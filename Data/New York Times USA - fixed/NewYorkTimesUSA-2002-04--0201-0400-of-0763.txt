HEADLINE: Saddam's Offensive 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Sixty Islamic terrorists, trained in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden, are holed up in the town of Biyara in northern Iraq, guests of Saddam Hussein. Their assignment is to infiltrate the no-flight zone and to kill the Kurdish leaders, who Saddam assumes will be allied with the U.S. in his overthrow.
 This is the same assignment that Al Qaeda performed for the Taliban last Sept. 9, when a terrorist suicide team murdered the most popular Afghan leader, Ahmed Massoud. That assassination was intended to weaken anti-Taliban forces if the U.S. responded to the Sept. 11 attacks by hitting Osama's base in Afghanistan. 
 Ten days ago, a suicide team of three terrorists was dispatched by Saddam's Qaeda affiliate into the Kurdish area of Iraq protected by the U.S. and British air forces. A Kurdish leader, Jalal Talabani (no kin to the Taliban), was meeting in Sulaimaniya with the U.S. diplomats Ryan Crocker and David Pearce. 
With that meeting guarded by scores of Kurdish pesh merga fighters, the terrorists targeted the home of Barham Salih, 41, the pro-Western regional prime minister. Their grenades and gunfire missed his appearance at his front door by 10 seconds. Five Kurdish guards were killed and two of the assassins died in the return fire. 
The third terrorist was wounded and caught. "I came to kill and be killed," he pleaded, but the pesh merga -- many of whose relatives were ambushed, captured and beheaded by Saddam's Islamic surrogates two months ago -- saved him for interrogation. He is the source of the intelligence about the 60 Qaeda terrorists in Biyara carrying out Saddam's assassination plans.
That intelligence seems of little interest to our C.I.A., which failed to inform members of the National Security Council of this incident until my query two days ago. Maybe it has no agents on the ground (though our diplomats were); maybe its director is distracted by his high-visibility diplomatic chores; maybe it is sulking because the journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The New Yorker went where no spook had gone before. 
Whatever the excuse, it's unlikely that one dollar of our $30 billion intelligence budget (which includes covert operations) has gone to provide one automatic rifle, one mortar, or one anti-tank rocket to the 70,000 Kurdish fighters who would make up our most dependable indigenous ally in any coalition to overthrow Saddam. 
President Bush constantly evokes Saddam's poison gas attack in 1988 on the Kurds in Halabja, killing many thousands of innocents, as evidence of the dictator's willingness to use weapons of mass destruction. Understandably, neither he nor Colin Powell wants to recall the elder Bush's blunder that allowed Saddam to keep his gunships and slaughter Kurds who trusted us to support their uprising after our Persian Gulf victory. 
Ever since that debacle, we have protected the Kurds and they are grateful for our air cover. As a result, they have built the only democratic government and rudimentary free-enterprise system in the Middle East since the birth of Israel. Contrast the Kurds' recent progress with that of Palestinians -- a people burdened with corrupt leaders, kept in squalid refugee camps for generations by Arab despots and fed a diet of hatred. 
Afflicted by tribal tensions at the start of their decade of freedom, the two Kurdish factions have come together. After Saddam's recent assassination attempt, the urbane Jalal (let's use his first name) was embraced by Massoud Barzani, as 100,000 Kurds marched through a heavy rain at the murdered guards' funeral. Kurds now dream of an autonomous region within a democratic Iraq, which would be acceptable to Turkey with its large Kurdish minority. 
If Bush is serious about overthrowing Saddam before that avatar of arrogance gets the power to obliterate Washington, he cannot count on a colonels' coup or a coat-holding coalition of craven caliphs. We have already had to begin abandoning our bases in Saudi Arabia. Joining us in liberating Iraq will be Brits, Turks and Kurds. 
The Kurds, though fierce fighters, cannot be provided with modern arms and trained to use them overnight. Saddam, allied with bin Ladenesque cadres, has begun his offensive -- diplomatic at the U.N., economic with oil-embargo threats, terrorist to his north. Time is short for our counterattack.

HEADLINE: A First Filing Makes Kirch Bankruptcy Official 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 8 

 BODY:
After weeks of teetering on the brink, the core companies of the Kirch Group media empire filed for bankruptcy protection in Germany today, paving the way for the banks that hold the bulk of Kirch's debt to reorganize its many activities.
 Representatives of Kirch's creditor banks said that KirchMedia, the unit that holds valuable broadcast rights to Hollywood films and World Cup soccer and stakes in German private television, had filed for protection. They also said a second unit, KirchPayTV, in which the Rupert Murdoch company British Sky Broadcasting holds a 22 percent stake, had also filed for protection. But executives at KirchPayTV denied this, and rumors circulated this evening that a last-minute move by an unnamed investor might make it possible for KirchPayTV to sidestep bankruptcy. 
 The creditor banks decided to push KirchMedia into bankruptcy today for a similar purpose, to open the way for outside investors to rescue some of the group's substantial assets. Germany has no direct equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, under which a company's managers continue to run it while it reorganizes; the filing today means that the court will appoint an administrator to take control.
Kirch Holding, the parent company, is struggling under $5.7 billion in debts, largely amassed in an aggressive push into pay television. It remained unclear this evening which other units of the Kirch group would file for bankruptcy.
Wolfgang Hartmann, a management board member of Commerzbank, speaking for the creditor group, said, "I'd like to emphasize that we will do everything to avoid a breakup" of Kirch. At a news conference in Munich, where Kirch is based, he called it the "biggest case of insolvency in Germany." The banks' goals, Mr. Hartmann said, were to save jobs, cut costs and debt and "avoid an erosion of assets."
Kirch is the third major bankruptcy to rattle Germany in recent weeks, after the Philipp Holzmann construction company and Fairchild Dornier, a builder of regional and business jets. And it could have significant political fallout, with jobs lost and doors opened to foreign investors in the formerly closed world of German television.
Ripples from Kirch's filing are expected to reach as far as Hollywood, where studios are owed about 500 million euros ($440 million), and through the sports world. Kirch paid 1.3 billion Swiss francs for the rights to the 2002 World Cup soccer championship. To shield them from creditors, those rights were transferred today to Kirch Sport A.G., a sibling company based in Zug, Switzerland.
For KirchMedia, whose main asset is a 52 percent stake in Germany's largest private television company, ProSiebenSat.1 Media, today's filing came after a consortium of banks and minority shareholders who were unwilling to throw more good money after bad failed to find a solution for saving the group. But the consortium -- including Commerzbank; the government-controlled Bayerische Landesbank; the HVB Group; and DZ Bank -- said it had agreed on a broad framework to keep some of Kirch's healthy businesses operating.
Among Kirch's other holdings are Kirch Beteiligung, which manages rights, and KirchPayTV, which includes the hugely unprofitable pay channel Premiere.
Wolfgang van Betteray, a lawyer for Kirch, said that KirchPay TV would probably also file for insolvency. But a spokesman for the unit said talks were continuing with minority shareholders "over ways of averting insolvency," and a spokesman for the bankruptcy court in Munich said the unit had not filed for protection today.
The outcome is crucial to Mr. Murdoch, because his British Sky Broadcasting holds an option to force Kirch to buy its shares back in October for $1.7 billion. Meeting that commitment would bankrupt Kirch, a turn of events that could play into Mr. Murdoch's plans by allowing him to cherry-pick assets, bankers in London and Frankfurt said.
British Sky Broadcasting has already written off the value of that option, suggesting that Mr. Murdoch is using it as a bargaining tool to get what he wants. Ultimately that could be ProSiebenSat.1 Media and, to a lesser extent, Premiere.
Mr. Hartmann said that the banks would have to come up with somewhat less than $1 billion in fresh money to keep Kirch going, but that they would seek to involve some of Kirch's minority shareholders, including both German and foreign investors.
The bank plan emerged after the failure of talks with Mr. Murdoch and another Kirch shareholder, the Mediaset group owned by the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.
Mediaset executives have said that they are interested in a role. Mr. Betteray, the Kirch lawyer, said that "the question whether Mediaset wants to be part of the new Kirch Media has to be asked by Mediaset itself, as by every investor."
Essentially, Kirch came down because it did not have the $3 billion it needed to make debt payments from now to October. At least eight banks have loans of more than $100 million outstanding to Kirch.
The solution sought by the banks involves selling unprofitable businesses, bringing in new investors, perhaps including the big German publishers WAZ Gruppe and Axel Springer, and an exchange of new stock for the debts the banks hold.
"It means an interruption," Mr. Hartmann said, "but from the point of view of the financing banks, not an end but a turning point."
Today's filing represents an end for Leo Kirch, 75, the entrepreneur who built the group with a keen eye for the value of media properties and strong help from conservative politicians like Helmut Kohl, the former chancellor, and Edmund Stoiber, the governor of Bavaria and the conservative standard-bearer in German elections in September.
Mr. Kirch began in 1959, borrowing money to buy the rights to "La Strada," Federico Fellini's film, and reselling them to TV stations. Over the years, Mr. Kirch, who is partly blind from diabetes, contributed heavily to the Christian Democratic party of Mr. Kohl and Mr. Stoiber. Critics have accused him of parlaying that aid into political favors when German television opened to private investment in the 1980's.
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, has sought to exploit Kirch's woes in his re-election campaign against Mr. Stoiber. At a news conference in Berlin today, Mr. Schroder said the decision by the Bayerische Landesbank, which is 50 percent owned by the Bavarian government, to pump money into Kirch amounted to "economic incompetence."
But Mr. Schroder also stands to suffer from Kirch's troubles if, as labor leaders predict, some 4,000 jobs are eliminated, hollowing the chancellor's pledges to reduce unemployment.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTING CANCER: SCIENTIST AT WORK -- PETER GOTZSCHE; 
A Career That Bristles With Against-the-Grain Conclusions

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: COPENHAGEN 

 BODY:
Seated at an eerily neat desk in a modern office on the grounds of Denmark's state hospital, Dr. Peter C. Gotzsche does not seem a man whose bite is much worse than his very gentle bark.
 But this tall, gray-haired statistician is sending some eminent doctors into fits of apoplexy as he quietly implies that they've wasted their lives defending old wives' tales, maltreated their patients or assisted in frauds that perhaps ought to land them in jail. 
 Most recently, he has made headlines for a study published in The Lancet in October concluding that the major studies of mammography do not show that mammograms can reduce death from breast cancer.
Earlier last year, in The New England Journal of Medicine, he purported to pop the old shibboleth known as the placebo effect. Many doctors who have for years repeated what they had learned in medical school -- that about 35 percent of patients improve if you give them only a sugar pill -- learned that Dr. Gotzsche felt they had fallen for a theory as grounded in hard evidence as the one that swamp gas causes malaria. 
In 1999, in The Journal of the American Medical Association, he argued that the research behind the Food and Drug Administration approval of fluconazole, an expensive and highly touted anti-fungal drug, was based on cooked books.
Before he was director of the Nordic Cochrane Center here and paid to make trouble like this, he was in private research. There, he asserted that a multinational drug company was deliberately overdosing AIDS patients with AZT because it was profitable to do so.
His critics say he is too harsh, rejecting important studies with small but acceptable data-collection flaws. 
Dr. Gotzsche replies that he does not go around looking for trouble, but it seems to come looking for him.
"We had no preconceptions about mammograms when we were asked by a government agency to look into this," he said in an interview in his blue and white office, where a thick stack of mammogram data fills drawer space. "It just wasn't one of my interests."
"Now I've received more than 2,000" -- he stops, and checks his computer -- "I've received 2,276 e-mails about this. It's incredible what we've unleashed."
Cancer researchers who still endorse mammograms have loudly attacked the work he did with his colleague Dr. Ole Olsen.
The seven landmark studies that back the use of mammograms for early cancer detection were begun between 1962 and 1982 in New York, Canada and Sweden. Dr. Gotzsche's specialty, meta-analysis, blends multiple study results. But he and Dr. Olsen found five too flawed to use; the remaining two showed no benefit.
Dr. Anthony B. Miller at the German Cancer Research Center said some of the five were precipitously thrown out because the authors couldn't or wouldn't answer all of Dr. Gotzsche's questions about their data.
Attacks on him have come from three groups, Dr. Gotzsche said: disinterested experts, oncologists who spent careers recommending mammograms, and those who earn money in the $1 billion screening industry.
The first group, he said, are "academic and reasonable," the rest have vested interests "and want to shoot the messenger."
Dr. Gotzsche was born 53 years ago in Naestved, near Copenhagen, where his mother taught mathematics and home economics.
Her father, a doctor, was his role model. "He was very bright," Dr. Gotzsche said. "I never succeeded in beating him in chess."
His own grandfather never once let him win?
"No," he answered, looking perplexed. "Fairness and honesty were important values in the family. I would have found it unfair if he lost to me on purpose."
His first job was a paper route, and he planned to be a doctor, too, "until I realized when I was 17 that many of my grandfather's patients really weren't ill."
They were affluent women," he said. "Seeing the doctor was a social event, so I decided it was a waste of time. I wanted to be a biologist and walk in rain forests."
Instead, as a biologist, he went to work doing clinical trials for Astra Pharmaceuticals. But, disillusioned by its glowing pitches for the arthritis drug he tested, he started medical school in 1978. By 1990, he had a medical degree and a doctorate. His thesis: "Bias in Double-Blind Trials."
"It was provocative," he said quietly. "In 1990, the pharmaceutical industry had a good image."
The thesis was read by Dr. Iain Chalmers, an Oxford professor who founded the Cochrane Collaboration, and invited Dr. Gotzsche to direct its Nordic branch.
The self-supporting collective, which has worldwide chapters in 50 medical specialties, was named for Archie Cochrane, author of a history of fatal flaws in medical practice, like the refusal by 19th century doctors to wash their hands between dissecting corpses and examining patients.
Its mission is to question medical tenets by analyzing all the trials of any treatment. It has, for example, compared 1,000 acupuncture studies and concluded there is no evidence it works, even for pain or smoking.
His placebo study, with Dr. Asbjorn Hrobjartsson, was done by hunting down trials that experts thought hardly existed: those with three patient groups, the treatment, a placebo and no treatment. They hoped to find a dozen, but by getting the United States National Library of Medicine to rewrite its software so "Treatment: none" could be searched, they found 130, in everything from herpes to nausea to schizophrenia. Over all, the untreated patients -- those still on the waiting list, for example -- got better at the same rate as those receiving placebos.
"We started the project believing there were important placebo effects," Dr. Gotzsche said. "But when we finished, there wasn't much left."
A small effect may exist in subjective symptoms, like pain, he conceded, but not in doctor-observable ones like swelling.
Dr. James M. Robins, a Harvard epidemiologist who follows Dr. Gotzsche's work, said he would probably have reached different conclusions. Dr. Gotzsche excluded acceptable mammogram studies and averaged pain studies in a way that made the placebo effect seem not to exist, rather than to exist in some studies for unknown reasons.
He called Dr. Gotzsche's harshness toward other people's randomized trial data "unscientific and even bizarre."
"He seems to have a very black-and-white mind," Dr. Robins said. "When he writes, he seems to be saying: 'You've done such terrible things against the pristine world of randomization that you're not going to be allowed in the covenant.' "
Aware of his critics, Dr. Gotzsche said he was "not cooking up difficulties or being nihilistic."
"There are many things in health care that, if you look at them closely, you are disappointed," he said.
His 1999 fluconazole study, done with Dr. Helle Krogh Johansen, his wife, attacked the research backing a drug that sells in the United States for $25 a pill for yeast infections and toenail fungus but also kills funguses that can be fatal to AIDS patients.
He found that studies by Pfizer, fluconazole's patent holder, compared oral doses to mixed results for amphotericin B and nystatin. But amphotericin B should be given intravenously and nystatin doesn't work at all, Dr. Gotzsche said, so the studies were, in effect, rigged.
In a later letter to the medical journal, Pfizer conceded that the comparison drugs did not work and that it would change how it reported results of trials. A Pfizer spokesman, Andrew McCormick, says the company stands by that response.
In 1987, Dr. Gotzsche said, he was the coordinator for all Nordic AIDS drug trials, and found that AZT was just as effective, with fewer side effects, at 400 milligrams as at 1,200 milligrams, the dose recommended by its maker, Burroughs Wellcome. The company, which sold it in 100-milligram pills, did not lower its recommendation, he said. 
Patricia R. Seif, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline, which now owns the Burroughs Wellcome company, said 1987 was "ancient history" but recalled that the company's recommended AZT dosage was reduced from 1,200 to 600 milligrams in mid-1990, based on studies sponsored by the National Institute of Allergic and Infectious Diseases between 1986 and 1989. About the price-gouging accusation, she said the company cut its price for AZT by 20 percent in 1987 and another 20 percent in 1989.
No one she could find recalled Dr. Gotzsche's Nordic study, she said.
Asked if he had ever confronted Burroughs Wellcome by holding a news conference or getting a forceful group like Act Up into the fray, Dr. Gotzsche said he had not, then added: "Perhaps we should have -- but that was not our style here in the Nordic countries."

HEADLINE: The Peril of Too Much Power 

BYLINE:  By Timothy Garton Ash; Timothy Garton Ash is director of the European Studies Centre at St. Antony's College, Oxford, and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
For most of the 20th century, the defining political question was: What do you think of Russia? At the beginning of the 21st century, it is: What do you think of America? Tell me your America and I'll tell you who you are.
 Sitting in sun-dried California, I have been trying to work out exactly what I think. Quite a few European writers caricature America as a dangerous, selfish giant, blundering around the world doing ill, and as an anthology of all that is wrong with capitalism -- in contrast to morally superior European versions. But of course America can't be reduced in this way. Apart from anything else, it is just too large, too diverse, too much a cornucopia of combinations and contradictions to allow any simple interpretation. Here in Stanford there is the post-Sept. 11 "United We Stand" poster on the Japanese-American sushi bar, but also the bookshop that declares itself a "hate-free zone," with a notice in the window deploring attacks on Arab-Americans. There's the gung-ho unilateralism of Fox TV, but also the patient multilateralism of elder statesmen interviewed on CNN. As Walt Whitman wrote: 
 Do I contradict myself? 
Very well then I contradict myself, 
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
So any simple generalization will be wrong. My own, more complicated conclusion is this: I love this country and I worry about its current role in the world. I use the word love loosely, of course, as we do in our increasingly Americanized English. I love the energy, the openness, the everyday cheerfulness of people in shops and on the street, the sense of freedom you get driving for hours down a California highway under those king-size skies, and the feeling that all people -- whoever they are, wherever they come from -- have a chance to shape their own lives. I love the accuracy of The New York Times, the vigor of television's "Crossfire," the probing tough-mindedness of the best universities in the world and the American activists I've frequently encountered in Eastern Europe and the Balkans who really do want other people to share the freedoms they enjoy.
Most people in the world will have some such list. For America is part of everyone's imaginative life, through movies, music, television and the Web, whether you grow up in Bilbao, Beijing or Bombay. Everyone has a New York in their heads, even if they have never been there -- which is why the destruction of the twin towers had such an impact. This fascination with American culture, in the broadest sense of that term, is part of what Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, calls America's "soft power."
So why I am worried about this wonderful country's current role in the world? Partly because until President Bush changed tack last week, I feared that if the United States were to attack Iraq without taking the lead in negotiating a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Islamic world would be united against the West while Europe would be divided from America, with disastrous consequences for years to come.
But my concern goes deeper than simply a worry about the Middle Eastern policy of a particular administration. The fundamental problem is that America today has too much power for anyone's good, including its own. It has that matchless, global soft power in all of our heads. In economic power its only rival is the European Union. In military power it has no rival. Its military expenditure is greater than that of the next eight largest military powers combined. Not since Rome has a single power enjoyed such superiority -- but the Roman colossus only bestrode one part of the world. Stripped of its anti-American overtones, the French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine's term "hyperpower" is apt.
Contrary to what many Europeans think, the problem with American power is not that it is American. The problem is simply the power. It would be dangerous even for an archangel to wield so much power. The writers of the American Constitution wisely determined that no single locus of power, however benign, should predominate; for even the best could be led into temptation. Every power should therefore be checked by at least one other. That also applies in world politics. 
Of course it helps that such power is exercised by leaders under the scrutiny of a developed and self-critical democracy. But even democracy brings its own temptations when it exists in a hyperpower. That temptation is illustrated by the Bush administration's recent imposition of unjustified tariffs on steel imports, threatening the international framework of free trade in order to win votes in steel-producing states.
And when a nation has so much power, what it doesn't do is as fateful as what it does. Thus, the Bush administration came into office determined not to get dragged into close mediation between Israelis and Palestinians, as former President Bill Clinton had been. The horrors of the suicide bombings of Israeli civilians and the siege of the West Bank are at least in part a result of this policy, which might be called partisan disengagement. Critical Europeans generally see the United States as misusing its power by intervening, as in the cases of American actions in Cambodia and Nicaragua. But as often, the problem is that the hyperpower does not intervene -- as we saw in the agony of Bosnia until the United States finally stepped in to stop the bloodshed.
Who, then, should check and complement American power? International agencies, starting with the United Nations, and transnational nongovernmental organizations are a place to start. But they alone are not enough. My answer is Europe -- Europe as an economic equal to the United States and Europe as a close-knit group of states with long diplomatic and military experience. The European Union is already a major force in trade and foreign aid, and it is slowly acquiring more diplomatic coherence. But the gulf between its military capacity and that of the United States grows ever wider.
The complicated double task for us pro-American Europeans is to strengthen Europe's capacity to act outside its own borders while disentangling the idea of a stronger Europe from its sticky anti-American integument. We need to build a Europe that sees itself not as a rival superpower to the United States, but as America's most important partner in a world community of liberal democracies. Americans, in their own enlightened self-interest, should want Europe to succeed. Otherwise they will be left to cope alone with the loneliness of the long-distance hyperpower.

Market Shakes Off I.B.M. Warning; Nasdaq Rises 15.84

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks rose yesterday, even as I.B.M. startled the market with its first earnings warning in years.
 I.B.M., the world's largest computer products and services company, said spending cutbacks by corporate customers would cut into its earnings and revenue. The news added to jitters caused by rising oil prices after Iraq said it would withhold oil exports for a month to protest Israel's attacks on the West Bank. 
 But by midsession, the market began to move off its lows as investors digested the I.B.M. news and snapped up downtrodden technology issues. 
"A lot of the technology names like software stocks and semiconductors have already reported, already preannounced or are expected to have decent numbers," said Jon Baranko, director of trading at Strong Capital Management, "so I think people used the weakness of the market as an opportunity."
I.B.M. shares slumped 10 percent, keeping the Dow Jones industrial average in the red. The Dow fell 22.56 points, or 0.22 percent, to 10,249.08.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.56 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 1,125.29.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 15.84 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,785.87, after being down early in the session more than 2 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered those declining on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,836 to 1,331. Volume eased to 1.10 billion shares from 1.12 billion on Friday.
I.B.M. tumbled $9.84, to $87.41, on trading of more than 40 million shares, the most active stock on the Big Board.
"We all knew coming into the first quarter that, especially in technology, the business environment was still weak," said Benjamin Pace, managing director at Deutsche Bank Private Banking, which oversees about $9 billion in investments.
Earnings season moves into high gear next week, and according to Thomson Financial/First Call, corporate profits are expected to fall 9.2 percent from the quarter a year earlier. That is sharper than the 8.8 percent decline forecast on March 28, after a wave of technology companies warned that they would fall short of analysts' estimates.
Among technology stocks yesterday, Electronic Data Systems, the No. 2 supplier of computer services, dropped $1.74, to $51.11. Sun Microsystems, the big networking computer maker, fell 21 cents, to $8.50. But Microsoft recouped declines, closing up $1.35, at $57.22, and Veritas Software rose $1.51, to $36.62.
Oil stocks helped the market move higher as they tracked crude oil prices, which soared at first on the Iraq news and then eased in New York, settling at $26.54 a barrel, up 33 cents. Exxon Mobil, the global oil giant, rose 61 cents, to $43.24, offering support to the Dow industrials. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Treasuries moved lower yesterday after Iraq said it would suspend oil shipments to protest Israeli military action in the Palestinian territories, sending crude oil prices higher and briefly stirring inflation concern.
"We might see some higher inflation," said Tom Donne, who manages about $3 billion in bonds at Banc One Investment Advisers. "Nobody will want the added risk of a longer-dated Treasury in their hands."
Late in the day, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 13/32 , to a price of 97 3/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.26 percent from 5.20 percent on Friday. The 30-year Treasury bond dropped 20/32 , to 95 9/32 . Its yield rose to 5.71 percent from 5.66 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: So Much for Doctors' Bad Handwriting on Drug Prescriptions 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
An Internet-based system being introduced today will allow doctors to send prescriptions directly to a pharmacy's computer from a hand-held or desk-top computer, wireless telephone or text pager. 
 Using the system, being offered by the Giant supermarket and pharmacy chain and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, pharmacists can send back information over a two-way network about potentially harmful drug reactions as well as a patient's insurance coverage. 
 Tommy G. Thompson, the health and human services secretary, said that electronic prescriptions, or e-scripts, would help to prevent errors and save time. "Physicians and pharmacists will have more time with patients and more time to focus on health," he said yesterday. 
Giant Food Inc., a unit of Royal Ahold, a supermarket holding company based in the Netherlands, said it was testing the new system at six pharmacies and planned to install it next month in 154 pharmacies. Giant is based in Landover, Md.
The system was developed by physicians at InstantDx, a software company in Gaithersburg, Md. It will be available to 30,000 doctors who use the physicians' office software of the NDCHealth Corporation in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and Washington.
Doctors will pay a monthly subscription fee of about $30 for the services, and pharmacies will pay a transaction fee, said a spokeswoman for the drugstore association, which represents chains with 100,000 stores.
Technology analysts said the new system was the latest foray on a hotly contested health care battleground. "There are billions of dollars in drug sales in play," said Michael J. Barrett, a health care analyst at Forrester Research. The object is to influence doctors' decision at the moment they order a drug for a patient, he said, through advertisements on the Internet ordering system or references to health plan lists of preferred drugs.
Health insurance plans, pharmacy benefit management companies and drug manufacturers are all hoping to gain control of the drug-ordering process, Mr. Barrett said. Companies like NDCHealth and WebMD have a head start, he said, because each has longstanding electronic connections to hundreds of thousands of doctors. 
An estimated 200,000 of the nation's 600,000 doctors write most of the prescriptions, said Craig Fuller, president of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.
The association's system is intended to preserve the current role of pharmacists in matching patients with drugs covered by their health plans. The stores view the pharmacy management companies as commercial enemies who often try to persuade patients to fill prescriptions by mail, said Crystal Wright, a spokeswoman for the association. 
A similar electronic system being developed by ProxyMed Inc., based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., connects some pharmacies of the Walgreen and Eckerd chains in Southern states to a few hundred doctors. 
RxHub, another project that hopes to link doctors and pharmacies, is sponsored by pharmacy benefit managers, including Merck-Medco, Express Scripts and AdvancePCS.

Fashion Designers' Ceremony Shrinks
On June 3, the Council of Fashion Designers of America will present its 40th annual awards ceremony, in miniature. Yesterday afternoon, the names of the nominees were announced. 
 Marc Jacobs is a contender in the top three categories: women's-wear designer of the year, men's wear and accessories. Ralph Lauren was also named in the men's and women's categories. For the title of best men's-wear designer, the two men will be facing off against Sean Combs. 
 The list of nominees for the Perry Ellis award, which confers status on a new young fashion talent, seems to include every young designer who has applied needle to thread this year: Rick Owens, Zac Posen, Behnaz Sarafpour and Peter Som.
Only 450 tickets will be issued this year, in contrast to the usual 2,000. The event, which in recent years has been held at Lincoln Center, will move to the Celeste Bartos Forum at the New York Public Library.
"It's a nod to the mood of the country," Stan Herman, the president of the organization, explained. "Every winner had their PR people, their licensing people, their friends and relatives," Mr. Herman said. "And there were freebies going to some of the big names." 
This year, most guests will be paying, $1,750 a ticket, a $250 increase over last year. Peter Arnold, the group's executive director, said the shaky economy had a lot to do with the downsizing of the ceremony. Also, he said, "a lot of members had stopped coming because they felt the event was no longer about them."
The $1,750 ticket buys a fashion lover a sit-down dinner and the opportunity to mingle with nominees. Left out of the party will be fashion students, who often get to attend at the largesse of big companies, which buy up tables at a discount. Fewer press passes will be issued as well. But, Mr. Arnold said, the contraction "isn't meant to exclude any one group or sector."

A Black Model Advances
For a young model occupying any of the various precincts of fashion obscurity, the imprimatur of Steven Meisel almost always means a glamorous reversal of fortune. A few years ago, Sophie Dahl danced in front of him at a party, and before long she was gracing the covers of Italian Vogue and cuddling waterfowl in advertising campaigns for Banana Republic.
More recently, Mr. Meisel has turned his eye to Valery Prince, an 18-year-old from Dallas whom he shot for the May issue of Vogue. Ms. Prince took her book to Mr. Meisel in February, just after the fall 2002 collections in New York, where she had walked for Bill Blass, among a handful of other designers.
"I went to see if he wanted to work with me in the future," Ms. Prince said the other day, "and he said, 'How would you like to work today?' " By the time the European collections got under way a few weeks later, she was appearing in shows for Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior and Lanvin, among others, her first foray onto the runways of Milan and Paris.
Significantly, Ms. Prince is African-American. "Since Alek Wek, there's been no one," Andre Leon Talley, the Vogue editor, noted, referring to the dearth of black-skinned models who have appeared since Ms. Wek's arrival six years ago. "Black girls don't have the same opportunities," Mr. Talley said. "They have to work 15 times as hard to get a cover try." As recently as two years ago, he said, he would find himself suggesting black models to designers, who would make excuses, saying that the model would not be appropriate for the mood of a particular collection. "And I'd say, 'All those Belgian girls seem to fit,' " he said. African-Americans, he added, "are an afterthought in fashion." 
Ms. Prince, the daughter of a minister and a homemaker, will appear in the June issue of Vogue in a shoot by Steven Klein. She has signed up for a correspondence course at Spelman College in Atlanta, beginning in fall 2003. "You have more urban magazines now, and you are starting to see more black models," Ms. Prince said. "I just got some good news today: my little sister entered a modeling contest and won."
Mr. Talley predicts that African-American models will now get more work. "With the Halle Berry moment and Valery, the gates are going to be open next season."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: U.S. JEWS; 
Mideast Violence Rouses a Jewish Population With Deep American Roots

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., April 5 

 BODY:
The Jewish population here may no longer be the largest in the nation, as it was three centuries ago when South Carolina was the most religiously tolerant colony in the New World. But just as Jews have long been politically active here, the heirs of those early settlers are keenly following events in the Middle East, no more afraid than their forebears to raise their voices.
 Many Jews here have expressed disappointment with the Bush administration's demand that Israel end its raids into the West Bank. 
 At the same time, other Jewish leaders, many of whom did not support George W. Bush for president, agree with his peacemaking efforts. American Jews can disagree with Israeli policies just as vigorously as Israelis often do, they say, without undermining their support for Israel. 
"I am an American whose religion is Jewish," said Rick Silver, an advertising executive here and former president of the local Jewish Federation. "But I have no trouble disagreeing with American policy on this or any subject -- that's the American value. And in this case, considering that our country is trying to clear out terrorism from its hellhole in Afghanistan, I don't see why there should be a problem when Israel tries to do the same."
Several local Jewish residents agreed with Dr. Stanley Greenberg, a urologist who is the current federation president, that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, "is not an easy person to love," and that his agenda may not sit well with generally liberal Jewish sensibilities. 
But uneasiness about Mr. Sharon's policies and worries about his long-term goals do not imply a lessening of Jewish support for Israel in this struggle, he said. "There's no honesty or sincerity in the Palestinian leadership," Dr. Greenberg said. "They haven't really accepted a two-state solution -- they want to insidiously destroy Israel as we know it."
It was in the port cities and merchant towns of South Carolina that American Jews first announced they wanted their adopted country to regard them as Americans, not as a separate and insoluble clan.
"Jews are by no means to be considered as a religious sect, tolerated by the government; they constitute a portion of the people," wrote Isaac Harby, one of the state's leading Jewish citizens and a pioneer of Reform Judaism, to Secretary of State James Monroe in 1816. "Quakers and Catholics, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Baptists and Jews, all constitute one great political family."
That declaration -- the subject of a popular new exhibit here on the state's Jewish history -- is being heard once again among the leading Jews of South Carolina's capital. Many among this city's 3,000 Jews arise early each morning to read the Israeli and Arab newspaper Web sites, write letters and make calls to political leaders. They consider today's foreign news to be essentially local.
Samuel Tenenbaum, a retired steel executive who has long been active in the national Democratic Party, said he recently wrote President Bush to congratulate him on his foreign policy and to support his fight against terrorism in Israel and elsewhere.
"The terrorism we see now is a war against the Jews, just as World War II was," Mr. Tenenbaum said. "If you look at what Hamas says, they're talking about a struggle against the Jews, not just Israelis. So this becomes an existential argument -- my country needs to protect me and other Jews against a war of genocide."
Jewish leaders here say they are aware that some Americans blame the nation's ties to Israel for the attacks on Sept. 11. But Jewish residents here say they are too well established in the area to fear a significant increase in anti-Semitism in response to current events.
"I think from the relationships that we have established here that we feel genuine affection from our neighbors," said Eleanor Niestat, a volunteer whose family has long been active in the area. "It's gone beyond just tolerance." 
Others said that only a nationwide economic depression had the potential to trigger a surge in anti-Semitism, expressing a confidence -- borne out in public opinion polls -- that most Americans blame the Palestinians for the current violence.
That feeling of ease has not always been present. Alan B. Kahn, a local real estate developer, said that many Columbia Jews did not want to speak up about their religion or become civil rights advocates in the 1960's and '70s, fearing they would become entangled in the strong emotions of the period.
As the exhibit at the McKissick Museum of the University of South Carolina indicates, Jews and other white-skinned immigrants were welcomed to the colony to a unusual degree.
The exhibit, titled "A Portion of the People: 300 Years of Southern Jewish Life," shows that South Carolina was the first colony in the nation to grant voting rights to Jews, and they were welcomed as traders and merchants. The nation's first Jewish elected official was Francis Salvador, a member of the First Provincial Congress of South Carolina, and Jews have since been prominent in the state's political and business life. Some were also slaveowners and staunch Confederates, according to the show.
In a state now better known for an active population of conservative Christians, Jews here continue to worry more about intermarriage and a loss of tradition than about religious discrimination.
Regarding Middle East politics, many say they take comfort in the knowledge that most of their evangelical neighbors are fervent supporters of Israel. That support, many Jewish residents say, was only enhanced here and around the nation by the attacks of Sept. 11, and they say they do not believe it will recede, even if the administration needs Arab support for an attack on Iraq.
Nonetheless, with world opinion at stake, Jews say they will not be vocal in their criticism of Mr. Sharon's moves, even as many wonder whether he has a long-term strategy for peace.
"If all of us see Israel as truly threatened, which I think most of us believe to be true now, then that kind of debate stops," Mr. Tenenbaum said. "Israel's survival is paramount, and as hard as it is, a lot of us will hold our tongues even at things we disagree with."

Eulogies? No, the Smart Money's Still on a 'Kid' of 69

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
ALL alone, and temporarily unemployed, Louis Rukeyser, the deposed host of "Wall Street Week," the money-as-mantra PBS chat-fest that pioneered its genre in 1970, is rattling around his palatial Georgian colonial waiting for the phone to ring.
 The news could be bad: his wife of 40 years, Alexandra, is an ocean away on the Isle of Man tending to a gravely ill parent. Or the news could be good: any minute his lawyers could call to confirm that a new home has been found for his program. In investing, as in life, Mr. Rukeyser insists, "pessimism is the losing strategy." He's raring to return. 
 "It's just down to a few details, and I'm thinking we could be back on the air by the end of the month," he says, sinking into a wing chair in a formal parlor where some dozen chairs and settees hold needlepoint pillows depicting Cavalier King Charles spaniels, his favorite breed. (He once had six spaniels scampering through the house; now he just has the pillows.) Mr. Rukeyser likens the Maryland Public Television executives who canned him to feline ingrates, calling their tactics "low-grade farce."
On a more pleasant farcical note, he judges the tail-wagging contest at the local dog show. "It requires the judgment of Solomon and the diplomacy of Colin Powell," he says, confident he possesses both, along with a no-nonsense knack for spotting economic trends and sizing up stocks. 
"If you say the word 'economics' to the average person, it's pretty true that their eyelids get heavy, but if you say 'money,' their eyes open up and their nostrils flare. I never regarded money as the focus of life; I have never in my life made a career decision for financial reasons," he says. "I learned the best way to keep money in perspective is to gain a knowledge of how to handle it."
That's why his newsletters are hot sellers, as are his two yearly cruises and his annual investment conference in Las Vegas. He says endless speaking engagements and canny investing (he takes his own advice and has yet to lose his shirt), not public television, bought this mansion on four acres, the pair of Mercedes-Benzes in the garage, the swell vintages in the wine cellar. "It won't be necessary to hold any benefits for me," he says. "Many people have prematurely eulogized me: I'm still a kid, and I've got lots more to do." 
It's his feelings, not his finances or future, that took a beating last month when the brass at Maryland Public Television informed him that their idea of reinventing the show he invented 32 years ago was to remove him as host and insert a team from Fortune magazine when his contract expires in June. When he let his viewers in on the plan on March 22, MPT locked the studio door behind him a tad early. Litigation is in the air. So are sour grapes: Mr. Rukeyser chuckles ruthlessly while noting that his 22 regular panelists snubbed MPT's attempt to enlist their expertise on a Lou-less show.
Still, there are bags beneath his "baby blues," and his posture, in lapsed moments, is stooped inside his fancy Brioni suit -- the Fashion Foundation of America calls Mr. Rukeyser, an off-the-rack Barneys shopper, the best-dressed man in finance. Then there's the antique hairdo. When his hair was darker and longer, male viewers often critiqued it. His reply: "Thank you for trying to approve my appearance, but I do not have my hair cut to please other men."
HE can't decide whether to be indignant or amused that, in the stressed weeks since he broadcast his final program, his craggy 69-year-old face is sprouting blemishes of a sort last glimpsed, and battled, as a teenager. How dare the Maryland executives imply that his demeanor and demographics are over the hill: he's got letters from fans in their 20's and 30's "furious with the notion that they're callow idiots who need MTV to show them how to invest." 
His father, the syndicated columnist Merryle Stanley Rukeyser, was a "boy wonder" of financial journalism, and by 11, with an assignment from The Standard Star in New Rochelle, N.Y., Mr. Rukeyser was following in dad's footsteps. He got his first paycheck at 16, was president of the Princeton Press Club, and joined The Baltimore Sun, as a political and later a foreign correspondent in London and Asia, after graduation in 1954. His starting salary was $55 a week. In 1965 he left The Sun for an overseas assignment at ABC News and in 1968 became that network's first national economic commentator. 
"The smart guys said it was a stupid career move, a dead end," Mr. Rukeyser recalls.
In 1970, he began, with ABC's permission, a 30-week moonlighting stint for PBS as host of "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser." Three years later he left ABC and concentrated on marketing himself. It worked then. He can't imagine it won't work now.
When the show marked its 30th anniversary with a Carnegie Hall gala in November 2000 and PBS executives didn't attend, he celebrated without them. "A reporter said, 'Lou, you've given birth to an entire industry,' " he recalls, eager to charm despite keeping one ear tuned to the upstairs phone, "And I said, 'Heck, I don't even have stretch marks.' "

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: IMMIGRATION; 
I.N.S. Proposes New Limits On the Length Of Visas

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8 

 BODY:
Under intense pressure to regroup after embarrassing lapses involving the Sept. 11 hijackers, the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced several steps today to gain greater control over tourists and visiting students and businessmen.
 The proposed measures would reduce the amount of time granted to most foreign tourists, to 30 days from six months; limit most business travelers to a maximum of six months; and penalize illegal visitors who ignore the agency's orders to turn themselves in within 30 days. 
 Most changes are subject to public review, but one new rule that takes effect immediately makes it more difficult for business travelers or tourists to switch their visa status by enrolling in American schools. 
The student visa system is rife with abuse, Bush administration officials acknowledge. In a breakdown of procedure, the immigration service last month issued notices of student visas to two dead Sept. 11 hijackers. The two men, Mohammed Atta of Egypt and Marwan al-Shehhi of the United Arab Emirates, entered the country as tourists, then began their training at a Florida flight school as they awaited the issuance of their student visas.
James W. Ziglar, the commissioner of immigration and naturalization, said the new rules struck "the appropriate balance between I.N.S.'s mission to ensure that our nation's immigration laws are followed and stop illegal immigration and our desire to welcome legitimate visitors."
Business groups reviewed the proposed changes tonight. Theresa Brown, a spokeswoman for the United States Chamber of Commerce, expressed the hope that they would not cripple tourism and trade.
"Allowing people to come in for business and tourism is a big chunk of our economy," Ms. Brown said.
If the agency "raises the bar, where it's an impediment, we'll have an issue," she said.
Ms. Brown warned that tighter rules could add to the backlog of the immigration service as visitors seek visa extensions. In most cases, applicants would have a chance to make their cases for longer stays.
Effective immediately, individuals planning to study in the United States will be able to receive student status only if they notify the agency of that prospect before entering the country. The change is intended to give federal authorities time to conduct security checks, officials said.
Other changes in the handling of visas include the following plans:
*An illegal immigrant who has been ordered to surrender as part of the deportation process must do so within 30 days or give up the opportunity to legalize his status for 10 years. Nine of every 10 illegal immigrants facing final deportation orders fail to turn themselves in, the agency said.
*Most tourist visas would be good for 30 days, down from six months.
*Business visitors or tourists may extend their stays for up to six months if they can show "unexpected or compelling humanitarian reason," like medical treatment or an impending business deal.

HEADLINE: The Third Oil Crisis? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In 1973 an Arab embargo sent oil prices soaring, and a global recession followed. In 1979 the Iranian revolution provoked a second surge in oil prices, and another global recession.
 Are we now at risk of a third oil crisis? I wish I could say no, but I can't. 
 Oil prices have risen about $10 per barrel since the situation in the Middle East began deteriorating. So even if they stay where they are, this represents a serious shock to the system -- and there could be more to come. 
True, political analysts assure us that despite Iraq's decision to stop oil exports for a month, no broader, 1973-style oil embargo is likely. Let's hope they're right. But the 1979 oil crisis wasn't the result of a deliberate embargo.
Economists have never reached a consensus about what happened in 1979, but my interpretation is that it was similar to the recent California electricity crisis. In both cases the key was the combination of a tight market and demand that wasn't very responsive to price. Under those circumstances, individual producers -- power companies in California, oil-producing countries in 1979 -- have a lot of market power. That is, it is in each producer's interest to cut back production to drive prices higher. The result is a price surge, even though there is no real capacity shortage. 
Are world oil markets that tight? Not yet -- the world still has about seven million barrels' worth of spare capacity each day. So Iraq, by taking away its two million barrels a day, cannot create a crisis by itself. But the remaining slack in the system is just about equal to the combined production of Iran and Libya, which have also proposed an embargo.
The point is that it would not take much worsening in the political situation to produce markets so tight that the logic of market power kicks in and countries decide that, quite aside from politics, their financial interest lies in reducing, not increasing, their output.
If an oil crisis can happen so easily, why haven't we had one since 1979? The answer is that we made ourselves crisis-proof for a while, then became complacent. After the oil crises of the 1970's, Western economies sharply increased their energy efficiency: the U.S. economy was a third bigger in 1985 than it was in 1973, but it consumed less oil. The result was the marginalization of the danger zone: in 1985, the Persian Gulf produced only 18 percent of the world's oil, less than half of its share in 1973. But rapidly growing oil consumption in the S.U.V. era was met, inevitably, by increased Persian Gulf production. So oil prices are once again hostage to Middle Eastern politics.
If oil prices do surge, will this have the same disastrous effects as the price spike in 1979? No, but it may have different disastrous effects.
In 1979 the clear and present danger from soaring oil prices was that they would send already inflation-prone Western economies into an out-of-control inflationary spiral. To fight that, all the leading economies raised interest rates -- which controlled inflation, but also generated a nasty recession.
Today, after a decade of price stability, fears of inflation are much more muted. Instead, the main concern is the drag of oil prices on purchasing power. Each $10-per-barrel increase in the price of oil is like a $70 billion tax increase, one that falls most heavily on middle- and lower-income families. 
And this is not a good time to slash purchasing power. Business investment, which plunged last year, has still not recovered; optimistic economic forecasts depend on the assumption that buoyant consumer spending will keep the economy afloat until businesses do decide to invest again. If consumers are made poorer by higher oil prices and cut back instead, that assumption goes out the window. And the Fed can't respond with another big round of interest rate cuts: since it has already reduced rates from 6.5 to 1.75 percent, it doesn't have much ammunition left.
So I'm sorry to say that under current conditions, a third oil crisis could indeed happen. It doesn't have to happen: a diplomatic breakthrough could calm oil markets, and even if oil prices rise, the U.S. economy may be more robust than I fear. But it's easier to tell a downbeat, even scary, story than any of us would like.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Tigers Dismiss Garner And Smith

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Detroit Tigers, continuing to move in reverse after squandering the economic advantage of a new park, fired their general manager and manager yesterday. Losses in the team's first six games hastened what had appeared to be an inevitable development.
 Randy Smith, the general manager, and Phil Garner, the manager, were most likely in jeopardy as soon as Dave Dombrowski became the Tigers' president and chief executive last November. 
 "We haven't started off well, but it's not the only thing," Dombrowski said by telephone from Detroit. "We've been evaluating the team. I thought if we were going to proceed to the championship level we'd have to make some changes. There's never a good time to do this, but it was just time to make the change." 
Smith, 38, was in his seventh season as the Tigers' general manager. In three of his first six seasons, they had a worse record than the year before. They never had a winning record, and in four seasons they did not reach 70 victories.
Garner, 52, became the Tigers' manager in October 1999, not long after he was dismissed as the Milwaukee Brewers' manager after seven successive losing seasons. 
The Tigers were so eager to hire Garner that they offered him $1.2 million a year for four years. They hired Garner before they informed the outgoing manager, Larry Parrish, that he was being fired, and they hired him without following Commissioner Bud Selig's directive to interview members of minority groups for major vacancies. With his two losing seasons in Detroit, Garner had nine straight losing records. Only Connie Mack, who owned the Philadelphia Athletics and managed them, had that long a losing streak.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Garner's dismissal after six games matches the earliest firing during a season. The Orioles fired Cal Ripken Sr. after Baltimore lost its first six games in 1988. If that precedent serves as an omen, though, the Tigers are in for more trouble. Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, and the Orioles ran their losing streak to 21 before gaining their first victory. 
Dombrowski named Luis Pujols, the team's bench coach, as the interim manager.
"He will be one of the people we interview," Dombrowski said, discussing his plans to hire a manager. "We would like to start the interview process as quickly as possible."
Felipe Alou, who was a manager in the Montreal minor league system when Dombrowski worked for the Expos, was one of the first possibilities mentioned, but he does not appear to be on Dombrowski's list of candidates.
Dombrowski said he had the utmost respect for Alou but added, "Whoever we hire I would hope would be our manager for the next 10 years." Alou will be 67 next month.
Michael Ilitch, the Tigers' owner, hired Dombrowski last Nov. 5 to replace John McHale Jr., who had moved to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays last season at Selig's request to clean up a mushrooming mess. Dombrowski, 45, had been president and general manager of the Florida Marlins. He will assume the general manager's duties with the Tigers.
Smith was general manager of the San Diego Padres for three seasons before taking the Tigers' job.
Smith failed to build the Tigers into a competitive, let alone contending, team. They moved into Comerica Park in 2000 and drew 2.5 million fans, their second-highest total. But last season the attendance plunged with the victory total, falling to 1.9 million. 
Many of Smith's trades did not work out. The one he will probably be remembered for most notoriously was the deal that sent Luis Gonzalez to Arizona for Karim Garcia in December 1998. Gonzalez batted .325, hit 57 home runs and drove in 142 runs for the Diamondbacks last year. He also got the hit that beat the Yankees in Game 7 of the World Series.
Garcia played in 20 games for the Cleveland Indians last season.
Smith and Garner are not the first general manager-manager tandem to be fired this year. The new owners of the Boston Red Sox dismissed Dan Duquette and Joe Kerrigan in spring training.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD; 
Taming the Unruly Business Fare

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The On the Road column appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LIKE many business travelers these days, I am quite pleased with my resourcefulness. Planning a business trip to San Francisco, I went online the other day, certain that I would find an impressively cheap fare. 
 I clicked onto Orbitz.com. On a typical business trip, one booked on a few days' notice, my round-trip coach fare between Newark and San Francisco would cost about $2,500. But my trip was more than two weeks away, meaning that I could book a cheaper advance-purchase fare. Orbitz quickly yielded 250 separate fares in that category, from $302 to $1,369, most requiring stopovers. But Continental Airlines had a selection of nonstops that fit my itinerary -- all at $309. 
 So I went to Continental's Web site and, bada-bing, as they say in Jersey, I booked that $309 fare -- aware that I would also probably be upgraded to first class to boot because I flew over 25,000 miles with Continental last year.
Total time spent online, researching and booking the trip: 10 minutes.
Such small acts, repeated tens of thousands times a day by business travelers, are striking fear into the heart of the airline industry, which operates on an economic model that depends on business travelers not flying across the country and back for $309. 
That we are now doing so, and frequently, is partly attributable to the wealth of instant, comprehensive price information available on Internet booking sites like Orbitz.com, Expedia.com, Travelocity.com and others, including company-operated intranet portals.
But it's also much attributable to a rebellion that has now become an insurrection among business travelers and the companies that pay their way. Their target: airline fare structures that everyone concedes are intended to squeeze top dollar out of business travelers, while indirectly subsidizing leisure travel.
Right now, corporate travel managers are at the table, negotiating new airline deals with the ferocity of the old coal miners' union. Firmly, the airlines are being told to reform their business-fare structures or else. 
They have two options, according to Kevin P. Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, a trade group that represents major corporate buyers of air travel.
"There's Plan A, which is a fundamental reform of the existing fare system" in which companies now commit themselves to airline contracts that offer volume discounts on a big range of fares that airlines can raise at will, he said. 
"And then there's Plan B," he added. Plan B is the "or else." Under this option, companies would expand their relatively new relationships with travel-management companies and distributors who manage internal online booking portals. Existing airline contracts would disappear or greatly diminish in scope, and employees would book far more travel through the company portal, with access to a wide range of fares and conditions, including all discount fares. 
It's a tough choice for the airline business, where most executives remember the financial beating the whole industry took in 1992 when American Airlines, responding to corporate demands, tried to simplify business fares and competitors jumped into the fray with a discounting free-for-all that left everyone bruised.
To allay those concerns, under Plan A corporations would enter new "ironclad agreements" with selected airlines to thwart competitive sabotage, Mr. Mitchell said.
He said that airlines needed to accept the fact that the plunge in business-travel revenue, which began more than a year ago, was not just a reversible consequence of a flagging economy. Rather, he said, it is partly a manifestation of a revolutionary shift in the way business travelers fly, especially the trend toward booking more trips well in advance and taking advantage of cheap fares.
Airline executives have begun to acknowledge the revolt over business fares. Airlines fare structures are "confusing, unfair and broken," and corporate customers are "showing signs of fatigue" with airline business-fare pricing by buying cheaper nonrefundable fares, Rono Dutta, the president of United Airlines, conceded to travel managers in late March at a corporate conference sponsored by Business Travel News, a trade publication.
American Express, which monitors average business fares, said that business travelers scooped up cheap nonrefundable fares from among the leisure-fare discounts that flooded the market after Sept. 11. As a result, American Express said, the average business fare paid in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 6 percent lower than the average in the comparable period of 2000, even though the average posted business fare itself was 1 percent higher. 
"The current system is unworkable," said Peter Buchheit, the director of travel and meeting services for the Black & Decker Corporation. 
Mr. Buchheit said that he had been amazed at the growth in employee use of nonrefundable fares, many purchased on the company's internal Web booking portal, managed by GetThere Inc. In 2000, when the trend acquired traction, cheaper nonrefundable fares accounted for 65 percent of all air tickets, he said. Last year, it was 77 percent. "And so far this year, it's 82 percent," he added.
Mr. Buchheit said he envisioned a system in which some airline flat-fare contracts would remain in place, greatly augmented by a company-managed online booking portal that would enable employees with flexible itinerary demands to choose from among a far greater range of fares and conditions than currently available.
Already, because of those capabilities, he said, "there is no more leisure fare versus business fare -- there's just a fare."
He added: "It's not like we want to squeeze every last penny out of the airlines. We want them to make a reasonable profit. We need a viable airline system. But we don't want to continue subsidizing leisure fares, which we've been doing for years."

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Try Giving Legislators A New Job

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
A NEW YORK mayor wants control of the schools; a few state legislators don't want to give it to him. This is a familiar scenario, and until now it has ended badly for the mayors and the city. When you have a seat for life, as state legislators typically do, you don't need to compromise with a mayor no matter how much bipartisan support he has within the city.
 But maybe this time Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg could improve his chances with a tactic suggested by one of his predecessors, Edward I. Koch. Mr. Koch's idea is simply to get rid of the legislators, or at least threaten them with the prospect of unemployment. 
 "I think you could scare the hell out of them," Mr. Koch said. "The mayor could create a committee of prominent Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals and independents. If a legislator refused to support legislation giving the mayor control of the schools, the committee would promise to support an opponent to that legislator in the next election. I'd be glad to be on the committee."
Children may not benefit when authority for schools is diffused among members of the central school board and community boards, but legislators appreciate the system because it provides them with patronage opportunities and maintains the power of the teachers' union. Aside from dying or being indicted, displeasing the teachers' union is considered about the only way for a legislator in Albany to be unseated. 
Other cities have been trying to make schools more accountable by putting the mayor in charge, as in Chicago, or giving parents vouchers, as in Milwaukee and Cleveland. In New York, though, such ideas have long been dismissed as the fantasies of political naifs. When New York journalists write about a successful reform in other cities, they ritualistically include a paragraph explaining why it could never happen here. 
The explanation usually involves two Democrats from Manhattan: Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly, and Steven Sanders, the chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. Mr. Sanders reiterated his determination yesterday to retain some form of the Board of Education, which Mr. Bloomberg would like to abolish so that he could run the schools directly, the way the Police Department is run. 
"What the mayor has proposed would eliminate public debate over education," Mr. Sanders said. "We need to have a Board of Education. We shouldn't allow two or three people in City Hall to make decisions without any public debate."
But even if a mayor ran the schools without an advisory board, he would face plenty of public debate, just as he already faces public debate over the performance of the police. Members of City Council would hardly be silent, and voters would make the mayor's handling of schools one of the major issues in any election. 
AS it is, the one place where education policy is made behind closed doors by two or three people is the State Capitol, where nothing even gets to the floor of the Senate or the House without the approval of the leaders. The fate of New York schools is determined by a few men who don't suffer any obvious consequences for their decisions.
Mr. Silver and Mr. Sanders don't suffer personal consequences, since they have no children in the city's public schools. (Mr. Silver chose private schools for his children; Mr. Sanders has no children.) Nor do they suffer political consequences at election time, since Democratic legislators in New York City can expect at most token opposition. Even a wildly unpopular move with city voters doesn't seem to matter, as Mr. Silver demonstrated by being re-elected even after siding with suburbanites against his own constituents in voting to eliminate the commuter tax.
As mayor, Mr. Koch tried to change this calculus when legislators were about to order an increase in pension benefits for city employees, thereby scoring political points for themselves with the city's money. Mr. Koch threatened to make the legislators accountable for the budget deficit they were creating. 
"I threatened to issue public bulletins at election time listing all the city workers and programs in each legislator's district that had to be cut because of the legislator's vote on the pension bill," Mr. Koch recalled. "I wasn't able to stop the pension increase, but they did agree to reduce it by $70 million if I'd shut up. Just the threat of a problem at election was enough to worry them. The most important thing in any legislator's mind is being re-elected. Nothing else comes even close."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AID FOR BUSINESS; 
Citing Construction Slump, Bush Pushes Bill to Protect Insurers From Terrorism Losses

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8 

 BODY:
Attributing a sharp decline in the nation's construction projects to a lack of insurance, President Bush tried today to revive stalled legislation that would protect insurers from losses from terrorist attacks.
 In remarks to a group of business executives and labor leaders, Mr. Bush urged Congress to adopt a measure to counter the insurance problem caused by last September's terrorist attacks. He said the problem was contributing to unemployment and limiting economic growth. 
 "The pace of new construction is dropping dramatically in America," the president said, surrounded by 10 workers in hard hats and speaking before a group that included James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters, and Edward C. Sullivan, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Building and Construction Trades Department.
"Banks and investors and others," he said, "will not finance construction projects that do not have terrorism insurance. In order to build a project, in order to employ people, you've got to borrow money, and you can't borrow money unless there's adequate terrorism insurance. And that's not being provided today."
The effort by the White House to revive the legislation by using the political influence of organized labor, a traditional ally of Democrats, appeared to be aimed at countering another Democratic ally, the trial lawyers. They have joined consumer groups in criticizing the administration's proposal as making it harder for victims of attacks to file lawsuits against insurers and businesses.
The administration has endorsed a measure that passed the House in a vote largely along party lines last November that would provide as much as $100 billion in government loans to the insurance industry to cover future attacks. The measure has slowed in the Senate because of provisions, included at the administration's request, that would sharply restrict the ability of victims of future attacks to collect damages from insurers and other business.
The proposed revisions to the nation's tort law system have provoked widespread criticism from Democrats, who have said the administration has tried to use the terrorism insurance measure to impose broad restrictions on victims and protect big businesses from lawsuits. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, suggested that the administration was not interested in yielding on the issue, telling reporters that "you cannot have terrorism insurance passed without legal reform."
There is no consensus that the lack of terrorism insurance is having as wide an effect as the administration has said. The Consumer Federation of America and some executives in banking, real estate and insurance said terrorism insurance was becoming increasingly available at increasingly lower prices.
They said they believed the biggest push for government aid to the insurers was from a few of the biggest banks, insurers and property owners that wield enormous political influence.
"For the vast majority of real estate deals, terrorism insurance hasn't been the huge issue that most people thought it would be," said John B. Levy, the president of John B. Levy & Company, a real estate investment banking firm in Richmond, Va., that does business around the country.
"In most cases, terrorism insurance is not only available," Mr. Levy said, "but it is available at a price that doesn't knock anybody out of the box."
Insurance brokers say the number of insurers offering terrorism coverage has jumped from zero immediately after the September attacks to more than a dozen. Allianz A.G. and Zurich Financial Services recently announced a joint venture to provide terrorism coverage in the United States and elsewhere.
Early this year, insurance companies were demanding premiums for terrorism coverage 10 to 20 times as high as standard commercial property insurance. But Gary Mathieson, a senior executive at Willis Group Holdings, a big insurance broker, said most clients could get terrorism coverage now for about 20 percent of their overall insurance costs.
For most businesses, those with revenues of $500 million or less, terrorism coverage is not an issue at all, Mr. Mathieson said. After weighing the risks, he said, most insurers have begun including terrorism coverage for those businesses along with property coverage, as they did before the September attacks. The insurers lost an estimated $50 billion in the attacks and that has driven up prices for all coverages, he said.
The businesses having to pay the highest prices for terrorism coverage and having to negotiate the hardest to get the coverage are those with the biggest, most prominent buildings in the cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. But even the cost for those so-called trophy buildings is rarely more than one or two times the premium for general coverage, Mr. Mathieson said.
Mr. Bush said nothing today about the debate over liability issues other than to repeat his often used comment ridiculing lawyers and terrorists.
"They must have miscalculated," he said, speaking of the hijackers. "They hit us and thought we were so weak that all we would do is probably file a lawsuit."
White House officials and other participants at today's meeting described many problems in obtaining financing for new construction projects. The president noted, for instance, that the Hyatt Corporation had been unable to get money to begin work on a 1.5 million-square-foot office building in Chicago because of inadequate terrorism insurance. A $2 billion resort in Nevada had similar problems, he said.
J. Willard Marriott Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Marriott International, said the company was having trouble finding money for $6 billion in construction of new hotels that would provide more than 35,000 rooms. For existing buildings, Mr. Marriott said, the company is facing premium increases of as much as 300 percent.
But in most cases, insurance brokers said, coverage has been available, but executives have been unwilling to pay the price. Now, Mr. Mathieson said, "every day it is getting more affordable."

HEADLINE: Mideast and Venezuela Turmoil Sends Oil Prices Into Wild Swing 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Oil prices, already up 40 percent this year, swung wildly yesterday, with political turmoil from the Middle East to Venezuela threatening to crimp energy supplies just as seasonal demand in the United States is starting to rise.
 Prices jumped almost 4 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, said in a television address that he would halt his country's oil exports for 30 days to protest Israel's military action on the West Bank. Page A12. 
 Energy markets also were responding to events in Venezuela, a major supplier of oil to the United States, where a simmering labor protest at the state oil company seemed poised to spread, with a nationwide general strike called for today. Page A3. 
By late yesterday afternoon in New York, crude oil prices fell back to settle at $26.54, up 33 cents, after Ali Rodriguez, the secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, reassured the markets that there were sufficient worldwide production and supplies of oil to soften any losses from Iraq's temporary embargo. The Venezuelan government denied reports that its refineries had drastically reduced output.
But many industry experts said yesterday that disruptions had occurred, and warned that if they were prolonged -- and if oil prices continued to rise as a result -- the economic recovery in the United States could be hobbled. 
The nation is approaching the warm-weather driving season, when gasoline consumption jumps, and the increase could be particularly sharp this year as a result of the growing numbers of gasoline-hungry light trucks and sport utility vehicles, the sales of which surpassed those of automobiles for the first time last year.
"This summer, you will see the impact of Detroit's zero percent finance rate," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an independent oil analyst based in Newport Beach, Calif., alluding to the automobile industry financing programs that increased the sales of sport utilities and other vehicles last fall. "All these S.U.V.'s will be on the road and demand will be up."
At a news conference yesterday, the Energy Department painted a more optimistic picture, projecting that average gasoline prices this summer would be $1.46 a gallon nationwide, or about 8 cents less than last summer, despite a 20 percent increase in prices over the last month. But the estimate relies in part on the assumption that the Iraqi embargo will not spread to other countries and that other OPEC members will make up the difference. 
The Saudis and other members of OPEC have said that they will not impose oil embargoes in the hope of swaying Washington's policy in the Middle East. But the leaders of Muslim countries that represent 80 percent of OPEC's production face growing pressure from their people to stand up to the United States over policies that that many Muslims regard as too sympathetic to Israel while ignoring the concerns of the Palestinians.
"This puts Arab members of OPEC in an extremely difficult position," said Yasser Elguindi, managing director at Medley Global Advisors, a New York consulting firm. "On the one hand, they have to be extremely subtle in getting the message out that they want to stabilize oil markets, but they don't want to seem as if they are at the beck and call of the U.S. This will be very hard, given how their local populations feel."
Over the last 16 months, Iraq has twice suspended oil exports for various political purposes, and Saudi Arabia, among the few countries with extra production capacity to bring on line, has stepped up its production to compensate. 
Even with those interruptions -- and despite the bitter differences between Baghdad and Washington going back to the Persian Gulf war of 1990-91 -- Iraq last year was the sixth-largest oil supplier to the United States, according to the Energy Information Administration, the analytical arm of the Energy Department. 
Iraq exports its oil under the United Nations' oil-for-food program, with the proceeds going into an escrow account overseen by the United Nations to buy essential goods for the Iraqi people. But oil industry experts said that rampant oil smuggling outside the United Nations-approved system had padded Iraq's treasury. 
The proceeds, and the escrow account, experts said, give Mr. Hussein leeway to use an embargo to burnish his popularity in the Arab world and tweak his regional rivals.
"He has everything to gain politically and nothing to lose," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "He's been trying for the last several years to be seen as the leader sensitive to global Arab politics, and this puts additional pressure on the Saudis. The message may not be to the oil markets, but to the Arab people."
Mr. Hussein said that he would re-evaluate his embargo in 30 days. It will take at least that long for refiners and consumers to feel the pain, if any, from the embargo, given that oil travels from the Persian Gulf to American gas stations over four to six weeks. 
But the impact of political turmoil in Venezuela, the third-largest exporter of crude oil and petroleum products to the United States, could be felt in eight days or so, said Charles T. Maxwell, senior oil analyst for the brokerage house of Weeden & Company. 
Over the last five weeks or so, employees of the state-run oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, have orchestrated a successful work slow-down to protest moves by President Hugo Chavez to exert greater control over the company and to divert more of its profit to the national treasury. 
The largest Venezuelan refinery is operating at 50 percent of its capacity, and others have shut down, according to workers' groups and independent experts. But the Venezuelan government denied yesterday that such disruptions had occurred. 
The strikes seem poised to spread far beyond the oil industry. People with long involvement in Venezuelan affairs said that a broad range of the nation's citizens -- from business people to laborers to clerics -- had banded together against what they regard as Mr. Chavez's autocratic rule.
The president has pledged to quash the one-day nationwide work stoppage called for today by the opposition, and many analysts fear an intensification of the social conflict.
"This has brought together large swaths of society, and they see it as an opportunity to get rid of Chavez," said Moises Naim, a former Venezuelan trade minister who is now editor of Foreign Policy magazine in Washington. "But Chavez won't go quietly. If the strike is successful or it lasts for more than a day, you can expect troubles."

HEADLINE: Pulitzers Focus on Sept. 11, and The Times Wins 7 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The New York Times won a record seven Pulitzer Prizes yesterday, including six for its news coverage of the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, its victims, its causes and its aftermath, all transformative events in the modern history of the United States. The attacks and the war on terrorism were the focus of 8 of the 14 Pulitzer Prizes awarded for journalism.
 The staff of The Wall Street Journal, which on Sept. 11 was forced to abandon its building across the street from 2 World Trade Center, pick its way through the carnage and gather in small groups around Manhattan and New Jersey, was awarded the prize for breaking news reporting. 
 One of two prizes awarded to The Washington Post yesterday was for its staff's national coverage of the war on terrorism.
The Times's Pulitzers included the public service award for the section A Nation Challenged, which was anchored each day with a full page headed Portraits of Grief, consisting of biographical sketches of those who died at the World Trade Center. The coverage on The Times's Web site was also mentioned in the citation by the Pulitzer board at Columbia University, which administers the prizes. 
The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times won two prizes apiece. Newsday won the award for criticism for the work of its classical music critic, Justin Davidson.
In the 86 years that the prizes have been awarded, no newspaper has previously won more than three in a single year. 
"We are witness to an extraordinary moment in the history of this newspaper, just an extraordinary moment," said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times, addressing hundreds of reporters and editors gathered in the newspaper's newsroom off Times Square. "But it is built on the back of a real tragedy."
He then called for a moment of silence in memory of the nearly 3,000 people killed during the attacks and their aftermath and of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was killed in Pakistan.
Among the seven awards given in the arts category, David McCullough won for biography for a work that burnished the image of the nation's often-criticized second president, John Adams. 
Diane McWhorter received the award in the nonfiction category for her intricately woven portrait of the best and worst of Birmingham's citizens in "Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution."
Six of the eight awards for coverage of terrorism and its consequences were given not to individuals, but to the staff of the newspapers involved -- The Times, The Post and The Journal.
Among the individual awards, Thomas Friedman, the Times columnist, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary, his third award. Barry Bearak of The Times was awarded a prize for international reporting, "for his deeply affecting and illuminating coverage of daily life in war-torn Afghanistan."
The staff of The Times was awarded the prize in explanatory reporting "for its informed and detailed reporting, before and after the Sept. 11 attacks on America, that profiled the global terrorism network and the threats it posed."
In a rare double award for photography, The Times received prizes in both the breaking news and the feature categories -- breaking news for a portfolio of work by 14 photographers who covered the events of Sept. 11, and feature for 5 photographers' work in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Of the six journalism prizes awarded for work unrelated to the Sept. 11 attacks, The Los Angeles Times won two, one for Barry Siegel's "haunting and humane" portrait of a Utah man tried for neglect in the death of his son, and one for editorials written by Alex Raksin and Bob Sipchen about the dilemmas presented by mentally ill homeless people. 
Another, for beat reporting, went to Gretchen Morgenson of The Times "for her trenchant and incisive Wall Street coverage," which focused in part on the business conflicts of financial analysts and the firms that employ them, which receive investment banking fees from the companies the analysts cover.
The Washington Post's second prize was for investigative reporting by the reporters Sari Horowitz, Scott Higham and Sarah Cohen on the District of Columbia's "role in the neglect and death of 229 children placed in protective care between 1993 and 2000."
Clay Bennett of The Christian Science Monitor won for his editorial cartoons.
In the arts category, the fiction prize was awarded to Richard Russo for his novel "Empire Falls," (Alfred A. Knopf) about working-class life and aspirations in a small Maine mill town. 
The award for history was won by "The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America" by Louis Menand, an examination of the turn-of-the-century pragmatist thinkers Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., William James, Charles Sanders Pierce and John Dewey. It was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
"Practical Gods," by Carl Dennis, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, won the award for poetry. 
The prize for drama went to "Topdog/Underdog" by Suzan-Lori Parks, which examines the relationship between two brothers. Ms. Parks is the first African-American woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for drama.
The composer Henry Brant won the award for music for his work "Ice Field,"' which opened on Dec. 12, 2001, at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.
Seymour Topping, the administrator of the prizes, said yesterday that the 18-member Pulitzer board "did not set out to dedicate itself to marking the coverage of a single event. It followed its usual practice. It went down category by category looking at the quality of the entry, regardless of the subject."
He agreed, however, that the dominance of a single set of events was "highly unusual."
The breadth of the losses of Sept. 11 lent a somber undercurrent to the celebrations in the newsrooms of The Times, The Journal and The Post -- the newsrooms closest to the attacks themselves. 
Howell Raines, the executive editor of The Times, said to the hundreds of journalists clustered in the third-floor newsroom, "We are ever mindful of the shattering events it was our task to record in our city, nation and world community." 
But, he added, "We have a right to celebrate these days of legend at The New York Times." A minute earlier, Mr. Raines predicted that The Times's reporting in the wake of the attacks "will be studied and taught as long as journalism is studied and practiced."
And in both The Times's newsroom in Midtown Manhattan and at The Journal's temporary newsroom in South Brunswick, N.J., editors celebrating their awards said that the entire newsroom shared them.
Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post, said of his newspaper's national reporting award, "This was reporting that brought out information that without the reporting might never have been brought out." He added, "It was wonderful to have Bob Woodward come in Sept. 11 and stay with us and drive that reporting." Mr. Woodward, an assistant managing editor, brought The Post a Pulitzer for its Watergate coverage along with Carl Bernstein.
Mr. Downie added, "What I liked about the Pulitzers as a whole was they really rewarded public service this year. It was public service performed by large newspapers in two cities where attacks occurred. It wasn't individual glory, it was teamwork."
Regional newspapers and smaller-circulation dailies were almost absent from the list of winners in journalism, as five of the six newspapers which won were among the country's 10 leading newspapers in daily circulation.
Mr. Topping said that the board moved one candidate, The Post's series on foster children, from the public service category into the investigative reporting category, meaning that none of the three finalists originally selected by the Pulitzer jury in that group won any award. 
That category had been the focus of a recent controversy as The Wall Street Journal published three attacks on The Seattle Times's entrant -- an examination of cancer trials at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
But, Mr. Topping said, the Seattle series "did not lose out because of the criticism leveled extraneously in the public forum."
Mr. Topping also said he will step down as administrator of the prizes in June, to focus his energies on writing novels.

FICTION
RICHARD RUSSO
"Empire Falls"

In this panoramic novel, a former mill town in Maine becomes the embodiment of the dreams and disappointments of its citizens and of the country itself. As in the author's other fiction about life among the working class, the protagonist is a classic underachiever who is also a figure of some nobility.
Mr. Russo is 52 and a resident of Camden, Me. This is his fifth novel. A new book of short stories, "The Whore's Child," is scheduled to be published this July. 
FINALISTS "The Corrections" by Jonathan Franzen; "John Henry Days" by Colson Whitehead.

GENERAL NONFICTION
DIANE McWHORTER
"Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution"

Ms. McWhorter's book is an exhaustive, meticulously detailed account of the struggle between integration and segregation in Birmingham, Ala., her native city and the scene of one of the worst racist atrocities in American history, the murder of four black girls in a 1963 church bombing carried out by white supremacists.
With that event as her centerpiece, Ms. McWhorter writes a history of segregation in Birmingham and the way it was maintained by an intricate alliance of judges, the police, the Ku Klux Klan and the surrounding complacency of white society. 
FINALISTS "War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton and the Generals," by David Halberstam; and "The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression," by Andrew Solomon.

DRAMA
SUZAN-LORI PARKS
"Topdog/Underdog"

Ms. Parks's comic drama, which opened on Broadway on Sunday, explores the tense yet loving relationship between two brothers. Ms. Parks, who lives in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, said waking up to rave reviews and winning the Pulitzer Prize on the same day had left her fairly airborne. "That's why I do yoga," she said, "to handle things like this. So I can keep breathing." 
FINALISTS "The Glory of Living" by Rebecca Gilman; "Yellowman" by Dael Orlandersmith.

POETRY
CARL DENNIS
"Practical Gods"

In his poetry, Mr. Dennis, 62, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, finds the deities everywhere. There is Hermes, for instance, sitting under the stars, sniffing the fragrance of wine and barley blowing on the sea breeze from his temple, who, if you are lucky, might "want, when you die, to offer his services/ As a guide on the shadowy path to the underworld." Mr. Dennis is known for his plain-spoken, deceptively simple work, which has been called by The New York Times "wise, original, and often deeply moving." FINALISTS "The Seven Ages" by Louise Gluck; "The Beforelife" by Franz Wright.

BIOGRAPHY

HISTORY
LOUIS MENAND
"The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America"

In 1872, a group of young intellectuals in Cambridge, Mass., formed a conversation society, which in the words of one member was "half-ironically, half-defiantly" called the Metaphysical Club. The club lasted only a few months but its legacy was to create the foundation for pragmatism, the prevailing American philosophy of the early 20th century.
The lives and work of four large personalities -- William James, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Charles Sanders Pierce and their intellectual heir John Dewey -- are at the center of this book by Mr. Menand, a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine, professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and a Manhattan resident. But Mr. Menand fans out broadly across the American intellectual landscape, delivering a history of ideas written, as one critic said, with "rare common sense and graceful witty prose." 
FINALISTS "Deep Souths: Delta, Piedmont, and the Sea Island Society in the Age of Segregation" by J. William Harris; "Facing East From Indian Country: A Native History of Early America" by Daniel K. Richter.

MUSIC
HENRY BRANT
"Ice Field"

Mr. Brant is a pioneer of 20th-century spatial music, in which the planned positioning of the performers throughout the hall, as well as on stage, is a basic factor in the composition. Mr. Brant's main works since 1950 have all been spatial compositions.
The San Francisco Symphony played the premiere of "Ice Field" at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco on Dec. 12, 2001. 

FINALISTS Peter Lieberson, "Rilke Songs"; David Rakowski, "Ten of a Kind" (Symphony No. 2).

PUBLIC SERVICE
THE NEW YORK TIMES

The New York Times was honored for "A Nation Challenged," a daily special section that reported on the aftermath of Sept. 11, the war in Afghanistan and America's campaign against terrorism. It included "Portraits of Grief," the biographical sketches of the lives of 1,800 of nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks. The Pulitzer board said the section "coherently and comprehensively covered the tragic events, profiled the victims and tracked the developing story, locally and globally."
FINALISTS The Washington Post for a series exposing the District of Columbia's role in the deaths of 229 children placed in protective care between 1993 and 2000; The Washington Post, coverage of Sept. 11 and its aftermath.

INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING
SARI HORWITZ, SCOTT HIGHAM AND SARAH COHEN
The Washington Post

The Post was honored for its four-part series, "The District's Lost Children." The articles, which took a year to prepare, exposed the District of Columbia's role in the neglect and death of 229 children placed in protective care between 1993 and 2000. The award "is a tribute to the children who lost their lives," said Mr. Higham, who added that "we hope that this prize will put more attention on the issue of abused and neglected children in the future."
FINALISTS The Washington Post, two series that documented systematic abuses in the Prince George's County Police Department; The Seattle Times, an investigation of a local cancer research center; The Dayton Daily News, for its focus on the recruiting of foreign athletes for American schools.

NATIONAL REPORTING
THE WASHINGTON POST

A series of articles relating to the terrorism investigation -- six of them carrying the familiar byline of Bob Woodward -- earned the Washington Post staff recognition for national reporting. The paper was cited for coverage that "regularly brought forth new information together with skilled analysis of unfolding developments."
One article described how Osama bin Laden slipped through the Clinton administration's fingers after the government of Sudan offered to arrest him. Another corrected initial misimpressions of the hijackers as pilots who had blended into the suburban landscape. 
FINALISTS Douglas M. Birch and Gary Cohn of The Baltimore Sun for a series on medical research, and Gregory L. Vistica for a New York Times Magazine story on United States Senator Bob Kerrey's role in a Vietnam War massacre.

INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
BARRY BEARAK
The New York Times

As co-bureau chief in New Delhi, Mr. Bearak traveled extensively in Afghanistan during and after the reign of the Taliban, producing what the Pulitzer committee described as "deeply affecting and illuminating coverage" of ordinary people struggling to endure famine, extremism and war.
"Afghanistan is the world's most beautiful and the world's saddest place, and I only hope some good will come to the people after all these years of intense suffering," Mr. Bearak said. 
FINALISTS Dexter Filkins of The New York Times and The Washington Post staff, all for reporting on Afghanistan.

FEATURE WRITING
BARRY SIEGEL
The Los Angeles Times

Mr. Siegel, 52, won in the feature writing category for his account of a man's trial on negligence charges in the accidental death of his 2-year-old son. Mr. Siegel told the story mainly through the eyes of Judge Robert Hilder, who struggled with the decision to convict the father and then anguished further after the convicted man took his own life.
Judge Hilder had not spoken to other reporters but spent hours discussing his feelings about the case with Mr. Siegel. Mr. Siegel said his reporting often focuses on people struggling with moral and ethical issues, and he writes fictional courtroom dramas on the side. 
FINALISTS Ellen Barry, The Boston Globe, for a portrait of teenage Sudanese boys resettling in the United States; David Maraniss, The Washington Post, a reconstruction of the events of Sept. 11.

BEAT REPORTING
GRETCHEN MORGENSON
The New York Times

Ms. Morgenson, a stockbroker turned journalist, exposed the hidden conflicts of interest that abound among stock analysts. Her articles illuminated a culture in which analysts spent less time on research and more time promoting stocks of companies that did business with their firms. Last year, she was the only reporter to also look at stockbrokers who advised the employees of companies like Microsoft and Worldcom to make risky bets on stock options.
"Individual investors were driven like sheep to the slaughter by analysts looking to line their own pockets," she said.
Ms. Morgenson, 46, joined The Times in 1998 and has been a business reporter for more than 18 years.
FINALISTS Patrick Healy of The Boston Globe, for a series exposing rampant grade inflation at Harvard University; Jack Kelley of USA Today, for coverage of the attack on the World Trade Center.

EXPLANATORY REPORTING
THE NEW YORK TIMES

In the three-part series "Holy Warriors," The Times wrote of a Saudi millionaire whose camps in Afghanistan were molding thousands of militant Muslims into an international network of terrorists waiting only for their orders to strike.
The series was published in January 2001. "Eight months later," the newspaper's editors wrote to the Pulitzer jury, "it all turned horribly real." Their work was cited by the Pulitzer judges as part of the newspaper's "informed and detailed reporting, before and after the Sept. 11 attacks on America, that profiled the global terrorism network and the threats it posed."
FINALISTS -- David Finkel of The Washington Post "for his illuminating series of articles on the lives and journeys of international migrants," and The New York Times staff "for its sustained explanatory reporting on the nature of the structural damage at ground zero."

BREAKING NEWS
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

The Wall Street Journal won its award for an event that happened right outside its windows. Cater-corner across a multi-lane highway from the World Trade Center, the offices of The Journal were rendered unusable, without power and with most windows blown out by the attack. But within minutes of the time when the first plane hit the trade center, a team of editors was sent to the Journal's backup facilities near Princeton, N.J.
From there, in contact with a group of senior editors huddled in an apartment in Manhattan and fielding e-mail transmissions from reporters around the city and the world, The Journal produced a two-section, 32-page paper, "executed under the most difficult circumstances," according to the Pulitzer committee, which made it to 88 percent of subscribers. The day's articles not only documented the attacks but also accurately analyzed their potential effect on the economy. 
FINALISTS -- The Daily News, New York, coverage of the attack Sept. 11; The New York Times, coverage of the attack Sept. 11.

CRITICISM
JUSTIN DAVIDSON
Newsday

While he won the Pulitzer for criticism, Mr. Davidson, who is Newsday's culture writer at large as well as its classical music critic, is a journalist with eclectic interests. His recent work includes a review of a book of essays on food and a two-part series on guns in America. The Pulitzer committee that singled out his work for the prize described it as "crisp coverage of classical music," which Mr. Davidson attributes to the tight restrictions on space that most journalists work with in an era when articles are shrinking. "It's a challenge, but it's also a discipline," he said. "I don't sacrifice a word because they all count." Mr. Davidson, who is 35, was nominated as a finalist in this category in 1999.
FINALISTS -- John King of The San Francisco Chronicle for his essays on the impact architecture and urban design have on the Bay Area; Joseph Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal for film criticism.

COMMENTARY
THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
The New York Times

Mr. Friedman, 48, foreign affairs columnist for The Times, won his third Pulitzer Prize, for his columns examining the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat. The Pulitzer board cited his "clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting."
"This is the biggest story of my life, and the thing that motivated me most was I just really wanted to get it right," Mr. Friedman said. "Get it right not only in terms of who they are but in terms of who we are." 
He shared the Pulitzer for international reporting in 1983 for his work in Lebanon and won again in 1988 for his coverage of Israel. 
FINALISTS -- Michael Daly, The Daily News, New York; and Nat Hentoff, The Village Voice.

EDITORIAL WRITING
ALEX RAKSIN AND BOB SIPCHEN
The Los Angeles Times

Mr. Raksin, 41, an editorial writer with The Los Angeles Times, and Mr. Sipchen, 48, the associate editor of the paper's editorial pages, were cited "for their comprehensive and powerfully written editorials exploring the issues and dilemmas provoked by mentally ill people dwelling on the streets." In 14 editorials, the two wrote that the decison to let hundreds of thousands of people out of mental hospitals had left 50,000 mentally ill people homeless in California. The two editorial writers described the sorry existences of several of these people and urged lawmakers to give the government more power to compel some of them to receive treatment, for their own good as well as the public's.
"Life on the streets is anything but humane," they wrote. 'It's time that we all squarely face the fact that some people who cannot act in their own best interests must be nudged off the streets and into treatment even when they don't think they need it." 
FINALISTS -- William H. Freivogel of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch for editorials opposing the nomination and policies of Attorney General John D. Ashcroft; The Philadelphia Daily News editorial board for a series on behalf of Philadelphia's neglected parks.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: OIL; 
Iraq Halts Petroleum Exports To Put Pressure on Americans

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, April 8 

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq halted his country's oil exports temporarily today, saying he would seek to damage the American economy because of Washington's support for Israel, and he repeated his demand -- likely to remain ignored -- that other Middle Eastern oil producers follow suit.
 Shutting off the taps had an immediate impact on oil prices, which shot upward. But it seems unlikely that the move will have any short-term effect on the United Nations program that supervises Iraq's purchase of food, medicine and other goods by siphoning its oil revenue through a special account. 
 Mr. Hussein said Iraq would review the decision to halt exports after a month, or after the Israeli military withdrew unconditionally from Palestinian territory. 
"This decision is essentially aimed against the Zionist entity and the aggressive U.S. policy, not against anyone else," Mr. Hussein said, accusing the United States of backing Israel's sustained military offensive.
The move would clearly be popular among the general Arab population, with demonstrators joining ever larger marches all week, chanting for their leaders to skip the speeches and take some action.
King Abdullah II of Jordan, in his first brief public remarks on the situation, said today that if Israel did not withdraw from the Palestinian territories immediately, relations with his kingdom would be affected. But he did not specify how.
Mr. Hussein said other countries should follow Iraq's example.
"Our Arab and Muslim brethren and all believers will hopefully encourage our move," he said in a televised address, suggesting that all oil exporters take "similar measures."
Despite the day's steep rise in prices after the announcement, oil analysts said other producers like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, often fearful of the effect of volatile oil prices, were likely to increase production to make up the shortfall. Nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, like Russia and Norway, can be expected to increase sales to take advantage of high prices.
Iraq exports about two million barrels of oil a day, or 4 percent of global production. The United States in particular ranks among its best customers. The Iraqis say roughly 15 percent of America's imported oil originates in Iraq. The United States says the figure is more like 8 percent.
Mr. Hussein's measure "will have a major impact on the oil market and directly hurt the U.S. economy," Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid told Iraq's satellite television channel.
He said the United States generally bought 1.25 million barrels of oil daily that originated in Iraq and noted that he had contacted other members of OPEC to suggest that they not mitigate the effect of the embargo by raising their production.
Although the leaders of Iran and Libya have supported the idea of reviving the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which resulted in Americans lining up for gasoline, they seem unlikely to join. Iran's economic problems make it heavily dependent on oil revenue -- as is the case with most oil producers -- and Libya only recently began resuming commercial ties with the West.
Although Mr. Hussein has forced the 17 million Iraqi people to weather repeated crises in the past, United Nations officials said the export cutoff probably would not have any immediate effect on the oil-for-food program.
Some $13 billion in outstanding contracts for food, medicine and other supplies is already in the pipeline, said Hasmik Egian, the spokeswoman for the program. But the program has already been suffering from a funding crisis, with no money to back another $2 billion in contracts that have already been approved.
"There is a funding shortfall, so this will further complicate that situation," Ms. Egian said.
She said that Iraq earned some $11 billion from oil last year, but that production was already erratic because the Iraqis stopped exports in June and then slowed them again in December in a dispute with the United Nations over pricing. More stringent price controls were put in place after reports that Iraq was demanding kickbacks from buyers that were deposited outside the United Nations system.
Iraq exports smaller volumes of oil to its neighbors -- Jordan, Syria and Turkey -- with various levels of United Nations approval. While Jordan's economic hardships exempted it from some United Nations controls, the United Nations has queried Syria about opening a long-closed pipeline to help Iraq export. Baghdad did not indicate that any of those sales would be cut.

HEADLINE: Council Seeks Tax Surcharge To Aid Schools 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The City Council called yesterday for levying a new income tax surcharge to pay for new schools, school libraries and labs, charting a collision course with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg over two political flash points: taxes and budget cuts.
 Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, announced the council's plan for a new tax, which would be leveraged to pay for $5 billion in new debt, in Corona, Queens, in a temporary classroom that was built in the playground of what he described as the most overcrowded school in the nation. 
 In laying out the plan, Mr. Miller challenged Mr. Bloomberg's oft-repeated position that higher taxes would frighten away businesses. "We have got to keep our middle class, we have got to attract businesses, and we believe that the way to do that, first and foremost, is to have an outstanding public education system," Mr. Miller said. 
The Bloomberg administration was swift to take up the gauntlet. "I'm opposed to raising taxes on anything other than cigarettes, which clearly would save lives if you did," said the mayor, who wants only one tax rise: a $1.42-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, to as much as $7 a pack. His aides called the Council's proposal unrealistic and "not responsible."
The Council made its push for an education tax surcharge as part of its response, and rebuttal, to Mayor Bloomberg's plan for closing a $4.76 billion budget deficit in the fiscal year beginning in July. 
The Council wants to restore several of the mayor's proposed cuts. They called for restoring all $344 million in education cuts; keeping open seven centers for the elderly that were scheduled to be closed; partly scaling back the cuts to libraries and cultural institutions; and continuing the city's recycling program for cans and bottles, which the mayor says is too inefficient and costly and should be dropped.
To pay for these, the Council proposed a variety of new cuts and tax increases, including $31 million in higher taxes on beer, wine and liquor, and $65 million in a property tax surcharge on absentee landlords with one-to-three family homes. Even absent any tax increases, the council forecasts that the city will collect $445 million more in taxes next year than the mayor does, because it expects the economy to improve more quickly.
But its plan got a cool reaction from the Bloomberg administration. "The Council's financial plan relies on over a billion dollars of unrealistic tax increases," Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw said in a statement. "It is not responsible to raise expectations for moneys that are simply not going to materialize."
The mayor is expected to release his executive budget plan later this month, setting off a round of hearings and fevered negotiations and horse trading with the City Council until a final budget is passed in June.
The proposed education tax surcharge would cost $7 a year for people making less than $40,000; $263 a year for people making $100,000 to $150,000; and $14,490 for people making a million dollars. Unlike other recent income tax surcharges, like the one used to hire more police in the 1990's, this proposal contains no sunset clause or date when the surcharge would be phased out.
Over all, the Council said that the tax would bring in almost $400 million a year.
The Council's plan is to borrow $5 billion for education and use the $400 million a year generated by the tax surcharge to pay off that debt. Mr. Miller said that the money would be used to pay for the construction of 10 new high schools, 10 more high schools on City University of New York campuses, 13 elementary schools, 650 new school libraries, 670 new science labs and 136,000 new computers for the schools.
The building would be handled not by the School Construction Authority, which has been widely criticized for inefficiency and cost overruns, but by the Department of Design and Construction, an agency answerable to the mayor.
When Mayor Bloomberg first laid out his budget plan in February, he said that he would oppose a higher income tax on the city's wealthiest people. "Adding a tax to the most mobile people in the city just doesn't make a lot of sense," he said then.
Yesterday, Mr. Miller turned that argument against him, arguing that the city faces a greater danger of losing people who are concerned about its school system than losing people who are against higher taxes. "When people call me and tell me that they are planning to leave New York City, the reason that they always tell me, every single time, is because they don't have faith and confidence in our public school system," he said.
The Council, clearly sensitive to the potential of tax-and-spend criticism, was careful to include several proposed tax cuts and service cuts. They proposed eliminating the commercial rent tax below Houston Street, cutting the sales tax the week of July 4, and trimming more administrative positions from city agencies. And some tax increases that council members had discussed -- such as a stock transfer tax -- were not included.
And while the Council is asking the State Legislature to reinstate the commuter tax, which was levied on people who work in the city but live outside it, it wants to use any proceeds from it and other funds so the city will only have to borrow $1 billion next year. Mr. Bloomberg's budget calls for borrowing $1.5 billion to help close the budget gap.
Reinstating the commuter tax, instituting a personal income tax surcharge, and raising the tax on beer, wine and liquor all require the approval of the State Legislature, which could be difficult in an election year, and without the mayor's support.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Woes Worsen as State Oil Company Calls Strike 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: MERIDA, Venezuela, April 8 

 BODY:
A six-week tussle over President Hugo Chavez's management of the state oil company has turned into his most serious crisis, with exports of oil disrupted by a labor slowdown and a general strike called for Tuesday by labor and business leaders.
 "This can only end with the president resigning," Humberto Calderon Berti, a former minister of energy and mines, told a throng of protesting executives from the oil company Petroleos de Venezuela in Caracas. "All Venezuelans from all walks of life, from all social strata, from all the political and ideological sectors, must take part in the stoppage. This is about him or us. It is a choice between democracy or dictatorship." 
 Government ministers said today that exports of oil and refined products remained normal for Venezuela, the world's No. 4 exporter. But analysts and executives from Petroleos de Venezuela said a five-day work slowdown among oil workers and managers had forced a scaling back of operations at several refineries and a cutback in production at wellheads, all of which has disrupted oil shipments to the United States and other countries.
"The reality is you don't have business as usual," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-supported consulting group in New York. "We believe half to two-thirds of their exports have been impacted. But it is literally an hour-by-hour situation."
Latin America's fourth-largest economy may also grind to a halt on Tuesday, as dissident business leaders have promised, in protest against what they see as Mr. Chavez's autocratic style of governing and his treatment of oil company managers. The first such stoppage took place on Dec. 10. Millions of workers stayed home as part of a growing wave of protests aimed at forcing Mr. Chavez from power.
The showdown that has churned up the current crisis began when Mr. Chavez, a left-leaning former army paratrooper who won office in 1998, took on the management of Petroleos de Venezuela, a behemoth with 40,000 employees. Calling it a "state within a state" that sapped resources while benefiting a small number of high-flying executives, Mr. Chavez in February fired the company president, a general whom he had appointed months earlier, and appointed five board members with ties to his administration.
For many of the company's 15,000 office workers, who had long celebrated it as a meritocracy known for efficiency and high standards, the president's management decision was enough. The workers organized protests and slowdowns, which have won the support of leaders from business and labor, as well as from the local media, which report every anti-Chavez protest or pronouncement with relish.
With Mr. Chavez refusing to withdraw his appointments or negotiate with dissident oil executives, the office workers and production workers persisted with their slowdowns, which have intensified since last week. At one drilling site on Thursday, two oil workers were killed when fighting broke out between government supporters and opposition party members.
The exact impact on oil production, refining and the transport of crude and oil products was unclear today. 
But analysts and executives said the Amuay Cardon refinery, which processes 950,000 barrels of crude daily and is a crucial supplier of finished oil products to the United States, had reduced operations. At least two other installations, the Palito refinery on the north-central coast and Puerto La Cruz to the east, halted operations, they said.
Dissident oil executives, reading a statement outside a Petroleos de Venezuela office building in Caracas, said extraction of oil was slowing in the Furrial field in the east while refineries and plants that produce chemicals or distribute natural gas were also ratcheting down.
"Progressively, everything is shutting down," said Alberto Quiroz, an oil analyst and former executive at Petroleos de Venezuela (which is known worldwide by its Spanish acronym, Pdvsa, pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah).
Top government officials, among them Vice President Diosdado Cabello, Energy and Mines Minister Alvaro Silva, and the oil company president, Gaston Parra, have sought to minimize the effects of the slowdown.
"Everything is normal," Mr. Silva told reporters. "Go to the refineries. Everything is normal. There is a small group protesting, but everything is operating normally." 
The commander of the armed forces, Gen. Lucas Rincon, announced that the military was beefing up its presence at refineries and oil fields, which are routinely protected by the National Guard.
Through it all, Mr. Chavez has refused to back down or acknowledge that the slowdown could hurt Venezuela, whose economy relies on oil for 80 percent of exports and 50 percent of government revenues.
In a long nationally televised address on Sunday, the president said the military could run oil production and refining sites if necessary. He also took the opportunity to announce that he had fired 7 dissident executives and forced 12 more to retire.
Blowing a soccer referee's whistle and calling the executives "off sides," Mr. Chavez warned about a "subversive movement in neckties" trying to destabilize the country. But, he warned, "I can do away with all of them," he said.
Rafael Sandrea, president of the oil committee of Fedecamaras, a powerful business group, said Mr. Chavez's uncompromising approach had only made the opposition that much more defiant.
"The president has closed the door of reconciliation and opened the doors for war," Mr. Sandrea said. "That is what this is now, war, between the people of Pdvsa and the government."

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
At a Festival, Documentaries as History

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.C., April 8 

 BODY:
Traveling theater troupes once gave audiences what Shakespeare called "the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time." Then came an era when encyclopedic historians like Gibbon and Macaulay told people what they wanted to know about history and society. A festival held here last weekend suggests that today, documentary filmmakers are assuming that role.
 Public and cable television networks have spurred a boom in documentary filmmaking over the last few years, resulting in a surge of films that seek to interpret both contemporary events and those long past. 
 The Full Frame Documentary Film Festival here, formerly the DoubleTake Festival, attracted 630 entries this year, far more than in any of its previous four years. Sixty-seven films were chosen to be screened.
Most of the works shown fell into two broad categories. Some were personal stories or video diaries that presented individual lives. Many of the most compelling ones, however, dealt with historical events. Their richness and variety suggest that documentary films have become a vital part of the way Americans learn about what is happening and has happened in the world around them.
"We're part of the great move away from quantitative history toward history that is concerned about the art of presentation as well as the science of information," said Ric Burns, one of the country's most prominent documentary filmmakers, who was here to present his new film, "Ansel Adams," about the photographer. "We want to seduce people imaginatively and give them a sense of what it was like to be there then. We're doing what realistic novelists did in the 19th century. We take the roof off the house and show you what's happening or what happened inside."
"As people become more informed, there's a hunger for insight into other places and other times," Mr. Burns said. "People are asking, 'What went on in his head?' or 'How does she live?' That's part of what accounts for the explosion of interest in documentary filmmaking."
This year's jury prize for a full-length film at the Full Frame festival went to Davis Guggenheim's documentary "The First Year," which portrays the daunting challenges facing novice teachers at some of America's toughest public schools. The audience prize was awarded to "The Last Just Man," a shattering account by Steven Silver of the responsibility shared by the United States, Belgium and the United Nations for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. It focuses on Gen. Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the United Nations peacekeeping force there, who is consumed with guilt for his inability to persuade his superiors in New York to allow him to stop the massacres, which took 800,000 lives in a 100-day period.
In an interview Mr. Silver said the burgeoning interest in historical documentaries placed an added burden on filmmakers as reporters. That burden is increased when important figures refuse to cooperate, a problem he faced when both the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, and former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright turned down his requests for interviews. 
"With so many of these new history-oriented channels using our films, and so many more people watching them, our responsibility to get the story right is heavier than ever," Mr. Silver said. "Today history is being taught on film. That means filmmakers become historians, and it means we have to work and research and look for fairness and truth with the same rigor as any scholar. There's a big weight on our shoulders."
When he accepted the audience award, Mr. Silver said the accompanying $3,000 worth of film donated by Eastman Kodak would "come in very handy, given the economics of our business." Several other filmmakers also said that although there were many more outlets for documentaries now than even a few years ago, they still make little money from their work. Even some of the most successful must still struggle for the relatively modest funds needed for their projects.
Mr. Silver's film also reflects a trend in modern documentary filmmaking, because although it strives for honesty -- or perhaps because it does -- it interprets events and takes a position on them rather than simply presenting points of view. Passion informs his film and many other contemporary documentaries.
Margaret Drain, executive producer of the PBS series "American Experience," said she worried that many Americans were learning history not from documentaries but from feature films, ranging from admittedly fictionalized ones like "A Beautiful Mind" to those that claim authenticity, like "JFK."
"It's the responsibility of documentary filmmakers to counter that," Ms. Drain said. "You're always interpreting facts, but in the documentary business we have to be bound by them and respect them. That certainly isn't the case with feature films."
She was encouraged, though, by the increasing interest in documentaries. "A lot of people do seem to be taking their historical information from documentary films," she said. "More and more historians are finding that they love working with documentary filmmakers, and that's had quite an impact. I was at CBS in the mid-80's when executives there announced that the documentary was dead. Well, guess what? It's alive and well and thriving."
Perhaps inevitably, the Durham festival devoted several programs to films about the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and their aftermath. Some are directly tied to the disaster, like "The Morning Of," a five-minute short that shows people on Staten Island reacting while the World Trade Center towers are still ablaze, and "Site," a record of visitors' reactions to ground zero. Others probe related issues, like "Afghan Alphabet," a study of the difficulties facing children in Afghanistan as they struggle for an education.
"Television did a very good job of covering the events of Sept. 11," said Nancy Buirski, the festival's executive director. "Documentary films take that to the next level. They probe history and emotions and psychology. They approach experience from so many vantage points, like a prism. If they're well done, there's a fullness to them that you really don't get in any other medium."
Among the filmmakers who came here for the festival was David Van Taylor, co-producer of "Ghosts of Attica," which provides chilling new insights into that 1971 prison uprising in upstate New York. He is now working on a video history of documentary filmmaking.
"We do what historians do, which is to write the second draft of history, to correct what people are told at the time that things happen," Mr. Van Taylor said. "We don't compete with scholars, but we fill an important niche and we take what we do very seriously. Filmmakers definitely have an increasing responsibility, as more people go to films for information that they used to get from the written word."
"I see a lot of very good historical films these days," he said. "They have to be good, because people are becoming more and more sophisticated in gleaning information from visual sources. As superficial as visual information can be, compared to text, it also contains great riches."

HEADLINE: Blue Skies Shining On City Restaurants 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
PREDICTIONS for New York restaurants after Sept. 11 were dire. Business would be so bad, people in the industry feared, that dozens would be forced to close.
 Some of the worries have come true. Corporate spending, the lifeblood of high-end restaurants, is down. And tourism, along with the convention business, is still lagging. Many believe that freewheeling consumption is out of step with the times. 
 Yet few restaurants closed, and many did even better in the first quarter of this year than they did last year. 
The reason? In great part, the weather.
Ordinarily, the seasonal annoyances of cold, snow and slush keep people in the office instead of out to lunch, at home instead of out for dinner. But this past winter the balmy weather proved a bonanza. People kept going to their favorite places; sometimes they even ate outside.
"The threat of snow can change dinner reservations from 250 to 75," Waldy Malouf, the chef at Beacon on West 56th Street, said, "and very cold weather keeps people from going to lunch." 
Other factors played a part. The city and the industry organized two promotional restaurant weeks instead of the usual one, and New Yorkers responded, turning out for $20 prix fixe lunches and $30 prix fixe dinners.
"It brought main-line restaurants pretty nearly back to normal," said Tim Zagat, departing chairman of NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing agency.
The slowdown in business travel had a flip side, George Faison, a partner in D'Artagnan, the purveyor of luxury meats and foie gras, said. "A lot of New York business travelers stayed home and are eating here." Vendors like Mr. Faison also gave restaurants more time to make payments. "We have to be more lenient to help keep people afloat." In some cases vendors renegotiated contracts. Wholesale wine prices dropped, allowing some restaurants to cut the cost of wines by the glass in half. 
Individual restaurants have instituted their own promotions, giving away wine and bar snacks, offering gift certificates and frequent-eater programs to lure customers back, and even reducing prices. 
Restaurateurs say that unlike the case of Broadway, which had one of the best theater seasons in years with the help of suburbanites and out-of-towners, the speedy rebirth was mainly fueled by New Yorkers.
With the exception of San Francisco, no city was affected more than New York by the recession that began early last year. But the downturn affected restaurants less severely than had been predicted, said E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the New York Restaurant Association. Across the country, the National Restaurant Association said, sales returned to pre-attack levels. After declining 2.4 percent in September, sales surged by 7.5 percent for the rest of the year, and though dipping slightly in January, rebounded in February, the last month for which figures are available. 
Despite the good news for New York restaurants, the losses in the fall will not be easy to make up. The terrorist attacks and the recession have forced even the most successful restaurants to take stock, looking for ways to control costs while making customers feel more welcome. 
Even so, some restaurants that were struggling before Sept. 11 have fallen by the wayside, like Quilty's and Palio. Others are still struggling. And many restaurants that have opened since the first of the year have much lower prices. 
Patroon, once one of the most expensive steakhouses in New York, closed last July to renovate and offer a less expensive menu, said its owner, Ken Aretsky. When it reopened in mid-November its prices were 25 percent lower. Mr. Aretsky says business is 12 to 14 percent below last year's levels. "We are trying to be extremely inventive and creative, constantly trying to come up with ways to drive more traffic through the door," he said.
Seven months after the attacks, restaurateurs say, their customers continue to be more relaxed and more convivial, which might have something to do with the increased consumption of alcohol. "When people drink, people are happy and that makes for a nicer atmosphere," Geoffrey Zakarian, owner and chef of Town, said. "People are even talking to people at tables next to them."
What they are drinking is cocktails and lots of them, and more moderately priced wines. Charlie Palmer, owner of Aureole, Alva and Metrazur, says his wine costs are down. "Wine purveyors have been stuck with a glut of wine since 9/11, and people with cash could make a great deal," he said.
Corporate spending is still down. "There's much less extravagance," said Drew Nieporent, who owns Nobu, Montrachet and Tribeca Grill and is about to reopen Layla. "But when there is a business dinner now, they want to build the menu around price; before, price was no object."
Even thriving restaurants have adjusted. For Oceana, which just celebrated its 10th anniversary, business has never been better. "Our February this year is the best we've had," said Rick Moonen, the chef and a partner. "Out of a bad situation we tightened a lot of nuts and bolts we were not paying attention to. It's made us better managers."
Two months ago the restaurant began putting a nut mixture on the bar. The prix fixe dinner remains at $68, but an optional $30 supplement offers three glasses of wine.
The restaurant is not purchasing expensive wines, and it has made do with a smaller staff, things it thought very little about before 2001, Mr. Moonen said. And the linen supplier has agreed to hold off on an increase for six months. 
But prices have not been lowered. "If you do quality work, you need to hold steady," Mr. Moonen said, "and the people will come back."
Much of this is good news for patrons, who are getting more value for their money. At Union Pacific, Rocco DiSpirito, the chef and an owner, redecorated to make the restaurant's rather formal interior warmer and "less intimidating," he said. He also introduced a pre-6 p.m. menu with three courses for $45 and dropped a $12 supplement for the prime strip steak, adding it to the regular prix fixe menu, which has been at $65 for four years. 
And, Mr. DiSpirito said, "we started directing our waiters to bring a surprise to our guests by eavesdropping on what they were thinking about ordering but didn't, like wine or dessert."
"It's the way you stay alive in a competitive time," he added. 
At Mr. Palmer's restaurants, where business is off 4 or 5 percent, the staff has been instructed to be more careful. Glass breakage is down 15 percent; a change in linen suppliers is saving $2,000 a month. "And less people are getting the same work done," Mr. Palmer said.
Some sections of the city are still suffering, like Rockefeller Center, Little Italy, Chinatown and Wall Street. With fewer shows at Radio City Music Hall, there are fewer diners. Chez Louis at West 50th Street has drastically lowered prices. "January was the worst month of my life in the restaurant business," David Liederman, the owner, said. "February was pretty good because there were a lot of shows booked, but March was off 18 percent from a year ago. We have a second-floor lunch for $9.95 and it's only $2 more than McDonald's, and we have problems selling that."
Wall Street-area restaurants that say they were thriving before Sept. 11, like Vine and Bayard's, are off 15 to 20 percent. Delmonico's is down 25 percent, despite the fact that tourists are visiting ground zero.
While the new efficiencies are important, everyone comes back to the same reason for the healthy restaurant scene: the weather. "Usually for the first part of the year," Mr. Zagat said, "one day of three is generally lousy and you aren't going to go out at night. But the astonishingly good weather this winter helped. Whether the economy has turned or people are beginning to feel better, one thing is true: You didn't have snow on the ground and you didn't have to go through slush."

HEADLINE: And to Think That I Ate It on Clinton Street 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
NOT so long ago, Clinton Street on the Lower East Side was a grim, grafitti-ridden streetscape. By night, bags of heroin were sold by brand name, while prostitutes peddled their wares nearby. Things looked even worse, if possible, under daylight, which shone on Clinton Street like fluorescent lights on a hangover. 
 In a scant few years, though, Clinton Street has undergone the equivalent of a whole body transformation. Restaurants are now the reason to travel there, and the temptations offered for sale are chestnut gnocchi with braised rabbit and lamb spareribs with a fennel seed-coriander rub. 
 Clinton Street's evolution from drug bazaar to a lively Restaurant Row of the Lower East Side is perhaps only one more scene in New York's long-running revitalization show. Clinton Street is the latest in a series of streets -- most recently Smith Street in Boerum Hill and Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and Fifth Avenue in Park Slope -- where restaurants have led the way to more thriving local economies. 
But on Clinton Street, the transformation can be traced to the arrival of one small 30-seat restaurant, 71 Clinton Fresh Food, which opened in late 1999 near Rivington Street, a notorious drug intersection. Almost immediately, the precise and elegant flavor combinations of the chef, Wylie Dufresne, received critical raves. Within weeks, town cars and limousines were pulling up nightly, depositing patrons from all over the city and beyond. Fresh Food was the beginning. Now, barely two year later, young, attractive crowds flock to Clinton Street to eat on any given night.
The diners stop in at 1492, a noisy brick-walled restaurant, for traditional tapas, like whole grilled prawns seasoned only with sea salt, or dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped with bacon. They drop by Punch and Judy, a dark, romantic lounge where pinot noir or Chateauneuf-du-Pape is served in oversize glasses, the better to swirl and sniff, and the menu includes slices of smoked duck and lobster club sandwiches. At Alias, opened just a few weeks ago, smart-looking diners think little of stepping outside for a smoke -- the drug dealers are long gone. And everybody is awaiting WD50, Mr. Dufresne's new restaurant, to open this fall in a former bodega.
Even by day, a new liveliness is evident on the street. Practically next door to the imposing 1853 Romanesque Revival synagogue housing Congregation Chasam Sopher sits the Clinton St. Baking Company, where diners enjoy freshly baked blueberry muffins, omelets, fat biscuits and soups. Pedestrians stroll under blooming Callery pear trees, while older men sit on benches or play dominoes. Down the block, young people are filling aKa Cafe, perhaps for its signature sandwich of lamb's tongue with almond butter and currant jelly. Across the street, at Cibao, a venerable Dominican restaurant, a Spanish-speaking crowd tucks into chicharrones de pollo, chunks of crisp fried chicken, or downs cups of cafe con leche with plates of glistening flan.
"Clinton was out of it; it was really hard core," said Mark Federman, the third-generation owner of Russ & Daughters, a smoked fish store on Houston Street. "But once they put in 71 Clinton it started to turn."
Henry Hallivis, a neighborhood resident for 30 years and an owner of the building that houses Alias, was more blunt. "They put Clinton Street on the map," Mr. Hallivis said. "The change is unbelievable." 
Of course, Clinton Street was not transformed in a vacuum. The Lower East Side, once a gateway to opportunity for immigrants as well as a hotbed of radical disillusionment, began evolving into a hipster's paradise in the 1990's. Its tenements had, of course, more recently offered inexpensive if grim haven for artists, musicians and other urban pioneers.
In the late 1980's, bars and boutiques on Ludlow Street in particular and on nearby blocks of Stanton and Rivington Streets began to attract a college crowd, but Clinton Street remained largely unaffected by gentrification. Still, it was spiffed up in the 1990's with new sidewalks and the Callery pear trees. In 1997, the Lotus Cafe, by day a coffeehouse for the goatee and laptop set, by night a bar, was the one new touch.
"We're old school," Joe Manuse, an owner of Lotus, said of the cafe. "People come here for sandwiches and salads. They go down the block for cuisine."
 Since 71 Clinton opened, the changes in the neighborhood have been profound. Small shops and boutiques have popped up, and enterprising restaurateurs are hoping to capitalize on the excitement 71 Clinton has generated. Azul, a Mediterranean bistro, arrived in January at the corner of Suffolk and Stanton Streets, a block west of Clinton. Suba, a stylish subterranean restaurant and bar with French and Spanish accents, opened recently on a previously deserted section of Ludlow near Delancey Street. 
"I am a firm believer in upcoming areas," said Fernando Dallorso, who owns Azul with Stefano Villa. "It happened on Smith Street, it happened in SoHo, and the Lower East Side has a lot of potential and a lot of history."
Mr. Dallorso has done pretty well with that theory. He opened Novecento, an Argentine steakhouse in SoHo, more than a decade ago, and followed with Sur, another Argentine restaurant, just as Smith Street was taking off in 1998. 
"As soon as three or four restaurants do good, you get 15," Mr. Dallorso said. "Look at Smith Street."
Back in 1999, when Janet Nelson and her partners were building 71 Clinton, they were simply hoping for a successful neighborhood restaurant. Ms. Nelson -- who has been in the restaurant business for 20 years, involved with places like Tortilla Flats, Grange Hall and Global 33 -- has lived on Rivington Street for 17 years in a building owned by her sister Marybeth Nelson, a partner in Fresh Food. The building is also home to another sister, Susan Nelson, who helps manage the restaurant, and Dewey Dufresne, an original partner whose son, Wylie, happened to be a chef.
"I knew Wylie when he was a teenager," Janet Nelson said. "We thought we were going to be a neighborhood restaurant, but it evolved into a destination."
How could it be otherwise? Wylie Dufresne had spent seven years working for Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and dishes like black sea bass with a crust of crumbled edamame and tiny rye croutons immediately drew attention.
"He was a destination chef," said Michael Batterberry, the publisher of Food Arts magazine. 
The fact that he was on the Lower East Side, with its immigrant and artsy past, added to the attraction. "There's a reverse chic of wanting to be adventurous, eating in the ground floors of what were formerly appalling tenements," said Phillip Lopate, a literary critic and essayist. 
For restaurateurs, the attraction to the Lower East Side is not romance but rent, a barrier that for many young or independent entrepreneurs has become increasingly steep in Manhattan. The lure of cheaper rents drove restaurateurs to Brooklyn -- and to the Lower East Side.
"It's not just the rent; landlords want key money," said Allan Mannarelli, who builds and finances downtown restaurants. "You can't do Avenues B or C anymore because everything's taken. The Lower East Side has the lowest barrier of entry, with the highest upside."
Ms. Nelson and her partners used their contacts to get reasonable rents at two more spaces on Clinton Street. They opened aKa Cafe, a colorful, informal spot that successfully applies the 71 Clinton formula of exceptional ingredients and ambitious combinations to a sandwich and wine bar. A few weeks ago, they opened Alias. Without compromising on cuisine, it stakes out a middle ground between aKa and 71 Clinton, which Mr. Dufresne left in December. His sous-chef, Matt Reguin, is now in charge of the kitchen, while another alumnus, Scott Ehrlich, cooks at both aKa and Alias. 
Clinton Street restaurants have not been an unblemished success story. Sago, a Moroccan restaurant with belly dancers, did not hit the right note and closed, as did Lowly Lady, which had a backwoods theme that was perhaps too rustic for the neighborhood. Nonetheless, Mr. Dufresne's new restaurant, which he is opening with his father and with major-league partners, Phil Suarez and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, is keenly awaited.
WD50, with 65 seats, and 5,000 square feet, will be larger than 71 Clinton, aKa and Alias put together. "We got a very favorable deal," Dewey Dufresne said. "The smaller spaces have doubled in price." 
For Wylie Dufresne, the opportunity to have his own restaurant was irresistible. With construction not quite under way, it's also a chance to dream. "I very much want local people to come in, though I know it's not realistic," he said. "I want children to come in, and elderly people. I want everybody to feel at home."
Surprisingly, in a neighborhood undergoing turmoil and transformation, almost everybody seems pretty much at home. Many residents originally opposed 71 Clinton, fearing an onslaught of bars, noise and rowdy behavior, said Jose Rivera, head of the United Merchants of Clinton Street. "We started to work together, and everything has been quiet," he said.
Still, some people fear that in the long run Clinton Street will not benefit from its restaurants, that the out-of-the-neighborhood people will decamp for the next new thing.
"To saturate Clinton Street with restaurants that nobody can afford to eat in, it just destabilizes the neighborhood and creates constant turnover that's not healthy," said Clayton Patterson, a community advocate and longtime resident. 
Another looming issue is the direction of traffic on Clinton Street. In the mid-1990's, when construction on the Williamsburg Bridge began, traffic on Clinton Street was reversed so that it went north to south. Cars that formerly barreled off the bridge onto Delancey Street and headed north on Clinton were diverted, which Mr. Rivera said harmed longtime businesses, but also created a calm, tranquil block, with easy access from Houston Street. Mr. Rivera and others would like to restore the old traffic pattern, while Mr. Dufresne and other restaurant owners want to keep it as it is.
Nonetheless, Mr. Dufresne sounds as if he's in love with his culinary home.
"It's one of the few streets that's tree-lined," Mr. Dufresne said. "It's absolutely gorgeous, the flowers blooming. I'm really excited about Clinton Street. I'm going to be on that street for a long time to come."

To the Editor:
 Your "queasy feeling of slippage and lack of focus" ("Rebuilding Downtown," editorial, April 3), about efforts to revitalize portions of Lower Manhattan affected by terrorist attacks, should dissipate when considering the following accomplishments and prospects. 
 Almost 1.5 million tons of debris have been cleared from ground zero. 
Subway service will be restored on the Nos. 1 and 9 lines by December. A more integrated new downtown PATH station is scheduled for completion by the end of 2003.
New York secured the largest grant in federal HUD's history to retain and attract businesses south of 14th Street, and residential incentives have already played a part in slashing housing vacancy rates south of Chambers Street.
Rather than see the glass as half empty, it would be more accurate to recognize the speed and effectiveness with which public officials, civil servants and business leaders have responded to the worst disaster that New York has ever suffered.

HEADLINE: Tarrytown Immerses Latinos and the Native-Born 

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN, N.Y., April 9 

 BODY:
Onassis Tejada spoke no English when he arrived for his first day of high school in America, as a 17-year-old freshman. 
 Had Onassis, a native of the Dominican Republic, been entering a New York City school, chances are good he would have been put into a traditional bilingual program, in which he would be taught in Spanish and only gradually in English for perhaps the rest of his high school career. Had he been younger, he might have stayed in bilingual programs for seven years or more. 
 But here in the Tarrytown School District, which includes the villages of Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow and sits along the Hudson River in largely comfortable Westchester County, there is a move to put students like Onassis into regular classrooms as soon as possible. The process, known as mainstreaming, has become state law in California, and even New York City is offering parents more of a choice in whether they want to keep their children out of bilingual classes, in which they are taught largely in their native language. 
This district, which sent 85 percent of last year's graduates to college, has a lot at stake in its stand on the debate on how best to educate students like Onassis. This year, just over half the district's 2,367 students in elementary through high school are Hispanic, many of whom are immigrants. 
Marilyn Mercado-Belvin, the principal of the John Paulding School, all 191 of whose pupils are first graders, and the English-as-a-second-language chairwoman for students through sixth grade, said self-contained bilingual settings "are slightly artificial."
"We like to see the children much more integrated," she said. "We don't ignore the native language, and it's honored. But the goal is to move them toward English."
A faster, more immersed approach, school officials said, works better in teaching students English, which, Mrs. Mercado-Belvin said, is how they become members of the community. It also brings the children together socially before inappropriate perceptions become hardened, she said.
It also creates its own momentum, said Katharine St. Vincent, the E.S.L. chairwoman for 7th through 12th graders, who has been teaching in the district since 1971. "There's a competition to keep up," she said. "The students see movement and say why wait a year if I can do it faster?"
Similarly, at Sleepy Hollow High School, the principal, Carol L. Conklin, believes that as soon as students know a smattering of English they should be learning in English, not in their native languages. 
"If a student hasn't taken chemistry before and doesn't know chemistry terms in Spanish," Mrs. Conklin said, "we're going to teach it to them in English." 
This district's mainstreaming accelerated further with the arrival last year of a new superintendent, Howard Smith. 
Many critics, including many leaders of Hispanic organizations, disagree with rapid mainstreaming, asserting that immigrant students need to learn English gradually while learning subjects like history in a language they are comfortable in so they will not fall behind irretrievably. What is happening in suburban districts, they say, is the unwillingness of taxpayers to pay extra for bilingual programs, which benefit low-income immigrants. 
Mainstreaming is a political decision more than a pedagogical one, said Luis Reyes, an assistant professor of education at Brooklyn College who was formerly a member of the New York City Board of Education. 
Dr. Reyes said fast-track mainstreaming sent the wrong message to students, that "they have to subtract what they have in order to give to the community." 
In the 1970's and 1980's, when Tarrytown's program was much smaller, the school district did take a more traditionally bilingual approach, under which the subjects were taught in Spanish. But that was because a lot of the students were Cuban, Mrs. St. Vincent said, and they were expecting to return to their native land. 
Now the push is on to put students into regular English classes. New students are placed according to credits and abilities in a Transition 1 class, in which concepts will be explained in Spanish, if needed. Then they are moved to Transition 2 classes, in which "we don't lapse into Spanish words or phrases to explain," said Dr. Smith, the superintendent. 
When they are deemed able, students are moved on, even during the school year. When they are mainstreamed, they are periodically taken out of classes for tutorials. 
In the high school, there is also a resource room for English language learners, which is open all day and after school. Students come in for tutoring, to do computer work and to ask questions. Throughout the district, schedules are set up to allow students in Transition 1 and Transition 2 classes to take electives like gym, music and art in mainstream classes.
The scholastic results of the immigrant students have not been as good as those proficient in English. For the 94 students who entered the ninth grade in 1997 with English proficiency, 94 percent met graduation requirements by June 2001. But for the 23 students lacking English proficiency, only 39 percent met requirements. 
Supporters of mainstreaming argue that this is to be expected, given the longer time that American-born students have been learning in English. But such statistics are seized on by critics like Dr. Reyes. "A 55-point gap," he said, "is a tremendously unequal outcome."
But school officials point to some complexities behind the numbers. Many students, like Talita Oliveira, came from Brazil not speaking enough English, as she recalled, to ask to go to the bathroom. That was six years ago, when she was in the fifth grade. Now she is a junior and the vice president of the student body, and she is in the English-proficient group. 
Mrs. Mercado-Belvin stressed that their approach to non-English speaking students was a work in progress and should not be seen in fixed ideological terms. 
"The entire debate," she added, "has been a dilemma for me. Having grown up in a Lower East Side housing project and in the Bronx as the daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants, whose mother spoke no English and father died when she was young, I learned English in an all-English environment. But I saw others not as successful. It's just not a one-size-fits-all issue, and can never be." 
Tarrytown's approach could not have worked out better for Onassis Tejada. It has been two years since he arrived from the Dominican Republic. He plans to take English Regents, precalculus, advanced placement statistics, honors physics and honors economics next year, his senior year. 
Through it all, he has also worked at a local McDonald's after school until 11:30 p.m. to help support his family. When he comes home, he has dinner and then does his homework. 
"The E.S.L. teachers try to teach you as much English as they can," he said, saying that he expects to graduate next year and go to college to become an engineer. 
"Sometimes it gets difficult, but they just keep encouraging the kids not to give up. The thought comes to mind to quit, but they say, no, you have to do this."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: ORANGE COUNTY, N.Y.; 
At a Shoppers' Mecca, Now, Retail for Locals

BYLINE:  By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
If shopping is the great American pastime, then Exit 16 of the New York State Thruway in Orange County is becoming one of its shrines. 
 The site, around the intersection of Routes 17 and 32 and Route 6 about 60 miles north of New York City, is home to the enormously popular 220-store, 855,000-square-foot Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, where shoppers get discounts on designer names like Coach, Polo Ralph Lauren, Dolce & Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Versace. Now, just across the road from the outlet mall, a $34.5 million, 228,000-square-foot shopping center is rising that is to include a Kohl's department store, a Staples, a Linens 'n' Things, a Michaels Crafts, a Marty's Shoes, a T.G.I. Friday's and a Pizzeria Uno. 
 The 68-acre development, called Woodbury Centre, is scheduled to open in the fall. It is owned by Allied Partners, a Manhattan real estate investment and finance company. The development is more than 81 percent leased, and negotiations are under way to add a 22,612-square-foot bookstore, a 2,400-square-foot electronics store and other shops. 
"Woodbury Common across the street, on the other side of the Exit 16 off-ramp, is a destination center, where about 13 million people from all over New York, the country and the world go each year to discount shop," said Eric Hadar, the president of Allied. "The area around it is growing so fast, and we decided that there was an increasing demand for retail to serve the local community. So, rather than making Woodbury Centre an expansion of Woodbury Common, we decided to bring in retailers that would cater to the local residents."
Richard B. Kabat, a managing director of Faison, a real estate and shopping center development company that Allied retained to develop and lease the project, said studies determined that the area was underserved by retail. The studies, he said, showed that nearly 500,000 people, with an average annual household income of $85,851, lived within 15 miles of the site, and that more than 100,000 cars -- 72,000 on the Thruway and 36,000 on Routes 17 and 32 -- passed by every day. The center is also near a Wal-Mart Supercenter, a Home Depot and the site of a planned BJ's Wholesale Club. 
Mr. Hadar said Allied had decided not to have a Lord & Taylor or a Bloomingdale's-type store anchor the shopping center. "What's happening now, given the economy, is that discount retailers like Kohl's provide a perception of value," he said. "People flock to the Targets, the Kohl's, the Wal-Marts of the world. And we think these stores will do well no matter what happens to the economy." 
The question of whether the local market could support a retail shopping center, Mr. Hadar said, was answered "by the overwhelming success of the Wal-Mart and Home Depot stores, both of which opened in the last year."
"After the success of these stores became known," he said, "a lot of retailers came rushing to us who had originally had doubts about whether the immediate market was large enough."
Mr. Hadar said that Allied bought the land, which lies between Woodbury and Central Valley, N.Y., in early 2000 for $7.5 million. It took nearly a year and a half, he said, to get the necessary approvals for the shopping center from the town of Woodbury and from the Army Corps of Engineers. "We have 35 acres of wetlands," he said. "We had to get approval from the Corps of Engineers to remove two acres of wetlands on one part of the property and add back four acres on another." 
Mr. Kabat said that annual rents for smaller stores at Woodbury Centre would range from the low $20's to the mid-$30's a square foot, but that the rents for the anchor tenants were lower.
Mr. Hadar said that Woodbury had also approved a 150-room hotel on the site, but that no deal had been made. "We wanted to get the retail leased and built," he said, "and then focus on the hotel, which we believe will only benefit from the retail."
Mr. Kabat said that although Woodbury Centre is meant to cater to local residents rather than the tourists who visit Woodbury Commons, both he and Mr. Hadar were of course hoping to attract their fair share of outlet aficionados.
"We're not a high-fashion project, because there's so much of that at Woodbury Common," he said. "We wanted to make a statement of our own and make sure that our uses didn't duplicate what's across the street. But we think that the cross-shopping from that project to ours ought to be significant."

HEADLINE: Federal Study Calls Spending on Water Systems Perilously Inadequate 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Annual spending to maintain and expand water and sewage systems is lagging tens of billions of dollars behind what is needed to keep up with population growth and tightening health and pollution standards, federal environmental officials have found.
 A draft report by the Environmental Protection Agency says that by 2019 the accumulated gap between actual and necessary investments in these vital, but largely invisible, underpinnings of urbanized America is likely to exceed $650 billion. 
 The trend threatens to hinder urban economies as long-deferred costs for cleaning up water come due and to harm coastal waters and public health as water and sewage treatment capacity falls short, according to the analysis, which confirms studies by private groups. 
The problem remains hidden from view, partly because it is generally manifested as thousands of discrete local mini-disasters -- boil-water alerts, beach closings and the like.
The agency predicts more frequent water and sewage pipeline leaks and breaks, higher maintenance costs and a rise in coastal sewage pollution to levels not seen since the early 1970's. 
"The gap is at staggering levels," said Benjamin H. Grumbles, the deputy assistant administrator in the agency's office of water. "The real question is not what is the specific number, but focusing on what new approaches can be put together to move forward."
Because of leaks, water shortages during droughts like the one that has settled in along the East Coast will only get worse, other experts say. Chronic leaks in pipes already consume 20 percent of the water carried by many aging city supply systems, and every year more water mains crack or fail.
A copy of the draft was provided to The New York Times by a private group eager to point out that the Bush administration's proposed spending to help communities meet pollution limits does not come close to matching its own estimate of the costs of such improvements.
What is normally a stealth issue has surfaced now because Congress is finishing work this week on bills that would significantly increase federal money for water projects for the first time in many years.
Private environmental groups and engineering trade groups have been pointing to the spending gap for several years.
"With the exception of the interstate highway system, this is the largest public works infrastructure in this country, the biggest investment we've made in the 20th century," said Michael Charles, a lobbyist for the American Society of Civil Engineers, a private group representing 125,000 engineers. "And it's in real trouble. A lot of these aging facilities have outlived their design life and have to be replaced."
About 85 percent of spending on what amounts to society's circulatory system comes from local fees, the rest from federal loans and grants. But federal aid has been flat for years, pushing up local water and sewer rates and raising borrowing costs as local water utilities and municipalities try, and fail, to keep up. 
The problem, many experts say, cannot be solved only with added local user fees, because sharp increases would push rates so high that no one could pay them and urban economies would stall.
The Environmental Protection Agency report, which is being reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, comes as Congress considers increasing the federal money provided to state loan pools for water and sewer projects. 
The House subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials is holding a hearing on Thursday to examine problems with the nation's drinking-water supplies.
A bill being marked up this week by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee would, over five years, put $20 billion into state loan pools for sewer improvements and $15 billion for drinking water projects. In recent years, a total of about $2 billion annually has gone into the combined funds.
A House bill, focused on the sewage treatment problem, would provide $20 billion over five years.
But spending at these levels would still only nibble at the problem outlined by the E.P.A. and others. Private engineering and water quality groups have conducted independent analyses showing greater gaps. The Water Infrastructure Network, a coalition of local water and sewer officials and environmental groups, recently estimated the accumulated needs by 2020 at $1 trillion.
Not everyone agrees that the gap is insurmountable and will inevitably lead to trouble. Last year, Perry Beider, an analyst at the Congressional Budget Office, testified at a Congressional hearing that it was hard to predict long-term needs for wastewater and water systems because there was little hard data, particularly on the condition of underground pipelines. The lifetime of identical sections of iron pipe can be 20 years or 100 years, depending on conditions in the soil. 
Moreover, Mr. Beider said, expanded federal aid can backfire.
"A broad increase in federal funding aimed at keeping water and sewer rates affordable," he said, "could reduce the pressure on systems to operate more efficiently and on customers to economize on their use of water services." 
He noted that the cost per gallon of operating and maintaining sewage plants had declined slightly through better management. Over all, though, he agreed with industry experts that "drinking water and wastewater systems will require large investments over the next few decades."
The question of where the money will come from remains. Some people have suggested establishing a federal trust fund similar to the one that supports highway maintenance and construction. But the highway fund is replenished by gasoline taxes and other user fees. 
"There's no federal tax associated with toilets and faucets," Mr. Grumbles of the E.P.A. said.
Most federal spending on sewage treatment systems occurred in a burst after the Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972. Since then, the federal government has issued more than $77 billion in grants and loans that cities have used to upgrade plants to capture more pollution, bacteria and other threats. Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act in the mid-1990's led to similar loan pools for fixing water systems. 
But little federal money has flowed to help maintain those plants or build more, the E.P.A. report says, even as the country's population has grown sharply and become more urbanized. 
"People have an idea of the cost and needs of highways, subways, schools, but sewage treatment, water -- these things are invisible," said James T. B. Tripp, a lawyer for Environmental Defense, a private conservation group, and a member of the New York City Water Board, which sets water and sewer rates.
They are invisible, at least, until they fail. Examples abound: a 1998 water main break floods collections in the basement of the Boston Public Library; sewage spills in New Orleans close lake beaches and foul the Mississippi River and, after a settlement with the federal government, are costing the city $200 million to fix. In Los Angeles, according to a separate E.P.A. report, the health of swimmers is largely a function of the distance they keep from storm sewer outflows. 
Even with spending trailing needs, old and fast-growing cities are already seeing a rapid rise in water and sewer charges. Without more federal money, experts say, those charges will rise even more quickly.
New York City, for example, which for years had water and sewer charges that rose at most 1 percent or 2 percent annually, will have a 6.5 percent increase this year, Mr. Tripp said. 
Nationwide, the vast maze of buried water and waste pipelines is one of the biggest sources of trouble.
By 2016, the E.P.A. report projects, more than half of the country's sewer pipes will be in poor or very poor condition or broken. This would constitute an enormous rise from 2000, when only 8 percent of the estimated 600,000 miles of sewer lines were in poor shape or worse.
Adding to costs is the need to address newly appreciated health and pollution problems, Mr. Tripp said. These include hazards in drinking water, like arsenic and the intestinal parasite cryptosporidium, and substances that choke waterways, like nitrogen, a nutrient in runoff that saps oxygen and sparks algae blooms.
New York City, under a recent settlement with federal and state environmental agencies, has committed to spending up to $1.4 billion just to cut nitrogen releases from five sewage plants to improve conditions in Long Island Sound.
City environmental officials say 70 percent of the $7.5 billion in improvements planned for sewage plants and other water quality equipment over the next five years results from tightened federal rules -- but hardly any federal money is involved.
One way to reduce the gap would be to develop more efficient ways of improving treatment of waste and drinking water. Some techniques show promise, the E.P.A.'s Mr. Grumbles said, including harnessing more kinds of bacteria and plants to help capture contaminants.
But the new report notes that public and private research and development for water purification technologies are about half what they were in the boom years of the 1970's.
Water problems, meanwhile, are forcing change on communities where growth has outpaced planning. In Georgia, longstanding pollution from storm runoff and sewage lines led to an order from a federal judge that could, if certain deadlines are not met, halt the writing of new discharge permits for wastewater -- in essence halting growth.
Joel H. Cowan, the developer of the Atlanta area's giant Peachtree City community, was appointed by the governor last year to lead a new water planning commission for the region that is trying to figure out how to fix what he calls "sins past."
"We never thought we had a geographic limit or a resource limit for growth," Mr. Cowan said. "Now we don't have a choice."

HEADLINE: Roadway Reports a Loss 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio,April 9 

 BODY:
The trucking group Roadway Corporation said today that it had a loss in its fiscal first quarter as shipping volumes sapped by the recession touched a low not seen since 1987. 
 The company, based in Akron, posted a loss of $1.7 million, or 9 cents a share, for the period ended March 23. 
Roadway reported a profit of $5 million, or 26 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues fell 2 percent, to $637.2 million from $650.5 million, the company said. 
 "In the first four weeks of January," said Michael W. Wickham, Roadway's chief executive, "daily tonnage levels at Roadway Express, our largest operating unit, were 18 percent below the same period last year, and at their lowest point in 15 years." He said business was slowly improving through early April.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LAWYER; 
A Persistent Defender, Even in a Mets Cap

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
Among her peers, Lynne F. Stewart is known as a dogged lawyer, a left-wing radical at heart and a veteran soldier of the city's defense bar who is as willing to take on unpopular clients as she is to carry purple tote bags and wear New York Mets caps into court.
 Now add to that the description of her offered by federal prosecutors: a lawyer who entered into a criminal conspiracy with Islamic terrorists in New York. 
 Yesterday, Ms. Stewart was charged with helping one of her jailed clients, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, send messages to the Islamic Group, a fundamentalist terrorist organization based in Egypt. Mr. Abdel Rahman is the militant Muslim cleric who was convicted of leading the conspiracy that prosecutors say included the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and aborted plots to blow up the United Nations and the Hudson River tunnels. 
For nearly 40 years, Ms. Stewart, 62, has made her living representing a rogues' gallery of characters that included David J. Gilbert, the Weather Underground member who was found guilty in the 1981 Brink's armored car robbery in Rockland County, and Larry Davis, the Bronx man accused -- and later acquitted -- of trying to kill nine police officers in a 1986 shootout. She is currently the lead lawyer for Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia hit man turned informer, who is about to be sentenced in Brooklyn on drug-trafficking charges.
In 1999, Ms. Stewart pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal contempt for refusing a court order to explain fee arrangements she had made with a client who was a Lower East Side drug gang member.
"Lynne is a zealous advocate and a proud defender of the oppressed all over the world," said Ronald L. Kuby, a lawyer who has known her for years. "She was always there at any time of night when the police or the F.B.I. were kicking in someone's door, and as a distinguished member of the New York bar, those of us who know her find these allegations to be unbelievable and politically motivated."
In an interview with The New York Times in 1995, while she was defending Mr. Abdel Rahman, Ms. Stewart suggested that violence and revolution were sometimes necessary to right the economic and racial wrongs of America's capitalist system. "I don't believe in anarchistic violence but in directed violence," she said. "That would be violence directed at the institutions which perpetuate capitalism, racism and sexism, and at the people who are the appointed guardians of those institutions, and accompanied by popular support."
Still, Ms. Stewart's supporters said they found the charges against her ridiculous.
"She's a person who is extraordinarily skillful with extraordinary courage and principle," said Frederick H. Cohen, who represented one of the defendants in the recent trial that stemmed from the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa in 1998. "Without being fully familiar with the charges, I think it would be unlikely she would do such a thing."
Dozens of defense lawyers packed a courtroom in United States District Court in Manhattan yesterday to show support for Ms. Stewart during her arraignment. The lawyers were mostly quiet during the proceedings, but there were a few audible gasps and whispers of outrage when Ms. Stewart's bail was set at $500,000.
"The Justice Department has been overreaching a lot lately," said Robert Perry, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights who was sitting in the second row. He said he had heard about the arraignment from colleagues, and had shown up because "it sounded strange, even outrageous, to arrest a lawyer" on such charges.
Ms. Stewart hardly seems the stereotype of a lawyer with such incendiary clients and beliefs. She is tiny and round-faced with the slightly owlish manner of a high-school art teacher. She rarely wears flashy clothing, preferring smocklike dresses and sensible shoes. Her courtroom style combines an inbred skepticism of the government with heavy doses of pleasantly delivered sarcasm.
Ms. Stewart, raised in Queens as the daughter of schoolteachers, worked in the poverty and squalor of Harlem as a librarian and teacher in the 1960's.
"I said, 'Why are all these people living in these conditions? I wouldn't,' " she told The Times seven years ago. "My answer was, 'Because they're kept here and society had an interest in keeping them here.' "

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: REGIONAL TIES; 
With a Word, Israeli-Turkish Strain Surfaces

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, April 9 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey told a gathering of his political party last week that Israel's military raids into the West Bank were genocide.
 Israel might have ignored the statement had it come from another Muslim leader, but Turkey is Israel's best friend in the region. So Mr. Ecevit's choice of words set off protests that heightened strains in a relationship of strategic importance to both countries and to the United States. 
 "We have some common interests in the Middle East, but whether we can sustain the relationship with what is happening now in Palestine is a question," Ilter Turkmen, a retired Turkish diplomat and foreign minister, said today.
Pro-Islamic politicians in the opposition have called for a re-evaluation of Turkey's ties with Israel, and mainstream politicians and newspapers have joined in condemning what they describe as Israeli aggression.
As much as Turkish politicians may want to criticize Israel, however, they are restricted by deep military and economic bonds. While other governments in the region have kept Israel at arm's length, the Turks have embraced it.
Turkey recently awarded Israel a $670 million contract to modernize 170 M-60 tanks. Israel already was upgrading Turkish warplanes in a deal worth nearly $1 billion. Turkey also provides airspace for Israeli military exercises, and the countries share intelligence and military technology.
Bilateral trade topped $1 billion last year, and long-running negotiations are continuing for Turkey to sell Israel $50 million to $75 million worth of water annually. Israelis are among the most numerous tourists on Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
"We live in the same region, and we face the same reality," said David Sultan, Israel's ambassador to Turkey.
The friendship has multiplied Turkey's influence in Washington. The pro-Israeli lobby argued Turkey's case for increased international financial aid. American Jewish organizations have lobbied on Turkey's behalf against attempts by Armenian-Americans to have the killing of Armenians between 1915 and 1921 in Turkey declared a genocide.
"We have put a lot of effort in on behalf of Turkey," said Barry Jacobs, director of strategic studies in Washington for the American Jewish Committee. So his organization and other American Jewish groups were stung and angered when Mr. Ecevit said at a party meeting in Ankara that "genocide is being committed" against the Palestinians.
Nine organizations, including B'nai B'rith and the Anti-Defamation League, fired off a letter telling the Turkish leader that his remark was "absolutely wrong as fact and offensive as comment." Israel also lodged diplomatic complaints.
The next day, Mr. Ecevit downplayed his statement, saying his words only reflected concerns felt in the region and Turkey.
Other Turkish officials hurried to repair the damage by assuring Israeli and American diplomats that Turkey's basic policy remained unchanged. 
"Turkey's relations with Israel are based on sound foundations," a senior Turkish government official said today. "We believe these relations will play an important role in ensuring peace in the region."
The Israelis had no desire to fan the flames either. Mr. Sultan said Israel was satisfied with Mr. Ecevit's clarification.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Greed Kills Fish by the Seaful 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: BAHIA DE LOBOS, Mexico, April 5 

 BODY:
The fishermen set out before dawn from this dirt-poor town to the Gulf of California. They returned with seven crabs and a baby shark.
 "There just aren't any fish anymore," said Teresa Lopez, 39, a villager. "Less and less every year for many years. Now we haven't enough to eat." 
 Greed and corruption are draining the gulf, also known as the Sea of Cortes. It is not dead yet, but it is exhausted. 
American and Japanese ships were the first to exploit it. Now fleets of Mexican fishermen, mostly unlicensed and ungoverned, are taking whatever they can, as fast as they can, for American and Asian markets. Every important species of fish in the sea is in sharp decline, fishermen and marine scientists say.
"Too many fishermen and not enough fish," said Pedro Alvarez, pulling tiny mullet from his net near the city of Guaymas.
Overfishing is a global problem. People are taking marine life faster than it can reproduce. The world's catch peaked at 86 million tons in 1989, up fourfold in 50 years. 
But many governments, including the United States, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and China, kept on pouring subsidies into commercial fishing fleets to keep them afloat.
Crucial fisheries have collapsed worldwide.
"We have an endowment in the bank, and we're spending it all instead of living off the interest," said Juan Manuel Garcia Caudillo, a Guaymas conservationist trying to protect the Gulf of California.
This, the world's youngest sea, created when the San Andreas fault split Mexico millions of years ago and let the Pacific pour in, is home to 875 species of fish and 30 species of marine mammals. They have been killed indiscriminately for years.
"The philosophy is: get it now; grab it -- if I don't, the next guy will," said Juan Pablo Gallo, a marine biologist in Guaymas who has recorded steep declines in sea lion populations and has found DDT residues among dolphins in the gulf.
Some say the trouble began when the United States started damming and diverting the Colorado River in the 1930's. The river that carved the Grand Canyon became a bare trickle at its Mexican mouth, turning the gulf's biggest estuary, a bountiful breeding ground, into a dried-up delta.
Before and after World War II, American ships took every school of tuna and every swarm of sardines they could, along with sea lions for pet food and sharks to use the livers to remedy iron-poor "tired blood." The Japanese came too, "destroying the ecological balance of the whole region," John Steinbeck wrote in 1940. 
The foreign boats, many buying permits and government concessions with bribes, worked the gulf hard until the catch started plummeting about a decade ago.
Then the great divide between Mexico's laws and its law enforcement began taking its toll. In 1992, President Carlos Salinas, fighting for the free-trade agreement with the United States, essentially deregulated Mexican commercial fishing without creating an effective system of licensing and permits.
"The political mistakes of past governments had a terrible effect," said Otto Clausen, the federal environmental protection officer for the state of Sonora, which is bordered on the west by the gulf. "The economic development strategy was wrong. It broke all authority over fishing."
Jeronimo Ramos, the national fisheries commissioner, is based in Mexico City. He said about 1,200 permits existed for boats in the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean, estimating that 20 to 30 percent of the catch was being taken illegally.
Leon Tissot of Mexico's National Fishing Industry Council says that "there is an illegal traffic in permits." Fishermen say permits are bought under the table, sold and resold, ignored with impunity.
"The laws are totally clear, and their application is totally cloudy," said Felipe Rodriguez, a scientist working with the fishermen of the Seri Indian tribe.
Fishermen, businessmen, scientists and even some federal officials say at least 12,000 unregulated fishing boats, probably more, now are at large in the gulf, a number that doubled in the last decade.
"It's the law of the jungle out there," said Luis Bourillon, a marine biologist in Guaymas. "You can do anything you want."
The unregulated boats, whose crews include thousands of men who came to the coast in the 1990's looking for a living, set gill nets, nylon webs banned by many nations as a barbaric and indiscriminate form of fishing, but not in Mexico. More than 1,000 miles of gill nets were sold in Sonora last year.
Gill nets trap everything: endangered sea turtles, sea lions, even the vaquita, a rare porpoise on the edge of extinction. They take so many sailfish, tuna and marlins that the rich American sports fishermen who considered the gulf a paradise are staying home -- another drain on the local economy.
A gill net fleet backed by unknown financiers appeared seven years ago in Sonora. Fishermen and scientists say it slaughters thousands of sharks solely for their fins, which when dried sell for as much as $300 a pound in Asian markets.
The fishing boats also play out long lines, each with hundreds of baited hooks, reaching for miles. The long-liners land as much as 20 tons a day of dorado, sold as mahi-mahi, in the port of Guaymas alone, along with unrecorded illegal catches like sea turtles, which can sell for as much as $200 apiece in Mexican black markets.
The high price of turtle meat and shark fins, founded on male folklore long predating Viagra, spurs the fleet.
The shrimp fleet wreaks its own separate havoc. Shrimping throughout the world uses bottom-scraping dragnets that haul up 10 pounds of life -- often young fish too small to sell -- for every pound of shrimp, like gathering wild mushrooms with a bulldozer.
Underwater, "one day there's all kinds of fish, crab, octopus, maybe a turtle, and the next day it's empty, nothing but rocks and a sandy bottom," said Feliza Rios, a scuba diving instructor in San Carlos who has seen the effect at first hand. "It takes years, many years, to come back."
Discarded shrimp nets do more damage: one strangled three whales last week.
A pound of Mexican shrimp sells for $16 or more in American markets, and though Mexico no longer directly subsidizes shrimp boats, it underwrites the fleet through a quasi-governmental, California-based corporation called Ocean Gardens, which buys half of its catch. So the shrimpers work the sea floor as hard as they can.
Recognition is now dawning that if nothing changes, "in a few years, you could end up without any fish in the sea," said Victor Lichtinger, Mexico's environmental minister.
Change may begin with the Mexican government observing its own laws.
"We have to prevent the sales of permits under the table," said Juan Carlos Barrera, the World Wildlife Fund's representative in Sonora. "The answer is zero tolerance for corruption. If we do nothing, we'll kill the sea."
The Mexican Navy has standing orders to police the outlaws by chasing them from the sea. If not, fishing villages may take the law into their own hands. The Seri Indians, Mexico's smallest tribe, already have.
At gunpoint, they guard the waters around their fishing village, Punta Chueca, barring outsiders or demanding tribute in the form of shrimp or money. The other afternoon, their boats came back with a bushel of scallops, a peck of crabs and a giant manta ray, a haul that meant the difference between subsistence and the near-starvation stalking Bahia de Lobos.
The sea can revive if overfished areas are given a rest. But as Josefina Molina, a 45-year-old Seri woman in Punta Chueca, said, "If the sea takes a siesta, how are the people going to eat?"

HEADLINE: Minor League Ballpark Planned for Yonkers 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: YONKERS, April 9 

 BODY:
City officials announced a plan today to build a $25 million baseball stadium in downtown Yonkers that would anchor their redevelopment efforts.
 The proposed 6,500-seat stadium would serve as the home for a new minor-league baseball team in the Atlantic League, and would include amenities like two dozen luxury skyboxes, concession stands and roughly 100,000 square feet of space for restaurants, pubs and stores. It could break ground as soon as this fall, and would take eight months to a year to complete, city officials said. 
 "We have a lot of families and children, and this is great entertainment for them at reasonable prices," said Phil Amicone, the deputy mayor.
The stadium is the culmination of more than two years of negotiations between city officials and Mary-Jane Foster and her husband, Jack McGregor, who helped found the Bridgeport Bluefish in Bridgeport, Conn. The Bluefish are one of eight baseball teams that play in the Atlantic League, an independent group that was started in 1998. 
League teams include the Newark Bears and the Camden Riversharks, both in New Jersey, and the Long Island Ducks in Suffolk County.
Ms. Foster said the stadium would benefit existing businesses and draw new ones to downtown. She said she planned to hold a local contest to find a name for the new Yonkers team, and to start drafting players as early as next spring. 
"It's really, really a jump-start for downtown Yonkers," Ms. Foster said. "And it will give life to the ballpark 12 months of the year. We're very excited about the Yonkers and Westchester market."
Under the city's plan, the stadium would be built on a 12-acre site adjoining Getty Square that is now occupied by a city-owned parking lot and 19 businesses, including a restaurant, a bakery and several stores. The city owns more than three-quarters of the land and plans to buy the rest or, if necessary, seize it by eminent domain, city officials said.
Mr. Amicone said city officials had begun meeting with many of the store owners at the site and planned to help them move. "They're concerned, but nobody has said they won't move," he said.
The estimated $25 million to $30 million cost of the stadium would be partly offset by revenues from the baseball team, which would lease the stadium, and from the businesses that rent space in the stadium. 
Mr. Amicone said the rest of the money would come from a mixture of the city's nontax revenue sources, state development grants and private investors. Though he declined to give details, he emphasized that the city would not raise taxes or sell bonds to help pay for the stadium.
Last year, Yonkers officials commissioned a feasibility study for a baseball team that suggested seven potential sites for a stadium, including the waterfront, Tibbetts Brook Park and Yonkers Raceway. Mr. Amicone said city officials narrowed the choices to one based on factors like accessibility and economic impact.

HEADLINE: A Surge in Asbestos Suits, Many by HealthyPlaintiffs 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Decades after American companies largely stopped using asbestos, a wave of asbestos-related lawsuits is again flooding the nation's courts.
 The suits, once filed mainly against shipbuilders, makers of asbestos and companies in a few other industries, now touch thousands of companies. In the last two years, they have forced at least 18 companies, with more than 100,000 employees, into bankruptcy protection. 
 Exposure to asbestos has plunged since the 1970's, and the number of new cases of asbestos-related disease has been falling, doctors say. Very few new plaintiffs have serious injuries, even their lawyers acknowledge. But at least 90,000 new claims were filed last year. If the trend continues, as many as 2.5 million people could file asbestos-related suits before the litigation begins to fade around 2030. 
Many companies now facing asbestos lawsuits did not make asbestos or use it heavily in their products. They have been sued because more obvious defendants have already filed for bankruptcy protection and are protected from large verdicts.
Wall Street has grown uneasy that even profitable giants like Dow Chemical, which had $27 billion in sales last year, could struggle with claims for years. The National Association of Manufacturers calls asbestos a top priority, along with taxes, trade and energy.
Among the companies that have lost multimillion-dollar judgments since last fall are Dow, Halliburton and 3M. Viacom reported 106,000 claims at the end of the year related to its one-time ownership of Westinghouse, and the big automakers are so worried that they have hired the lawyer who successfully represented Dow Corning in its breast-implant litigation.
"We've got a lot of people who have claims," said Stephen Carroll, a senior economist at the Rand Institute for Civil Justice who has studied asbestos litigation. "It's going to take a lot of money to settle those claims, and we are beginning to run out of people who are rather clearly and distinctly culpable to charge."
New claims have steadily increased since 1997, when the Supreme Court struck down a class-action settlement between asbestos defendants and lawyers for plaintiffs. The settlement would have prevented most people exposed to asbestos from filing lawsuits unless they became sick. The court said the settlement was unfair to future claimants, who would be forced to abide by its terms even though they had not agreed to it.
Plaintiffs' lawyers, who typically receive 25 percent to 40 percent of a settlement, routinely set up mass screenings for union members and other workers who might have been exposed to asbestos. The screenings often turn up moderate lung damage consistent with asbestosis, or asbestos-related lung disease. Lung damage, however, is common in people over 50, especially among smokers.
John Dement, an associate professor for environmental and occupational medicine at Duke University and the former deputy director for lung disease research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said there were far fewer cases of serious asbestosis today than 5 to 10 years ago.
"What we're seeing right now is the downswing," Dr. Dement said. 
Lawyers for the companies being sued, along with independent experts and some lawyers who represent only seriously ill plaintiffs, say most suits are baseless and an abuse of the courts.
"Sick people with legitimate claims represent a tiny fraction of the claims being brought," said Lester Brickman, a law professor at Yeshiva University who has studied the issue. (Mr. Brickman said he had not consulted for either side in the litigation for more than a decade, although he was briefly hired by the Keene Corporation, an asbestos defendant, in 1989.)
Steven Kazan, a lawyer who represents only plaintiffs with mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure, and lung cancer, dismissed the suits by healthy plaintiffs. "The overwhelming majority of these cases," Mr. Kazan said, "are brought by people who have no impairment whatsoever."
Lawyers who represent unimpaired plaintiffs say their clients have been hurt by asbestos and deserve compensation, even if they are not ill. 
Plaintiffs should have a chance to make their cases in court, said Perry Weitz, a partner at Weitz & Luxenberg, which represents 25,000 plaintiffs, including some who have asbestos-related cancers.
"Juries throughout the United States have said that these people deserve compensation," Mr. Weitz said. "You really have to have faith in the jury system."
In the next few weeks, legislation that would delay lawsuits from healthy plaintiffs is expected to be introduced in Congress, with the support of the Asbestos Alliance, a group that includes manufacturers and some plaintiffs' lawyers. Previous efforts to tighten the rules for asbestos suits have foundered, and organized labor, whose support may be crucial for any legislation, has not indicated whether it will back this bill.
Determining how many asbestos suits have been filed or how much companies have spent to resolve them is difficult. Cases are filed in state and federal courts, and many companies do not disclose their spending on settlements.
But American companies and insurers have spent well over $30 billion to defend and settle asbestos lawsuits. United States insurers alone had spent $22 billion by the end of 2000 to resolve claims, according to A. M. Best, an insurance industry analyst. With the number of claims growing, and jury verdicts for cancerous and noncancerous claims soaring, those figures will skyrocket, according to Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an actuarial firm that has studied the issue. Tillinghast projects that the total costs of asbestos suits will be about $200 billion; some other estimates top $250 billion.
Companies and their lawyers say that the plaintiffs' lawyers bundle a few cases of asbestos-related cancer with hundreds or thousands of claims of asbestosis. Then they file the claims in courts in Mississippi, east Texas and other jurisdictions where juries have a history of being friendly to plaintiffs. Almost any company that made a product containing asbestos can be included in a claim, as long as the plaintiff can show that it may have been used at a place where the plaintiff worked. As a result, many claims name 50 or more defendants.
Companies are almost forced into settlements, said Stan Ferguson, general counsel of the USG Corporation, which makes wallboard and other building materials. USG filed for bankruptcy protection in June of last year after being named as defendant in about 50,000 lawsuits in each of the two previous years.
"Let's say you want to defend every case -- $5,000 a case, $10,000 a case -- that's $250 million or $500 million in legal fees a year," Mr. Ferguson said. Instead, USG settled its share of cases, paying $1,000 or more for each uninjured defendant.
"There's a tremendous temptation to try to outrun the problem," he said. But if companies become known as willing to settle, they face more and more claims, driving up their costs.
On the other hand, trying to fight cases is nearly impossible, Mr. Ferguson said. People who do not have cancer, or even serious asbestosis, have won multimillion-dollar verdicts in the last year in Mississippi and Texas. In those cases, the plaintiffs have claimed that they have an increased fear of cancer as a result of exposure, as well as an inability to exercise or other minor symptoms.
USG lost a $36 million verdict in Texas last year in a case where the plaintiffs were not sick. "When you face something like that," Mr. Ferguson said, "and you've got another 100,000 in the pipeline, you think this is crazy, and we can't keep doing this."
The companies that file for bankruptcy protection are automatically excused from lawsuits against them. (By filing for bankruptcy, the companies essentially agree to pledge most or all of their equity -- their assets, less their debts -- to a trust that will be used to pay off asbestos claims. Though the companies continue to operate, they often have trouble getting loans or expanding and some have had to cut their work force to save cash. Their current shareholders are left with little or nothing. In return, the companies receive permanent protection from asbestos lawsuits.)
As more companies file for bankruptcy protection, the burden of lawsuits on those that remain grows heavier, since they must pay a bigger percentage of any judgments.
"Asbestos litigation has turned into a search for the solvent bystander," said David Bernick, who represents W. R. Grace, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April of last year. Mr. Bernick, who was the architect of Dow Corning's strategy in defending itself from breast implant lawsuits, is also representing Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler.
The eventual impact of the suits on corporate giants like General Electric is uncertain. Many big companies, including G.E., do not disclose how many suits they face or how much they have spent to settle them. For those that do, including Viacom, the cost of settling lawsuits appears manageable. Viacom, which had $23 billion in sales last year, said it had spent $21 million after taxes to settle suits.
But other companies have been stung. Halliburton, which faced 274,000 claims at the end of 2001, suffered a plunge in its stock in December after a series of multimillion-dollar verdicts. In a regulatory filing this year, Halliburton said it had raised its estimate of its asbestos liability by $650 million last year and expected to raise it further in 2002. The stock has since regained some of its losses.
As concern over the verdicts against Halliburton spread, Wall Street punished the stocks of big companies with potential asbestos liabilities. Dow, Viacom and 3M all briefly plunged in January, though they have recovered.
Wall Street may be underestimating the problem, said Graham Copley, a research analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Mr. Copley estimated in January that asbestos liabilities for Dow Chemical probably ranged from $1 billion to $5.5 billion. For Dow, which has a stock market value of $29 billion, the burden is significant but manageable, Mr. Copley said.
But he warned that investors in Dow should be aware that asbestos liabilities seem only to get worse.
"If you look at the history of asbestos, there's never been a good investment story from a company that's been tainted with asbestos," Mr. Copley said. "There's a very large potential class of claimants. If anything, I would say Wall Street may be underreacting."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 11, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about an increase in the number of asbestos lawsuits erroneously included Dow Chemical among those that have lost multimillion-dollar judgments since last fall. Dow has not lost a multimillion-dollar verdict, but it said in a filing with regulators last month that in 2001 Union Carbide, which it acquired in February 2001, had raised its estimate of the amount it could be liable for in asbestos cases by $115 million, to $233 million.

HEADLINE: Lawsuit in California Asks, Whose Tribe Is It, Anyway? 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: IONE, Calif., April 4 

 BODY:
The Me-Wuk Indians disappeared from this part of the Sierra Nevada foothills not long after people began scraping gold from the streams and charging a day's wages for whiskey. They left without much of a trace 150 years ago, leaving a land that would be known for Zinfandel and long weekends. 
 But now the Buena Vista Me-Wuks have reappeared -- at least on paper -- and are going after a mother lode of their own: a $150 million casino and resort on a cow pasture 35 miles from Sacramento. The casino has been approved, and construction was to start this month. 
 The only problem is, the group calling itself the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians are not who they say they are, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. That group consists of a 58-year-old woman, Donnamarie Potts, and her two adult children -- none of whom, the bureau recently concluded, have any blood lineage to the little band of people long ago recognized as the Buena Vista Me-Wuks. 
Indeed, Ms. Potts is being challenged by another woman who says she is the last surviving member of the tribe.
This creates a problem. As a federally recognized tribe, the Buena Vista Me-Wuks may be a sovereign Indian nation, but for now they are a nation without people. A federal district judge issued the latest injunction last month, halting the casino's construction until the government can figure out who -- if anybody -- is a rightful member of the tribe. 
There is good reason to want to be a Me-Wuk. As with other tribes across the country, the right heritage can be worth a fortune in gambling revenue, particularly in California. 
With 108 federally recognized tribes, and 46 Indian casinos, California has more Indian nations and brings in more tribal gambling revenue than any other state and, in fact, the entire Northeast. 
By 2004, about a third of the $15 billion made nationwide by tribal gambling will come from California, industry analysts say, even though Indians constitute only a tiny percentage of the state's population. That growth, some forecasters say, may mean that California could eclipse Nevada, which generates about $10 billion a year in gambling revenue, by the end of the decade.
For the most part, California's tribes are nothing but small, extended family groups living on a few acres, called rancherias. One tribe, the Sheep Ranch Sierra Rancheria, consists of an elderly man living on less than an acre. Another, the Augustine Band of the Coachella Mission Indians, is a single mother living in a trailer in the desert. Both have plans to build casinos, and both may grow their tribal populations.
When tribes like these are reconstituted as nations seeking gambling compacts, the fights can sometimes amount to one lost cousin battling another, with billions of dollars at stake. The willingness of outside investors and large corporations to finance the tribal ventures can further inflame the situation.
For this reason, critics say that tiny tribes are vulnerable to exploitation. 
"You're talking about one or two people using the shield of tribal sovereignty to promote gambling that otherwise would never be allowed in these areas," said Cheryle Schmit, director of Stand Up for California, a Sacramento-area group fighting the expansion of Indian casinos.
Tribes disagree, saying that the economic renaissance that has come with legal gambling should not be denied California Indians simply because the tribal units are small. 
"The reason some of these tribes have only one or two people left is because Indians were exterminated -- that was the intent of the State of California," said Susan Jensen, a spokeswoman for the California Nations Indian Gaming Association, which represents tribal casinos.
The Buena Vista casino would be one of the biggest, and one of the closest to a large population center -- an hour from Sacramento, a few hours' drive from the Bay Area. 
The Indian land is a 67-acre rectangle of rock, oak, pine and grass on a rise just across the road from the rusting detritus of an abandoned coal mine. Wood stakes mark the boundaries of the proposed casino. 
It seems an unlikely place for a resort. But a similar lonely dell, just up the road near the Gold Rush towns of Sutter Creek and Jackson, was transformed into the modern version of a gold mine a few years ago by the small Jackson Rancheria. Now, buses roll into the Jackson casino, and its parking lot is so full at midday that people have to take a shuttle to the entrance. 
Before the latest injunction on the Buena Vista project was issued in March, the Cascade Entertainment Group, a Louisiana-based corporation, had already sunk more than $10 million into the project on behalf of the family that calls itself the last of the Buena Vista Me-Wuks. 
Like other small tribes, the Buena Vista Me-Wuks were given a parcel of land by the federal government in the early 1900's. On this land in Amador County lived the Oliver clan, led by Louie Oliver, and they called it the Buena Vista. It was a hardscabble life of raising pigs, chickens and a few head of cattle.
In the late 1950's, as part of a government initiative to take trust status away from the tribes, the Me-Wuks were officially terminated, as were other rancherias.
The property was transferred from tribal ownership to private ownership -- to the Olivers. Their three children held the land until 1983, when the tribe's status was restored as part of a lawsuit on behalf of numerous small tribes. 
The families drifted away, and by the 1990's, only one Oliver descendant was living on the land, Lucille Oliver Lucero. She was joined by Donnamarie Potts, a niece by marriage. The two formed a tribal government. When Mrs. Lucero died, she left the land to Ms. Potts, who then formed a tribal government with her two grown children, and won recognition from the Interior Department as the tribal leader. 
It was not until casino plans were announced two years ago that another woman came forth, claiming to be the great-granddaughter of Louie Oliver, an assertion that the Bureau of Indian Affairs supported in its most recent ruling. The woman, Rhonda Morningstar Pope, said her father, who died of a gunshot wound when she was 4, and other relatives were buried on the Buena Vista rancheria. 
She opposed building a large casino. It was her lawsuit, saying the Indian nation had been stolen from her family, which led to the court injunction. 
To support her claim, Ms. Pope's lawyers produced birth certificates showing that Ms. Potts -- the woman who claimed to be the last of the Buena Vista Me-Wuks -- was the daughter of a Hispanic woman and an Indian man from another tribe. They also produced evidence that Ms. Potts had tried to join another tribe, the Maidu. 
In her defense, Ms. Potts said that she was the illegitimate daughter of an Oliver descendant and that her birth certificate was misleading.
"I am frankly uncertain about the circumstances of my birth," Ms. Potts said in an affidavit. Neither Ms. Potts nor her lawyers returned telephone calls requesting comment. 
But a spokeswoman for Ms. Potts, Jean Munoz, said that blood lineage was irrelevant in determining the rightful Buena Vista Me-Wuks. She said Donnamarie Potts had lived much of her life on the land and was brought into the tribe legally by the late descendant of an Oliver. Ms. Potts is the only tribal member who lives on the rancheria, Ms. Munoz said; the two adult children, listed as members, live elsewhere. 
Ms. Munoz also questioned the timing of Ms. Pope's lawsuit. "Rhonda Pope had no interest in becoming a member of the tribe until the casino was announced," she said. 
Ms. Pope's lawyer, Timothy Grieve, said his client wanted to restore her family's claim to the sliver of ground the government gave the Olivers a century ago. 
"She wants her heritage back for herself and her children," Mr. Grieve said. "She wants to be able to be on the land where her family is buried."
When asked if Ms. Pope -- should she win control of the Buena Vista Rancheria -- planned a casino of her own, Mr. Grieve said he did not know.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
What's in a Name? For Ritz-Carlton, About 25%

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
"We're not hoteliers," said Christopher M. Jeffries, a founding partner of Millennium Partners. It seems a peculiar claim for a developer who is building eight hotels across the country, including a new Ritz-Carlton in this city, which has long been synonymous with that hyphenated name.
 But a bed check bears him out. While there are 193 transient rooms at the six-month-old, $500 million Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Towers, a pair of angular high-rise bookends on the Boston Common, there are 304 condominium apartments. Priced around $900 a square foot, they use Ritz-Carlton services and trade on its reputation and lion's head logo. Half have been sold. 
 Despite a difficult seven months since Sept. 11, Millennium is taking the branding idea a step further. It is building a $155 million, 17-story, 220-apartment tower that will carry a hotel name and offer hotel amenities like room service, housekeeping and a health club, but have no overnight accommodations at all. This nonhotel hotel is to open in 2005 at Stuart and Charles Streets. 
"We are about housing," Mr. Jeffries said. "Our customer is buying a brand, exclusivity and service. These are all transportable."
Millennium, based in Manhattan, has six projects in Boston, New York and Washington with the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company of Atlanta, a division of Marriott International. The second Boston project is the renovation of the 75-year-old original Ritz-Carlton. Millennium also has projects in San Francisco and Miami with Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts of Toronto.
For its part, Ritz-Carlton is developing a two-tower hotel-condominium project in Sarasota, Fla., with WCI Communities. And Four Seasons has a similar project in Jackson Hole, Wyo., with the Louis Dreyfus Property Group.
Ritz-Carlton calculates that its name on the door and services in the building account for an average premium of 20 to 25 percent in apartment prices. What it gets -- besides management fees and a percentage of the premium -- are new rooms in business districts where the scale of development would make a small luxury hotel uneconomical.
"We could not do it without a residential component," said Simon F. Cooper, president and chief operating officer of Ritz-Carlton. "We couldn't do a 650-room hotel at the Boston Common. It would be too large for the market."
Instead, Ritz-Carlton occupies six of 34 floors in the 400-foot-high south tower. The condos are above. At the base is a 100,000-square-foot Sports Club/L.A., with a popular restaurant called Blu, and a 19-screen, 4,700-seat Loews Theater. The 37-story north tower has more condos and 63 extended-stay suites.
"Our model is to make most of the money in housing, a solid return in the sports clubs and theaters and do reasonably well on the hotel business," Mr. Jeffries said. Of course, it is the association with a luxury hotel that lures buyers, even to a development by an out-of-town builder.
"You say 'Ritz-Carlton' and that's all you have to say," said Anthony Pangaro, Millennium's partner here. A 30-year veteran of the local development scene, he has worked for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, two governors, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, Macomber Development Associates and its successor, MDA Partners.
It is expensive to put a hotel, apartments, sports club, theater and garage under one roof, perhaps 50 percent more so than conventional residential construction. Where Millennium finds savings is in land costs, buying property in neighborhoods it judges to be up and coming.
In Boston, Millennium bought two parcels on Washington Street, in an area known as the Combat Zone, a rundown mix of stores, theaters and sex-related businesses. The F. D. Rich Company of Stamford, Conn., planned office towers on the site but Citicorp, the primary lender, foreclosed in 1991. "You had to understand that a couple of parking lots in the Combat Zone were a hidden treasure," Mr. Pangaro said.
Both sites offer panoramic vistas sweeping from the John Hancock Tower to the Custom House Tower, across the Public Garden, Charles River, Beacon Hill, State House and the new cable-stayed Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge.
Millennium decided to develop all 1.8 million square feet at once. "You felt that if you did something big enough and good enough, you could change people's perception quickly," said Philip E. Aarons, a founding partner. The buildings, which might be described as Pinstripe Modern, were designed by Gary Edward Handel & Associates and CBT/Childs Bertman Tseckares.
Mayor Thomas M. Menino encouraged the project as a way to stimulate economic revitalization along Washington Street, which had seemed stubbornly resistant.
The Ritz-Carlton "really was a catalyst," said Susan M. Hannon, a deputy director at the Boston Redevelopment Authority. "What we're trying to achieve here is a place for people to be -- to eat, go to the movies, shop, live and work. This is a huge anchor."
One harbinger of change is the adoption of a new neighborhood name: in this case, the Ladder District, after the runglike array of short streets between the legs of Tremont and Washington Streets.
Old names die hard, however.
"My wife used to tell all our friends, 'My husband is moving me to the Combat Zone,' " said J. Brad Griffith, former president and co-chief executive of Leggat McCall Properties. The couple moved into a $2 million apartment at the Ritz-Carlton in December.
"We travel a lot and wanted something that would make our life very, very easy," Mr. Griffith said. Also, as a daily swimmer, Mr. Griffith was drawn to the 25-meter pool at the Sports Club.
"The combination of all the services is really terrific," he said, though he acknowledged his concern about Ritz-Carlton's long-term commitment to the project since he, too, calculated that its name added a 25 percent premium. Mr. Griffith said he was now assured that Ritz-Carlton would stay the course.
About 100 residents have opened accounts with the hotel, said the general manager, John Rolfs, enabling them to get room service, laundry service and housekeeping, for which they pay fees.
Of 304 apartments, 140 have been sold and 9 are in contract, with 49 under one- or two-year leases. Prices have ranged from $455,000 for a one-bedroom to $6.6 million for a four-bedroom penthouse. Millennium is keeping some as rental units so that it can take advantage of rising prices later.
"By changing neighborhoods, we're changing underlying values," Mr. Aarons said. "I want to be there for that."

A Financing Deal's Many 'Wants'
To finance six developments with Ritz-Carlton in Boston, New York and Washington, Millennium Partners wanted to borrow $400 million. The lenders, in turn, wanted a $100 million debt-service guarantee, which came from Marriott International, the parent company of Ritz-Carlton.
And what did Marriott want?
"They wanted that," said Christopher M. Jeffries, a founding partner of Millennium, pointing to a model of the former St. Moritz Hotel in New York. (And by that, he meant not only the building but a location on Central Park South, where Ritz-Carlton had a hotel until 1997.)
The St. Moritz, 50 Central Park South, will reopen this month as a Ritz-Carlton, with 277 hotel rooms and 11 full-floor condominium apartments, 6 of which have been sold. Prices range from $22.5 million to $28 million.
The five-year, $400 million loan, underwritten by Dresdner Bank and DePfa Bank of Germany, supplemented $300 million in equity from Millennium and its partners.
Millennium's other New York hotel and condominium project, the Ritz-Carlton Downtown, at the southern end of Battery Park City, opened in January.
"It meant returning Ritz-Carlton to a market it hadn't been in and absolutely needed to be in," said Simon F. Cooper, president and chief operating officer of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. "You can well understand why we were so willing to be the catalyst from a financial point of view that enabled Millennium to do the deal." DAVID W. DUNLAP

HEADLINE: Is America Abandoning Afghanistan? 

BYLINE:  By Barnett R. Rubin; Barnett R. Rubin, director of studies at New York University's Center on International Cooperation, is author of "The Fragmentation of Afghanistan."

 BODY:
"Everyone is failing us." I heard these words recently from a senior adviser to Hamid Karzai, the Afghan leader, at a private dinner in Kabul. His was just the most blunt expression of a spreading concern. United Nations officials, who had relied on assurances of American support, also wondered if the United States would soon turn its attention elsewhere. Washington's refusal to support expansion of the British-led International Security Assistance Force beyond Kabul has signaled, to many, the start of disengagement.
 Just past the halfway mark of its six-month tenure, the interim authority in Afghanistan is preparing for a transition through the assembly of leaders called a loya jirga, which is scheduled for June 10 to 16. The loya jirga, to be opened by the former king, Zahir Shah, is supposed to elect a new, more representative government. The prospect of the loya jirga process shaking up an already shaky structure -- before reconstruction or disarmament has even begun -- further complicates the security crisis. 
 Reconstruction aid is trapped in an incomprehensible bureaucracy as visiting dignitaries pose for photo-ops with schoolgirls; meanwhile, legions of consultants (myself included) traipse from ministry to ministry conducting "needs assessments." Officials scrape by without furniture, equipment or even paper, while warlords armed and financed by the United States and Britain to fight terrorism rule over most of the country.
Men and women throughout Afghanistan welcome the opportunity the loya jirga represents to be consulted, however imperfectly, on how they will be governed. Yet they also fear they will not be able to vote or debate freely. Armed commanders dominate the localities where several stages of indirect elections will be held to choose delegates to the loya jirga. The defense ministry -- controlled by followers of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud, all from the Panjshir Valley -- still has thousands of troops in Kabul. In the first major violation of the United Nations-sponsored Bonn agreement that formed the current government, the defense minister refused to withdraw these troops from Kabul when international security forces were deployed there. The troops are supposed to be confined to barracks.
For many Afghans, the test of the loya jirga's legitimacy will be whether it can provide a political role for the former king and reduce the power of this small group. But the Panjshiris believe that only the organized force left them by Massoud can assure the stability needed for the transition and that both their persistence in fighting the Soviets and the Taliban and their willingness to participate in a broader coalition government, even with groups lacking military power, entitle them to this role. The presence of their troops in Kabul reinforces the message. The resulting tensions could erupt in a battle over the center, dissidence in the provinces, or both.
Twenty-four years of war have left the country in a state of destitution and brutalization almost impossible to fathom. Nearly every victimizer has served his turn as victim, though Afghanistan's women have experienced only change from one form of oppression to another. Even once brutal commanders say they have learned from the past and wish to move from war to politics. But they need help, they need to be pressured, and all are keeping their options open.
Afghanistan's leaders have clearly stated what they need: expansion of the International Security Assistance Force from Kabul to the major provincial centers and quick disbursement of aid to resuscitate the administration and provide alternative livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of armed men. In discussions I had in the Ministry for Women's Affairs and with professionals and activists from nongovernmental organizations, women emphasized that security was the prerequisite for their broader participation in public life.
The position of the United States and its coalition partners -- that they will train Afghan national forces rather than use international forces to maintain security -- is disingenuous. An expanded international force is needed precisely to provide security during the reorganization of irregulars into a smaller, more disciplined force that will maintain security.
A recent Security Council resolution tried to replace expansion of the international force with economic incentives by promising that reconstruction aid will be provided only to local leaders who protect human rights and ensure security. But substituting offers of assistance for police and military action will fail here as elsewhere. Incentives work best when combined with sanctions. For now, local commanders still feel they can protect their interests best with guns.
Whatever explanations Washington offers, both Afghans and international officials see the refusal to expand the international force as the start of American disengagement, repeating the mistake of the 1990's despite promises to learn from that experience. Providing security for rebuilding Afghanistan is now the front line in the war against terrorism. Failure here will undermine all other commitments. Many fear that failure has already started. There is still time to prove them wrong.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Opened Into Expenses Of a Former Housing Official 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The city's Department of Investigation has begun an inquiry into whether a politically connected Giuliani appointee improperly charged up to a quarter of a million dollars in travel, dining and gifts to the housing agency he led, officials said yesterday.
 City officials acknowledged the investigation after The Village Voice reported on its Web site that the appointee, Russell A. Harding, had spent more than $250,000 in travel, dining and entertainment expenses during his tenure as president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation, a public corporation that provides both taxable and tax-exempt financing to build affordable housing in New York City. 
 Mr. Harding issued a statement yesterday saying that he had reimbursed his former agency for $52,000 worth of expenses and that he was prepared to repay more money if needed. 
Mr. Harding was a college dropout with no experience in housing finance when Rudolph W. Giuliani tapped him to run the corporation in 1998 at the age of 34. Because his father, Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, was one of Mr. Giuliani's biggest supporters, the appointment was criticized at the time as a patronage hire.
Raymond Harding's other son, Robert M. Harding, was Mr. Giuliani's budget director, and then deputy mayor, and is now a member of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is charged with rebuilding downtown.
As president of the housing corporation, Russell Harding made more than 30 long-distance trips, often staying in luxury hotels and charging as much as $1,000 for meals at four-star restaurants, according to The Voice, which obtained Mr. Harding's expense records after filing several freedom of information requests with the corporation. 
The Voice reported that although Mr. Harding wrote on his expense statements that he made the trips to attend housing finance and technology conferences, he rarely stayed at the hotels where the conferences were held and was often absent from the proceedings. 
Mr. Harding stayed at the Coronado in San Diego, the Four Seasons in Georgetown, the Royal Garden in Hong Kong. The paper reported that he made many of the trips with Luke Cusack, a senior vice president at the housing agency who was described as a close friend of his. Mr. Cusack said yesterday that he had no comment on the report.
The Voice reported that Mr. Harding filed expenses for his bagels each morning, for $860 worth of books and gift cards at a Borders bookstore one Christmas Eve and for a $17,000 trip to Las Vegas that included a helicopter ride. It also said that he bought a television and a DVD player for a man he met in an America Online chat room for movie buffs. 
The paper reported that Mr. Harding wrote the man an e-mail message explaining that he would charge the electronics to the corporation. "Don't worry about the price," the e-mail said. "I can put them both on an expense report at work."
Mr. Harding released a statement yesterday that said: "During my tenure as president of the Housing Development Corporation, I charged certain expenses to the corporation. After leaving H.D.C. on Feb. 1, 2002, I began to reimburse the corporation for those expenses. I have already repaid more than $52,000 and I am prepared to repay any additional amounts that are required."
The Voice said it first sought Mr. Harding's expense reports in October 2000 but was told that they were lost. When Mr. Harding left the corporation in February, The Voice refiled its request. The new president of the corporation, Charles A. Brass, an appointee of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, found the records and turned them over.
The records were also turned over to the Department of Investigation, and Mr. Cusack was dismissed from his position. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment, saying that the matter was under investigation.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Decline as Saudis Offer Assurance on Supplies 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell almost 3 percent yesterday after Saudi Arabia, the world's leading exporter, said it would ensure that consuming nations had enough oil to cover any losses caused by a 30-day halt in exports by Iraq.
 The Saudi assurances came in a report in a London-based daily, Al Sharq al Awsat, citing the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi. 
 Idle rigs in Saudi Arabia can pump more oil than Iraq's output, which in the first quarter fell below two million barrels a day. 
The Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, said he was suspending exports to show support for the Palestinians in their fight against Israel.
"Every time the Iraqis threaten to cut exports, Saudi Arabia has pledged to make up for any shortfall," said Michael Fitzpatrick, a futures broker at Fimat USA in New York. "They make more money and help their allies in the West."
In trading yesterday, crude oil for May delivery fell 72 cents, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $25.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest since March 26. Futures prices dropped last night after the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil supplies had grown by an unexpected 4.2 million barrels in the week ended April 5.
In London, crude oil for May settlement fell 94 cents, to $26.08 a barrel.
Prices have risen for several weeks, surging when Israel sent troops to attack Palestinian command-and-control operations after suicide bombing attacks in Israeli cities. Prices reached a seven-month high of $28.35 a barrel last week amid concern that Middle East producers might cut off supplies to the West.
Israeli troops pulled out of two towns in the West Bank yesterday, after repeated calls for a withdrawal by President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is on a Mideast cease-fire mission.
"The Israelis gave Bush part of what he wanted," said Mordechai Abir, head of energy and geopolitical research at Burnham Securities in New York, adding that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon "isn't withdrawing from anywhere until he's finished."
Iran reiterated its willingness yesterday to reduce oil exports in cooperation with Arab neighbors as a way of applying pressure on Israel.
"Iran will join the embargo only if all the Arab members do as well," Mr. Abir said, adding, "They know very well that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait" and the United Arab Emirates will not join any embargo.
The decline in oil prices yesterday came as a strike at Venezuela's state oil company was extended for a second 24-hour period, and as Nigerian oil workers' unions halted a strike there, giving the government a week to pay overdue benefits.

HEADLINE: A Survey Asks Companies For Opinions of New York 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has begun an extensive survey of corporate leaders nationwide to determine how they feel about doing business in New York, and to come up with a series of recommendations for attracting and keeping corporations in town.
 The study, one of the largest of its kind, is being conducted by a private management consulting firm. It is the latest example of how three men from the private sector -- who never worked in government before and now earn $1 a year for their service -- are slowly trying to rewrite the way the city interacts with private businesses as part of a larger economic development plan. 
 Those men, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff and Andrew M. Alper, a former investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & Company who was recruited by Mr. Doctoroff to be president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, are aggressively wooing and hand-holding businesses, much the way each one approached his Wall Street clients while working in the private sector. 
These officials have been out and about in the city, asking chief executives what they can do to make them happy. City officials have also tried to retool the relationship between the city development corporation and the state's Empire State Development Corporation, so that the two agencies are less competitive with each other. At the same time, the administration is looking for ways to get the private sector to play a role in the city's recovery at a time when a looming budget gap is hampering big ideas.
"We are in a competitive business," Mr. Alper said yesterday during an interview in his downtown office. "Companies don't have to be in New York City." During his days at Goldman, Sachs, Mr. Alper said, the relationship with the city was "neutral to hostile." 
When he took over the E.D.C., he said, he realized that "virtually no one in the private sector had a relationship with City Hall. Maybe it is because of its size or maybe it was because of a certain kind of arrogance in the mayor's office." He added: "Taxpayers are our valued clients. We have to see how much we can help them."
To that end, Mr. Alper has completely restructured the way the E.D.C. operates, essentially placing the private-sector template over the government agency. He has divided the agency into four areas, including "client coverage," which consists basically of paying calls on businesses, hearing what their problems are and trying to give them some succor.
Those who lead each business group report directly to Mr. Alper, who makes many decisions in consultation with Mr. Doctoroff. In the Giuliani administration, most major economic development plans were devised and executed by City Hall. Executives have been amazed to hear from E.D.C. officials, Mr. Alper said, and have grumbled to him that they never heard from anyone in the prior administration. 
"We've been pleasantly surprised about how aggressive Andy and his group have been in trying to reach out to people," said Matthew Andresen, the chief executive of Island Inc., an electronic stock market, who added that he never heard from anyone in the Giuliani administration. Other business leaders, including those from much larger companies, who were not willing to speak on the record for fear that Mr. Giuliani might be re-elected, said they were never approached by his administration, either.
Granted, the economic climate is far different than it was during the Giuliani years, when a boom economy allowed businesses to thrive without needing help. 
And several executives praised the apparently more cooperative relationship between the city and the state, whose competitive manner obstructed projects in the past, they contended. "I think they are working very well right now," said Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York. He said that the prior relationship created "stumbling blocks."
Some also praised the Giuliani administration for moving quickly to aid downtown businesses after the terror attack on Sept. 11. "They kept us in business," said Peter Hoffman, a partner at Deloitte & Touche. "They helped us to get our computers out of the World Financial Center and walked us through police lines. They could not have been more helpful."
Outside of rebuilding Lower Manhattan, Mr. Alper said his agency was focused on developing Brooklyn and Long Island City as new business hubs. And he said that New York City, unlike other cities, has never had a plan to recruit new industries or companies.
Mr. Bloomberg has said that he would like to see private businesses help bail the city out of its financial troubles. One way to achieve this, Mr. Alper said, is to get businesses to donate services or pro bono work.
To that end, the administration has tapped McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, to do various studies pro bono, including the latest one, in which scores of business leaders are being interviewed about their perceptions of New York City as a place to do business. It will result in a series of recommendations to the city on how to attract and retain businesses. Laurie Blitzer, a partner at McKinsey, said the study, one of the largest of its kind for a municipality, began last month and would conclude sometime in June.
"To me this is an issue of classic market segmentation," said Mr. Doctoroff. "For the first month or so we've spent an enormous amount of time and energy on keeping people here. But here are a whole series of things that companies look at and we are trying to analyze that."

HEADLINE: Oil Field Hopes to Become World Power 

BYLINE:  By BIRGIT BRAUER 

DATELINE: KARACHAGANAK, Kazakhstan 

 BODY:
About a two-hour drive from the regional capital, Uralsk, along a bumpy road and close to the Russian border, Karachaganak lies in an inhospitable, barren area where temperatures can range from minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit in winter to 105 in summer. Spring is probably worst of all, as swarms of gnats descend.
 But this remote spot and, more to the point, its vast gas, oil and condensate reserves, are a crucial part of an effort by the government to turn the energy-rich country into a major oil producer in the next 10 years. In February, in the first meeting of the country's new government, the prime minister, Imangali Tasmagambetov, made a point of emphasizing the industry's significance. 
 With the news Monday that Iraq would withhold its oil exports for a month underlining the political volatility that bedevils supplies from the Middle East, the West's appetite for energy sources far removed from the turmoil will probably remain high for years. 
Already, Karachaganak and other fields have helped make this former Soviet republic a magnet for foreign investments, attracting billions of dollars and promises of more. American companies alone have said they are ready to invest as much as $200 billion in the next 5 to 10 years.
With more than 30 percent of Kazakhstanis living below the poverty line, Karachaganak has also attracted people from around the country, many desperate for work. The population of Aksai, the nearby city where most newcomers have settled, has soared 55 percent, to 31,000, in five years. Around 70 percent of its working population is employed at the field.
Karachaganak, one of three premium Kazakh fields being developed in the northern Caspian region, was discovered in 1979. Though it is smaller than the other two, Kashagan and Tengiz, its 116 square miles contain more than 1.2 billion metric tons of oil and condensate and more than 1.35 trillion cubic meters of gas, making it one of the world's top 20 oil and gas fields in terms of proven reserves.
The Soviet gas industry ministry began production in 1984. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Karachaganak became the property of Kazakhstan and was operated by Gazprom, the Russian-controlled gas giant that was the ministry's successor. Realizing early on that Karachaganak was not going to go anywhere with Gazprom, which considered it a competitor to Russian fields, the Kazakh government looked for other companies to participate in its development. In 1992, British Gas and Agip of Italy won the operating contract. Since Gazprom controlled the field's only export outlet, to a processing plant in nearby Orenburg, it was offered an equity interest in the field. In 1997, Gazprom sold its stake to Lukoil, Russia's top oil producer, and Texaco bought a stake from BP and Agip.
Currently, Agip and the BG Group each own 32.5 percent of the Karachaganak Integrated Organization, the venture that operates the field, while ChevronTexaco has 20 percent and Lukoil 15 percent.
Next year is expected to be the long-awaited breakthrough for the field, which so far has been cut off from international markets because of a lack of pipelines to transport what it produces out of landlocked Kazakhstan. A 394-mile oil pipeline is expected to be completed in 2003, connecting Karachaganak with the export pipeline that runs from the Tengiz field to Novorossiysk, a Russian port on the Black Sea.
The Karachaganak Integrated Organization has already invested more than $2 billion in the project and will invest an additional $1.5 billion by the end of 2003, when the next phase of development and most infrastructure work is expected to be completed, allowing the venture to increase production sharply.
But investors have had some tough going. Production came to a virtual standstill for two months in the fall when a tax dispute between the Kazakh and Russian governments caused the field's only customers, Russian companies, to stop buying gas.
A year ago, hundreds of disgruntled workers, employed by the venture's Greek-Italian contractor CCC/Saipem, took to the streets to demand higher wages and better working conditions during a visit by Kasymzhomart Tokayev, then the prime minister, whose car was stopped by the protesters. The demands were quickly met. And Mr. Tokayev, in turn, used the opportunity to chide the venture for not using enough local labor, goods and services.
(Import substitution is also important to the new government; some foreign investors were recently asked to come to the capital, Astana, to explain how much progress they have made.)
The formation of the joint venture had its own tribulations. Scott Horton, a lawyer with the New York firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler who has been involved with foreign investments in Central Asia, recalls intense behind-the-scenes jockeying among the Kazakhstani elite aligned with different investors. "It is the norm in Kazakhstan for problems to come up," Mr. Horton said. But with Karachaganak, he said, it "has been quite a bit more than usual."
A 40-year production-sharing agreement was signed with the Kazakh government in 1997, providing for development of the field but differences have continued over issues like taxes and license validation. BG, for example, was involved in a lengthy tax battle with the government three years ago and had to pay several million dollars to settle the dispute.
In 1998, the Russian financial crisis left Karachaganak's customers insolvent and production plunged.
Much is riding on the success of Karachaganak for the Kazakhstanis as well as for the investors.
"We are now employing, either ourselves or our contractors, 17,500 people here," up from about 4,000 a year and a half ago, said John Morrow, general director of the Karachaganak Integrated Organization. "That has had a dramatic effect on the economy in the region."
But as development continues, questions are being raised about what will happen with the work force once construction is finished and the project is up and running. "We will have a lot of people out of work in two to three years," said Aksai's deputy mayor, Maksut Shunshaliyev. "What are we going to do with them?"
Not a problem, Mr. Morrow said. "Beyond 2003, there are plans for further development projects in the oil and gas industry around the North Caspian," he said. "There will be opportunities for people," he said, especially those already trained at Karachaganak.

HEADLINE: The Missing Energy Strategy 

 BODY:
The events of the past year -- prominently, a power crisis in California and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 -- gave the nation many reasons to re-examine its energy strategy. Now comes another: Saddam Hussein's decision to halt oil imports to the United States, at least temporarily, in retaliation for Washington's support of Israel.
 In an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, President Bush warned that the recent 20 percent jump in oil prices could threaten economic recovery. While Iraq accounts for about 8 percent of America's imports, according to Washington's estimates, there is spare oil capacity in the system, and thus there should be no petroleum shortage if other Middle Eastern producers refuse to follow Baghdad. Even so, Mr. Hussein's action draws attention once again to America's dependence on imported oil, including oil supplied by the troubled countries of the Persian Gulf. It also points to Washington's sorry failure to devise a balanced strategy to reduce America's reliance on gulf imports and give itself greater maneuvering room in the war on terrorism and other foreign policy issues as well. 
 The Senate, which has resumed debate on the energy bill, is the last hope for such a strategy. Admittedly, the prospects are dimmer than they were a month ago, when the Senate took up an imperfect but honorable measure cobbled together by Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Tom Daschle, the majority leader. The bill included a mix of incentives for new production of fossil fuels, largely natural gas, along with provisions aimed at increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. As such it stood in stark contrast to a grievously one-sided House bill that provided $27 billion in incentives for the oil, gas and coal industries and less than one-quarter that amount for efficiency. The House bill also authorized the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and drilling.
On its first big test, however, the Senate collapsed under industry and union pressure and rejected a provision requiring the first increase in fuel economy standards since 1985. To Mr. Daschle's dismay, Democrats deserted the cause of fuel conservation in droves; New York's senators, Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, were among the honorable exceptions. The only bright moment in a dismal two weeks of debate and defeat was the approval of a "renewable portfolio standard" that would require utilities to generate between 5 and 10 percent of their power from wind, solar and other forms of renewable energy. 
There are several things the Democrats and their moderate Republican allies can do to produce a respectable bill. First, they must defeat any amendment aimed at opening the Arctic refuge to drilling. Such an amendment is almost certain to be offered by Frank Murkowski of Alaska, but the facts are not on his side. Every available calculation -- including those that accept Mr. Murkowski's inflated estimates of the amount of oil underneath the refuge -- show that much more oil can be saved by fuel efficiency than by drilling.
Next, they must resist efforts to weaken the renewable energy provision, while defending energy efficiency measures that have yet to be voted on -- chiefly a provision that would increase efficiency standards for air-conditioners by 30 percent. The Senate should also preserve a useful provision that would require companies to give a public accounting of their production of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases. On the supply side, it can take steps to improve the reliability of the nationwide electricity grid, while increasing incentives for smaller and potentially more efficient producers of power.
These are modest measures, less ambitious than the Senate's original agenda. But at least they point in the right direction, toward a strategy that includes conservation as well as production.

HEADLINE: Transit Hub and 'Freedom Park' Part of Blueprint for Rebuilding 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation yesterday made public a blueprint for a commercial and cultural makeover of downtown Manhattan, an outline that includes a new Freedom Park with memorial and museum, and a transit hub connecting subway, commuter rail and ferry lines.
 While the outline issued yesterday was only a general document, with few specifics or timetables, John C. Whitehead, chairman of the development corporation, said the proposals should serve as evidence that the rebuilding process has begun. The plans would make significant changes to the area's transportation systems, economy and traffic patterns for pedestrians and automobiles. 
Among the outline's proposals are the creation of a park encompassing a memorial to the victims of the World Trade Center attack as well as a museum dedicated to "freedom, tolerance and the values that the World Trade Center represented." The proposed park would be linked thematically to the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the New York Stock Exchange and other downtown institutions and museums. 
In addition, the plan proposes extensive transportation improvements, including a new hub connecting subway, commuter rail and ferry lines, as well as a terminal to accommodate the expected surge in buses and other tourist traffic once the park and memorial are in place. 
At a meeting yesterday, Mr. Whitehead and other members of the development corporation's board sought to rebuff criticism that plans for the redevelopment of the trade center site are not keeping pace with the cleanup, which is nearing completion.
"I think this announcement shows that there is a lot of work being done, and that progress is being made," Mr. Whitehead said. "Speed is not the essential quality of good development. Quality is the essential quality."
But the "principles for action" and "preliminary blueprint for renewal" released yesterday do not discuss how much the proposals might cost, or how many of them could be paid for with the $21 billion that Congress has appropriated for the city's rebuilding efforts. Nor do the proposals set a timeline for completing a development plan.
"These are proposals under review," Alexander Garvin, the corporation's vice president for planning, design and development, said in presenting the plans to the board. "Now we need to put some meat on these bones."
Also yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed four members to the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, bringing to eight the number of mayoral appointees. The new members will significantly change the ethnic makeup of the board, which has been criticized by City Council members for including only one member of a minority group and two women.
The new appointees are Sally Hernandez-Pinero, an attorney who was a deputy mayor for economic development under David N. Dinkins; Billie Tsien, a principal at the architecture firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien and Associates; E. Stanley O'Neal, president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch; and Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district. Ms. Hernandez-Pinero is Hispanic, Ms. Tsien is an Asian-American and Mr. O'Neal is an African-American. 
Along with one additional appointee still to be named by Gov. George E. Pataki, the new appointments will expand the board to 16 members.
Several of the proposals outlined yesterday have been talked about previously by city and state officials. Some have also emerged from advisory committees set up by the development corporation, which include groups of downtown residents, families of Sept. 11 victims, owners of small businesses and representatives of major downtown corporations. 
The proposals will next be presented to the advisory committees for discussion, but there is no formal comment period. The corporation expects to begin issuing formal plans on individual topics, like transportation and the memorial, beginning next month. Copies of the plan released yesterday can be found at the development corporation's Web site, www.renewnyc.com.
Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a civic group, characterized the outline issued yesterday as "a good start."
"It's the first time anybody has put any of this down on paper," he said. But while the outline includes a number of projects that various civic and planning groups have supported, it makes no mention of the Second Avenue subway, which, if built, would presumably have some part in a reconfigured transportation hub.
Among the transportation links that could, if approved, be part of a new transportation hub, are a link between the N and R subway lines and the 1 and 9 lines, either at Rector Street or at a rebuilt Nassau-Fulton Street station. The PATH train could be extended from its former station under the trade center to be part of that hub, and the plan also proposes new connections between Pennsylvania Station or Grand Central Terminal and the downtown area. And a possible Long Island Rail Road link through Brooklyn or Queens to downtown is also discussed.
The plan also proposes reconstructing streets that were removed from the downtown grid when the trade center complex was built, and making significant additions of retail space. 
Mr. Garvin noted that some of the proposals would be very expensive and take years to complete, and that such considerations would influence the formal proposals he makes to the board over the next year.

HEADLINE: Can Computers Foil Air Pirates? 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE computers in the cockpits of modern jets help airline pilots with more and more tasks: plotting routes, calculating fuel use and takeoff speeds, relieving the tedium of 14-hour flights and finding the way through the clouds. But what about dealing with the Sept. 11 problem, hijackers who want to turn planes into weapons?
 Many of the electronic building blocks are in place for a system onboard airplanes that would thwart air pirates, according to aviation experts. In fact, systems that could prevent terrorists from crashing a plane into a building, or even crashing the plane at all, would require no fundamental breakthroughs. But people in the aviation industry doubt they will be used any time soon. "It's not something that could happen in the near term at all," said Diane Spitaliere, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
 The reason is part of a dilemma of aviation since Sept. 11: steps that increase security once a plane is in the air may create their own safety risks. The most visible example is the use of F-16 combat planes over major American cities, their pilots ready to force down or even shoot down an off-course airliner. 
Less dramatic, computer-controlled solutions are available. The problem is that while pilots love computers, they do not trust them as much as themselves.
In the weeks after the September hijackings, various experts (and, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, lots of people who merely thought they were experts) came up with hundreds of ideas. 
Among the ideas that are getting close scrutiny are onboard flight-control systems that could be programmed to prevent planes from heading into restricted areas; remote control from the ground that could not be overridden from the cockpit; and a panic button, also impossible to override, that has the plane direct itself to land at the nearest suitable field.
The computer-enforced "no flight" idea has been articulated by, among others, Edward A. Lee, an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who calls it "soft walls." Mountains, he says, are "hard walls," where planes cannot fly; why not add artificial three-dimensional blocks of space where planes could not enter? 
In fact, Professor Lee's approach would solve a problem that predates Sept. 11 and has killed thousands of people -- namely, what the airlines call "controlled flight into terrain," when a crew takes a plane in perfect working order and slams it into a mountain. Since the crash of an American Airlines Boeing 757 in Colombia in 1995, and that of a Korean Air 747 short of a runway in Guam in 1997, thousands of planes have been equipped with a device called an enhanced ground-proximity warning system, which incorporates a major chunk of the "soft wall" idea. 
"Enhanced groundprox," as pilots call it, uses the Global Positioning System or other navigation information available to the plane -- like inertial guidance, which keeps track of location by measuring each turn and how long the plane flew at each speed in each direction, or ground-based radio beacons -- to plot the plane's longitude and latitude. It also keeps track of the plane's heading, speed, altitude and rate of climb or descent. Then it projects the plane's position in the next few minutes and compares the projection to a computer database of terrain. 
If the system calculates that the crew is heading for a mountain, it highlights that mountain on a screen. As the plane gets closer, the mountain gets brighter. Eventually, the machine starts talking. "Pull up," it says, in increasingly insistent tones. 
All the system does, however, is warn. Professor Lee would have it prohibit the pilot from flying toward the obstacle. All other movements would be allowed. Eventually, he said, the plane would be "gently diverted" and would bank or climb as appropriate to avoid the forbidden area. The mandatory system would mediate every instruction from the cockpit. For example, if the forbidden zone included a block covering Manhattan to an altitude of 4,000 feet, it would prevent someone in the cockpit from skimming in at that altitude and cutting off the engines. 
There are, however, several problems. 
First is that for software to interpose itself between the human in the cockpit and the flight control surfaces, the airplane has to have such a computer to begin with. Those are planes that are known as "fly by wire," because a pilot's actions in the cockpit, like a command to bank or climb, are given to a computer, which then sends a signal in an electric wire to a mechanical device at the control, like the elevator in the tail or the aileron on the wing. 
Only a few planes, like a Boeing 777 or an Airbus A320, have such "fly by wire" systems, also called F.B.W. In older planes, to move a flight-control surface on a wing or the tail, the pilot moves a mechanical control that pulls a cable running under the plane's floor. Generally, the cable or an electronic signal from the computer connects to a hydraulic system that actually does the work. 
In November, the F.A.A. counted about 2,300 fly-by-wire planes among Boeing and Airbus models, the two most popular among big jets; another 8,700 planes in those fleets had conventional mechanical systems. 
Herman A. Rediess, director of the Office of Aviation Research at the F.A.A., said in a paper representing his own views: "For the near future, no airline will have the financial resources to even modify the F.B.W. aircraft. It's not clear that they would even have sufficient funds to retrofit the non-F.B.W. aircraft."
Adding fly-by-wire ability to older planes would be wildly expensive. George K. Muellner, an Air Force veteran and president of Boeing's research and development arm, called the Phantom Works, recalled that the Air Force had taken some of its oldest F-4's and converted them into pilotless drones, for use as target practice. The conversion, he said, cost more than the plane did new. 
Even for newer planes, pilots do not like the idea. 
A Boeing 737 pilot for a major airline recalled approaching Reagan National Airport from the south a few years ago and facing a microburst, a rainstorm that includes sudden changes in wind direction. Such a condition can lead to a crash if a plane is at low altitude and low air speed, as it is on approach. 
He broke off the approach and turned east. "It was the only way to go," he said. However, if he had been a little deeper into the approach, he said, "I'd be flying right toward the protected area," the forbidden zone that includes the White House. A system that prevented him from turning that way would be unsafe, said the pilot, whose airline, like most, has been reluctant to discuss security changes.
Another pilot, Stephen A. Luckey, the chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association's security committee, said computers were still too prone to failure to allow them to override human pilots without recourse. Captain Luckey, who flew a Boeing 747-400 until he retired recently, said that in the last three years, he had seen three instances of computer failure on planes he was flying. In two of those, he said, as he looked at a navigation screen, the ground appeared to rotate 120 degrees. 
"If something goes wrong, it will go wrong at the worst possible time," he said. "Murphy is always your co-pilot in this business." He said he preferred "fortress doors," air marshals and armed pilots. 
"There are far better, more economical, proven and reliable systems than these gee-whiz things," said Captain Luckey, who heads a panel on ways to fortify planes against hijacking, formed by an F.A.A. advisory committee on airline security. 
Another concern is the reliability of the Global Positioning System. The system is certainly precise enough to be used to steer planes away from objects as large as mountains or major clusters of buildings. But it, too, is subject to sabotage from the ground that could blank out a signal or possibly even send out false information. At that point, other navigation information, like inertial navigation or land-based radio beacons, would still be available, though.
Professor Lee, in a telephone interview, said the problem was not technical, but cultural. The idea of a captain with ultimate authority goes back 1,000 years, he said, and is hard to overcome. But he said his plan left maximum possible control with the cockpit crew, by allowing any movement that did not take the plane into the target. "We need to convince the pilots that this is their best option," he said. 
Another idea examined since Sept. 11 is the remote control of hijacked airplanes. Such control has advanced sharply in recent years for military planes and has proved its worth in Afghanistan. The newest systems are designed to let a single operator run four drones at once, because the drones are given a preprogrammed mission and endowed with some artificial intelligence that lets them make some decisions on their own. 
The operator on the ground does not have so much as a joystick to work with. Instead, a keyboard is used to issue instructions, the way a pilot onboard might instruct an autopilot: climb to a certain altitude at a certain rate, level out, roll the plane to a new heading, proceed to a certain point and make a turn in a different direction; land on a particular runway at a certain airfield. 
A related idea is a "panic button." Once it was pushed, the plane would land at the nearest suitable airfield, with no one onboard able to stop it. G.P.S. navigation is rapidly approaching the point where it will be accurate enough for such landings, if it is working properly.
The drawbacks of these high-tech solutions, however, have led civilian experts to conclude that lower-technology solutions are more likely to be helpful.
As with the "soft walls" systems, remote controls would work only on fly-by-wire planes. Reliability is a problem, too. Michael Heinz, vice president of Boeing's Unmanned Systems program, said that while the pilotless combat aircraft had a level of reliability that approached that of private planes, the risks were still much higher than typical for airliners. 
There are other complications, too, even for the fly-by-wire planes. For remote control, the biggest is probably unauthorized attempts to take control. "Any hacker with some radio-frequency equipment might try that," said Mr. Muellner of Boeing. 
Installing a system that cannot be overridden from the cockpit is a risk if it can be used by malefactors. As Mr. Muellner put it, "A terrorist who is not even on the airplane is the worst of all possible worlds."

GRAPHIC: Photos: TAKING BACK THE SKY -- Newer planes like the Boeing 737-900 demonstrated recently (top) can display hazards in a plane's path (right); such systems might be adapted to bar flight into designated areas. Boeing's drone warplane (above) can be flown remotely, but not at the reliability standards of commercial aviation. (Boeing); (Associated Press); (Boeing)(pg. G5) Chart: "No Simple Fix for Safer Skies"Computer-controlled mechanisms to thwart hijackers like those on Sept. 11 seem possible, but they have drawbacks. The situation near Reagan National Airport in Washington, where planes enter and leave the airport by following the Potomac River directly past the Mall, illustrates both sides of the issue. TWO IDEAS a) Systems could be developed so that planes that strayed too close to restricted areas would be diverted by computer-controlled security systems. Flight control systems could be programmed to forbid pilots from entering certain areas. Such programs would track the plane's location, heading, altitude and rate of climb (or descent). If a pilot persisted toward a restricted area, the system would take control, banking or climbing to avoid the area. b) Another idea would be to take control from the ground. This technology is in development for military planes (above), but has not reached a level of reliability necessary for airliners. DRAWBACKSThe idea of forbidden open spaces rankles many pilots who want to maintain maximum flexibility in an emergency, especially when severe weather conditions can produce dangerous winds. Also, remote-control systems are vulnerable to hacking. (Sources: Federal Aviation Administration; National Weather Service; Edward A. Lee, University of California at Berkeley)(pg.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform, New and Improved 

BYLINE:  By J. Dennis Hastert; J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, is speaker of the House of Representatives.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress is now preparing to reauthorize the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, the landmark law that transformed the federal government's role in helping the poor. Because of the law, which requires recipients to work for their welfare checks, welfare now encourages economic and social stability instead of fostering dependency.
 There was no question that the system needed an overhaul. Welfare had become a trap that hurt more Americans than it helped, discouraging work and contributing to the breakdown of the family. So Republicans in Congress pushed forward on a series of reforms. We made work the centerpiece of the new welfare law in 1996. 
 Since then, millions of Americans have left welfare for paying jobs. The number of families on welfare peaked in March 1994 at 5.1 million; by September 2001, the figure was 2.1 million. Low-income mothers, especially, have made tremendous progress -- experiencing a significant rise in employment and an increase in earnings. We have seen child poverty rates drop every year since the mid-1990's; the poverty rate for African-American children is now at a record low.
Now the reauthorization process gives us a chance to review the law and make the necessary improvements.
The first priority is to increase the expectations when it comes to work. Under the current law, half of all a state's welfare recipients are required to put in a 30-hour work week; the new plan calls for 70 percent of a state's able-bodied recipients to put in 40 hours a week. After all, many employers expect a 40-hour week from their employees. Welfare recipients will have the best chance of achieving independence in a work program that mimics the real world and allows them to maximize their time learning job skills. At the same time, we want to give states an incentive to innovate by, for instance, allowing them to reduce their work participation rates if their overall caseloads decline.
We also want to do more to address the needs of children on welfare. One of the ways we plan to do that is by helping to see that more child-support payments go directly to mothers and their children. Under the current system, state governments do not always have to turn over the child-support money they collect from deadbeat dads. Our plan changes the system to give states a financial incentive to hand over more of that money to mothers and their children.
Children will benefit even more if we can keep families together -- particularly if the welfare system encourages marriage. Erosion of marriage is the principal cause of child poverty, welfare dependence, higher emotional instability in children and higher crime rates for children.
But in its current form the welfare system discriminates against marriage. A married couple must work more hours than a single mother to earn a welfare check of equal value -- so there is little incentive for a single mother to marry. We want to change it so that married or not, the same number of hours are required to receive the same welfare check.
The federal government can further encourage marriage by financing premarital marriage education and divorce-reduction programs so that couples have support in building healthy marriages. Our plan includes $500 million over five years to pay for these programs. While many single mothers do a wonderful and difficult job in raising their children, statistics show that children of single parents face numerous challenges. For example, they are twice as likely to drop out of high school.
Congress has already started down the reform path this week with the introduction of the new welfare proposal in the House. Through these additional changes, we hope to build on the welfare-reform success stories and give even more families a chance to realize the American dream.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise After Sears Says Profits Will Top Estimates

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
An upbeat earnings outlook from Sears, Roebuck lifted Wall Street out of its malaise yesterday, spurring a broad rally across the market on hopes that profits are improving and that higher stock prices will prove justified.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 170 points, the biggest gain in more than a month. But analysts were skeptical the momentum would last, noting that earnings season is just beginning and Wall Street has yet to see a preponderance of companies confirm that business is turning around. 
 "A rebound is a very fair label of today's action," said Scott Bleier, president of Hybridinvestors.com. "But the sustainability of it all remains questionable, particularly since we are in preannouncements and earnings reports season." 
The Dow closed up 173.06 points, or 1.7 percent, at 10,381.73, ending a two-session losing streak. The last time the average rose more was on March 4, when it gained 217.96 points.
Broader stock indicators also surged. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 12.67 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,130.47, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 24.50 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,767.07.
Investors bid Sears up $2.98, or 5.8 percent, to $54.18, after it indicated first-quarter results would be better than expected although revenue remained soft.
The buying momentum quickly spread across the market, including to technology. Cisco and I.B.M. rebounded despite concerns about earnings. Cisco rose 73 cents, to $15.55, recovering some of its loss Tuesday on speculation it would cut its forecast. I.B.M. gained $1.27, to $89.01, after sliding on a profit and revenue warning Monday. 
Oracle dropped 43 cents, to $11.55, on speculation its earnings would be lower than expected.
Concern about disappointing earnings also plagued WorldCom, which fell 63 cents, to $4.77.
Shares of brokerage firms slipped on reports that the State of New York was expanding its investigation into conflicts of interest involving Wall Street analysts. Merrill Lynch, which was singled out Monday, fell $1.17, to $50.92. Goldman Sachs lost 11 cents, to $84.49.
Xerox slid 34 cents, to $9.94, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission notified two former company officials that they might face civil charges for accounting fraud.
The optimism yesterday contrasted sharply with the lackluster-to-negative trading that has characterized recent sessions. Stocks have been falling on mixed earnings reports and outlooks that have made it difficult to discern whether business is improving. Technology stocks have been particularly vulnerable for fear the sector will turn around at a slower pace than hoped.
Although the Dow is up 3.6 percent from the start of 2002, the Nasdaq, which more closely tracks the technology sector, is off 9.4 percent. The S.& P. 500 has lost 1.5 percent.
"People are nervous about earnings and they're afraid technology is going to take it on the chin; so they're not buying," said Jack Francis, managing director at UBS Warburg. --------------------

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler to Meet 2002 Profit Goals 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BERLIN, April 10 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler told shareholders at its annual meeting today that it would meet 2002 earnings goals as its Chrysler division returned to profitability.
 But the company abandoned goals for 2003, saying it had overestimated economic growth. 
 Chrysler had a slightly positive profit before interest and taxes in the first quarter after six losing quarters, DaimlerChrysler said. As a whole, the company will meet its revised 2002 goal of at least doubling last year's operating profit, its chief executive, Jurgen Schrempp, said. 
Shareholders criticized Mr. Schrempp at the meeting for failure to achieve profit goals. The carmaker had a loss of 662 million euros ($583 million) last year, the first since Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler in 1998. The company spent 4.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) reorganizing Chrysler and other divisions.
"Investors would prefer profits to endless possibilities," said Klaus Kaldemorgen, head of international equity fund management at DWS, Deutsche Bank's mutual fund manager, at the meeting. "The company has demanded a lot from shareholders with its expansion strategy."
The automaker had forecast operating profit for 2003 of 8.5 billion euros to 9.5 billion euros. In February, the company said that it would meet at slightly later dates its 2003 target, which was set in 2001.
"They had very optimistic forecasts that were overtaken by reality," said Peter Braendle, a money manager at Swissca Portfolio Management in Zurich.
The carmaker said it would meet its revised 2002 goal of profit before interest and tax of at least 2.6 billion euros, which was lowered in February from a previous forecast of 5.5 billion to 6.5 billion euros. It had a 2001 operating profit of 1.3 billion euros.
"The profit target for 2002 is a bit nebulous," said Georg Sturzer, an analyst at HypoVereinsbank.
The maker of Mercedes-Benz cars expects the United States car and light truck market to decline to 15 million this year from 16 million in 2001. Chrysler is offering sales incentives to lure buyers from General Motors and Ford Motor.
The company expects worldwide economic growth this year to be 1.4 percent instead of the 3 percent previously forecast.
"Due to projected economic trends we will only be able to achieve these targets at a somewhat later date," Mr. Schrempp said.
In New York, shares of DaimlerChrysler gained $1.65, to $45.81.

HEADLINE: Spotlight on Central Asia Is Finding Repression, Too 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, April 10 

 BODY:
The United States' newest strategic partners, the impoverished former Soviet republics of Central Asia, are undergoing a surge of repression and corruption just as they are attracting new world attention.
 Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, imprisoned two of his leading political rivals two weeks ago and has ignored objections about it from the United States and the European Union. Last week, Kazakhstan's prime minister admitted that more than $1 billion had been transferred to off-shore bank accounts in Mr. Nazarbayev's name. 
 In neighboring Kyrgyzstan, which is now hosting a new American air base for attacks on Afghanistan, the government has shut down two opposition newspapers. Last month, the police killed seven demonstrators protesting the imprisonment of a member of Parliament.
Uzbekistan, Central Asia's most populous country and the host of another military base used by the United States has one of the worst records in the region for human rights. As it has attempted to clamp down on people suspected of sympathizing with radical Islamic groups, experts say, Uzbekistan has raised major barriers with neighboring countries, disrupting the movement of both goods and people across state borders. 
Tajikistan, the region's poorest country, remains a central corridor for heroin smuggling.
The authoritarian turn in these Eurasian allies is problematic for Washington, which is relying on their support for the military operation in Afghanistan. The Bush administration has criticized the human rights record of several of the governments but has been careful not to undermine them.
All this provided a backdrop to gala meetings in Kazakhstan on Monday and Tuesday of the World Economic Forum's Eurasian Summit, which attracted hundreds of Western business executives and government officials.
At a packed cocktail party hosted by Mr. Nazarbayev on Monday night, top government officials quietly insisted that the recent political arrests were a mere legal problem and that the diverted money was a rainy-day fund in case of abrupt shortfalls in government revenue.
Prime Minister Imangali Tasmagambetov insisted that $400 million from the secret $1 billion fund had been drawn to cover government obligations in 1997, when the country was badly shaken by Russia's financial downturn.
At least in public, many executives at the conference seemed unconcerned. "I don't get involved in those issues," said one. "It has no impact on what we do at all."
Kazakhstan, a vast country that has emerged as one of the world's biggest new sources of oil, is drawing billions of dollars of investment from drilling and pipeline companies that include ChevronTexaco and Exxon Mobil. For it and neighboring countries in the region, the twin allures of tapping oil and helping in the American-led war against terrorism have brought elevated geopolitical significance.
"Since Sept. 11, a lot of our shareholders discerned the importance of this region, and we ourselves are going to take advantage of that to wield a cohesive policy," said James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, who is touring five Central Asian countries this week.
The World Bank, which loaned $3.5 billion to central Asian countries over the past 10 years, plans to loan at least $1.5 billion over the next 10 years. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development plans to invest $300 million over the next several years. The United States, on its own, is providing hundreds of millions of dollars in new assistance as well.
Even as the Eurasian conference was under way, several countries were cracking down harder than usual on political opponents.
Here in Kazakhstan, two founders of a new opposition party called Democratic Choice for Kazakhstan remained incarcerated throughout the conference. 
One of the men, Mukhtar Ablyazov, is a former governor who is also a founder of two opposition newspapers and an opposition television network called TAN. The other, Galymzhan Zhakiyanov, is a former energy minister. He took refuge for nearly a week in the French Embassy here and is now under house arrest.
Meanwhile, the government has shut down Mr. Ablyazov's newspapers, and an unidentified person blacked out TAN's broadcast in Almaty by shooting a cable that fed signals to its transmission tower.
Government leaders say both men have been charged with crimes: Mr. Ablyazov for soliciting prostitutes and Mr. Zhakiyanov for misusing his office as energy minister.
"It is nothing more than a criminal proceeding," said Karim Massimov, Kazakhstan's deputy prime minister. "It will be decided in court."
In Kyrgyzstan, police officers killed 7 people and wounded at least 17 others in mid-March at a protest rally in the village of Kerben. The country's leaders said the police had fired only after the protesters became violent. But last week, human rights groups revealed a police videotape of the incident that they said showed the police blocked a peaceful march and then fired on unarmed people.
"It was absolutely clear from the video that the protesters were unarmed," said Natalia Ablova, director of the Bureau on Human Rights and Rule of Law, a group based here. 
Some longtime observers believe, however, that Kyrgyzstan's president, Askar Akeyev, has been one of the region's more courageous reformers. He has ushered in a host of market-opening measures that reduced the power of old monopolies and encouraged competition.
But one senior Western diplomat said that political repression in Kyrgyzstan has deep roots. "They have been doing it for a long time," he said. "It's not better. It's not worse. It is manifesting itself in a different way."
Business executives and diplomats say that every country in Central Asia has a serious problem with corruption. In Tajikistan, for example, drug trafficking has become such an ingrained part of the economy that Western companies and lending institutions like the World Bank have largely stopped their activities there entirely.
The fear of infiltration by Muslim militants has added to the difficulties, causing countries like Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to impose ever tougher restrictions and higher barriers along their borders with neighboring countries. The Uzbeks have put mines along some of their border areas with Kyrgyzstan, which have killed many traders and shepherds.
"The new map of Central Asia is being defined by a process that is often antagonistic and tainted by strong-arm politics, economic pressures, shadowy back-room deals, nationalist sentiments and an environment of mutual mistrust," said the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that monitors tensions in the region.
It does not help that Uzbek leaders feel they are in constant rivalry with Kazakhstan to be recognized as the leaders of Central Asia. Thus, while almost everybody at the Eurasia meeting insisted on the need for "regional cooperation," top Uzbek leaders did not attend.

Yahoo Gains in Revenue, Aided by Online Dating Service

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
A series of hot dates has spiced up the otherwise bleak business at Yahoo.
 While advertising revenue continues to decline for Yahoo, the big Internet portal, fee income, especially from its rapidly growing online personals service, is making up the difference. 
 The company's revenue in the first quarter was $192.7 million, up 7 percent. Excluding revenue from HotJobs, the online help-wanted site that Yahoo bought in February, the company's sales were essentially flat with the $180 million it posted a year earlier and slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. 
Yahoo lost $53.6 million in the quarter, largely because of a $64 million charge related to changes in accounting.
Excluding that charge, the company earned $10.5 million, in contrast to a loss of $11.5 million in the period a year earlier. The profit translates to 2 cents a share, matching analysts' forecasts. 
"No bad news is good news for Yahoo," said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "They have made progress, but they haven't done anything impressive."
Shares of Yahoo, which announced its results after the markets closed, fell 2 cents, to $18.44.
Continuing a yearlong drop, Yahoo's advertising revenue was $121 million, down 15 percent for the year. Yahoo says that this year it still has $50 million to $60 million in revenue from long-term advertising contracts struck at the height of the Internet bubble, deals that are not being renewed as they expire.
And fee revenue, which is the area in which the company has the greatest hopes for growth, was $55 million, up 66 percent. The company said it now had about 500,000 subscribers to its various pay services, with the $19.95-a-month personals being the fastest growing. The company has been actively adding others, including premium versions of its e-mail and games offerings.
Revenue from transaction fees -- mainly commissions from merchandise bought on its shopping channel -- were $17 million, triple the amount a year earlier.
Yahoo's international network of affiliates lagged behind the United States, with revenue falling 21 percent, to $26 million. 
"The downturn in the advertising market began later internationally, and it is beginning to stabilize, as the United States did," said Terry Semel, Yahoo's chief executive. 
Yahoo's audience continues to grow. It counted a total of 237 million unique users worldwide in the quarter, compared with 192 million in the first quarter of 2001. 
Yahoo now says it expects revenue to be $205 million to $225 million in the second quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of $192 million. For all of 2002, Yahoo expects revenue of $870 million to $910 million, compared with expectations of $798 million. That would represent at least a 20 percent increase over last year, when Yahoo's revenue was $717 million. But it would still be well shy of the $1.1 billion in revenue the company posted in 2000.
Indeed, many of the initiatives on which Mr. Semel has based his turnaround plan will not start to take effect until the end of this year. Yahoo has high hopes for its joint venture to offer Internet service through SBC Communications and perhaps other cable and phone companies, and it is busily working on even more fee-based services. In addition to HotJobs, it is looking to build or buy services that compete with newspapers' classified sections in real estate and auto sales.
Interestingly, Yahoo did not report pro forma results -- a customized measure not in keeping with generally accepted accounting principles -- as it has since 1997. Such pro forma results, which were used by many Internet companies, have been widely criticized.
Susan Decker, Yahoo's chief financial officer, said it was dropping the pro forma measure because the new accounting rules allow it to take fewer quarterly charges relating to their acquisitions, although many, like Yahoo, have to make one-time adjustments this quarter.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Street Wars Grow Deadlier 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 10 

 BODY:
Danny Rodriguez rolled his tongue over the metal stud in his lower lip, palmed a fortune cookie from the bowl in front of him and shook it in his fist like a pair of dice.
 "I bet this says I'm going to die in two weeks," said Danny, a 17-year-old gang member, forcing a grin. 
 He came pretty close a few weeks ago. Some boys from outside the neighborhood crashed a party in Cypress Park, just down the street from his home in northeast Los Angeles. Glares gave way to insults. Next came the guns. Bullets struck three of Danny's friends. When the melee ended, one boy from the rival gang lay dead. 
"He should have known better," said Danny, shrugging his shoulders. Sympathy is too scarce to waste on strangers, he explained.
To the alarm of a city already hardened by a history of street wars, gang killings, after picking up pace significantly over the last two years, are mounting at an even faster rate this year. If the surge continues, the casualty count would be one of the highest in a decade. 
In the first two months of 2002 alone, there were 63 gang-related homicides, more than triple the number for the same period two years ago and almost double the average over the past five years. Though the official statistics for March have not yet been tabulated, officials say the gang murder rate was equally high, leading residents to rally for cease-fires and spurring a volley of recriminations in the Los Angeles Police Department over who or what is responsible. 
After starting out at a relatively mild pace in the early months of 2000, the number of killings built up momentum toward the end of the year, with a total of 331 deaths. The accelerated pace continued, reaching 346 killings by the end of 2001, and has only quickened since then.
Much of the blame for the rising violence has fallen on Chief Bernard C. Parks, whose request for a second term was denied on Tuesday by the Los Angeles Police Commission, in part because of gang problems. 
But many current and former gang members say there is another reason for the rise in violence, one that has little to do with the police: Truces between gangs, forged and maintained over the last decade, are unraveling. New gang members carry with them only dim memories of the devastating violence that prompted the creation of the pacts in the first place.
"Unfortunately, people my age and younger, they're not worried about people killing each other," said James Scott, 21, a member of the Bounty Hunters, one of the many subsets of the Bloods. "As long as it's not them dying, they're not losing any sleep over it." 
Struck by the gangs themselves to quell a surge of killings in the early 1990's, the truces range from informal cease-fires to signed treaties, some of which have lasted as long as a decade. Communities have reinforced the peace, often using government money to hire former gang members as mediators who push for dialogue when tensions flare. 
But even some longstanding truces have begun experiencing strain. With an air of celebration last April, gang leaders dragged a conference table into the middle of a street in the Watts neighborhood to expand a nine-year-old treaty between Crips and Bloods. The pledge they signed condemned the "barbarous acts that have outraged the conscience of mankind." Since then, however, gang-related crimes in the area have increased more than 43 percent, according to police statistics.
There are similar stories across the city. Tenuous truces in northeast Los Angeles have snapped. Even relatively solid treaties among West Side gangs -- in Culver City, Venice and Santa Monica -- have ruptured. 
"Right now, there is no truce anymore," said Manny Lares, a gang member who runs Barrios Unidos, a group in Santa Monica that tries to stop gangs from fighting. 
The surge in violence stems from a confluence of factors, but perhaps none so tangible as the troubles plaguing the police department, whose officers are steadily migrating to other, quieter cities in the surrounding suburbs of Orange County. After years of scandal, the department is having a difficult time bringing in new recruits. 
"We're finding it hard to attract people to our business," said John Michael Cota, a Los Angeles police detective who specializes in gangs. 
As the size of the force shrinks, the pipelines into gang life are open. Every year, more than 1,000 parolees return to Los Angeles, often with few job prospects and little commitment to truces struck in their absence.
There are also serious economic issues. Gang violence fell in the 1990's, in some measure because of California's booming economy, and the jobs it brought to Los Angeles's most depressed communities. But the recent downturn hit these neighborhoods with particular force, and the recovery has been slow. While the city's unemployment rate of 6.4 percent in February was only slightly above the state average, the jobless rate in many neighborhoods where gangs are prevalent is twice as high.
"We have people calling us all the time for work, but we don't have the jobs available for them," said Alex Sanchez, a former gang member now with Homies Unidos, a gang intervention group. "It makes it really difficult to sustain these truces."
Some Los Angeles officials go further, blaming the city's inattention in the late 1990's, when gang violence dropped sharply while the economy was booming. With gangs out of the news, the city made little effort to embark on initiatives that have helped keep youths out of gangs: after-school programs, job-training classes, drug treatment services.
"We really didn't step in with enough resources," said Jitahadi Imara, the Los Angeles County Probation Department's juvenile division chief, saying "the failure to do that is probably the most significant factor" in the current killings.
Now that the city is grappling with a $250 million deficit, gang prevention programs face an even more uncertain future. "We're not sure what's going to happen," said John Chavez, director of the Los Angeles Bridges Project, which finances the city's gang intervention agencies.
Schools find themselves stretched particularly thin, with tight budgets and a student body that grew 15 percent in the last decade.
"Kids in gangs, they're kind of the result of our negligence in the school district," said Henry Torres, an administrator for the Unified School District's after-school programs. 
In the city's continuation schools, where children with troubled academic careers go, the school day ends in the early afternoon. After that, students are often on their own. 
As the violence intensifies, some former gang members say that the groundwork for a lasting truce is unexpectedly being laid. Killing has reached the point where all but a few have grown weary of it, prompting gang members across several generations to resume talk of cease-fires.
"It's going to get worse before it actually gets better," said Aqeela Sherrills, who helped forge a truce between Crips and Bloods 10 years ago. "But what gives me hope is that people are constantly coming back to the table." 
For his part, Danny Rodriguez has become tired of gang life, which he took up for protection when he entered high school.
Quitting is another matter, though. If he manages to scrounge up the money to have the tattoos taken off his arm, there is still the problem of living down the block from fellow gang members who might not be willing to let him leave.
"I just got myself into something that's hard to get out of," he said.

HEADLINE: Atlantic Carriers Cut Capacity 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 10 

 BODY:
CP Ships Ltd., which moves about 50 percent of its cargo on North Atlantic routes, said it and other carriers agreed to cut capacity between the United States and Europe as demand falls. 
 CP Ships and the Grand Alliance carriers will provide slots on their vessels for containers that would have been carried by the Cosco Shipping Company, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and Yang Ming Marine Transport between the United States and Europe, a spokeswoman, Elizabeth Canna, said. 
 The agreement, which will eliminate a string of five ships weekly with a combined capacity of 10,000 20-foot equivalent units, comes after rising competition and the recession forced freight rates lower in the last year, which in turn led to a reduced fourth-quarter profit at CP Ships. 
The proposed space-sharing agreement among the lines requires approval from the Federal Maritime Commission in the United States and European Union regulators.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ENERGY MARKET; 
Signs Enron Bet on Price Increase Before California Power Shortage

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
In the middle of 2000, on the eve of the California energy crisis, Enron was making increasingly large bets that electricity prices in the state would increase, according to Enron records cited by a California state senator leading an investigation into the state's power crisis.
 The state senator, Joseph Dunn, is scheduled to testify Thursday in Washington before a United States Senate Commerce Committee hearing that will examine whether Enron manipulated power prices in California in 2000 and 2001, contributing to a surge in electricity prices that pushed California into a fiscal crisis. 
 Soon after the crisis began, California officials began accusing Enron and other energy companies of artificially causing shortages. But the energy companies, and some economists, have said that state officials created a deeply flawed energy market that led to the crisis. They said a big downturn in the availability of hydropower from the Pacific Northwest also played a significant role. 
In other Enron-related developments in Washington today, House lawmakers prepared to do battle on Thursday over legislation to improve pension safeguards in the wake of Enron's collapse. Democratic leaders, who plan to introduce their own bill, said the Republican proposal offered cosmetic changes and scaled back some current safeguards. But Republicans said that they had proposed substantial reforms and that the Democratic legislation could lead some companies to curb pension coverage by imposing burdensome new rules.
In his prepared remarks to the Senate panel on Thursday, according to an advance copy of the testimony, Mr. Dunn, a Democrat from Orange County, will say that internal Enron records obtained by his state investigating committee showed that in the months before the energy crisis, Enron was making larger and larger bets that the price of electricity in California was going to rise.
"We know from the daily position reports, which Enron provided our committee, that as the summer of 2000 approached, Enron's traders had taken increasingly 'long' positions in the market, meaning they had a growing amount of electricity to sell," Mr. Dunn will say.
Mr. Dunn also plans to testify that while the company was aggressively lobbying California officials to deregulate the state's electricity market, and promising big benefits for consumers, Enron documents showed that the company's "internal predictions do not appear to support" these "hyperbolic promises."
In addition, Mr. Dunn will assert that in 2000, before natural gas prices began a similar surge in California, Enron went from being "short," or betting that gas prices would fall, to betting that prices would rise. "Staggering shifts, a veritable sea change, from short to long positions are found in Enron's own books," he will say.
An Enron spokesman declined to comment today, but in the past the company has denied assertions that it played any role in the skyrocketing prices for electricity that crippled the state. Instead, Enron officials, and executives of other energy companies, have said that California officials deserved the blame for policies that stymied construction of power plants and made it hard for utilities to lock down long-term supplies of power, forcing them to obtain supplies from an increasingly volatile spot market.
Executives at Enron, which until it collapsed last year was the world's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, have maintained that the company made little profit from big moves in energy prices, generating profits instead by taking a tiny cut of the trades it did.
The California energy crisis finally eased last summer, as prices for electricity and natural gas dropped. California officials have credited the change to their decision to sign long-term contracts to buy power, as well as conservation by consumers and wholesale price caps applied by federal regulators. Energy companies have said cooler weather and other factors played a role.
Some lawmakers have questioned whether the steep drop in West Coast energy prices may have accelerated Enron's collapse, as profits from inflated power and gas prices were no longer able to cloak the company's financial problems.
Meanwhile, in the House today, even Democratic aides conceded that their pension proposal was certain to lose out to the Republican bill, but they hoped few Democrats would vote for the other side. 
Tonight, one crucial Democrat, Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, said in an interview that he would probably vote against the Republican proposal, even though it incorporates significant provisions of a bill on which he was a sponsor.
Mr. Cardin, who has written pension legislation with Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, that has enjoyed wide bipartisan support, said he could not support the Republican proposal because, among other things, it went too far in allowing investment firms with potential conflicts of interest to advise employees on pension investment decisions.
Karen Friedman, director of policy strategies at the Pension Rights Center, said that the Republican bill "will do nothing to protect against future Enrons, will not protect employees who lose money in Enron-type situations, and, in fact, will roll back worker protections under current law."
But James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the American Benefits Council, which represents large employers, said the investment advice provisions might be the most beneficial to workers. "It provides meaningful new tools to 401(k) investors to manage their retirement accounts and get professional advice with respect to investment decisions," he said. 
Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the House Education and Workforce Committee, which produced the bill that is serving as the platform for the Republican legislation, said it would be hard for some Democrats to vote against the bill.
"It's hard to go home to your district," Mr. Smith said, "and say you voted against a modest compromise bill that would have done quite a few things that would have helped Enron workers."

PERSON: Alison Hurt 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
A Closing, and Hope of Another Opening

BYLINE:  By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
TIME was Tom Cruise, dining with Nicole Kidman at Alison on Dominick Street, was so touched by a marriage proposal he witnessed that he picked up the check for the happy couple. 
 The SoHo restaurant with the navy blue banquettes was often cited as one of the most romantic spots in town; there were always proposals, says the owner Alison Hurt. Sometimes there were two or three a week. 
 Now, Tom and Nicole are finished and the relationship of the moment at Alison involves the officers who guard the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, just down the street, who pop into the restaurant to use the bathroom. 
The restaurant's location, a sharp rise in rent, the economy, and the Sept. 11 attack have all hurt business, Ms. Hurt says. After 13 years, it will be closing next month with hopes of moving uptown. 
"SoHo has not recovered, I don't care what anybody says," Ms. Hurt says. "Nobody is full down there. There are a few places that seem to be doing fine, trendier places like Raoul's; he owns a building, restaurants that own buildings can creep through. I pulled our numbers and January was very good, but it's a struggle getting people to come out. They don't want to be that far away from home." 
Could it be that the restaurant, operating in a trendy world, simply has had its moment? 
"No," says Ms. Hurt, taking no offense. "Because if it were about trendy, we wouldn't have lasted beyond three or four years." 
A little laugh. "That crowd moves very fast, let me tell you." 
Privileged and artistic. That was the world of Ms. Hurt, growing up, and that's the world echoed in the dining room at the restaurant. There are black and white photographs of France taken by Ms. Hurt's older brother, a photographer at Vanity Fair. The subjects include the parents of the au pair Ms. Hurt had growing up and Elaine Kaufman, the owner of Elaine's. 
MS. Hurt, 45, is still of a privileged world. There is an apartment on the Upper East Side and a house in Sag Harbor. She operates a second restaurant, Alison by the Beach, in Sagaponack, and frets, jokingly, about her 4-year-old son's nursery school problems. "My alma mater and he was wait-listed," she says, laughing. "I was shocked. And they wouldn't tell me why." Her watch is a vintage Rolex. She has the blond looks and understated style of a Ralph Lauren girl. But inside, one starts to suspect, is the heart of a tender truck stop waitress. 
Consider, for instance, her approach to one beleaguered celebrity guest.
"Monica Lewinsky came a lot, and people said to me, 'Alison, you've got to call somebody.' I said, 'You know what? That girl has had enough press. Let her have her dinner in peace.' Though it was tempting." There was also the incident of the man who tossed a glass of Champagne at his date and walked out. "So I had dinner with her," Ms. Hurt says. "I said, you stay, get rid of him."
What did they talk about? 
"Clothes. When something like that happens you get off the subject as fast as you can." 
What makes a woman want to go into the restaurant business? 
Ms. Hurt, who grew up on the Upper East Side, is not certain she can tell you -- except to theorize that all those French movies she saw as a child might have been an influence. Her father, A. William J. Becker 3rd, was an owner of Janus Films, the source for European art films in the 50's. Her mother, Patricia Birch Becker, was a dancer and choreographer. Ms. Hurt attended Miss Hewitt's, Rosemary Hall, then Boston University and Columbia University, and worked for a time as a dancer and actress. Her best-known film was perhaps "Grease II."
"I was Rhonda Ritter, one of the pink ladies -- you know, there were the T Birds and the Pink Ladies," Ms. Hurt says.
Wait -- your mother directed that movie! 
"Yeah, but she did not give me that role easily," Ms. Hurt says. "She made me fly out to L.A. twice." 
Ms. Hurt worked as a receptionist and general manager in restaurants around town before opening Alison on Dominick. For the first two years, Ms. Hurt says, she had no social life; she was making romantic evenings for other people and calling her mother and telling her she was going to be "a lonely old bag for the rest of my life." In 1992, however, she met the writer Harry Hurt 3rd. 
"Originally I wasn't going to date him, because he was supposedly a very bad boy," Ms. Hurt says. "I told somebody who was trying to fix us up he was the last man on earth I would ever date. And he was." 
They married in the summer of 1993, in Southampton. 
Ms. Hurt, sitting under the photo of Elaine Kaufman, reflects on her advice about going into the restaurant business. 
"Elaine told me I shouldn't do this because it would eat me up alive, but I did manage to get married and have a baby," Ms. Hurt says. "But there are lots of trade-offs. Time off with your child, time alone with your husband, time for yourself. Somebody always gets cheated, either somebody's mad at you or you're mad at yourself." 
It will be nice, this summer, to have only one restaurant to worry about.

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
21st-Century Plans, but Along 18th-Century Paths

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap; David W. Dunlap's column on urban planning issues will appear in the Metro Section on alternate Thursdays.

 BODY:
FROM a new Freedom Park to a sunken West Street to a transit hub that would link PATH, the subway and regional rail service, a host of principles have now been laid out to guide the downtown reconstruction.
 Presented with an opportunity that no one wanted but almost everyone wants to exploit, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation announced on Wednesday that one of its goals would be to "restore all or a portion of the street grid and reintegrate the former World Trade Center site to the rest of downtown." 
 But planning isn't as simple as having a grand idea or good intentions. And the fabric of downtown is not blank. As a practical matter, its future will rest on details as small and tangible as how many transformer vaults can be squeezed together in a single block. 
While public attention in recent months has focused on big questions -- should the entire site be set aside as a memorial? should the towers themselves be replicated? -- planners, architects and engineers have tried to figure out how to recreate a long-lost segment of Greenwich Street between Barclay and Vesey Streets. This was the site of 7 World Trade Center, the 47-story tower owned by Larry A. Silverstein that was destroyed Sept. 11.
The tentative solution would require some expensive contortions and compromises in the design of the building that is to replace 7 World Trade Center. It begins to suggest how difficult the larger reconstruction process will be, even when there is general agreement on a principle, as there seems to be about reopening Greenwich Street, at least as a pedestrian and view corridor.
Things are moving faster on the 7 World Trade Center site than elsewhere in part because the Consolidated Edison Company had its Trade Center Substation there, with 10 transformers through which many Lower Manhattan customers received power. Con Ed says it must restore at least four of the lost transformers by the summer of 2003.
That has contributed a sense of urgency to the search for a solution, beyond the economic interest that Mr. Silverstein has in rebuilding.
IT is a measure of Lower Manhattan's complexity that a 21st-century office tower should be shaped by an 18th-century roadbed. Greenwich Street, the route from New York to the village of Greenwich, ran uninterrupted from Battery Place almost to West 14th Street until a five-block stretch was cut out in 1966 to create the World Trade Center site.
Parts of Washington, Fulton, Dey and Cortlandt Streets were also closed, turning 14 city blocks into two superblocks. At the time, urban planners were keen to replace the downtown crazy-quilt street pattern, which they saw as a straitjacket, with broad plazas from which enormous buildings could rise.
On the smaller trade center superblock, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey built the Con Ed substation. Twenty years later, Mr. Silverstein added his tower directly over the substation.
Seven World Trade Center was a formidable obstacle, physically and visually, between TriBeCa and Lower Manhattan.
In its absence, you can see from Barclay Street all the way to 1 Bankers Trust Plaza at Liberty Street and, farther down, to the old Electric Bond and Share Building at 2 Rector Street. Between them is a sliver of light, a slice of sky, an intimation of the harbor beyond.
Given that compelling view, and the general repudiation of the superblock concept in recent decades, it is not surprising that recreating the Greenwich Street right of way was among the first objectives of planners.
But opening that 60-foot-wide swath is not easy. It leaves a plot only 170 feet wide, barely enough to fit five transformers abreast. Con Ed says it must have space for 10 transformer vaults. Each transformer distributes up to about 80 megawatts of power and requires a 32-by-40-foot enclosure. Because they weigh almost 150 tons apiece, transformers are generally installed on the ground floor.
The ground floor must also accommodate an office lobby, a core with nearly 30 elevators and truck loading docks. To find room, the architects at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill proposed to squeeze them like a sandwich between two banks of five transformers.
They could only achieve this layout by expanding the building area 22 feet farther south than the site occupied by 7 World Trade Center (although the planned tower would line up with its Vesey Street neighbors). The question of who owned the 22-foot strip and how it could be acquired further vexed the process.
WHAT has tentatively emerged is a parallelogram-shaped building that would rise 736 feet, about 10 stories taller than 7 World Trade Center. Because the floors would be smaller, the new tower would have 300,000 square feet of space less than Mr. Silverstein planned to rebuild.
Those unused development rights would almost certainly affect the future of surrounding blocks. So will the architectural gesture of hewing to the line of Greenwich Street, which may make its extension southward through the main trade center site seem almost irresistible.
"Greenwich Street is not only symbolically important, but it is an important first step," said Amanda M. Burden, chairwoman of the City Planning Commission. "It's about beginning to interconnect the totally disconnected elements of Lower Manhattan."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Reclaiming Greenwich Street"After much effort, planners, architects and engineers have found a way to recreate the 60-foot-wide route of Greenwich Street through the site of 7 World Trade Center. Map of Lower Manhattan highlighting area around Greenwich Street shows as it was before the World Trade Center, as it was before Sept. 11, and as it might be developed.

 Andersen has agreed to a government condition that it admit it committed a crime by destroying documents related to Enron last fall. The tentative agreements amount to a turnabout for Andersen, which has loudly proclaimed its innocence since it was indicted last month. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Survivors in Oklahoma City Fear New Office at Bomb Site 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, April 10 

 BODY:
The Oklahoma City National Memorial is only eight blocks from Cathy Coulter's downtown office, yet she detours to avoid passing the huge bronze gates and the 168 chairs symbolizing each person killed in the 1995 bombing here. Her friends died there, and she nearly died, too. 
 The memories are too painful. 
 So on Tuesday afternoon, after an e-mail message unexpectedly pinged onto computer screens at her office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ms. Coulter began to sob. Her boss, Mel Martinez, the secretary of housing and urban development, had decided that her office here must move next year to a new federal center that will replace the bombed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. It will be across the street from the memorial, which stands on the Murrah site.
Last summer, Mr. Martinez wrote a letter stating that the employees would not have to go to the new building. But housing officials in Washington, citing the changed priorities of the post-Sept. 11 world, said this week that Mr. Martinez had changed his mind because not moving to the new building would be akin to bowing to terrorists. 
Employees like Ms. Coulter, who survived the bombing by crouching in a darkened bathroom, are terrified to return daily to the Murrah area, not only because of the emotional strain, but because many of them fear that just as the World Trade Center was a target twice, they may be, too.
"My stomach is shaking so bad right now that it's just like I'm going to throw up," Ms. Coulter, 51, said on Tuesday afternoon. "It's hard to breathe. Think what it will be like to go over there."
Before Sept. 11, this city held the unwanted title of the site of the worst terrorist attack on American soil. This month, with the April 19 bombing anniversary approaching, few places are grieving as deeply as the local HUD office. It lost 35 people in the bombing, the most of any federal agency. More than half the current employees, 55 in all, are survivors, many of whom have spent years in therapy for post-traumatic stress syndrome.
That a new federal building would be built here has not been in doubt. Congress appropriated money for a building soon after Timothy J. McVeigh parked a Ryder truck in front of the Murrah building and exploded his bomb. The appropriation was touted as evidence that terrorism could not prevent the federal government from doing its business. 
"From the beginning we've called it a 'commitment' building, a statement building that says we will not be chased away," said Leonard Murphy, an acting regional administrator with the General Services Administration, which is overseeing the building project. 
"Nobody ever thought twice about rebuilding the section of the Pentagon that was hit on Sept. 11," Mr. Murphy said. "We didn't think twice about rebuilding this federal building right back downtown." 
But the question of where the new building would be, and what it would look like, have been a sensitive ones for many survivors. Some survivors and relatives of those who died find comfort in the memorial, working as volunteers and visiting the area. Others have never gone back.
Calvin Moser, a HUD supervisor and a former president of a survivors' association, is one of those volunteers. But, Mr. Moser said, "when I don't feel like going, I call them. I don't get that option if I work there. I have to go to work." He blamed local politics for the location, saying city leaders are most concerned with revitalizing a downtrodden stretch of downtown.
Mr. Moser and others have criticized the design, which calls for a curved facade on a central building with high exterior glass windows. He said the curved shape is reminiscent of the bombed husk of the Murrah building and that the emphasis on glass reminds many survivors of the shards that exploded like shrapnel.
"And this is supposed to give people comfort?" Mr. Moser asked. "You've got to be kidding me."
Vickie Hamm, who works for the Army recruiting station and is president of the same survivors' association of which Mr. Moser was once the chairman, said HUD is not the only agency whose employees are concerned. Her office lost eight people in the bombing and is moving to the new building, a decision that does not bother her. But, she noted, "most people would prefer not to go."
Mr. Murphy said any anxiety about the new location is misplaced. He said the building will cost $40.4 million and is scheduled to open in September 2003, housing 500 employees. 
He said HUD will be one of three "anchor" tenants, along with a military recruitment processing center and a division of the Social Security Administration. Other agencies once housed in the Murrah building, including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Agriculture, will also be there.
But the same office of Social Security that was in the Murrah building is not returning. Nor is a very small office of the Department of Labor. Mr. Murphy's own agency, General Services, will place 8 of its 16 local employees in the building. He said that, for now, there is not enough room for the rest.
Mayor Kirk Humphreys of Oklahoma City acknowledged that city officials hoped that the new building would help the area of downtown that had not recovered from the bombing. He said shops and restaurants moved away after the blast and real estate sales in the area had been virtually frozen since then.
But Mr. Humphreys also emphasized the symbolic significance of rebuilding beside the Murrah site, particularly after Sept. 11: "One argument we made with Washington is that we need to rebuild there so the terrorists don't win." Asked about survivors who fear going back and might even take medical leave rather than do so, he said, "I don't have a response to that."
Federal officials emphasized that security concerns are paramount. The building will be set back from the sidewalks. Parking will be prohibited on the streets surrounding the building to prevent another truck bomb. "I think lightning does not strike twice," Mr. Murphy said.
Virginia Fredman, a HUD employee for 15 years, is less easily convinced. She was at a meeting on the morning of the bombing and returned minutes later to find two of her best friends dead and the bodies of others strewn in the rubble. She worries that the proximity to the memorial and its adjacent museum could provide a tempting target for a terrorist eager to strike a raw nerve in the American psyche.
"If you already had been targeted for death, would you go again?" Ms. Fredman asked. "Especially when you've seen your friends die."
Even seven years later, the memory of the bombing is still fresh in the HUD offices. There is a sculpture of a tree on a wall in a waiting room that lists the names of the agency's bombing survivors on leaves. Those who died are named on leaves that have fallen to the ground. There is a room marked "Reflections" where employees have placed mementos of their lost co-workers.
Some employees like Ms. Fredman are considering taking medical disability. Others are uncertain if they can survive without their job. "I will have to go," said Sherri Coleman, 43, a HUD employee whose desk on the eighth floor was inches from where the building collapsed. 
Edie King, a psychologist who has led therapy sessions for HUD survivors, said many have struggled for years just to become functional employees again. She said daily contact with the Murrah site could be disastrous. "They just don't need that every day," she said. "I just can't imagine why people are so insensitive, expecting people to do that." She added: "You're supposed to suck it up and go. That's the American way. There's not a whole lot of sympathy."
Ms. Coulter is still haunted by the darkness of that bathroom where she crouched during the blast. Every night, she switches on a night light before bed, as if she were a child. "Seven years later, we still have nightmares," Ms. Coulter said. "And I'm still afraid of the dark. I read somewhere that the people in New York are healing.
"Well," she said, "they're not. It's going to take a long time."

HEADLINE: 2nd Day of Antigovernment Protests Slows Venezuela 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 10 

 BODY:
A confrontation between antigovernment protesters and President Hugo Chavez roiled Venezuela for a second day today. Exports of crude oil sagged, and two generals spoke out against the president. 
 In the second day of a nationwide work stoppage by labor and business leaders incensed by Mr. Chavez's left-leaning policies, thousands of protesters took to the streets, where sporadic clashes broke out with pro-government demonstrators. The United States, which depends on Venezuela for 15 percent of its oil imports, closely monitored the protests. 
 Further disruptions are widely expected in the days ahead, after protest organizers announced that the strike that they called on Tuesday morning would extend indefinitely. 
Mr. Chavez's ministers acknowledged for the first time that the strike had hurt oil production, but they played down the disruptions and said the production problems could be easily corrected.
"Oil operations are absolutely normal at this moment," the energy and mines minister, Alvaro Silva, said.
But oil experts here and abroad said tankers were idle at terminals as refineries had dramatically cut back operations. Venezuela, with the largest proven oil reserves outside the Middle East, produces 2.5 million barrels a day, shipping 1.3 million of crude and an additional 300,000 barrels of refined products like gasoline and heating oil to the United States.
A barrel of oil has 42 gallons.
"There are some ships on the sea right now, but from what we know there is no loading of tankers in Venezuela," said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-supported consulting group in New York. "Their refineries are operating at well below normal capacity," including plants in Venezuela and elsewhere in the Caribbean. 
The effects were not likely to be felt in the United States right away, because tankers take nearly a week to travel to refineries in Louisiana. Venezuela also has substantial storage capacity, here, in the Bahamas and in Curacao, able to hold 35 million barrels of crude and refined products, said Luis Giuisti, a former president of the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela.
Experts said, however, an extended strike could damage the oil-dependent economy and be troubling for the United States, which has viewed Venezuela as a dependable oil exporter.
The government's woes seemed to worsen when an army commander, Brig. Gen. Nestor Gonzalez, criticized the president today at a news conference, accusing Mr. Chavez of supporting leftist rebels in neighboring Colombia and governing like an autocrat. 
General Gonzalez suggested that the military might act against the president.
"If the high command has to say to the president, 'Mr. President, the cause of all of this is you, now leave,' then the high command has to take that position," General Gonzalez said.
Another general, Rafael Damiani of the National Guard, urged the military not to use force against protesters.
The message caused confusion, because the government has not resorted to violence. Several ministers denied that there were plans to use force or enact a state of emergency.
The officers' statements prompted Defense Minister Jose Vicente Rangel to warn that disciplinary action would be taken against the dissident officers. He stressed to reporters that the military remained loyal to Mr. Chavez, a former army paratrooper who tried to take power in a coup in 1992, before he eventually won election six years later. 
"The situation is absolutely normal in the military field," Mr. Rangel said.
The strike began on Tuesday, after labor and business leaders had decided that it was the only step that they could take to prod Mr. Chavez to reverse his decision to appoint five allies to the board of Petroleos de Venezuela.
Much of the opposition is rooted in widespread displeasure with Mr. Chavez's policies. White-collar workers view him as a left-wing autocrat. Unions resent his attempts to impose his control on them. 
Thousands of people have taken to plazas and busy avenues to call for Mr. Chavez's resignation.
Officials said most Venezuelans continued to support Mr. Chavez, adding that few people took part in the work stoppage, which began to wane in its second day.

HEADLINE: Relaunching Governors Island 

BYLINE:  By Robert Yaro and Robert Pirani; Robert Yaro and Robert Pirani are, respectively, president and director of environmental programs at Regional Plan Association.

 BODY:
President Bush's recent declaration that he will return Governors Island to the city and state of New York for a nominal payment is welcome news indeed. Since President Bill Clinton first offered to transfer the island to New York State for a dollar in 1995, this beautiful property has languished, its empty buildings symbolic of governmental paralysis.
 Mr. Bush's gesture recognizes both New York's free transfer of the island to the United States Army in 1800 and the role Governors Island can play in the rebirth of Lower Manhattan, which is about seven minutes away from the island by ferry. 
 Governors Island has played a storied role in American history. Lord Jeffrey Amherst, Confederate prisoners, Wilbur Wright and Walt Disney (in the brig during World War I) all spent time on the island. Their presence is almost palpable when one walks in the National Historic Landmark District, an unmatched assemblage of 19th century fortifications, landscaped grounds and buildings in federal and Victorian styles.
The vision put forward by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki for establishing a City University campus on the island could become the latest installment in the island's saga. Making education the centerpiece will enable the federal government to reappraise the value of the island, making possible a no- or low-cost transfer to the city and state. But beyond getting around political and legal factors, education is a use that clearly makes sense for an island location with historic buildings. Expanding higher education could also be a key component in lower Manhattan's economic renewal. At the same time, it will be important to create a new park and civic spaces that allow public access to the island for the first time in centuries.
Realizing this vision will take careful planning as well as bold strokes. Previous pronouncements for the island's future have floundered as elected leaders struggled with difficult political relationships as well as the considerable challenges of reusing the island in ways that would benefit the public and make economic sense for the private investors who will probably be part of any final financing arrangement.
Now there may be a chance to overcome that history. The cordial relationship between Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Pataki, and their ability to speak with one voice to the president, helped bring about the president's offer. The city and state now need to establish a governance structure for the island that recognizes its educational mission and other public interests, with efforts made to include the voices of the City Council and New York's Congressional delegation. The city and state also must carry out the necessary legal commitments so that the federal government can legitimately transfer the property.
In the meantime, a portion of Governors Island could be enjoyed by the public soon. President Clinton designated two forts on the island -- Castle Williams and Fort Jay -- as the Governors Island National Monument just before he left office in January 2001. But three months later, the Justice Department said the island should be sold in accord with its budgetary status as "disposable" federal property. Resolving these conflicting opinions, through Congressional or presidential action, could open the monument and its 20-acre park to the public.
On June 2, a long-planned flotilla of more than 1,000 boats will converge on the island. The purpose is to celebrate both the proud history and the future of Governors Island. The recent agreement by the mayor, governor and president may finally bring this lovely spot in New York Harbor back within our reach.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Oil Cutoff Tied to Drilling in Alaska 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that Saddam Hussein's decision to cut off Iraq's oil exports for at least a month, or until Israel pulls out of the West Bank, makes it urgent for the Senate to allow drilling for oil in the Alaska wildlife refuge. 
 In spite of that warning, though, there was no evidence that Iraq's move would end the deadlock in the Senate, where environmental concerns have so far blocked a vote on drilling in Alaska. 
 Even as the White House was declaring that an Iraqi cutoff could further raise gasoline and heating oil prices, oil prices were dropping on the futures market, at least partly because of indications that Saudi Arabia and other major producers would make up any production shortfall.
"The president knows that ANWR represents 46 years' worth of imports of oil from Saddam Hussein's Iraq," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said today, using a somewhat aggressive estimate of the amount of reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. "And the president thinks that Saddam Hussein's threat, the promise to cut off oil, is another reason why our nation needs a comprehensive energy plan that is independent of such threats." 
The White House announcement was the most explicit effort yet to use the turmoil in the Middle East to press for what has become a symbolically vital part of its national energy plan. Last year, Mr. Bush said the economic downturn in the United States was an argument for proceeding with the drilling.
So far, however, Republicans concede that neither argument has enabled them to assemble the 60 votes needed to overcome the opponents of drilling in the refuge and force a vote on the issue.
Last month, the administration vigorously opposed an effort in the Senate to raise fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and trucks sold in the United States, a change that advocates had argued would save far more oil than Iraq or the Alaska wildlife refuge could produce.
White House officials insisted there was no contradiction in the policy, contending that by mandating stricter mileage standards, Congress would force auto companies to produce more small, unsafe cars.
"We will come back with another, more flexible plan" on mileage standards, Mr. Fleischer said today, though he did not say when. 
Even before the Iraqi cutoff, lawmakers from both parties agreed that the United States should become less dependent on imported oil. But partisan and regional differences -- and ferocious lobbying -- have left Congress paralyzed.
Most Republicans believe the solution lies in more oil production, particularly exploration in the wildlife refuge on Alaska's north coast. Most Democrats hold that the solution is conservation, particularly stiffer fuel efficiency standards.
Both sides are so locked into their positions that compromise appears to be out of the question, even if the Mideast is in turmoil and Venezuela, a main producer of gasoline, is suffering from political instability and strikes at refineries and oil fields.
"In some ways," a senior administration official said today, "we're more concerned about how Venezuela could affect prices" than about Iraq's effect.
Iraq has produced 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day in recent times, mostly shipped through a pipeline to Turkey. That flow has stopped in recent days, American intelligence officials confirm.
The Senate, controlled by Democrats, began debating energy legislation more than a month ago, and a final vote is not likely until next week at the earliest. But the outcome is hardly in doubt. The final bill will almost certainly include neither new drilling in Alaska nor tougher mileage standards.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said today that he would offer an amendment this week to allow exploration in the wildlife refuge. Democrats have promised to filibuster the measure, and Republicans concede they lack the 60 votes needed to stop it.
Last year, the Republican-controlled House voted narrowly to allow drilling in the refuge. Whatever energy bill the Senate approves will end up in a conference to resolve the differences with the House bill.
But Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, a key Republican on energy issues, said that unless the Senate approved exploration in Alaska as part of its bill, the final measure would not include it either.
Last month, by a vote of 62 to 38, the Senate rejected a bill to require that the average mileage of vehicles sold in the United States rise to 36 miles a gallon by 2016, from about 24 miles a gallon now. Several Democrats from automobile-producing states broke ranks and voted with the Republicans.
Federal fuel efficiency requirements have not been changed since 1985, and the mileage average has fallen for years because of the increasing popularity of sport utility vehicles, which are not subject to the same standards as cars.
This week, Senator Murkowski and his allies have made the same argument as Mr. Bush, that the threat from Iraq's decision to stop exports and the general strike in Venezuela underscored the need for more domestic oil exploration, especially in Alaska.
On Tuesday, they turned out representatives of several Jewish organizations, including B'nai Brith International and the American Jewish Congress, who said the security of Israel and the United States depended on more oil production.
Some Republicans today were considering a proposal in which they would support giving steel manufacturers relief from the cost of death benefits and health care for retired workers in return for support of drilling in the refuge from Democratic senators from steel states. 
But the White House has opposed this kind of relief for the steel industry, and there was little indication today that this plan would produce enough votes to break any filibuster.
Democrats countered that even if drilling in the refuge began today, no new oil would be available for a decade. They said the Republicans' refusal to support tougher fuel-efficiency requirements showed they were not truly concerned about energy independence. 
"The Middle East crisis is far too complicated to be calmed by drilling in the Arctic, and the fact that we're hearing such a far-flung argument tells me that our opponents don't have the votes," Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said.
Also today, the Senate shelved a proposal that would have tightened federal regulation of financial instruments called derivatives in energy trading.
The proposal was opposed by most Republicans, and the sponsor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, withdrew it when she could not muster enough votes to break a Republican filibuster.
The Enron Corporation used derivatives in part to keep debt off its balance sheet, and the supporters of more government regulation called the use of derivatives a factor in the company's collapse.

 BODY:
Early on the morning of Sept. 11, I was reading a biography of Lincoln and relishing the cloistered atmosphere of the New York Public Library's Center for Scholars and Writers, tucked away on the second floor of the main research building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Around 8:50, an emergency phone call shattered the calm, and the library, like all of New York, soon closed for the rest of that horrific day.
 Two days later, the noble Beaux-Arts structure, compared upon its dedication in 1911 to the great cathedrals of European cities, reopened to the public and stayed open in spite of occasional bomb scares in nearby Grand Central Terminal. 
 "It feels weird to be away from the TV set," one young woman said to a friend as they entered the library's third-floor reading room on the morning of the 13th. Her companion, sporting turquoise hair and triple-studded earlobes, replied: "Weird but good. Like, all of these books make you feel, like, safe." 
I loved the library long before I first set foot inside it at age 26, but I never loved it more than I did during the days when the wind from Lower Manhattan was still wafting the smell of death throughout the city. Spending hours in an oasis of civilization somehow made it easier to endure the heightened awareness of just how fragile civilization can be.
It is natural, I suppose, that a great library should be a more important presence in the life of a writer than it is for those whose work does not involve constant contact with the written word. My old calendars tell me that I have certainly spent more time in this building during the last three decades than anywhere but in my own apartment.
I have relied on the library to provide the research materials for five books and uncountable magazine articles. But what has always impressed me most forcefully is the institution's connection to the everyday life of New Yorkers, from giggling teenagers to the very old. 
My father wrote his high school term papers in Room 315, the quarter-acre reading hall that has been the undisputed glory of the building since its opening. As a child, I was enthralled by Dad's story of having hoisted himself triumphantly (and illicitly) atop one of Edward Clark Potter's famous stone lions on the night of his high school graduation in 1931. 
In 1971, when I took my own seat in Room 315 and began working on my first book, I wondered whether my father might have occupied the same chair. I adored the place even though by the time I'd made my way there, the reading room (along with the entire building) had taken on the aura of an aging, impecunious beauty who, like the city, had seen better days. 
No one has captured the enduring democratic hospitality of 315 better than Alfred Kazin in his 1978 autobiography, "New York Jew." Kazin spent five years there writing "On Native Grounds," which instantly, upon its publication in 1942, established him as a rising star in New York's intellectual firmament. 
He described the reading hall as "that asylum and church of the unemployed; of crazy ideologists and equally crazy Bible students doggedly writing 'YOU LIE!' in the reference books on the open shelves; of puzzle fans searching every encyclopedia; of commission salesmen secretly tearing address lists out of city directories."
This struggling cast of New York characters, pursuing various dreams in a city just emerging from the Depression, provided a perfect backdrop for Kazin's creative labors. "I liked reading and working out my ideas in the midst of that endless crowd walking in and out of 315 looking for something," he recalled. "I, too, was seeking fame and fortune by sitting at the end of a long golden table next to the sets of American authors on the open shelves."
Today's equivalent of salesmen tearing out lists of addresses are the people who spend their hour of allotted time at computer work stations, e-mailing business contacts and friends. 
From its beginnings, this building -- on the site of what had become an obsolete reservoir by the last decade of the 19th century -- has served both as an instigator and a mirror of social change in New York.
The name New York Public Library is somewhat misleading, at least as far as the financing of the four research libraries is concerned. While the neighborhood branch libraries, with circulating collections, are publicly financed, the great research collections are largely supported by private philanthropy. Less than one-third of the budget for the research centers comes from public sources. 
"That word 'public' poses a real problem in raising money," said Rodney Phillips, director of the Fifth Avenue collection (officially called the Humanities and Social Sciences Library). "Most New Yorkers have no idea that the research collections depend largely on private generosity, a situation that doesn't exist in any other city. The one thing that is public -- and free -- is the service we give." 
The present library was founded upon the 19th-century fortunes of three New York moguls: John Jacob Astor, James Lenox and Samuel J. Tilden, a former governor of New York and loser in the hotly contested 1876 presidential election. In 1895 three private libraries were consolidated to create the New York Public Library.
The Fifth Avenue building, designed by the architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings and constructed for $9 million, then a munificent sum, opened to the public on May 24, 1911. 
"More than 50,000 persons visited the new public library yesterday," The New York Times reported on May 25. "The flow was so steady and strong that to avoid confusion library attendants had to separate the incoming and outgoing tides at the Fifth Avenue entrance."
It is not surprising, given the influx of Russian Jewish immigrants during that era, that the first book ordered in the reading room -- a study of Nietzsche and Tolstoy -- was in Russian. The call slip was filled out at 9:08 a.m. and the book was delivered six minutes later to one A. Shub of 1699 Washington Avenue.
Shub may well have been one of the venerable bibliophiles, described in newspaper accounts, who packed the reading room from Day 1. 
"Most of these are old men, many with thin white hair and thick untrimmed gray beards," The Times reported. "These men for the most part are book aristocrats, who read Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and who know by heart the best there is in the poetry of the world," the article continued. "When the doors of the great reading room swung open on well-oiled hinges for the first time the faithful entered single file, looks of 'home at last' satisfaction shining in their weather-beaten faces." 
The library, like Grand Central Terminal (which opened two years later), was the product of an era of civic pride engendered by New York's emerging sense of itself as one of the world's great cities. 
But by the time I arrived in the early 70's, the library had come to represent something else: financial crisis and a degeneration of communal spirit, reflected in the dilapidated state of many of the city's most cherished public spaces and institutions. 
In the library itself, the decline was evident in the dinginess of the reading room that had seemed so golden in the 1930's. World War II blackout paint still obstructed the flow of light through the windows. Outdoors in Bryant Park, drug dealers dominated a space that had once been ideal for a break from literary contemplation.
I must admit that I (unlike native New Yorkers) scarcely noticed the decrepitude because I was so entranced by my first experience of working in a great library. As a young reporter in Washington, I had been too intimidated by the Library of Congress to figure out how to use it properly.
The librarians in the main reading room in New York were never too busy to help. In the early 80's, when I was beginning a book on the relationship between justice and vengeance in Western culture, one librarian (regrettably, I cannot remember her name) took the trouble to supply me with a list of what she considered the best translations of Greek tragedy. 
With the translations of Moses Hadas and Philip Vellacott, a new world opened up to me, one I never entered as a college student because I was hellbent on graduating in the shortest possible time to find a newspaper job. Like so many New Yorkers before me, I owe my real education to the New York Public Library. 
During those years, the library was also reborn in an era of aggressive fund-raising spearheaded by the legendary Brooke Astor. From the mid-80's to the late 90's, the institution moved into the computer era (just in time to render my mastery of the paper catalog obsolete). 
In a vast restoration project financed by Sandra and Frederick Rose, the reading room was returned to its former glory. Under ceilings painted with Tiepoloesque clouds, with light pouring on golden oak tables through windows no longer blocked by paint, readers now have access to the old world of books on paper and the the new resources of the digital age. 
Beginning in June, with the opening of the library's new Celeste Bartos Education Center, anyone will be able to take advantage of free instruction in the use of the institution's electronic resources.
For me, the old world of print is still the main attraction. This year I ascended to a state of bibliophile blessedness as a fellow of the Center for Scholars and Writers, which opened in 1999 with a grant from a library trustee, Dorothy Cullman, and her husband, Lewis. 
In a compartmentalized and bureaucratized American academic culture, the library is one of the last bastions of respect for those who try to carry on an older but increasingly archaic tradition of independent scholarship embodied by men like Kazin. My current research is concerned with the marginalization of secularism and freethought -- the lovely, anachronistic term that appeared at the end of the 17th century -- in American history. 
The range of the library's holdings on this quirky and controversial subject has given me a new appreciation of the courage and vision of past generations of New York librarians, who collected material without regard for the received religious and political opinion of their time. 
Every day offers unexpected delights. In "The Old Testament Comically Illustrated" (circa 1900), a classic piece of blasphemy, the cartoonist Watson Heston hit on the effective technique of illustrating biblical texts in the most literal way. Suffice to say that there is a good deal of amusement to be derived from illustrations of the Lord's doings in passages like "I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile and will set thee as a gazingstock" (Nahum 3:6). 
As a writer, I can never get over the sense of being absolutely lucky to be able to get my hands (literally) on so many books. As a New Yorker, I can never stop being grateful for the chance to pursue my intellectual passions in such elevated physical surroundings. 
In a definitive 1923 account of the library's early history, Henry Miller Lydenberg, then the institution's chief reference librarian, observed that "the charm of the flagstaffs on the front terrace, the design of their bases, the beauty of their sculpture are lost upon many of us, simply because they are things we see day by day -- and therefore fail to give the appreciation to which they are entitled."
In today's less innocent city, one takes less for granted. 
As I stare out the windows overlooking Fifth Avenue, a young woman is playing a flute at the base of one of the lions. I cannot see the inscription to the right of the main entrance -- "But of all things, truth beareth away the victory" -- but I know it is there.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Weekend on April 12 about the New York Public Library misstated the age of a library user, A. David Shub, when he filled out and turned in the library's first call slip on May 24, 1911, the day the reading room opened. He was 24, not an old man.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
He Was Inside, Outside, but Everywhere Intense

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The American sculptor H. C. Westermann (1922-1981) is a hard nut to crack. Just when you think you've sorted out your feelings about his work, he does something disconcertingly sexist, corny or obvious. Walking through his large retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum here is a little like being in a cartoon, with Bugs Bunny or Woody Woodpecker popping his head out of one gopher hole, then another and another, taunting his way across a big, flat field.
 But Westermann's bad-boy antics were a form of pitiless scrutiny trained on himself and society -- its racism, warmongering, materialism, environmental profligacy and general hypocrisy. He rarely liked what he saw in any direction. And these antics were always balanced by beautiful forms and rigorous technique, in which craft borrowed from cabinetry and folk art was raised to the level of passion and penetrating intelligence. 
 Since the early 1960's, Westermann has been best known for sleek, usually solid wood sculptures that extended and Americanized Surrealism, presaged Pop and Conceptual art and are among the ultimate examples of "specific objects," Donald Judd's admiring term for art that rejects both painting and traditional sculpture. 
Westermann's achievement has hardly been ignored: Judd was calling him great in 1964, when reviewing his second solo show in New York, at the Frumkin Gallery. But still, like Jim Nutt, he has yet to receive his due.
Westermann personifies a brief, productive spasm of creativity in art in America. By the late 1950's, artists across the country were charging the barricades between art and craft, high and low, insider and outsider. They were spurred by the achievements of the Abstract Expressionists and the trenchant recycling of existing objects and motifs in the art of Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. They were armed with unsanctioned subjects and materials. Their ranks included Judd, Claes Oldenburg, John Chamberlain and Yayoi Kusama in New York; Kenneth Price in Los Angeles; Robert Arneson and Peter Saul in San Francisco; and Peter Voulkos in Montana. The changes they brought were soon ironed out, along with the term "specific objects," into the narrower swaths of Minimalism and Pop, a simplification from which American art is still recovering.
This exhibition of 100 objects and a smattering of drawings may aid the recovery, although it is unfortunately not traveling to New York. It originated at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the work of Lynne Warren, the curator, and Michael Rooks, assistant curator. And it includes what artists and cabinetmakers alike would call some of Westermann's best-known masterworks.
From the Whitney Museum of American Art comes the emphatically static "Antimobile," a non-Calder in the shape of a thick, uselessly irregular steering wheel in laminated wood. From the Museum of Contemporary Art itself, the sardonic tour de force "Memorial to the Idea of Man if He Was an Idea" is a cabinet with a castlelike head and an interior lined with bottle caps -- a tribute to tramp art that may also signal greed. It may not be entirely by chance that the creature's Cyclops eye and round red mouth bear an uncanny resemblance to Leela in "Futurama," Matt Groening's animated space-age sitcom. And from the collection of the son of William Copley, who was an early Westermann fan, comes "The Big Change," a large, upright, often-reproduced object made of laminated Douglas fir plywood. Its fat, smooth twists, which are accented by the wood's rippling striations, form an imposing, somewhat suggestive knot. 
There are also wonderful unfamiliar works, like "Imitation Knotty Pine," a small trapezoidal box whose exterior is meticulously inlaid with pine knots, and "Clean Air," three graduated glass-sided, wood-framed boxes set inside one another. Made in 1964, it predicts aspects of the work of Judd, Sol LeWitt and Larry Bell, while also evoking Joseph Cornell and Marcel Duchamp.
Westermann was a complex yet straightforward man. A patriot who accurately described himself as "an average Joe," he also became a ardent pacifist. Although a man of few words, he fired off loquacious, illustrated letters and, in his work, fused form and language as no Conceptual artist ever has, with the exception of Bruce Nauman (who was introduced to Westermann's work by his teacher, Robert Arneson). A gallant gentleman, he also pondered his ambivalence toward women, as in "I Wonder if I Really Love Her?," a life-size sculpture of a pregnant woman's abdomen terraced in laminated wood.
He experienced firsthand the horrors of war at sea while serving in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II, signed up for two more years in Korea in 1950 and emerged with a career's worth of painful memories to exorcise. His work was haunted by small, anvil-like ships' hulls that were punctured by kamikaze planes or that listed in shark-infested waters, and by cross-shaped grave markers and entrapping shapes, including coffins. A tiny wood-and-bronze tableau called "The Dead Burying the Dead" (1956), which is indebted to Giacometti, is among the earliest pieces in the show. Another early work is "Monument for a Dead Marine," a small carved-wood column topped by a screaming animal head that seems to have come out of "Guernica." 
In Chicago in the 1950's, Westermann evolved into a lean, mean art-making machine, developing a style that had an amazing physical economy. It helped that the small Chicago art scene included some of the most ardent collectors of European Surrealism in the country. 
A trained acrobat who exercised religiously until the end of his life, Westermann lacked anything remotely resembling body fat. Photographs of the artist bare chested show muscles and tattoos that suggest a cross between Popeye and Dick Tracy amplified by the real-life focus and physical confidence of Harry Houdini.
Westermann backed into sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, where he intended to study commercial art on the G. I. Bill. He then fixated on wood after several years of supporting himself as a carpenter, an attachment that also reconnected him with his roots. His favorite grandfather was an expert carpenter who made him a toy ladder that he never forgot. It's noteworthy in trying to understand the future subjects and demeanor of Westermann's art that this grandfather sometimes built coffins and committed suicide by standing in front of an oncoming train.
One repercussion is Westermann's "Suicide Tower" (1965), a small wood campanile carved with steps that recalls the classic Surrealism of Dali and de Chirico, except that it is also carved with its title in bold letters and punctuated by a perfectly scaled bronze porthole. 
As a teenager growing up in Los Angeles, when he wanted a room of his own, he built it himself onto the side of his parents' house: it was the predecessor of the many small sculptures of houses, both open and closed, that riddle his art. He would spend much of the last 12 years of his life building, mostly by hand, a house in Brookfield Center, Conn., with his wife, Joanna Beall, an architect and sometime acrobat who died in 1997.
In his catalog essay, Mr. Rooks, the assistant curator, details the house's obsessive sturdiness and finishing, and says it may be Westermann's greatest work of art. He also compares it to Judd's similarly obsessed-over compound, centering on two renovated airplane hangers, in Marfa, Tex.
As good as it is, this exhibition feels at times a little relentless, even hectoring. It might have been edited a bit, or softened with more works on paper, especially the illustrated letters that are possibly the artist's best drawings. But the show's onslaught also indicates the emotional and formal force that Westermann concentrated in nearly everything he made. Each piece benefited from his profound grasp of materials, of metaphor and of his own emotional state. Each was built to last, as if it would be sent out into the world as the single, solitary representative of its maker.

"H. C. Westermann" is at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Independence Avenue and Seventh Street SW, Washington, (202) 357-3091, through May 12. It travels to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles (June 9 to Sept. 8) and the Menil Collection in Houston (Oct. 4 to Jan. 5).

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Just Fun and Games? No! It's Greed and War, Too

BYLINE:  By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
If you think Monopoly, Risk and Stocks and Bonds are not just innocent board games but instruments for late-capitalist brainwashing, you're in for a surprise at the New-York Historical Society. The brainwashing began long before the mid-20th century.
 In celebration of its recent acquisition of 500 American board games collected by Arthur L. Liman (1932-1997), the New York trial lawyer who investigated the Iran-contra affair, and his wife, Ellen Liman, the author of a book about collecting, the historical society is showing "The Games We Played: American Board and Table Games From the Liman Collection Gift." 
 Most of the 150 games exhibited are from the 19th century and were manufactured by McLoughlin Brothers (the company that Milton Bradley bought in 1920). Along with the games themselves are three tables set up for play. 
There is nothing like a century's distance to see a genre clearly. The earliest board game shown is the Mansion of Happiness (1864), where you get to the Happiness at the center of the board by leading a good Puritan life. The Checkered Game of Life, which came out in 1866 (and was reissued in 1960 as the Game of Life) kept the goal of happiness but tossed in the crucial idea of material success.
What followed was a series of baldly capitalist games that might have made Max Weber, author of "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," smile in recognition: Monopolist (1885), which is won by breaking up a monopoly and then becoming a monopolist oneself; the Game of Playing Department Store (1898), in which players buy up everything they can while still economizing; and Commerce (1900), in which players try to corner the market in pork, flour, cotton or coffee.
Even the games that feature exploration (Round the World With Nellie Bly and To the North Pole by Airship), travel (the Amusing Game of Innocence Abroad) and law enforcement (Rival Policemen, created when New York City's police force was competing with the state police) have an acquisitive edge. The idea is to bag as many experiences, places and criminals as one can.
It is not hard to see why the war most often honored by late 19th-century board games was the Spanish-American War. In 1898, the United States bagged Puerto Rice, Guam, the Philippines and temporary control over Cuba. That same year a half-dozen games celebrating the war were issued, including Games of War at Sea or Don't Give Up the Ship; the Great Game: Uncle Sam at War With Spain; Rough Riders Ten-Pins; and Mimic War, in which the action figures are dressed like soldiers from the Spanish-American War but can be drafted into other wars. It is Manifest Destiny made festive.
Cornball graphics generally ruled the game boards. On top of pastel-colored landscapes, idealized cityscapes or maps are pathways and grids that lead from nowhere to the promised land, with perilous pitfalls along the way. You win when you get to heaven, become the president, go around the world, acquire the most land, win the war, buy the most things.
Of course, there are some exceptions to the visual rule of a happy landscape on the box. The box top of Bulls and Bears: The Great Wall St. Game, issued after the panic of 1873, is thought to have been painted by the political cartoonist Thomas Nast. And it has a nasty, cynical edge. The bull and the bear, dressed in hats, coats and patent leather shoes, are ready to fleece a scared sheep.
Apparently, one key to capitalist training through game-playing is to silence any thoughts of bucking the social order. The box for Cash: Honesty Is the Best Policy (1890) shows a well-scrubbed boy dutifully walking through a bank with money. The Game of the District Messenger Boy or Merit Rewarded (1886), shows how one can rise from lowly beginnings to become president of the company. The game pieces are little messengers in running position.
Parlor games were in charge of manners. If courting couples felt awkward or didn't know how to start a conversation, they could always rely on the Sociable Telephone: A Game for the Smart Set or the Elite Conversation Cards to feed them some flirtatious repartee. For example, to play Elite Conversation, one player would draw a white card with questions to be asked: "Have you ever been in love?" or "Are you economical?" And the other would draw a blue card with an evasive answer: "I never thought of such a thing," or, "Ask me in earnest when nobody is about."
Some games appear to be without guile. The show includes two versions of Pillow Dex, which is called the precursor to American Ping-Pong; several versions of Tiddledy Winks, in which a wink is flicked with a tiddly or squidger into a cup; and a half-dozen games of dexterity called Fish Pond, Frog Pond and Four and Twenty Blackbirds, in which one uses a line and hook to pluck flat figures (fish, frogs or blackbirds) out of their slots without dropping them. What could be wrong with this?
But it turns out that even the most innocent games can be used for vile social purposes. A jigsaw puzzle first issued by McLoughlin in 1874 was called Chopped Up Niggers. The object of Jim Crow Ten Pins, created in 1900, was to knock down smiling minstrel figures. 
The Game of Watermelon Patch (1896) is identical to Fish Pond and Frog Pond, except that the object is to pluck watermelons out of their slot. And the game box shows three black men dancing in the moonlight near a giant watermelon they have apparently stolen. This is not all fun and games by a long shot.

"The Games We Played: American Board and Table Games From the Liman Collection Gift" remains on view at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, near 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Jan. 5.

Gluttony and Sin Tax

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
CONSPICUOUS consumption is not enshrined in the Constitution, but even though some Americans seem to regard ownership of gasoline hogs as a birthright, the government makes them pay with luxury and gas-guzzler taxes.
 The burden is getting lighter: the federal luxury tax on cars will be eliminated at the end of the year. That tax was imposed on cars in January 1991, at a rate of 10 percent of the selling price over a threshold of $30,000. But at that level, even some family minivans were subject to the tax. Congress responded to complaints, acting to phase out the tax by Jan. 1, 2003, by raising the threshold over seven years. 
 For 2002, the luxury tax is 3 percent of the amount of the sales price over $40,000. Last year, it was 4 percent of the sales price above $38,000.
The tax threshold has been determined each December by the Internal Revenue Service, based on the Consumer Price Index. It has generally risen by $2,000 every other year, said Scott Lane, vice president for government relations at the American International Automobile Dealers Association, whose members sell vehicles from foreign carmakers. The group lobbied hard for repeal.
Not all vehicles are subject to the luxury tax. Those with a loaded weight of more than 6,000 pounds, including full-size sport utilities like the Chevrolet Suburban, and the Lexus LX 470, are exempt.
The gas-guzzler tax was enacted in 1978 to penalize vehicles that the Environmental Protection Agency found to be gas hogs. The penalty applies only to cars -- not trucks -- that exceed fuel economy guidelines.
Vehicles with a combined city and highway economy rating of less than 22.5 miles a gallon are subject to the tax, which ranges from $1,000 for combined mileage of 21.5 to 22.5 m.p.g. to a maximum of $7,700 for vehicles that get less than 12.5 m.p.g.
Someone who buys a BMW Z8, which has a combined average of 16 m.p.g., pays a gas-guzzler tax of $2,100. But someone who buys a Ferrari 575M Maranello, rated at 12 m.p.g., pays the top tax of $7,700.
How much damage can these taxes do to the ostrich-skin wallet of, say, a Mercedes-Benz customer? The guzzler tax is applied first; the luxury tax adds insult to injury. 
Someone who wants to buy a 2002 Mercedes S500 sedan for $80,865 faces a federal gas-guzzler tax of $1,000, bringing the transaction price to $81,865.Then the luxury tax is applied on the amount over the $40,000 threshold, which is $41,865. The luxury tax of 3 percent on $41,865 adds $1,255.95. That brings the price of the $80,865 car to $83,120.95. A bit of math shows that $2,255.95 goes to Washington.

HEADLINE: Latest Data Dampens Mexico's Hopes 

BYLINE:  By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 11 

 BODY:
Whatever economic revival may be developing in the United States and elsewhere, it isn't doing much for Mexico's struggling manufacturers.
 The government said today that industrial production was down again in February, by 1.8 percent from February 2001. It has now been more than a year since the sector showed any significant growth. 
 The report had been anxiously awaited by analysts, who had hoped for signs that Mexico had begun to emerge from a recession that has destroyed some 450,000 jobs over the last year. But though the figures were not as bad as January's -- they showed a slight increase in output month to month -- they nonetheless offered little grist for broader optimism. 
And that may spell political trouble for President Vicente Fox, who promised to build employment, not watch it wither.
Manufacturing is a dwindling source of jobs in the United States but remains crucial in Mexico, where factory employment peaked in June 2000 and has since fallen 4.3 percent, a sharper decline than any other sector. 
Much of the decrease has come among the maquiladoras, plants that import duty-free components for assembly into products for re-exporting; most are owned by foreign multinational corporations.
The maquiladoras have been a powerful engine of job growth in areas near the American border, and they employed 1.2 million workers in mid-2001. Since then, 240,000 maquiladora jobs, or one-fifth of the total, have been lost.
Positive signs elsewhere in the Mexican economy, like three consecutive months of export growth and a rise in total investment, had prompted hopes that manufacturing might soon turn the corner, though few analysts expected industrial production to shoot up in February. So far, those hopes have been disappointed, suggesting that greater forces are at work than month-to-month shifts in the climate. 
In some ways, Mexico is a victim of its own success. The high demand for factory labor created by the maquiladora plants in their salad days drove wages up to the point that companies focused primarily on cheap labor began abandoning Mexico for countries like Guatemala and China. Some 350 maquiladora plants have shut down in the last year. Many of those that remain have invested in more sophisticated manufacturing and created more skilled jobs, but they employ far fewer workers over all.
Both employment and productivity in the maquiladoras began to decline in February 2000 and fell steeply after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, when demand from the United States contracted sharply. Few analysts are optimistic that an economic upturn will restore the maquiladoras to their former vibrancy any time soon.
Also working against a manufacturing revival is the Mexican peso, which has remained surprisingly strong against the dollar, driving up production and energy costs, compared with weak-currency countries.
"I think international companies have determined that Mexico has become too costly," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a prominent economist in Mexico City, "and that's why they're moving." 
Analysts say that Mexico will be able to maintain its competitiveness in high-end manufacturing jobs, like electronics and heavy machinery, but will continue to lose low-end textile jobs.
Cities on both sides of the Mexican-American border are feeling the pinch of the downturn in the industrial sector. For example, Nogales, Ariz., developed a symbiotic relationship with Nogales, Sonora, just across the border, where the population grew rapidly as maquiladora plants were established there. Many of the Mexican workers would cross the border to do their daily shopping.
Ken Larriva, who owns a number of retail stores on the American side, said that 90 percent of his customers were maquiladora workers -- when they had work.
"People are not walking through the doors like they did before," Mr. Larriva said in an interview. "We should open our doors in the morning and people should come in freely, but it's not happening."
Twenty-nine plants on the Mexican side have shut their doors or cut back operations in the last year, almost one-quarter of the total. A work force that was 38,000 strong a year ago has lost 12,000 jobs.
Nogales, Ariz., gets two-thirds of its sales tax revenue -- its only source of income -- from Mexican shoppers' purchases. 
President Fox has said he still has hopes that the maquiladora system will recover as the United States emerges from recession. He is also pushing southern Mexico, where wages are still very low, as a factory site for companies who find the border area too costly. But he has had little success in drawing multinationals to locate there so far.
As for the idle maquiladora workers, Susan Clark Morales, who owns a ranch in Nogales, Ariz., that abuts about eight miles of the border, predicts that they will move north, not south, in search of jobs. She said she had seen a drastic increase in the number of immigrants crossing her ranch.
"If you were 2 miles away from an opportunity to work, why would you turn around and go 400 miles?" she said.

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
A Return to Nature, Mostly by Cutting It Down

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
THE log home stood on the banks of Fall Creek in the shadow of 14,000-foot peaks. Its owner tossed his fly fishing line into the stream looking for German brown trout, but instead hooked a nagging idea for an acquisition.
 The cabin, just outside Telluride, Colo., was to be Lance Mortensen's retreat, a refuge from the fast pace of Silicon Valley. 
 But standing knee-deep in mountain water, Mr. Mortensen realized he could not escape his compulsions and promptly packed up his pole and returned to California to wheel and deal. 
This marriage of Captains of Industry with Log Cabins -- popping up from the Pennsylvania countryside, to Lake Tahoe and the great Northwest -- has created a curious culture, and some contradictions. For one thing, the logs often cannot protect movers and shakers from their own work ethics, and a home office is often a well-worn room in these retreats.
For another, while the outside of the homes are made of shorn trees (specifically, standing dead timber), they are far from Abraham Lincoln's log cabin.
Inside are the latest amenities: Sub Zero refrigerators, floors made of slate from Shanghai, and Cypress hardwood imported from South America, a Viking wine cooler kept at 55 degrees.
They are to a homesteader's cabin what a Land Rover is to a covered wagon. Some observers say the structures are mere shells of log homes -- less like Frontier Days, and more like Walt Disney's Frontier Land.
Yet the executives and well-heeled types who are building these high-end cabins as second homes say the the structures are not just aesthetic, but also spiritually pleasing. The logs are not mere building materials, it is said, they are about mood. Timber as transcendentalism. They remind one of a simpler time. Of a slower pace. Of the era B.C.: Before the Computer Revolution.
"It's back to nature, back to the frontier days," said Michael Hammes, chief executive of Sunrise Medical, a San Diego company that is one of the world's largest wheelchair suppliers.
He retreats to an 11,000-square-foot home just outside Aspen, which is called "the cabin" by his family.
"You walk in, put the fireplace on, and you're your own man," he said.
Michael McLaughlin, a Telluride real estate agent and designer of log homes, said that owners wanted a "camplike experience," but with "steam showers, granite countertops, the best appliances."
For instance, Mr. McLaughlin designed a home owned by a money market trader from Chicago that has an outside stone deck on which the floor is heated; a gas fireplace near the hot tub (Mr. McLaughlin said he decided at the last minute not to include a waterfall because of potential legal liability); and a $6000 Viking Barbecue.
Inside, the kitchen floor is made of 125-year-old terra cotta from Provence, France, the countertop is Pennsylvania Blue Stone and the stove is cooled with a fan whose engine is in the garage, to keep fan noise to a minimum ("the little touches make a big difference," Mr. McLaughlin said). The showers are made of tumbled marble and include heated seats.
Mr. McLaughlin sold Mr. Mortensen his first log cabin, on the river. Subsequently, he collaborated with Mr. Mortensen -- who has started some 10 companies, including Zap Me, an Internet startup that put computers in schools -- to design a home closer to downtown Telluride.
But Mr. Mortensen has had particular trouble escaping his entrepreneurial nature. But, sensing a chance for profit, he sold that home; he recently purchased land on which he hopes to build his eventual retreat.
Despite all of his moves, he has not given up on the idea of a log cabin; he likes them, he said, because of the " tranquillity that comes with stepping back in time."
Generally, log home ownership has been on the rise since the mid-1980's. Then, 7,000 log homes were sold a year; today, 30,000 are sold in the United States, according to John R. Kupferer, publisher of Log Home Living Magazine, who said, "there are more log homes today than ever in the history of the world."
They are also more expensive; the average log home price is around $300,000, according to the magazine's surveys.
There has, however, been a slowdown in some of the fancier log home neighborhoods, in light of the dot.com collapse and the larger economic sluggishness.
In Mountain Village, an exclusive town beside Telluride that is or has been home to Oprah Winfrey, Dick Ebersol and Susan St. James, Marilyn and Dan Quayle, and Senator Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, there are 75 homes for sale on the market, an all-time high, according to real estate agents.
But not all action is at a standstill, as evidenced by the Yellow Caterpiller bulldozer culling aspens from a hillside lot in Mountain Village. The land is destined to be the site to a 15,000-square-foot log structure that, according to the project's developer, Ronald R. Kurucz, will blend in beautifully, and may be more enticing than the current grove of trees that dot the land.
"Aspens," Mr. Kurucz said, "are like weeds around here."
What is less common are bowling alleys. That is the heart of the project Mr. Kurucz is developing for his client, Timothy S. Boberg, who retired last year from Miami, where he advised Fortune 100 companies on improving productivity.
"I haven't bowled since I was 10 years old," Mr. Boberg said, but added that he thought the alley would be a good way to entertain guests.
That will not be the only possible source of entertainment; the odd configuration of a bowling alley necessitated building other rooms with similar dimensions, so Mr. Boberg decided to build -- alongside the alley -- a lap pool and an indoor shooting range. On the level above the pool, the alley and the range will be a 6,000-square-foot master.
Mr. Boberg plans to live there with his girlfriend, Roxanne Pulitzer, a romance novelist once involved in a highly-publicized divorce from Herbert Pulitzer Jr.
The 15,000-square-foot development is sizable, considering that it is an addition. Mr. Boberg and Ms. Pulitzer live next door in a 9,000-square-foot home they moved into last year and that cost around $5 million (and will ultimately serve as the guest house). Touring the property, Mr. Boberg said he liked the natural aura of the structure, in particular the strength exuded by the 12-inch-diameter lodge pole pine that surround him. He said it had "the feel of a log cabin in the woods.
"It's peaceful; it's healthy. There's something about being in the mountains.
Mr. Boberg, 55, said he liked to spend his time outdoors, hiking and skiing, though he said he got much of his exercise in one of two gymnasiums in his current home.
One gym has the latest Cybex weightlifting equipment, and the other contains cardiovascular machines. On the floor next to the treadmill is an authentic buffalo-skin rug; it came with the house, which came furnished. Mr. Boberg and Ms. Pulitzer have not quite figured out what to do with the rug, or some of the other rustic touches that they say seem a little too contrived.
Rather, Mr. Boberg has begun to decorate the place with his own contemporary art. The new addition will reflect their own tastes, such as including a mini-movie theater, along with the bowling alley.
"We just don't want a house that is stereotyped with a frontier theme," Mr. Boberg said, noting that he plans to "keep the stuffed deer heads and buffalo rugs to a minimum."
Indeed, Mr. Boberg said, there is a danger of going over the top with the rustic sensibilities, and he would not want to be accused of having that kind of home.
"Some people," he said, "really overdo it."

HEADLINE: Notes From New Orleans; 
A New Mayor and a New Wage

BYLINE:  By Kathy Finn; Kathy Finn, a business writer, has lived in New Orleans for 20 years.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
On a recent morning, New Orleans's mayor-elect, Ray Nagin, an African-American, stood before a gathering of 300 people in a meeting room of a downtown hotel. He told the mostly white and well-heeled audience of his hopes and priorities for the city. One of them was: "We have to develop a strong African-American middle class." 
 Just outside the room, dishes clanged and carts rolled as a few dozen hotel workers, most of them black, cleared the remains of another breakfast meeting. Had they heard Mr. Nagin's message, they might have agreed with its thrust. But chances are they would prefer a quicker economic boost. 
 Hotel workers will be major beneficiaries of a new law that sets the minimum wage in New Orleans one dollar above the federally mandated minimum. If the law withstands court challenges and takes effect as scheduled on May 2, an estimated 35,000 entry-level workers in private and public sector jobs will get a raise to $6.15 an hour, a dollar higher than what their brethren earn just across the city line. The law stipulates that the local wage must remain $1 above the federal minimum in the event of future increases.
Oddly, the wage bill easily won voter approval in a city with a long anti-labor-union history; only one New Orleans hotel has ever been unionized, and that was decades ago. The wage measure was on the same ballot that sent Mr. Nagin -- the only major mayoral candidate to oppose the wage hike -- into a runoff. A month later, voters delivered him a landslide victory. What were they thinking?
The election results were a measure of the frustration that bubbles just below the surface in this town. To the outsider, New Orleans may look like a city that seldom takes itself seriously, while taking big visitor events like Mardi Gras and the Super Bowl in stride. Our easygoing image aside, many residents have had it up to here with the politics of the past.
Local people rich and poor are fuming over the fact that our political leaders have done little to improve economic opportunities in the face of a shifting economy. Ray Nagin played to this frustration as no local political candidate has in decades.
As the general manager credited with turning around a faltering regional cable television franchise of Cox Communications, the 45-year-old Mr. Nagin moves easily among the local business elite. But his hip personal style carries him beyond business circles as well. Throughout his campaign, he kept his distance from the old-line political organizations that have long controlled local elections by playing one race or faction against another. Instead, carrying a Blackberry in his pocket and touting plans for a technological revolution in city government, he told voters a restructured local economy is the best medicine for what ails residents at all income levels. He spoke with the poise of a big-company chief executive and the sincerity of a preacher. Voters were captivated.
But now Mr. Nagin, who will take office May 6, faces public expectations he admits "are in the stratosphere." Depending on how the minimum wage fares with Louisiana's highest court, he may also face the thorny problem of rising costs for those doing business in New Orleans.
For local labor and community organizers and the close to 30 percent of the city's population who live below the federal poverty level, the new wage law is a long-sought prize. Six years ago the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now gathered 25,000 petition signatures to support a "living wage" ballot proposal. But the City Council stalled it, and state lawmakers in 1997 passed a new law barring local jurisdictions from setting their own wage floors.
Challenges to that state law were rebuffed until an appeals court ruled that the law couldn't be tested until local voters actually approved a wage ordinance; the court, in effect, ordered that the wage increase go to a vote.
New Orleans restaurant and hotel associations, along with other business groups, fought the wage hike. They said increased labor costs would drive New Orleans employers to the suburbs or even farther. And they predicted any wage boost would make it harder to attract new industries that could help diversify the local economy.
Louisiana's primary economic driver, the oil and gas industry, has shrunk in the last two decades as corporate mergers sucked high-paying jobs out of downtown New Orleans office towers. Another major industry, the maritime business, has had its ups and downs stemming from fluctuations in global trade.
Meanwhile, multiple expansions of the local convention center have fueled hotel construction and a slew of new restaurants. But as service jobs grew, so did the nagging feeling that economic expansion elsewhere in the country had left New Orleans in the dust. Overall job growth here plodded at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the late 1990's, while some Southern cities had job growth rates of 4 percent to 6 percent.
With too many low-wage jobs at one end and too few high-paying jobs at the other, the New Orleans economy is clearly out of whack. Ray Nagin didn't plan on using a higher minimum wage to help fix what's wrong with the economy, but he may have no choice.
The new wage law was upheld on March 25, when a New Orleans civil district judge turned back the first challenge to its constitutionality. Opponents are now asking the state Supreme Court to prevent implementation of the wage law until it can give their appeal a full hearing.
A higher local minimum wage may not be the best linchpin for building a new economy. Then again, the tens of thousands of workers who would feel the effect of the pay hike may see it as a pretty good start.

HEADLINE: Bulldozing Hope in the Mideast 

 BODY:
One tragic consequence of this month's Israeli military offensive across the West Bank has been the heavy blow it inflicted on a Palestinian economy and civil society that had begun to show signs of life. If these two proud and talented peoples are ever to live side by side in peace and cooperation, one obvious prerequisite will be a Palestinian economy that generates jobs and prosperity for its people and civil institutions that can broaden debate and begin to supplant the paramilitary secular and Islamist groups that now monopolize Palestinian political activity. 
 Israel's long-term interest lies in nurturing Palestinian development, not demolishing it. While Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's determination to strike back at terrorists is understandable, Israel's destruction of Palestinian homes, businesses and public utilities is not. Knocking down houses, destroying electricity pylons and interfering with health care, as Israeli forces have done across the West Bank, cannot be justified by any compelling military need. 
 The Palestinians are among the most educated and entrepreneurial people in the Arab world. Yet economic progress was disappointingly slow in the first years after the Oslo peace agreement. Official corruption, Israeli military blockades of Palestinian towns and uncertainty about the future all worked to discourage investment and disrupt commerce. Several years ago, promising signs of improvement appeared, helped by aid from the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and international organizations. Industrial parks and malls began to sprout, including some financed by Palestinian-Americans. There was a successful casino in Jericho and a new airport in Gaza. 
These gains have been obliterated by the past 19 months of conflict, with the greatest damage concentrated in the past two weeks. Yasir Arafat bears much of the blame. Now Israel claims to have proof that he has not only failed to oppose terrorism but has directly authorized it. Still, Israeli military tactics are responsible for much of the civilian destruction. 
While the ostensible goal of Israel's offensive is capturing terrorists and uprooting their organizations, it has resulted in a prolonged siege affecting hundreds of thousands of civilians trying to go about their everyday lives. Mr. Sharon needs to make it clear to his commanders that Palestinian civilians are not Israel's enemy and that their lives, livelihoods and property deserve respect.
Better yet, with Secretary of State Colin Powell in Israel, Mr. Sharon should belatedly heed President Bush's call for immediate withdrawal. Continuing this offensive may yield more terrorist arrests, but at grievous cost to Israel's long-term interests.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
A Turnabout for North Jersey Rentals

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A 41-story, 538-unit rental complex atop the Palisades cliffs in Fort Lee, N.J., is the latest addition to the Hudson River waterfront in Bergen County. The complex, called the Palisades, opened for leasing last month at a time when industry professionals say there is a surfeit of rentals on the waterfront stretch from Edgewater to Fort Lee. 
 It joins several local developments under way or completed in the last few years that total over 2,000 rental apartments. And the number of existing vacant rentals has grown to 200 from 3 in February 2001, according to Lennard Schwartz-Charles, owner of Smart Realty of Edgewater, who cited figures from the Multiple Listing Service of New Jersey. 
 Leasing has slowed and developers are offering concessions, like a month's free rent, which will further hold down rents that in the last year dropped by 15 percent, Mr. Charles said. 
"The number of vacant units in some of the newer buildings is scary," he added. "Developers have to pull out all the bells and whistles to get tenants."
The developers of the Palisades, the Applied Development Company of Hoboken in partnership with Vornado Realty Trust of Saddle Brook, said its size and location, less than a quarter of a mile from the George Washington Bridge, will distinguish it from its competitors, as will what they call its condominium-style amenities and finishes. The developers are also offering one month's rent free.
Costas Kondylis of Manhattan designed the complex, which has a 12-story base that contains 80 more units and a 1,008-car garage. On top of one part of the base is a 29-story tower with 438 units and on another part are 20 town house-style apartments.
"The long-term fundamentals are strong for high-end luxury rentals in Fort Lee, where most towers are condos or co-ops," said Allen F. Goldman, a senior vice president of Applied Development Company. "We created a viable alternative for people who don't want to buy and who want to live outside Manhattan."
So far nearly 100 of the one- to three-bedroom apartments have been leased for $30 a square foot a year, Mr. Goldman said. He added that 18 percent of the renters are from Manhattan, where, he said, a comparable apartment would lease for $50 to $55 a square foot. 
The units, including penthouses, have 756 to 1,796 square feet and rent for $1,795 to $8,950 a month. The 20 town houses, with 2,148 to 2,326 square feet, rent for $5,500 to $8,900. Amenities include a 1.4-acre landscaped plaza, a health club and outdoor pool.
The only other new rental project in the last 25 years in Fort Lee is the 351-unit Avalon Crest, which opened on an inland site in 1999. Its developer, AvalonBay Communities, based in Alexandria, Va., is now leasing a second project, with 408 apartments in two four-story buildings on River Road in Edgewater. 
"While the oversupply has caused a bottleneck in leasing, it will ease," said Stella M. Madison, a senior portfolio director at Avalon, noting that her company was offering a month's rent free.
Monthly rents for the one- to three-bedroom units at Avalon Crest are $1,710 to $2,520. Its occupancy rate has crept to 92 percent after falling to 88 percent last fall, Ms. Madison said.
At Avalon at Edgewater, the one- to three-bedroom apartments have 766 to 1,316 square feet and rent for $1,727 to $2,922 a month. While "leasing is not going gangbusters, we are meeting our expectations," she said, noting that 261 of the 408 apartments have been rented since leasing began last year.
On the water side of River Road in Edgewater there are two rental complexes that also offer retail space. One, called the Edgewater Towne Centre, with 64 units atop 74,000 square feet of stores, is complete; construction of the other, the Promenade, is under way and it will ultimately have 434 rentals, 54 condominiums and 160,000 square feet of retail space, assuming the market for rental housing is strong enough. The developer of both is G. Heller Enterprises of Edgewater. 
The Promenade came under scrutiny last summer by state environmental regulators concerned over how the site was being simultaneously developed and cleaned of pollution. Construction is proceeding as the developer and state officials hammer out a cleanup plan, both sides said. 
Monthly rents at Edgewater Towne Centre are $1,300 to $2,200 for studios to two-bedroom units with 720 to 1,125 square feet; at the Promenade they are $1,800 to $2,600 for the 108 completed, one- and two-bedroom rentals with 850 to 1,450 square feet on a pier. The 326 rentals under way on the site's uplands are similar in size and price, said Tod Heller, vice president for marketing and leasing at Heller Enterprises.
The hope is that the economy will improve when the rentals are completed later this year, he said, but it is possible that some or all the units at the two projects will be switched to condominiums, which currently have a stronger market.

HEADLINE: Enclave Links Its Political Fate to Its Rich History 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
No one has ever seen a State Assembly district line drawn on the ground. And yet they can seem as real as fences. At a recent round of redistricting hearings, people from all over the state fought to move their lines, citing reasons as diverse as racial balance and the omission of a particular park or school.
 But the tiny neighborhood of Vinegar Hill, which consists of just a few blocks of 19th-century row houses that emerge from the industrial buildings and parking lots near the Brooklyn Navy Yard like a ghost town in the desert, found an argument that redistricting officials said they had not heard before. It wanted to stay with other districts that are concerned with historic preservation. 
 Residents wrote letters, appeared at a hearing with a poster-sized color map and submitted a historic booklet on the waterfront. A Brooklyn newspaper took to calling the current district's assemblywoman, Joan L. Millman, "Brownstone Joan."
Ms. Millman's district encompasses Brooklyn's oldest neighborhoods, of which Vinegar Hill -- named for a battle against the British in Ireland -- is one. It includes six city-designated historic districts including Brooklyn Heights and Fulton Ferry Landing, where Brooklyn farmers once shuttled their produce to Manhattan.
Another neighborhood in the district, Dumbo (which stands for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), is on the state and national registers of historic places.
The argument for preserving a historic district has been made at least once before, Ms. Millman said. In 1982, Brooklyn Heights, which was the first neighborhood in the city to be made a historic district, fought off redistricting proposals to divide it in two.
Representing historic districts can be difficult, she said, although she quickly added that she welcomed the challenge. "People tend to be very civic minded, very community minded, and they reach out to their elected officials," she said. "They have a concern, they pick up the phone and tell you what it is, and they expect you to do something about it."
Gary Vanderputten, a resident of Fulton Ferry Landing, said Ms. Millman has supported their preservation efforts. "We are always fighting the same battles, always on the same side," he said.
The Legislature's first redistricting proposal would have severed Vinegar Hill, lumping it with Fort Greene, Williamsburg and Greenpoint, which include two historic districts but are communities of a different character.
Vinegar Hill and its neighbors in Dumbo and Fulton Ferry argued that they belonged together. And in a process often fueled by political self-preservation, the arguments seemed authentic, said Assemblyman William Parment, who heads the redistricting process for the Assembly.
Those neighborhoods were once the bustling working-class heart of Brooklyn, said Marcia Reiss, who is writing a series of neighborhood guides for the Brooklyn Historical Society.
It was there, Ms. Reiss said, that Walt Whitman worked as a newspaper editor for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, that the men who built the Brooklyn Bridge signed their charter, that the smell of roasting coffee beans once filled the air, and it was there that children used to linger outside the Eskimo Pie factory in hopes of ice cream alms. After World War II, when the Navy Yard's activity slowed and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway cut off the area, it went into decline.
The area's current residents have worked together to control development and influence the design of a planned waterfront park.
"We don't want a South Street Seaport kind of development in our neighborhood," said Per-Olof Odman, a retired photographer. He and his wife, Monique Denoncin, began the effort to preserve the last remnants of Vinegar Hill after a 19th-century gothic church across the street from their house was demolished in 1992.
"We want a more cultural, historical development," Mr. Odman said. "The state and the city can help us largely in making sure that it doesn't become too commercial."
When the Legislature released its new plan this week, Vinegar Hill and its neighbors were reunited.
Given that only 150 people live in Vinegar Hill, it was likely to be one of the easier requests for the redistricting task force to grant. Still, the success surprised and delighted historians and preservationists.
"So often," said Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic Districts Council, "district lines are broken up along economic lines or along racial lines." He said, "Preservation has become a demographic" -- like race or class -- and it "is really kind of exciting."

HEADLINE: Fuel Costs Push Imports Higher 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
Prices of goods imported into the United States in March rose at the fastest pace in a year and a half, the Labor Department reported today, led by a surge in the cost of oil.
 A 1.1 percent increase in the import price index reflected the biggest gain in energy costs since April 1999, the department said. 
It followed a 0.1 percent decline in February. 
 "A larger share of households' wallets will go to energy at the expense of other types of goods," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management in St. Louis. That "will damp overall economic growth," she said, "but shouldn't push us back into recession."
Unemployment may also keep spending from picking up. The number of workers continuing to collect state jobless benefits in the last week was the most since March 1983, a separate Labor Department report showed. Continuing claims rose to 3.78 million, up from 3.63 million the week before.
Applications for benefits have been inflated since mid-March by a law permitting unemployed workers whose 26 weeks of assistance had run out to apply for an additional 13 weeks of help. Initial jobless claims, which rose by 103,000 in the two weeks after the legislation was passed, fell by 55,000, to 438,000, in the week ended Saturday.
In the import price report, an index excluding energy costs was unchanged in March after a 0.4 percent decline in February. That gauge of import prices has not risen for 14 months. "Outside of oil, inflation still looks pretty tame," said James O'Sullivan, a senior economist at UBS Warburg in Stamford, Conn.
The March rise in import prices was the largest since a 1.2 percent increase in September 2000.

HEADLINE: Israelis and Arabs: Time to Start Anew 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Attacks Turn Palestinian Plans Into Bent Metal and Piles of Dust" (front page, April 11) puts the lie to the Palestinians' claim that they were getting nothing out of the Oslo process. As you point out, the economy of the West Bank was beginning to flourish, with large international investment and a 6 percent rate of growth. 
 Yasir Arafat put a halt to that progress when he turned his back on peace at Camp David and resumed the violence. It is sad that average Palestinians must pay the price for the folly of their leaders.
It will be to everyone's gain if the Palestinians can find a leader who truly seeks peace. When that happens, Israelis will extend a hand to help them rebuild their society.

Expert Lists Goals of a Microsoft Penalty

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
Antitrust sanctions against the Microsoft Corporation should seek to repair the damage the company's illegal conduct did to competition and consumers in addition to preventing a repetition of its misdeeds, an economics expert told a federal judge yesterday.
 Prof. Carl Shapiro, an economist who served as the expert witness for nine states seeking broader regulations of Microsoft's business practices, spelled out for the first time in the current hearing the economic rationale behind several of the states' proposals. 
 "We simply cannot replicate the powerful combination of factors that threatened Microsoft's Windows monopoly six years ago," Professor Shapiro said. "The clear implication: A broader remedy is required to truly restore competition." 
But Professor Shapiro conspicuously withheld his support from the states' proposal that Microsoft be forced to let computer makers remove various Microsoft programs from the Windows operating system, a remedy that the states have promoted perhaps more aggressively than any other.
"You don't believe the unbinding remedy proposed by the states will help competition?" asked Microsoft's lawyer, Michael Lacovara.
"It's a difficult call; I don't know the answer," replied Mr. Shapiro, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley who served as the deputy assistant attorney general for economics during the Clinton administration.
The hearing follows an appeals court ruling last June that Microsoft illegally stifled nascent threats to its monopoly in computer operating systems posed by the Netscape Web browser and the Java programming language of Sun Microsystems.
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court must decide whether to approve a settlement endorsed earlier by Microsoft, the Justice Department and nine other states, or adopt the more restrictive proposals of the coalition of state attorneys general still pursuing the four-year-old antitrust case.
Professor Shapiro argued that the court should impose rules that would lower the barrier to competition in the operating system market by approximately the same amount that Microsoft's illegal acts had raised it.
To that end, he said he supported requiring Microsoft to release the source code to its Internet Explorer browser and to license its popular word processing and spreadsheet programs to run on other operating systems like Linux. 
He also advocated a "parity principle" that would require Microsoft to publish information about Windows that would ensure that rivals in new technologies can develop software that works as well with Microsoft's operating system as the company's own programs.
The virtue of such a regime, Professor Shapiro said, is that consumers would benefit from the pressure on Microsoft to innovate, whether or not competition was restored.
But Mr. Lacovara accused Professor Shapiro of advocating a form of "rough justice." The appeals court had found that the Netscape browser and Java were only potential threats to the operating system, Mr. Lacovara argued, and since it was impossible to measure how much damage Microsoft had done to competition, there was no rationale for a broad remedy.
"There is no direct evidence in this case on which you have relied that any of the unlawful conduct taken by Microsoft had an effect on its monopoly power," Mr. Lacovara said.
In his written testimony, Professor Shapiro characterized that position as "extreme," arguing that to assume that Microsoft's current monopoly position was unaffected by its illegal acts disregarded the findings of the appeals court that Netscape and Java showed potential as threats to the operating system.
Yesterday, Professor Shapiro acknowledged that there was no way to know what would have happened had Microsoft not acted illegally. But he noted that Netscape and Java had had momentum: "The nature of these markets is that when these things take off they can really go and when they get knocked off, they can really crash," Professor Shapiro said. "I think something significant is needed, and I don't think the Microsoft remedy gets us anywhere near there."
When hearings resume Monday, Microsoft will continue to question Professor Shapiro before beginning to call its own witnesses. Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, is expected to testify before the hearings end next month.

HEADLINE: University of Arkansas Receives $300 Million Pledge 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
The University of Arkansas announced yesterday that it had received a commitment for a $300 million gift from the Walton family, heirs of the founder of the Wal-Mart chain. The donation would more than double the size of the university's endowment (most recently valued at $234 million) and is believed to be the largest contribution pledged to a public university.
 University officials said they planned to use the gift to create an honors college at the main Fayetteville campus to attract top undergraduates who might otherwise choose universities outside the state, and to strengthen graduate programs in disciplines like business, engineering and basic sciences. 
 "What the Walton family has done today will improve life in Arkansas for generations to come," the university chancellor, John A. White, said in a statement. "Our state cannot compete in a global economy without a better-educated citizenry." 
Mr. White said Arkansas ranked 49th among the 50 states in the percentage of adults with bachelor's and advanced degrees.
Rob Walton, the chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and a 1966 graduate of the university, said in a statement that the gift, made by his family's charitable foundation, was intended "to improve the standard of living for everyone" in the state and "to develop a vibrant social and cultural life as well."
Wal-Mart, which was founded by Rob Walton's father, Sam, is based in Bentonville, Ark.
The gift, if received in full, would eclipse the $250 million worth of stock committed to the University of Colorado in 2001 by William T. Coleman III, the chairman of BEA Systems Inc., and his wife, Claudia. The Chronicle of Higher Education ranks that commitment as the largest private gift to a public university. It also would eclipse the $150 million bequeathed this year to the University of Texas by John A. Jackson, a retired oil industry executive.
The largest donation pledged to a private institution, the Chronicle says, is $600 million, which was promised last year to the California Institute of Technology by Gordon Moore, the longtime chairman of the Intel Corporation, and his wife, Betty.
Arkansas officials said the Walton gift would enable them to increase the undergraduate enrollment of the Fayetteville campus to 17,000, from 12,500, by 2010. About 2,000 of those students, recruited from both within the state and without, would be enrolled at the proposed honors college, and nearly all would be absolved of paying the $10,000 that the university charges Arkansas residents for annual tuition, room and board.
"Wherever they come from," the university said in a news release, "their matriculation at the University of Arkansas greatly increases the likelihood that they will live in Arkansas after graduation."

HEADLINE: Sales Lag Nestle's Goal for Quarter 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 11 

 BODY:
Nestle S.A., the world's biggest food and beverage company, said today that its first-quarter sales had increased but not by as much as the company had hoped. The disappointing report took the luster off the company's stock, which had been among the best performing in Switzerland.
 Over all, Nestle said, sales were $13.1 billion, up 10.1 percent from the first quarter of 2001, but three-quarters of the increase came from the acquisition of Ralston Purina, the American pet food maker. Excluding acquisitions, currency effects and price changes, the company said, sales were 3.3 percent higher than a year ago. 
 "We are confident that we will again reach our real internal growth target of 4 percent, and that Nestle will once more improve sales and profits for 2002," the company's chief executive, Peter Brabeck, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Lausanne. 
Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, has a worldwide stable of brands including Nestea teas, Taster's Choice and Nescafe coffees and Kit Kat candy bars. Its pet care division nearly doubled in size when it bought Ralston Purina of St. Louis for $11.2 billion last year.
The deal, engineered by Mr. Brabeck, has positioned Nestle to become the largest global pet food maker. Nestle entered the industry in 1985 by buying the Friskies cat food brand and added Alpo in 1994 and Spillers of Britain in 1998. 
Relatively new business lines like bottled water were the brightest spots in the quarter for Nestle, where it posted better performance than its rival, Unilever of the Netherlands. 
Nestle's water sales rose 12 percent, to $10.5 billion, riding the tide of American demand for its well-known brands, including Perrier, Poland Spring, San Pelegrino and Vittel. 
Older business lines performed much more weakly. 
Sales of its traditional chocolate and confectionery products increased 1.3 percent, to $1.6 billion, while sales of ready-made foods and cooking aids rose 4.4 percent. The division that sells dairy products, ice cream and baby food recorded a 5.6 percent increase, but much of it came from buying out its partner in a joint venture to distribute Haagen-Dazs ice cream in the United States.
Alcon, Nestle's eye-care company in America, chalked up an 11 percent increase in revenue in the quarter, to $783 million. Last month, Nestle raised about $3 billion by selling almost a quarter of Alcon in an initial offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
Food processing companies like Nestle are often favored by investors when the economic climate is weak because demand for their products is seen as relatively recession-proof. 
But analysts said today that Nestle's report signaled that consumer spending was soft in much of the developed world. Its shares fell 1.3 percent, to 375 Swiss francs ($226) in trading today in Switzerland.

HEADLINE: End the Options Game 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Leave Options Alone" (Op-Ed, April 5), by John Doerr and Frederick W. Smith: What if, in the mid-1990's, accounting-rule makers had not caved in to lobbyists and instead had forced companies to recognize options as a compensation expense on financial statements? 
 There would still have been a technology boom, a bear market and a period of recession. 
Such cycles are immutable. But there may have been less of the accounting gamesmanship that is now the object of government investigation and investor ire. 
Options should count as an expense to the corporation, and the ability to exercise them should be based on stock performance that exceeds an index of peers.

HEADLINE: Who Controls Schools: Fight Eases, on the Surface 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH and JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Over the last few days, the debate over whether Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg should gain control of the school system has seemingly cooled to a simmer, with City Hall and the Legislature both claiming to have ceded ground and predicting a deal in the near future.
 But in fact, several large obstacles remain. Even as Mr. Bloomberg and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, put a sanguine public face on the negotiations this week, other players are maneuvering behind the scenes to ensure their political needs are taken care of in whatever deal comes to pass. Those players -- including the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus and Randi Weingarten, president of the city teachers' union -- may well try to stall or quash a deal if it does not serve their purposes. 
 Everyone remotely involved -- from state lawmakers to City Council members, from city business leaders to labor unions -- wants to be able to claim victory. The question is whether Mr. Silver and Mr. Bloomberg can persuade the various stakeholders -- or whether the stakeholders can persuade them -- that certain goals can be abandoned in the interest of 1.1 million schoolchildren.
"I'm not taking out the Champagne yet," said Eva S. Moskowitz, chairwoman of the Council's Education Committee, who is pressuring both sides to allow a weakened Board of Education with a limited policy-making role. "I think there was good news this week, but it's still tenuous and could still unravel."
Yesterday, leaders of the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus were smarting over Mr. Silver's public statements that he no longer expected Mr. Bloomberg to promise not to cut the city's share of the schools budget.
Many state legislators, especially those representing poor inner-city neighborhoods, have insisted that any deal include such an assurance. They say the city often uses even small increases in state education aid as an excuse to trim its own share of school financing.
Assemblyman Roger L. Green, the chairman of the caucus, said yesterday that a refusal by Mr. Bloomberg to protect education spending from one year to the next could be "a deal breaker." The caucus members want either a tightening of the current state law that assures "maintenance of effort" on the city's part, Mr. Green said, or the city to dedicate its yearly education aid from the state to a fund used only for instruction, not for school administration. Mr. Bloomberg dislikes both proposals because he fears they would dangerously limit spending flexibility, especially during tough economic times.
"We honestly believe there is not any vote to do the things the mayor wants if there is no commitment on money," Mr. Green said in an interview. 
While it is unclear just how much clout Mr. Green and his caucus have in this debate, they were instrumental in blocking a coup attempt against Mr. Silver in 2000, and as a result, Mr. Silver is unlikely to go against their wishes. Mr. Bloomberg, too, is clearly trying to win Mr. Green and other caucus members to his cause: the mayor yesterday visited Benjamin Banneker Academy, a high school that Mr. Green helped start in Fort Greene.
While Mr. Green said he was honored by the mayor's visit to Banneker, he said he was not pleased with the answers Mr. Bloomberg offered students who asked -- perhaps at the urging of parents and lawmakers -- why he had proposed cutting the schools budget by $358 million.
"The students would say, 'You're cutting the schools budget,' and the mayor would respond, 'Yes, but I'm cutting everything,' " Mr. Green said. "In the African-American communities I represent, that's not acceptable. The people believe that the schools should always be the exception to the rule."
In another behind-the-scenes conflict, aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Silver are still wrangling over what powers and how many members a reconfigured board should have, and even what the board should be called. The mayor wants any board's role to be "advisory," a word that makes state legislative leaders see red. They want a board to "set policy," a phrase that irritates the Bloomberg administration, because lawmakers have yet to define the difference between policy-making and administrative control.
Ms. Moskowitz and Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, are pushing a compromise that would expand the board from 7 to 11 members -- five appointed by the borough presidents, the majority by the mayor -- but allow it to vote only on broad policy changes, not specific administrative actions. The problem then becomes defining in legislation what constitutes a broad policy change.
"It's important to get the law right and not write it up some night at midnight," Ms. Moskowitz said. "We can't say on paper that the mayor has control, but in effect not give it to him."
Yet another potential stumbling block involves the New York City teachers' union, whose members have gone 17 months without a contract. Ms. Weingarten, the union president, is increasingly frustrated that politicians are obsessing over the governance issue instead of working out a teachers' contract. Although she publicly insists that governance and a contract should not be linked, Ms. Weingarten may be pressuring state lawmakers not to yield to Mr. Bloomberg unless his own concessions include a quick resolution to their negotiations.
Ms. Weingarten also has reason to push legislators to extract a promise from Mr. Bloomberg not to cut the schools budget: if the $358 million in proposed cuts go through, the school system will have less money to grant teachers a raise.
Ms. Weingarten, who was backed up this week by a fact-finding panel that recommended a 15 percent raise over 27 months, indicated on Wednesday that she indeed feared being left out in the cold if and when a governance deal was reached.
"Governance and the contract should not be tied together, but they should be proceeding on separate but parallel tracks," she said on Wednesday. "The mayor is a smart, agile guy who is capable of multitasking, so I'm sure he can do both at the same time."

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Japan: Economic Reform Urged 

BYLINE:  By James Brooke (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, urged Japan to revive its economy through structural reforms, not exports. 
At a news conference in Tokyo, Mr. Zoellick said, "I hope Japan does not once again simply rely on export growth to try to come out of this difficulty because ultimately that will be a mistaken strategy for East Asia, which will have to deal with the currency policies of Japan." James Brooke (NYT)

HEADLINE: Ex-Official's Sizable Expenses Renew Debate About Controls 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The inquiry into whether a politically connected Giuliani appointee improperly charged up to a quarter of a million dollars in expenses to a city housing corporation has raised new questions about the level of public scrutiny that such corporations receive.
 The appointee under investigation, Russell A. Harding, was the president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation, a public benefit corporation with the power to provide tax-exempt financing for low- and middle-income housing. 
 Such public benefit corporations, which have multiplied in recent decades, are neither fish nor fowl: they are created by government, often to do the work of government, but they are not bound by all the checks and balances of government.
"These quasi-governmental agencies have proliferated, and still appear to be doing public functions without public accountability," said Peter Bienstock, a former executive director of the state's Commission on Government Integrity, which published a 1990 report, "Underground Government," on the corporations. 
So who has oversight? Both the city comptroller's office and the state comptroller's office have the power to audit the housing corporation, but because it is not a city or state agency, neither is required to. The city comptroller's office last audited the housing corporation in 1983, the state comptroller's office in 1990.
And although the corporation is required by state law to file an audited annual report with the city comptroller within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year, which is Oct. 31, it has yet to file its 2001 report, officials said yesterday. Sarah Miles, a spokeswoman for the corporation, said the report was late because it can take the corporation 90 days to get its financial statements audited by Ernst & Young, its auditor.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the case highlights the need to reexamine the safeguards at the agency.
"I think that even the allegations -- and who knows how the investigation is going to turn out -- give us new impetus to make sure that we have appropriate safeguards in place and enough scrutiny and auditing capabilities to make sure that the public gets government that is honest, and spending their moneys wisely," he said.
The Housing Development Corporation has found itself under a great deal of scrutiny since Tuesday, when The Village Voice reported that its former president, Mr. Harding, had filed more than $250,000 in expenses ranging from stays in four-star hotels, fancy meals and expensive gifts for friends to his morning bagels.
The report prompted an inquiry by the city's Department of Investigation, officials said.
Mr. Harding was appointed to his post in 1998 by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani although he had not completed college and had no housing experience. Because his father, Raymond B. Harding, the leader of the Liberal Party, was one of Mr. Giuliani's most important supporters, his appointment was criticized as a patronage hire.
Russell Harding issued a statement saying that he has reimbursed the corporation for more than $50,000 in expenses, and that he will repay more if needed.
It is far from clear whether the questionable expense filings would have been caught in a government audit. And information about the housing corporation is not hard to come by; data is readily accessible on its Web site, www.nychdc.com, where, even though the 2001 annual report is late, its audited financial statement for 2001 can be found.
But several government watchdogs said yesterday that the case highlights the lack of oversight of public benefit corporations in general. That lack of oversight is, in a way, part of their reason for being.
Governments often create public benefit corporations using the argument that their tasks -- stimulating housing, or economic development, or whatever they may be -- cannot be performed efficiently by heavily regulated government agencies.
But government watchdog groups have long complained that such corporations still need more oversight. The 1990 "Underground Government" report said the corporations are generally exempt from controls designed to prevent abuses ranging from favoritism to "corruption, fraud, waste and misuse of government funds."

HEADLINE: Generals Revolt in Venezuela After 10 Protesters Are Killed 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Friday, April 12 

 BODY:
A group of high-ranking generals broke ranks Thursday night to demand the resignation of President Hugo Chavez after at least 10 people were killed and more than 100 wounded when hundreds of thousands of protesters marched on the presidential palace. 
 Among those who rebelled was the army commander, Gen. Efrain Vasquez Velasco. "Mr. President, I was loyal to the end, but today's deaths cannot be tolerated," he said in a news conference this evening. 
 Late Thursday night, a National Guard general, Alberto Camacho Kairuz, announced that Mr. Chavez's government was out of power and that the armed forces were now in control of the country, one of the top suppliers of oil to the United States.
"The government has abandoned its functions," he said. But early this morning it was unclear who was actually in charge.
Mr. Chavez, a mercurial left-leaning leader whose policies had antagonized much of Venezuelan society, had appeared on national television on Thursday, defiantly telling viewers he would remain in power. 
Early this morning the 24-hour television news station, Globovision, reported that Mr. Chavez had reached out to military officials to negotiate the terms of his resignation.
Local news reports also said that a number of top government ministers had resigned, among them the defense minister, Jose Vicente Rangell, and the finance minister, Gen. Francisco Uson Ramirez.
In the heart of Caracas, young men who support Mr. Chavez roamed the streets Thursday night carrying large sticks and bottles, which they threw at passing cars. It appeared that they were positioned to prevent outsiders from passing along the trash-strewn streets to Miraflores, the presidential palace.
Earlier, Mr. Chavez, in an improvised address that was televised nationally in the midst of pitched street battles between police and demonstrators, scoffed at the possibility that he could be ousted from power. But as he embarked on a long, rambling speech, popular opposition and disgust with his administration was swelling in the wake of the violence against the antigovernment protesters.
The bloodshed came on the third day of a general strike called by labor and business leaders against Mr. Chavez, a populist whose autocratic style had turned much of Venezuela against him in recent months.
It brought a sudden and sharp escalation to Venezuela's turmoil, which had already contributed to wild swings in world oil prices this week. Venezuela, Latin America's only OPEC member, is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and supplies about 15 percent of oil imports to the United States. 
Mr. Chavez also outraged Venezuelans when he ordered five private television stations shut down, charging that they were inciting violence by broadcasting news about the protests. Tanks and troops were then seen moving throughout the outskirts of the city.
In his televised address on Thursday, the president played down the troubles and accused private television stations of urging Venezuelans to try to oust him. At least one of the five stations that he had ordered closed continued to broadcast images of the protests.
"They have put themselves outside the law to instigate violence, knowing there is an insurrectional plan, a crazy plan, a diabolic plan, an irrational plan," said Mr. Chavez, wearing a suit and tie and sitting at a desk with a portrait of the South American liberator, Simon Bolivar, behind him.
In his monologue, Mr. Chavez questioned the strength of the strike, saying, "What stoppage?" But then, alluding to the protesters in the streets, he said, "I am worried about the situation, of course. How could I not be?"
The president said he had ordered troops to surround the presidential palace, "to have a cushion" to protect people inside and pro-government protesters just outside.
By late Thursday afternoon, confusion and panic reigned in the streets of Caracas.
Police threw tear gas canisters to disperse demonstrators and shots started to ring out, some apparently from rooftops. Venezuelan television showed plainclothes gunmen firing wildly, using semiautomatic handguns, as people scrambled in fear through streets shrouded by the police tear gas.
Gen. Carlos Martinez of the National Guard said in a news conference that his troops had witnessed the shootings. He said the gunmen who had fired on the protesters were from the Bolivarian Circles, pro-government neighborhood groups.
"They used violence on the other protesters," he said.
The mayor of Caracas, Alfredo Pena, a strident opponent of the president, said the government had "unleashed their Dobermans," charging that the gunmen came from the pro-Chavez district of Libertador.
"They began to shoot like they were hunting, just firing away," Mr. Pena said in a televised interview.
Many of the wounded, shot as they ran through the streets, were taken to the Jose Maria Vargas Hospital in downtown Caracas, a trauma center that was filled with bloodied protesters and frantic doctors. 
"We had a complete collapse," said Dr. Pablo Rausseo, the emergency room chief, late in the night as things calmed down. "We were not prepared for so many hurt people." He said, however, that the emergency room's regular team of 10 doctors was beefed up to 60 with the arrival of doctors from other hospitals.
Pedro Aristimuno, the secretary of health for metropolitan Caracas, said that 10 people who suffered mortal wounds in the fracas were brought into the Vargas hospital. "What we noticed was that the most serious wounds were in the cranium and cheek," he said in an interview. "They appeared to be shots from above."
After the violence, a group of generals and other high-ranking officers held a news conference to call for Mr. Chavez to step down. "We cannot allow a tyrant to run the Republic of Venezuela," said Navy Vice Adm. Hector Rafael Ramirez.
The strike organizers calling the work stoppage were angered by Mr. Chavez's management changes at Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil behemoth that is the economic pillar of the country. The strike shuttered many of Venezuela's offices and factories and severely hobbled the oil company.
Mr. Chavez's defiant refusal to talk with the protesters, whom he called "traitors" and "subversives," further antagonized his opponents.
"Chavez get out!" Carlos Ortega, president of the million-member Venezuelan Workers Confederation, shouted in a street rally. "We do not want you! We reject you!"
Mr. Chavez seemed to give his opponents a peace offering at the end of his televised talk, announcing the creation of two commissions to deal with the conflict at Petroleos de Venezuela and to address other concerns about his government.
Pedro Carmona, leader of the powerful Fedecamaras business group, and Mr. Ortega, the labor confederation president, were meeting into the evening and had not responded to the president's announcement.
Observers, though, said that they did not believe that there could be a negotiated solution now.
In an unusual announcement, Gen. Lucas Rincon, the armed forces chief, went on national television Thursday afternoon and denied rumors that Mr. Chavez had been asked to resign by the military or was in the custody of the army.
"The situation in the country is normal," said General Rincon. "We call on the Venezuelan people to maintain calm."

HEADLINE: Elton John Plays the Capitol, for AIDS Money 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
First came Bono. Now, Elton John.
 Continuing in the steps of the Irish rock star who dazzled official Washington last month while pleading for more money to fight international poverty and AIDS, Sir Elton swept through Capitol Hill today to prod lawmakers and the Bush administration to increase financing to eradicate the worldwide AIDS epidemic. 
 His hair was the color of a sunburst. His suit was appropriately conservative -- navy blue Versace, complete with matching shoes. (The distinctive gold emblems on the heels were a dead giveaway.)
His hosts, a few of whom received him in a private meeting before he testified in the Senate, were starstruck on a bipartisan basis.
"I've been an admirer for years," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican and occasional songwriter, whose own tunes tend toward the religious.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, told Sir Elton he was "absolutely fantastic" at a private concert during the recent World Economic Forum in New York. Mr. Leahy then produced an expensive set of Elton John compact discs for the witness to sign.
"A boxed set!" Sir Elton exclaimed, reaching for a pen.
Sir Elton's appearance before the Senate health committee, at the invitation of its chairman, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, came as Congress considers measures that would appropriate anywhere from $500 million to $2.5 billion for the global fight against AIDS next year. 
A spokesman for Mr. Kennedy said the senator wanted to "raise visibility and awareness of this issue" while lawmakers deliberate.
The White House has pledged $800 million in international AIDS spending for 2003, including $200 million to a new global fund to fight AIDS. But Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations, has said $10 billion a year is needed.
Advocates for people with AIDS and some lawmakers, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, are calling for the United States to contribute a quarter of that, or $2.5 billion a year.
"I don't think we've stepped up and given our fair share," Senator Clinton said today.
Sir Elton, whose Elton John AIDS Foundation has raised $35 million in the last 10 years to help patients in 55 countries, did not mention a specific amount in his testimony today. 
In an interview before his appearance, he said he had never testified in front of a government body before -- "I've never been asked," he explained -- and confessed to being a bit nervous. But he said he would "use my celebrity" if it could do some good.
Later, Sir Elton told the lawmakers that they had a moral obligation to act. 
"No nation, corporation, foundation or individual has the money you have. No one even comes close," he said. "I am no student of government, but I understand there are two ends to Pennsylvania Avenue, and this end controls the money."
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, replied, "Tell that to the other end."

HEADLINE: Investor Discontent 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
For several months, Wall Street firms and securities regulators have been rewriting the rules of stock research in an effort to regain some of the credibility that evaporated when the technology bubble burst. But suddenly, that patchwork approach looks like it may not hold off the critical masses. 
 The attorney general of New York, Eliot L. Spitzer, is attacking Wall Street's most glaring conflict of interest with a vengeance. In taking on Merrill Lynch, the biggest brokerage firm, he has insisted that more footnotes in research reports will not satisfy him. He wants more distance between investment bankers and the analysts who are supposed to be making independent judgments about stocks. 
 In negotiations with Merrill Lynch's lawyers, Mr. Spitzer and his staff demanded that Merrill split off its research department as a separate unit. Officials at Merrill and other Wall Street firms scoffed at the idea as naive, but Mr. Spitzer has not backed down.
He has pledged to make Henry Blodget, Merrill's former star Internet stock analyst, and others testify in public. He has issued subpoenas to several other firms and has said he might also file criminal fraud charges.
David Pottruck, co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, sees Mr. Spitzer trying to tap into a keg of investor discontent that has been a long time brewing. Mr. Pottruck has been railing for years against the conflicts of the big brokerage houses that Schwab competes with, but even he does not foresee a breakup of the financial conglomerates that have come to dominate Wall Street.
Still, he said, something must be done before investors lose faith. "It's a little disheartening to see companies tout the depths of their wisdom and then put out research that is so incredibly flawed," Mr. Pottruck said. "This doesn't just hurt a company, it hurts our industry. No company, no matter what their business model, is immune from the dissatisfaction, mistrust and disappointment investors are feeling. We see it as investors' being angry."
Mr. Pottruck said he did not expect the sort of wholesale changes that Mr. Spitzer was calling for, but he said more change was needed to assuage irate investors.
That rage has not yet registered with everyone on Wall Street. Yesterday, as Merrill was being granted another week to make court-ordered changes to its stock reports, the industry's main trade group was arguing against proposed reforms.
Stuart Kaswell, general counsel of the Securities Industry Association, said the group was preparing to weigh in against a proposed requirement from securities regulators that analysts disclose details of any banking relationships their employers had with the companies they were rating. He said the requirement would be too costly and would not help investors evaluate the research.
It should be sufficient, Mr. Kaswell said, for the firms to state, as many already do, that they may have done or hope to do some investment banking for a particular company. Saying more would run the risk of disclosing confidential information about an investment banking client, which could be illegal, he argued. "Our best answer to that is a plain-English disclosure that says we may have received money from this company and you should know that," Mr. Kaswell said.
Mr. Pottruck disagreed. "I think these new proposals are completely inadequate to solve the problems," he said.
Mr. Spitzer has already persuaded a judge in New York State Supreme Court to make Merrill do more. In an order whose deadline was extended yesterday until the end of next week, Merrill was told to start disclosing whether it had or was seeking financial ties to companies its analysts covered.
Merrill pleaded for more time but has already made some changes. Research notes it published this week included footnotes about opinions the firm had been paid to deliver on the fairness of certain mergers and acquisitions.
Those footnotes were probably not read as widely as the internal e-mail messages Mr. Spitzer collected and filed with the court on Monday. Mr. Spitzer said the messages showed that Merrill analysts had much more negative opinions about companies' prospects than they were sharing with Merrill customers. They caught analysts discussing the pressure they felt to overrate companies that Merrill had landed or hoped to land as investment banking clients.
That conflict has been apparent to Wall Street insiders and some sophisticated investors for many years. Most major brokerage firms -- including Merrill, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Salomon Smith Barney and UBS PaineWebber -- live under the same roof with investment banks. 
Despite what Mr. Spitzer called "dramatic evidence" to the contrary, Mr. Kaswell insisted that most analysts were unbiased and that securities firms knew better than to risk compromising the integrity of research to make more money.
Their research is "the crown jewel of the brands of those firms," Mr. Kaswell said. "It's just not credible to think that senior management would tolerate an institutional pressuring of one of their major franchises to get the next transaction."
Mr. Kaswell said many people, including analysts, became too exuberant about stocks in the late 90's. "That doesn't mean they were corrupt," he said. "It means they were wrong. Being wrong isn't criminal."
Either way, problems are bound to arise when people try to serve two masters, Mr. Pottruck said. He suggested that banks should be banned from distributing research on their corporate clients. "The real issue isn't good or bad people," he said. "The real issue is the organization's DNA."
There is a pervasive conflict, he said, that comes from focusing on the needs of institutional clients while treating brokerage customers as "the end point in a distribution chain of investment products."
Mr. Pottruck said, "Individual investors ought to have certain rights and a system that serves their interests, that's invented around them, that protects them, where they're at the center."

HEADLINE: McCall and Cuomo Pull Back From Council's Call for Taxes 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The two Democratic candidates for New York governor have distanced themselves from a proposal by City Council Democrats to raise taxes to balance the city's budget and pay for education programs, warning that tax increases might harm the city at a time when it is struggling through difficult fiscal times.
 The remarks by the candidates, H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, put them closer to the views of Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican mayor, than those of Gifford Miller, the Democratic speaker of the Council. Mr. Bloomberg flatly rejected the Council's proposal for, among other things, an income tax surcharge, reinstitution of a commuter tax, and a tax on alcoholic beverages. The Council urged the steps as a way to head off spending cuts that the mayor has sought. 
 Of the two Democratic candidates seeking the nomination to run against Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Cuomo was more definitive in ruling out support for any tax increases. Mr. McCall was more measured, saying he would prefer programs that foster economic development, and thus tax revenues, rather than imposing any increase in tax rates.
"I am not at this time looking at taxes," Mr. McCall said on Tuesday, after winning the support of more than 23 members of the City Council, in response to questions about Mr. Miller's proposal. "I'm looking at other ways of increasing revenue, at this time." 
As for the Council plan, Mr. McCall, who is the state comptroller, said: "I'm looking at their proposal. I know they've come forward with a proposal that's important, but we've got to find the best way to increase revenue in this state." 
Mr. Cuomo was more forceful in rejecting the proposal. Mr. Pataki defeated his father, Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994, by repeatedly painting him as a proponent of high taxes, and the defeat has clearly influenced Mr. Cuomo's own position on issues of taxes and spending.
"We are in a very precarious position right now -- it's still a fragile situation," Mr. Cuomo said, adding: "I think it's the wrong time to come up with a new tax package. People are mobile, people can make decisions, and one of the main factors in making these locational determinations is taxes."
One of the main elements of Mr. Miller's plan was to call on the State Legislature to reinstitute a tax on commuters it eliminated over the objection of New York City officials. While such a step might be popular among some city residents, it would clearly be disliked in the suburbs. In any event, few people believe it has any chance of being reinstated in this election year.
Mr. McCall declined to offer his opinion on whether the tax should be reinstated. 
Mr. Cuomo said he believed ending it was a mistake but would not support reinstating it now.
Mr. Miller, through a spokesman, said he was not concerned with the prospect of both gubernatorial candidates opposing his plan. His chief of staff, Forrest R. Taylor, said, "If any of the gubernatorial candidates, Democrat or Republicans, have another way to tackle this problem, we'd be delighted to hear it."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ENERGY MARKET; 
Enron Trading Gave Prices Artificial Lift, Panel Is Told

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 

 BODY:
A top California regulator told Congress today that the Enron Corporation engaged in sham transactions in late 2000 that drove up electricity prices and helped worsen the energy crisis that plagued the West for more than a year.
 Testifying to a subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said regulators had studied Enron's actions in the fourth quarter of 2000 and had determined that five subsidiaries traded large volumes of electricity contracts among themselves in an effort to push up prices. 
 Ms. Lynch said the effect of the trading was to set prices throughout the wholesale electricity market in California far above what was justified. "I believe these trades were sham transactions," Ms. Lynch said. The company, she said, "would trade among itself to drive the price up." 
Enron said that it had not manipulated prices and that the problems in California were a result of a flawed deregulation system combined with other factors like a drought in the Northwest and a temporary decline in generating capacity.
"We have and we will continue to cooperate with the committee's investigation," a spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said. "We have cooperated with numerous previous investigations, all of which found that the market structure was the cause of California's energy crisis, not Enron." The committee did not invite Enron to send a representative to the hearing.
Other witnesses from California, including S. David Freeman, the chairman of the California Power Authority; and Joseph Dunn, a state senator who is leading an inquiry into the power crisis, concurred with Ms. Lynch that Enron, with other energy companies, had manipulated prices.
"We must recognize that the so-called invisible hand of Adam Smith was Enron and their fellow gougers picking the pockets of Californians to the tune of billions of dollars," Mr. Freeman said. "Prices were skyrocketing in California in late 2000 and early 2001 as a direct result of Enron's influence and participation."
Today's hearing continued a battle between Enron and many of California's most prominent officeholders and appointees -- most of them Democrats -- over who is to blame for the spike in electricity rates.
The crisis, which eased last summer after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intervened, briefly hobbled the state's economy, threw its politics into turmoil and left California taxpayers and consumers with a multibillion-dollar hangover.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said Enron "used us as a cash cow to keep that company afloat, to keep the stock price high so insiders could cash out."
But some Republicans suggested that Enron was being used as a whipping boy by Californians for their botched effort at deregulating their electricity market. Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, told the hearing that he was "skeptical" that Enron had anything to do with the problem, which also afflicted other Western states.
Some witnesses at today's hearing said it was difficult to know precisely what Enron's role had been in influencing prices because the data available about transactions in energy markets was hard to interpret.
But they said there was considerable evidence that Enron planned to drive prices up and profit in a variety of ways. Robert McCullough, an energy analyst from Portland, Ore., who has studied Enron's activities, told the panel that the company sold a site for a power plant in Oregon in 1999 in a deal that suggested the company knew electricity prices would rise sharply.
Mr. McCullough said the deal ended with the site being 50 percent owned by LJM2, an investment partnership managed by a senior Enron executive that is at the heart of the problems that pushed the company into bankruptcy protection last year. Internal Enron documents, he said, showed that LJM2 anticipated a 22 percent return on investment from the project even as Enron was telling the Oregon Public Utilities Commission that it expected 15 percent.
"LJM2 apparently was able to either operate in the same markets with vastly more expertise than Enron," Mr. McCullough said, "or LJM2's estimate showed foreknowledge of the events to come."
Ms. Lynch said an examination of electricity trading by Enron affiliates and subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2000 showed that about 30 percent of the transactions were among themselves. She said her analysis was based on data supplied by Enron to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. She did not address the possibility that the trades reflected market pressures driving prices upward.
The Enron-related companies -- the New Power Company, Enron Energy Services, Enron Energy Marketing, Enron Power Marketing and Portland General Electric -- traded nearly 12 million megawatt-hours of electricity in the period at prices ranging from 5 cents a megawatt-hour to $3,322 an hour, she said.
A megawatt-hour is enough to run 1,000 room air-conditioners for about an hour. Before deregulation, utilities typically bought and sold electricity at around $30 a megawatt-hour.
"Enron was selling the same megawatts back and forth to itself, causing the price to rise with each sale, all under the rules it had helped to create," Ms. Lynch said in her prepared testimony. "The selling back and forth also created the illusion of an active, volatile market."
Because Enron booked as revenue the value of each trade, the transactions allowed the company "to create false value," she said. And because Enron reported the trades on its online trading system, she said, they created an artificially high benchmark price for other companies buying and selling power. In addition to benefiting directly from the trades at higher prices, she said, Enron profited by creating the appearance that transmission lines would be overburdened by huge flows of electricity among various power sources.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SANCTIONS; 
How Blocking Assets Erased a Wisp of Prosperity

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia 

 BODY:
Al Barakaat's headquarters here is a white three-story building on a street jammed with decrepit trucks and donkey carts, and guarded by young men lounging on the sidewalk with their AK-47's.
 Inside, the first floor is split between the cellphone subsidiary, which now offers only local calls, and the former leading branch of the bank, which is now closed, its tall teller chairs empty behind dusty counters. 
 Ali Bashi Ugas, 40, a jobless former cabby, stood outside. His extended family, he said, used to get up to $500 a month from relatives working as taxi drivers and cooks in America, and now he begs from neighbors to feed his children. 
"Sometimes, we boil water and tell them we are preparing food," he said. "If we get some food, we put it in. If the children fall asleep, we take the pot off the fire."
Al Barakaat is not some shady money-changer; it is Somalia's biggest employer. In a land devastated by civil war and drought, it ran the biggest bank, the biggest phone system and the only water-purification plant.
Though the Bush administration says the company has secret links to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, its open corporate links were to Citibank for money transfers and to AT&T for international calls, and it was negotiating with Coca-Cola to become a bottler.
When Washington froze Al Barakaat's assets, it crippled the company, forcing it to lay off 700 employees. Thousands lost their deposits, and those awaiting money from relatives in Europe and the United States were cut off. 
The United Nations estimates that Somalia received $700 million in remittances a year, while foreign aid from the West, after administrative expenses, amounts to about $25 million a year, Andre Le Sage, a Somalia scholar, estimated.
Hundreds of former doctors, lawyers and engineers whose government jobs disappeared in a decade of civil war found work as Barakaat cashiers and phone technicians, Mr. Le Sage said. They are now jobless. 
"I am a veterinarian, a specialist in anatomy and physiology," said Abdulahi Basto, 47. "I worked at Barakaat for six years. It was a good job -- $600 a month. I have 20 children by three wives. Now I am jobless. I have no ability to feed them."
Even Afghanistan was treated better, he insists.
"Before the U.S. went to bomb," Mr. Basto said, "they sent a message -- give us bin Laden, or we will bomb. But they didn't send any message to us." 
Other banks will not hire him, he said, and Abdullah Nur, local manager for a rival bank, Dahab Shiil, confirmed this. "We don't hire Barakaat employees," Mr. Nur said. "We're afraid of the U.S."
His business was up 35 percent since Barakaat's assets were frozen, Mr. Nur said, and he has opened eight new branches. With his biggest competitor gone, he can charge 5 percent on each money transfer; Al Barakaat charged 3 percent.
The freeze of assets also brought hardship outside the economy.
Malnutrition rates among children in the southern Gedo region were at "very alarming levels" in January, said Laura Melo, a World Food Program spokeswoman, because of a combination of poor rains, a ban on cattle and camel exports for health reasons, runaway inflation and the abrupt cutoff of Al Barakaat remittances.

HEADLINE: Index of Prices At Wholesale Is Up Sharply 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12 

 BODY:
Sharply higher gasoline costs drove up wholesale prices in March by the largest amount in 14 months, the government reported today. In addition, shoppers, hit by higher energy bills, spent modestly on other items. 
 The government reports released today suggested that the economy was hitting some rough patches. Though many economists believe that the surge in energy prices is temporary and note that oil prices have retreated, the increase helped make consumers less willing to spend. 
 The 1 percent jump in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, followed a 0.2 percent increase in February, and reflected a sharp increase in energy prices, especially gasoline. 
Excluding the volatile energy and food prices, the core rate of wholesale inflation nudged up just 0.1 percent in March after being flat in February, suggesting most other prices are remaining well behaved. For the 12 months ending in March, wholesale prices fell 1.4 percent. 
At the same time, the Commerce Department said, sales at retailers rose a modest 0.2 percent in March for the second consecutive month. 
While the increase was smaller than expected, analysts said it showed that consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity in the United States, were still buying. 
Consumers bought electronics and appliances, building and garden supplies and sporting goods. They cut back on cars, home furnishings and clothes, and ate out less often. 
Sales at car dealers fell 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.7 percent in February. Sales at furniture and home furnishings stores fell 0.2 percent after a 1 percent gain.
"The consumer is still buying, but the pace is moderate, not exuberant," said Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
Consumers' confidence in the economy has edged lower, according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer sentiment, falling to 94.4 in April from 95.7 in March. 
Energy prices accounted for most of the volatility, and concern, in March. The 5.5 percent jump in energy prices was the largest monthly jump since June 2000. Gas prices rose 21.3 percent in March, the biggest jump in nearly three years.
Economists said today's reports raised the odds that the Federal Reserve would wait until after May to begin raising interest rates. Citing signs of a turnaround, the Fed had opted to leave rates alone in January and March.

HEADLINE: NASA Says 2004 Mission Will Include Schoolteacher 

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

 BODY:
Outlining a modest vision for the NASA of the future, the space agency's new administrator said yesterday that it would concentrate on research and education -- including finally sending a schoolteacher into space in 2004.
 Sean O'Keefe, who took over as director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in December, said the agency needed to return to its fundamentals as a research agency, emphasizing the development of technology that could improve space exploration or promote national security. He called for more science-based exploration of the solar system and for inspiring future scientists and explorers through an education initiative. 
 "What we have done in our vision of the future and its mission road map is to make education a core mission element," he said in a speech at Syracuse University, where he is an alumnus. "This is not only self-sustaining for our own mission, but also a very real necessity for the country if we are to remain economically secure."
Mr. O'Keefe, a former White House budget official, was selected by President Bush with a mandate to straighten out budget problems and improve NASA's management. The visionary language of past administrators was largely absent from his speech.
To emphasize the importance of education and spur young people's interest in space, Mr. O'Keefe said it was time for NASA to complete the unfinished business of sending a teacher into space.
Barbara Morgan, a former third-grade teacher from McCall, Idaho, will be part of a space shuttle mission, and possibly visit the International Space Station, in 2004, he said. Mrs. Morgan, 50, has been in training as an astronaut at the Johnson Space Center in Houston since 1998.
Mrs. Morgan was the backup for Christa McAuliffe, the first teacher-in-space candidate, who died with six other astronauts in the 1986 Challenger explosion. After the accident, the teacher program was canceled, but Mrs. Morgan was admitted as an astronaut candidate in 1998 and designated the first educator mission specialist.
Mr. O'Keefe said the educator program would be expanded and, with the help of the Department of Education, other teachers would be sought to be trained as astronauts who also had expertise in teaching from space or developing new kinds of space-based education programs.
NASA should develop nuclear propulsion technology to speed the flight of spacecraft for deep space exploration, Mr. O'Keefe said, and work with other agencies on earth studies and security issues, such as improving airplane safety and making transportation systems more efficient and secure.
As he has said on other occasions, Mr. O'Keefe said he would push NASA to develop a management style that emphasized competition, ending duplication and promoting better financial accountability. This includes tighter management of the space station program, he said, where American expenditures are more than $4.8 billion over an original $17 billion budget.
Dr. John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Mr. O'Keefe's remarks showed a shift in emphasis at NASA rather than in fundamentals.
"There is more emphasis on earth applications, security in collaboration with other agencies and education and less stress on exotic technologies and far-reaching goals," Dr. Logsdon said.

HEADLINE: Minnesota's Governor Is Hitting a Rough Spot 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, April 11 

 BODY:
Here in his office, he sits in a big chair behind a big redwood desk, the image of two men fitted into one: both Jesse the Body and Jesse Ventura, the governor.
 It is difficult to know which of the two is holding the stogie, wearing the charcoal gray suit and waxing about his possibilities, preferably on a national stage, after his political life in Minnesota is over. 
 Is it the in-your-face former professional wrestler? Or the savvy populist governor who has yet to announce whether he will seek a second term?
What is clear is that Jesse Ventura has reached a political crossroads. Even as he ponders his future, a political poll taken last month shows that his approval rating has dipped to 43 percent, an all-time low since he won a surprising victory in a three-way race in 1998. 
Mr. Ventura's slide from public grace -- at least his current dip in popularity -- may be linked to a state budget crisis and to the feeling of many Minnesotans that the governor, at times, has seemed disengaged while appearing to tend to his personal interests. 
There is the issue of his contentious relationship with the local news media and his labeling of reporters as "official jackals." Then there is his brashness and his call-it-as-he-sees-it style that has wounded some, embarrassed others and left the governor reassessing how much of Jesse the Body may be too much for the political ring. 
"When you hold these positions, you learn that you're not just a spokesman for yourself," Mr. Ventura said today in an interview in his office at the Capitol, recalling the heat he took for calling organized religion "a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people" in a 1999 Playboy interview. That point, Mr. Ventura says, was the lowest in his term as governor.
"What I had to learn from that is that I also represent the State of Minnesota now, so that anything I say has a direct reflection on the State of Minnesota," he said. "So you can't quite be as flamboyant or outrageous."
Whether the governor, a former Reform Party member, now an independent, could win a second term, or whether he will even seek one, remains a mystery. His critics -- and even some of those who voted for him -- contend that he has worn out his welcome.
"He systematically abuses everybody," said Roger Moe, the majority leader of the State Senate, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. "He has no good will in the Legislature or in the press corps.
"When he was elected, there was a collective gasp across the state, but everyone said we would make it work for him. The Legislature did everything they could for him. The public wanted to give him credit, and he had a chance to bring young people into the process, but what we thought to be refreshing and different is now boorish and embarrassing." 
State Senator Becky Lourey, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, agrees. 
"Jesse is crashing into budget realities," said Ms. Lourey, who hopes to capitalize on the governor's rift with teachers and school administrators over cuts in education spending. "Having a celebrity for governor isn't quite as entertaining anymore. He tends to divide people. He uses anger."
Dave Miller, a school bus driver, said he voted for Mr. Ventura because he was not the "run of the mill" politician who "kissed up to everybody." Now, Mr. Miller said, he doubts he would vote for Mr. Ventura again.
"We ask ourselves every day what the hell we were thinking," said Mr. Miller, 63, sitting in a downtown Minneapolis restaurant this week.
Sitting nearby, Mr. Miller's friend Lyle Schutte, 63, said he would vote for Mr. Ventura a second time.
"But my wife thinks he makes too much noise," Mr. Schutte said, laughing. "So I think I'd have to convince her to vote for him." 
Some voters seem to believe that the governor has not been devoting enough time to the governor's duties, finding time to promote his books and to moonlight as a professional wrestling referee and as a commentator for the short-lived XFL football league. 
The governor rejects such criticism, pointing to his efforts to cut taxes and limit the growth of government while making government more accountable. Even his critics say he has assembled a praiseworthy cabinet. The tax rebate checks, which became known as "Jesse checks," may have won him points with the public. 
But the onset of an economic slump left Mr. Ventura, like governors of other states, with the difficult task of dealing with a projected shortage of more than $2 billion.
Mr. Ventura proposed a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, including reduced state spending in school districts, a plan that was criticized by legislators as unnecessary. 
Mr. Ventura says the Legislature's opposition to him has worked to unite Republicans and Democrats. That was apparent in an unusual bipartisan agreement to resolve most of the state's projected budget shortage in a plan that spared school spending and relied instead on state budget reserves. Mr. Ventura vetoed the proposal, but he was overridden.
In the aftermath, a Minneapolis Star Tribune poll in March found that only 43 percent of voters approved of Mr. Ventura's performance and 49 percent disapproved, a sharp decline from an approval rating of more than 70 percent a year ago. 
Mr. Ventura shrugged off the finding, saying this week that "polls are like the wind." He said he believes that the wind will eventually shift in his favor, and that still having an approval rating of more than 40 percent is not bad, given that he won the 1998 election with 37 percent of votes cast. 
He added: "Rather than them judging my policies, it's probably my personality. People are so in tuned to having these stereotypical politicians that never are politically incorrect, that always dress in three-piece suits, that fit the mold." 
That he does not.
Mr. Ventura has until July to decide whether to run again. He dismissed rumors that he might seek a Senate seat. He said that it would take "a sweet thing" to lure him from his governor's chair and that until further notice he should be considered as in the race. That's Jesse Ventura, the governor, speaking, though Jesse the Body is never far away.
"When I'm behind the desk, I control Jesse the Body," Mr. Ventura said, laughing hard, still holding his stogie. "When I go out from behind this desk, he can reappear real strong. He's waiting. He's inside lots of times shaking the bars. 'Turn me loose.' "

Jesse Ventura has been spending too much time on personal interests, like refereeing professional wrestling. (Craig Lassig)

HEADLINE: Faculty Pay Is Up 3.8%, the Most in 11 Years 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
Faculty salaries at the nation's colleges and universities rose 3.8 percent in the current academic year to an average of $62,895, the largest increase in 11 years, the American Association of University Professors reported yesterday.
 The association's report predicts that the increase in faculty salary will be smaller in 2002-03 because of the economic downturn that peaked after the events of Sept. 11. The sagging economy did not dent the current raises because they were set at the end of the last school year. 
 The report showed sharp differences in pay among the nation's academic institutions, with research universities and the most selective colleges paying professors far more than colleges that focus on drawing students from their regions.
At the nation's top universities, the average salary for a full professor ranged from $100,000 to more than $140,000, the report said.
Full professors at Harvard University, the best paid in the nation, make almost $145,000 on average, while those at Yale and Stanford average around $131,000.
At the nation's less selective colleges and universities, the annual salaries for full professors average less than $40,000 a year.
At McPherson College in Kansas, for example, full professors average $39,100 a year; at Tennessee Wesleyan College, the figure is $37,700.
As university and college trustees meet now through June to set budgets for next year, the recession is expected to crimp salary increases. The endowments of many colleges and universities shrank last year, and tuition increases for private institutions are expected to be greater in 2002-03 than in recent years.
At the same time, public universities will receive less from state governments next school year because of dwindling state revenues. Many state universities have raised tuition more than 10 percent to offset the declining state aid.
"Tuition increases in the public sector are not enough to make up for the cuts in state aid," said Dr. Ronald G. Ehrenberg, an economics professor and director of the Cornell University Higher Education Research Institute.
Private colleges and universities will fare better than the public ones, Dr. Ehrenberg predicted, because their endowments, some substantial, will provide a cushion against the downturn.
"I fully expect that faculty in the public institutions will lose ground to faculty of the private institutions," Dr. Ehrenberg said.
Since inflation between December 2000 and December 2001 was 1.6 percent, the report said, the real faculty salary increases this year, adjusted for inflation, averaged 2.2 percent, the largest jump since the mid-1980's. 
Despite the increases, though, the income of professors lags behind those of other professions that require similar educations, the report found. On average, doctors earn 70 percent more; lawyers, roughly 50 percent more; and engineers, about 30 percent more, it said.
Among faculty ranks, assistant professors got the biggest raises, 4.8 percent, the report said. That compares with 4.2 percent for full professors and 3.8 percent for associate professors. The gap between the pay of faculty women and their male counterparts continued, the report said, with male full professors averaging $85,437 and similar women, $75,425.
The report was based on a survey of 1,433 schools. It does not include salary figures for medical professors, typically much better paid.

HEADLINE: Favorite in Special Election Is Thinking Primary 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
By almost any indication, Michele Titus's prospects seem particularly bright in a special election next Tuesday for an Assembly seat representing an area in southeast Queens.
 Ms. Titus, a lawyer who is also a Democratic district leader, is the Democratic candidate in a district where the number of voters registered in her party is 10 times larger than the number of registered Republicans. She has been endorsed by a wide number of Democratic officials, including United States Representative Gregory W. Meeks and most of the elected officials in that area of Queens. 
 Still, Ms. Titus, 32, insists that she is running the race as though it were a closely contested contest.
"I am taking nothing for granted," Ms. Titus said. "We're doing everything in this race as seriously as we can. We're out there from the early morning hours until late at night, every day."
And there is little wonder. While Ms. Titus is expected to breeze to incumbency in Tuesday's election, where she faces opponents of the Republican and Conservative labels, a strong turnout and robust victory might discourage any challengers from running against her in the near future.
Indeed, Tuesday's special election is only the first skirmish, with the next one coming in five months. The September Democratic primary is expected to be a crowded and heated contest and up to a half-dozen or so candidates are already lining up.
The race in the 31st Assembly District is to fill the unexpired term of Pauline Rhodd-Cummings, who died earlier this year. The district includes South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Springfield Gardens and, across Jamaica Bay, Far Rockaway.
Unlike the nonpartisan nature of special elections for City Council seats, candidates in special elections for seats in the State Legislature are selected by the various political parties. In the case of special elections in Queens, the Democratic Party selects its nominees by a vote of the party's district leaders in the area where the election is to be held.
Because Ms. Titus was one of four district leaders who determined who the party's nominee would be, her status as the Democratic candidate was largely viewed as a foregone conclusion by the many Democratic candidates who sought to replace Ms. Rhodd-Cummings.
One candidate, Michael DuValle, a Queens businessman, sought and gained the nomination of the Independent and Conservative Parties in the special election. But others decided to wait until September, when the race for the nomination will be more open. (The Republican candidate is Marina Rejas, a member of the Republican Party's executive committee in Queens.)
Charles A. Pringle, a former prosecutor in the Bronx who was once an aide to former Congressman Floyd A. Flake, is but one who said he was definitely running in the September primary.
"She may wind up being the winner in this special election," Mr. Pringle said. "But that will by no means guarantee that she will be the Democratic nominee after the primary in September."
In the meantime, Ms. Titus insists that a huge victory in Tuesday's special election would be an especially important symbol in dissuading possible opponents in the September primary.
"I want to win big," she said, in her campaign office in the second floor of a storefront building on Rockaway Boulevard. "I'm not just looking at Tuesday, but I'm looking at the primary in September."
Ms. Titus, who is eight months' pregnant with her second child, campaigns from 6 a.m., when she greets subway riders at the A train station in Far Rockaway, until she leaves an array of civic association meetings in the late evening, seeking to take a nap in midafternoon.
When she meets potential voters, she discusses the need to improve the performance of the public schools in the district, although she is often less than specific about her proposals. For example, she does not favor mayoral control of the city's public schools, but said she had not yet determined how the schools should be run.
"As for the kind of model I favor," she said, "I don't have a specific model. But we need to ensure that our parents can have confidence in the schools."
Similarly, she said that she would seek to stimulate job creation and business development along such economically challenged commercial thoroughfares as Mott Avenue in the Rockaway Peninsula and Rockaway Boulevard.
But when asked what specific measures she would endorse, Ms. Titus said, "I'm in the process of sitting down with business owners in the area and finding out their ideas."
Still, she insisted that she was working feverishly to ensure that she got Democratic voters to the polls on Tuesday, pointing out that only 2,800 people voted in the special election in 1998 that sent Ms. Rhodd-Cummings to Albany.
"Special elections are incredibly unpredictable," Ms. Titus said. "So, we have to work overtime to make sure we do all that we can to win."

HEADLINE: A Fateful Journey to Jerusalem 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It's paradoxical that your April 12 editorial "Bulldozing Hope in the Mideast" holds Israel largely responsible for the Palestinians' economic plight. This criticism of Israel comes at the most inopportune moment as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell opens his peace mission and as yet another suicide bomber strikes in Jerusalem. 
 Furthermore, your editorial fails to recognize that for 18 years (1949 to 1967) the Palestinian economy was under the control of Arab regimes. Instead of focusing on building a viable economy, they supported a violent and corrupt Palestinian leadership and incited the Palestinian people to destroy Israel. Until there is more enlightened leadership in the Arab world, there can be no hope for Secretary Powell's mission, let alone for economic growth among the Palestinian people.

HEADLINE: Tax Proposal In New Jersey Has Businesses Up in Arms 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 12 

 BODY:
When Gov. James E. McGreevey first called for changes in New Jersey's corporate tax code last month, he assured the state's uneasy business leaders that he intended only to eliminate the loopholes that allow some companies to avoid paying their fair share.
 Mr. McGreevey, facing a $5.3 billion budget gap, said that one cause of the state's fiscal problems was its woefully outdated tax system, which allowed 30 of the 50 companies with the biggest payrolls in New Jersey to each pay just $200 a year in taxes. 
 As a result of changes increasingly generous to businesses over the years, the governor said, corporate tax collections plummeted, and other companies as well as middle-class families were forced to shoulder a disproportionately high tax burden. 
But as details of Mr. McGreevey's proposed changes have begun to emerge, the anxiousness felt by many business owners has turned to alarm. Corporate leaders say that rather than merely plugging the leaks in the current system, the governor is seeking a substantial overhaul, which would result in steep tax increases for hundreds of thousands of New Jersey companies.
During the last two weeks, for instance, Mr. McGreevey has indicated that he wants the corporate business tax code expanded to include partnerships and limited liability companies, which are currently exempt.
The governor's plan, which has not been released in detail, also calls for a fundamental change in the way business taxes are calculated. New Jersey, like the vast majority of other states, taxes businesses on their net profits. But many companies are able to avoid the state's corporate tax by using accounting techniques to shift their profits to subsidiaries in other states. For companies that do not show a profit, Mr. McGreevey wants to give the state the option of a 1 percent tax on their gross sales, with a cap of $5 million in taxes per year. Several other states tax companies on their sales rather than on their profits.
Business leaders warn that Mr. McGreevey's plans amount to a new tax on partnerships, and said that taxing companies even when they lose money could force employers to lay off workers or leave the state. 
"Where are companies going to get the money to pay these taxes if they have no profits?" said Arthur Maurice, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. "They're going to cut jobs. It will be the people who work at these companies who will ultimately pay the price for this counterproductive tax."
Mr. McGreevey insists that he is simply trying to repair inequities in the system, but the dispute is quickly becoming one of the most visible battles in the governor's effort to solve the state's budget problems. It is also one of the first major issues to test Mr. McGreevey's credentials as a so-called New Democrat who can address the concerns of working-class New Jersey residents without alienating businesses. 
"While Governor McGreevey hasn't committed the mistake that Jim Florio did by raising general taxes to the public," said David P. Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University, "he has chosen a path that could cause him grief with a constituency he spent a long time winning over.
"He's really put himself behind the eight ball," Professor Rebovich said, "because the way he proposed the plan -- without soliciting the input from businesses, then saying that it was still being formulated -- isn't the kind of thing that's going to inspire confidence from the community."
Whatever changes do result from the debate, the problems of New Jersey's current corporate tax system have been widely acknowledged. Because of an assortment of tax incentives given to businesses during the past two decades, the state is projected to collect less from corporations in 2003 than it did in 1982. Twenty years ago, corporate taxes accounted for 15 percent of the state's revenues, but that percentage has now fallen below 4 percent. 
Timothy A. Blake, who analyzes municipal finances for Moody's Investors Service, said he was startled by the McGreevey administration's frank portrayal of the system's problems.
"It's a little shocking to see that New Jersey's corporations pay taxes almost on a voluntary basis," Mr. Blake said.
Mr. McGreevey said his plan would allow the state to collect levies from companies shirking New Jersey taxes, and collect as much as $800 million a year in additional revenues. The governor also said his proposal had been carefully prepared to avoid hurting small businesses.
Tax experts say that Mr. McGreevey is one of the few elected officials in the country who is looking to the business sector to solve a major part of his budget deficit. A study by the National Conference of State Legislatures found that several states were pursuing marginal increases in business taxes to balance their budgets, but none approached the scale that Mr. McGreevey proposed in New Jersey.
David Brunori, contributing editor at State Tax Notes magazine, said Mr. McGreevey was virtually alone in bucking a 25-year trend toward reducing corporate taxes.
"Governors don't do things like this anymore," Mr. Brunori said. "No one goes after businesses in general, and corporations in particular, when they're trying to raise revenue -- largely out of fear that it will hamper economic development. But someone's got to pay the bills. So this is a bold move."
In an effort to rebut criticism of his new plan, Mr. McGreevey held a news conference this week with an assortment of academics and economists who described the flaws in New Jersey's current system. But even those experts were not privy to the specifics of Mr. McGreevey's proposed remedies, and that absence of details has hampered his attempts to sell his plan.
While the governor has repeatedly spoken about the 30 major employers that pay only a $200 minimum corporate tax, the administration has refused to identify them, citing a state law forbidding it to release information from a tax return. 
Business leaders say they suspect that some of those 30 companies are obligated to pay only minimal corporate taxes because they are already paying other taxes to the state, like the casino revenue tax or the insurance premium tax. Statistics compiled by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association show that corporations also pay $3.2 billion a year in property taxes to New Jersey municipalities.
Republicans, sensing that the resistance to the governor's plan may be gathering momentum, have pressed Mr. McGreevey to release it in its entirety, contending that the uncertainty surrounding the plan is damaging the state's business climate.
"Private-sector investment is being needlessly delayed by the governor's secrecy," said John O. Bennett, co-president of the State Senate, at a news conference today.
But Democrats, who control the General Assembly and share power in the Senate with Republicans, have generally praised Mr. McGreevey's proposals, calling them an uncomfortable but necessary step in balancing the budget and making the tax system more equitable. 
Cliff Zukin, the acting director of the Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers, said Mr. McGreevey had only unpleasant options for closing the budget deficit and had apparently decided that increasing tax collections from corporations would be least likely to rile the voters.
"Sure, he doesn't want to alienate the business community, because he's going to need business growth," Mr. Zukin said. "But it's hard to say that the business community is a crucial part of his coalition right now. His re-election, and the legislative elections, are far enough off in the future that there's time to repair any damage and to hope that the state's economy can grow out of its problems."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MONEY; 
5 Months After Sanctions Against Somali Company, Scant Proof of Qaeda Tie

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Tim Golden, Bill Berkeley and Donald G. McNeil Jr. and was written by Mr. Golden. 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's assault on Somalia's biggest money-transfer company was swift and severe.
 In November, American officials announced that they had proof that the company, Al Barakaat, was providing as much as $25 million a year to Osama bin Laden's terrorists in weapons, cash and other support. With the help of dozens of countries, the Treasury Department froze nearly all the company's assets, paralyzing the biggest employer in one of the poorest countries. 
 Five months later, however, some United States officials now acknowledge that the evidence of Al Barakaat's backing for terrorism is more tenuous. Some European countries that assisted in shutting down Al Barakaat say proof of a terror link has not materialized. 
Late last year, as Customs agents raided Al Barakaat's offices around the United States, officials predicted that the order freezing assets would be just the start of their crackdown. But only four criminal prosecutions have been filed so far, and none involve charges of aiding terrorists.
Government officials and international relief officials in Somalia have also questioned the sanctions, saying their impact on the poor has been so devastating -- layoffs, lack of access to funds, business disruptions -- that it may ultimately be a boon to Islamic radicals who drum up antipathy toward the United States.
"Thousands of Somalis had deposits in Al Barakaat," said Somalia's ambassador to the United Nations, Ahmed Abdi Hashi, whose government has close ties to the company. "Depositors cannot access their funds. Businessmen cannot do business. Many are going bankrupt. 
"We don't want to be seen as defending anyone linked to terrorism. All we want is to see the evidence."
In the months since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has waged a vigorous battle to disrupt financing for terrorism, using expanded presidential powers to freeze the accounts not only of terrorists themselves, but also of any individuals or entities "that support or otherwise associate" with them.
Yet, interviews and government documents show that while the new powers give Washington greater leeway to go after companies that might be used by terrorists, they also increase the risk of affecting people not linked to terrorism.
Foreign governments have made it clear that they will not continue to support Washington's call for sanctions unquestioningly, and some allies have pressed for new ways to ensure that future sanctions are well founded.
Even some American officials have questioned the Treasury's speed in freezing the assets, saying such moves may have consequences for diplomacy or criminal investigations that must be weighed against their real impact on terrorists.
"This is not normally the way we would have done things," one senior American official said of the designation of Al Barakaat as an entity that supports terrorism. "We needed to make a splash. We needed to designate now and sort it out later."
The law does not require the government to disclose the evidence behind financial sanctions. Companies can petition to have them lifted, and a handful have done so, including Al Barakaat. 
Administration officials have defended their action. They said they acted on the basis of classified information from law-enforcement and intelligence sources about the movement of funds from Al Barakaat to Al Qaeda, and have seen indications that the sanctions may have hurt Mr. bin Laden's operations.
"From what I've learned, this has had a major effect on bringing down, dismantling a major network used by Mr. bin Laden to move money and to communicate," Jimmy Gurule, undersecretary of the Treasury for enforcement, said in an interview.
But several American officials said the government has only limited evidence of a direct tie between Al Barakaat and Al Qaeda. One senior official said the information came from a single source.
Treasury officials said their most compelling intelligence centers on reports of Al Barakaat's relationship with an obscure militant Islamist group in Somalia that the United States has characterized as a terrorist group with clear ties to Al Qaeda.
But some officials said the significance of this indirect link to Mr. bin Laden may have been overstated. They said the Islamist group, Islamic Unity (Al Itihaad Al Islamiya), has operated primarily as a political movement in recent years, making it an unlikely conduit of weapons and money to Mr. bin Laden.
Al Barakaat came to Washington's attention partly because of the background of its founder and chief executive, Ahmed Nur Ali Jumale. American officials contend that he befriended Mr. bin Laden during the Afghans' war to drive out Soviet troops in the late 1980's. Documents provided to foreign governments by the United States assert that Mr. Jumale "founded Barakaat with capital reportedly provided by bin Laden" in 1989.
But Mr. Jumale, who trained as a banker in Saudi Arabia, said in an interview that he had never met Mr. bin Laden.
American officials said Mr. bin Laden's ties to Al Barakaat continued during the first half of the 1990's, when he was living in Sudan, and through the recent years he spent in Afghanistan. Over roughly the same period, Al Barakaat slowly expanded into cellular telephones, banking and other enterprises.
In announcing sanctions against the company on Nov. 7, President Bush said Al Barakaat and another company on the sanction list "raise funds for Al Qaeda."
"They manage, invest and distribute those funds," Mr. Bush continued. "They provide terrorist supporters with Internet service, secure telephone communications and other ways of sending messages and sharing information. They even arrange for the shipment of weapons."
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said Al Barakaat "used its offices in the United States and in 40 countries to finance and support terrorists around the world." 
He and other Treasury officials said that of $300 million to $400 million that Al Barakaat sent to Somalia each year, 5 percent -- or $15 million to $20 million -- was siphoned off directly for Al Qaeda.
But experts on hawala agencies like Al Barakaat, which move sums large and small around the world on handshakes and code words, said that even if Al Barakaat processed that much money, its profits would not be much more than $5 million.
By Al Barakaat's account to the Treasury Department, its moneytransfer revenues in 2000 were $2.76 million, with a net profit of $1.4 million. American officials disputed those figures, but said they were continuing to study the company's accounts, with its permission.
Mike FitzGerald, an American businessman who helped Al Barakaat set up its cellphone network and has worked closely with its executives for five years, said it never made anywhere near the money described by the Treasury. "These people started a commercial cellular network with $800,000, but they didn't have the money," he said. "We had to finance it." 
More recently, government officials have maintained that the support from Al Barakaat to Mr. bin Laden's group traveled a more circuitous route. The company, one official said, gave money to Al Itihaad radicals, who in turn provided Al Qaeda with weapons, trucks, cash and other support. 
But two other officials familiar with intelligence information on the subject said they knew of no reporting that documented major transfers of weapons and other equipment from Al Itihaad to Al Qaeda.
A confidential Treasury document described yet another pathway for the money. Al Barakaat, the document asserts, is actually controlled by Al Itihaad, which in turn funnels money to Al Qaeda.
Al Itihaad, it said, "takes a portion of the transaction fee -- typically 5 percent of the overall amount being sent -- for itself," the document said. It then sends "a smaller share on to groups and individuals associated with bin Laden, either in the form of money or weapons."
While American officials said they are convinced of a continuing link between Al Itihaad and Al Qaeda, several foreign experts on Somalia disputed the idea that the Somali radicals could be absorbing millions of dollars or passing such amounts on to Mr. bin Laden's forces. 
Al Itihaad has been linked to Al Qaeda in the past. It was one of several Islamist movements that emerged from the widespread Somali opposition to Muhammad Siad Barre, the American-backed dictator, who fell in 1991.
According to court testimony by a government witness in the United States, some Al Qaeda supporters provided military training for Al Itihaad in 1991-92 as it battled rival militias, including those that helped drive out American troops. 
But since 1997, when the last of Al Itihaad's militias were decimated by Ethiopian troops, the group has abandoned its military strategy, foreign analysts said, trying instead to build support by providing social services in impoverished areas.
Al Barakaat's founder, Mr. Jumale, denied reports that he has been among those supporting Al Itihaad. He has been critical of the Sept. 11 attacks.
In the United States, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Customs Service began to investigate Al Barakaat's operations about two years ago, uncovering several instances in which Somali immigrants who were involved in welfare fraud or drug-dealing had used the company to send money home.
One official said those cases, of themselves, "really didn't amount to anything." But when F.B.I., Customs and Treasury officials met several weeks after Sept. 11 to share information on Al Barakaat, officials said, they felt that the cases provided enough evidence for them to act.
Until now, the only criminal prosecutions to be brought against people involved with Al Barakaat do not include charges of terrorism.
Prosecutors in Boston have charged two Somali brothers with making illegal money transfers, a state misdemeanor that can be charged as a felony in federal courts. 
One of the men, Liban Hussein, who was chairman of Barakaat North America, was freed on a $12,000 bond by a judge in Canada, despite a request by the United States for his extradition. The judge said he found no evidence linking him to terrorism. 
Earlier this month, two Barakaat associates in northern Virginia were indicted on money-laundering charges that grew out of the November raids. The two, Abdirahman Sheikh-ali Isse and Abdillah S. Abdi, were accused of evading financial reporting laws while transferring more than $6 million to the United Arab Emirates.
In Europe, where several governments blocked Al Barakaat assets at the Bush administration's request, officials have also questioned the basis for the action.
Margarete Linderoth, a spokeswoman for the Security Police in Sweden, where the assets of three agents for Al Barakaat were frozen, said confidential information provided to the government by American officials merely asserts that the company is linked to Al Qaeda.

HEADLINE: Judge Moves Enron Lawsuit Against Dynegy to Houston 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
A bankruptcy judge ruled yesterday that Enron's $10 billion lawsuit against a rival, Dynegy, for abandoning a merger aimed at rescuing Enron should be moved to Houston.
 The judge, Arthur J. Gonzalez of United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, agreed to Dynegy's request to shift the case to Houston, where both companies are based. 
Dynegy is seeking a jury trial. 
 Transferring the case, Judge Gonzalez said, "will better serve the interests of judicial economy and the efficient administration of the bankruptcy." 
In Houston, the case will be handled by Judge Melinda Harmon of Federal District Court, who is also hearing shareholder lawsuits against Enron. 
When Enron filed in December for bankruptcy protection, it sued Dynegy over its decision to pull out of the merger deal. Dynegy retaliated with a complaint filed in Texas state court seeking control of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Company pipeline unit.
Dynegy asserted in court filings that most witnesses in the lawsuit lived in Houston and that the case would draw on facts from other lawsuits against Enron that were being heard there. 
Enron asserted that a dozen or more witnesses live in New York and that it should have its choice of where the case is heard. 
In another aspect of the bankruptcy, Judge Gonzalez is expected to hear arguments on Tuesday on Enron's request to pay as much as $140 million in retention bonuses to top employees.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is fighting Enron's request, saying the plan is too vague. 
"It is simply impossible to evaluate the reasonableness of Enron's request without substantial additional disclosure," the S.E.C. said in court papers filed yesterday. 
Enron asked Judge Gonzalez last month for permission to give bonuses and severance payments to more than 1,700 executives and managers.

HEADLINE: BBDO Worldwide Is Dropped As Agency for Charles Schwab 

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The advertising agency that brought star power to the brokerage category by creating popular commercials featuring actors, athletes, musicians and even a member of the British royal family has been dismissed unexpectedly.
 The agency is the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, which was let go yesterday after four years by the Charles Schwab Corporation. For Schwab, the nation's sixth-largest brokerage firm in terms of revenue, BBDO New York had handled corporate and brand campaigns with spending that ranged from $83 million last year to as much as $130 million in 2000, during the stock market and dot-com booms. 
 All Schwab ad spending totaled $138 million last year, according to CMR in New York, a company owned by Taylor Nelson Sofres, down 42 percent from $238 million in 2000.
The decision to dismiss BBDO New York is indicative of how ties between executives at agencies and advertisers can fray during tough economic times, particularly in competitive marketing categories like financial services.
"This was surprising," said Ted Sann, chairman and chief creative officer at BBDO New York. "We had, by far, the longest relationship of any agency in their history."
Schwab did not give a reason for the dismissal, he added, when notifying BBDO New York late Thursday night of the decision.
BBDO New York is known for using celebrities in campaigns for clients like Cingular Wireless, the Masterfoods division of Mars and PepsiCo, but the device is fresh for the traditionally staid brokerage industry. The celebrities, performing from humorous scripts, were meant to entice viewers into paying attention to pitches for investment products and services, typically a so-called low-interest category.
The celebrities included Sally Field, parodying her "You like me" Oscar acceptance speech; the athletes Hank Aaron, Charles Barkley, Barry Bonds, Evander Holyfield, Anna Kournikova and Tara Lipinski; the singer Ringo Starr; and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.
Schwab, based in San Francisco, will consolidate its creative advertising assignments at GSD&M in Austin, Tex., which like BBDO New York is owned by Omnicom. GSD&M, which works for other big advertisers like Southwest Airlines and Wal-Mart Stores, creates campaigns for Schwab aimed at online investors, under the CyberTrader brand.
"In the process of doing the CyberTrader work, Schwab talked to us about our thinking on the Charles Schwab brand and how we would bring it to life," said Roy Spence, president at GSD&M.
"This expanded relationship is being made on the belief we understand the Schwab values and brand," he added, "and will be able to articulate that in a compelling way."
For those who like celebrities in brokerage ads, fear not. When CyberTrader used the CyberCorp brand name, GSD&M created a campaign that featured the late actor and martial artist Bruce Lee.

HEADLINE: UPRISING IN VENEZUELA: THE CONTINENT; 
A Vicious Circle: Failures and Instability

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, April 12 

 BODY:
First Argentina, and now Venezuela. In less than four months, two governments of markedly different temperaments and philosophies at opposite ends of South America have been toppled by popular protests that embattled presidents sought to contain with force that led to bloodshed. 
 To governments across the continent, the parallels are as ominous as they are obvious. But even before turmoil engulfed Venezuela and even setting aside Colombia's longstanding and increasingly destructive civil conflict, South America was living its most difficult moment since making the transition from military dictatorships to civilian democratic rule nearly two decades ago. 
 Almost without exception, economic growth in the region has either slowed or stalled altogether. Unemployment, crime and social violence are growing, as is popular frustration with a nominally democratic political system that has left many of the 350 million people in South America feeling that they are trapped in an endless cycle of stagnation, corruption and incompetent rule.
"There is a lot of instability, turbulence and a lack of institutions to support a government," Moises Naim, the editor of Foreign Policy magazine in Washington and a former Venezuelan minister, said today when asked about conditions in the region. "So what you end up with is a vicious circle. The more you have political instability, the harder it is for institutions to consolidate and function, and the more likely the electorate is to lose patience."
Since the start of 2000, 4 out of 10 presidents of the Latin American countries of South America have been forced to resign. Besides Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, who stepped down early today under military pressure, and Fernando de la Rua of Argentina, who left in December, Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador and Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru have also been forced from office.
Mr. de la Rua may have been an advocate of free markets undone by his own indecisiveness, and Mr. Chavez was a left-wing populist doomed by habitual recklessness. But neither man was able to find a way to deliver the prosperity and higher living standards that they had promised their countrymen, and that is what ultimately assured their downfall.
"What we have seen is that when governments do a good job, the electorate allows them to change the constitution to stay on longer," Dr. Naim said. "But the moment that economic performance weakens, the electorate doesn't give a damn about elections and starts throwing governments out."
In the long run, the United States may have cause for concern in the reappearance of some old practices assumed to have been interred. In both Venezuela on Thursday and in Ecuador early in 2000, the military reassumed its traditional role as the ultimate arbiter of disputes in the political system.
An even greater danger is that increasingly restive populations might conclude that no approach at all will work. Mr. Chavez's critics dismissed his statist, interventionist philosophy as an antiquated anachronism of the 1960's. But Argentina's collapse after a decade of privatization, deregulation and other free-market measures suggests that formula is also exhausted. 
According to the commission's calculations, Latin America grew 3.2 percent a year in the 1990's, compared with an annual regional average of 5.5 percent from 1950 through 1980, a period of strong growth when governments played a more active role in economic policy.
For the Bush administration, the unraveling of political institutions and economies represents one more unwanted challenge. Mr. Bush took office promising to make the Western Hemisphere his top foreign policy priority. But despite his visit last month to Mexico, Peru and Central America, his government is almost universally described in the region as passive and disengaged on political matters and inflexible and hypocritical on economic issues.
At a hemispheric summit last year in Quebec, Mr. Bush promised his fellow heads of state increased trade as the cure for all their ills. But he has been unable to win Congressional approval of legislation to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas.
Neither the overthrow of Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel, nor of Mr. Mahuad two years ago can be classified as a conventional Latin American military coup. The armed forces did not actually take power on Thursday. It was the ousted president's supporters who appear to have been responsible for deaths that numbered barely 12 rather than hundreds or thousands, and political rights and guarantees were restored rather than suspended.
But in each case, constitutional procedures were at the very least bent by the intervention of the armed forces to force the resignation of an unpopular elected president. This afternoon, 19 Latin American presidents, meeting in Costa Rica and mindful that that fate could some day await them, said they "condemn the interruption of constitutional order in Venezuela, generated by a process of growing polarization."
That presents a moral quandary to the United States and the Organization of American States. They have promised not to recognize any government that takes power through a coup and to impose sanctions on those that do, although that position is highly likely to be ignored, setting a potentially dangerous precedent.
"I'm sure that all over Latin America the military are watching what is going on in Venezuela with great interest," said Michael Shifter, senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington. "This provides another formula to solve crises for countries that are seen as not being governable."
In addition, in Argentina and Venezuela, the agglomeration of civic and community groups known as "civil society" moved to fill the vacuums left by the discrediting of traditional parties. Though that phenomenon has been hailed as a refreshing manifestation of democracy, it also heightens the risk of disputes being settled in the streets instead of the courts or congress.
"It may not have been the scenario he envisioned," Mr. Shifter said, "but Chavez ultimately got the participatory democracy that he wanted. He always said that he wanted to see people in the streets, engaged and aware, and that's what he got. Unfortunately for him, it meant his ouster."

HEADLINE: Hugo Chavez Departs 

 BODY:
With yesterday's resignation of President Hugo Chavez, Venezuelan democracy is no longer threatened by a would-be dictator. Mr. Chavez, a ruinous demagogue, stepped down after the military intervened and handed power to a respected business leader, Pedro Carmona. But democracy has not yet been restored, and won't be until a new president is elected. That vote has been scheduled for next spring, with new Congressional elections to be held by this December. The prompt announcement of a timetable is welcome, but a year seems rather long to wait for a legitimately elected president. 
 Washington has a strong stake in Venezuela's recovery. Caracas now provides 15 percent of American oil imports, and with sounder policies could provide more. A stable, democratic Venezuela could help anchor a troubled region where Colombia faces expanded guerrilla warfare, Peru is seeing a rebirth of terrorism and Argentina struggles with a devastating economic crisis. Wisely, Washington never publicly demonized Mr. Chavez, denying him the role of nationalist martyr. Rightly, his removal was a purely Venezuelan affair. 
 Public faith in Venezuela's institutions began eroding well before Mr. Chavez burst on the scene with a failed 1992 coup. Corruption discredited both main parties, and a patronage-fueled bureaucracy devoured the country's abundant oil revenues, leaving many Venezuelans desperately poor. Mr. Chavez was elected president in 1998 promising change he never delivered. He courted Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein, battled the media and alienated virtually every constituency from middle-class professionals, academics and business leaders to union members and the Roman Catholic Church.
This week's crisis began with a general strike against replacing professional managers at the state oil company with political cronies. It took a grave turn Thursday when armed Chavez supporters fired on peaceful strikers, killing at least 14 and injuring hundreds. Mr. Chavez's response was characteristic. He forced five private television stations off the air for showing pictures of the massacre. Early yesterday he was compelled to resign by military commanders unwilling to order their troops to fire on fellow Venezuelans to keep him in power. He is being held at a military base and may face charges in Thursday's killings. 
New presidential elections should be held this year, perhaps at the same time the new Congress is chosen. Some time is needed for plausible national leaders to emerge and parties to reorganize. But Venezuela urgently needs a leader with a strong democratic mandate to clean up the mess, encourage entrepreneurial freedom and slim down and professionalize the bureaucracy. 
One encouraging development has been the strong participation of middle-class citizens in organizing opposition groups and street protests. Continued civic participation could help revitalize Venezuela's tired political parties and keep further military involvement to a minimum.

HEADLINE: UPRISING IN VENEZUELA: THE MARKETS; 
Oil Prices Drop Sharply on Venezuelan News

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12 

 BODY:
Oil prices fell today by 6 percent, to $23.47 a barrel, the sharpest decline in five months, on the expectation that exports of oil and petroleum products from Venezuela would return to normal after the ouster of President Hugo Chavez.
 Mr. Chavez's resignation followed weeks of intermittent work slowdowns and stoppages at Venezuela's major refineries that culminated this week in nationwide strikes and demonstrations. Venezuela's exports of about 2.5 million barrels a day dwindled over that time, as refineries idled. 
 Oil traders said they were hopeful that Venezuela, one of the world's largest producers, would begin producing even more oil in the coming months by returning to a policy it followed in the mid-1990's. Then, it defied the quotas set for it as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Mr. Chavez reversed that stance, hewing closely to OPEC's positions and reducing Venezuela's output to bolster prices.
But industry analysts warned that Venezuela would not be in a position to turn on the tap, at least over the next year, largely because it lacks spare capacity at oil fields that could be brought on quickly. "Venezuela is working near capacity and capacity is shrinking," said Sondra Scott, director of Latin American research at the consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
Tankers from Venezuelan refineries, which had all but halted production, resumed loading Thursday night, Ms. Scott said. By early next week, work at the refineries is expected to return to normal levels. Crude oil production, however, was not badly disrupted, Ms. Scott and other industry analysts said.
Venezuela is the third-largest exporter of crude oil and petroleum products to the United States. The resumption of exports to the United States, a large portion gasoline, calmed fears that prices at the pump would rise sharply.
Some in the Venezuelan oil industry predicted that after business returns to normal, the government would re-examine its recent policy of adhering to OPEC's mandates. "I think policy will be changed," a former oil minister, Humberto Calderon Berti, told Reuters. "It will be oriented more toward capturing markets while maintaining close ties in OPEC."
In 1998, the last time Venezuela broke with OPEC and produced far above its quota to grab market share, a price war ensued with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. Oil prices plummeted, battering Venezuela's economy. That memory, analysts said, might have left the country so chastened that it will not produce far more than its allotment in the short term.
Any plans to increase production would take a while to carry out anyway, industry experts said. The capacity of Venezuela's oil fields to produce more fell during the Chavez years, when the government took a greater share of profits to finance social programs, leaving the state oil company with far less to invest in expanding output, said Yasser Elguindi, managing director at Medley Global Advisors, a New York consulting firm.
But if the new Venezuelan government invests more and capacity rises, it might once again feel strong enough to challenge OPEC's mandates, industry experts said.
"That doesn't mean the end of OPEC and its ability to manage markets," Mr. Elguindi said. "But it is a signal for OPEC to watch this more closely."

HEADLINE: The Bush Doctrine, R.I.P. 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As a statement of principle set forth by an American chief executive, the now defunct Bush Doctrine may have had a shelf life even shorter than Kenny Boy's Enron code of ethics. As a statement of presidential intent, it may land in the history books alongside such magisterial moments as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 pledge not to send American boys to Vietnam and Richard Nixon's 1968 promise to "bring us together."
 It was in September that the president told Congress that "from this day forward any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime." It was in November that he told the United Nations that "there is no such thing as a good terrorist." Now the president is being assailed even within his own political camp for not only refusing to label Yasir Arafat a terrorist but judging him good enough to be a potential partner in our desperate effort to tamp down the flames of the Middle East. 
 Yet the administration's double standard for Mr. Arafat is hardly the first, or only, breach of the Bush Doctrine. 
As Tina Fey explained with only faint comic exaggeration on "Saturday Night Live" last weekend, the U.S. also does business of state with nations that both "fund all the terrorism in the world" (Saudi Arabia, where the royal family on Thursday joined in a telethon supporting Palestinian "martyrs") and are "100 percent with the terrorists except for one little guy in charge" (Pakistan). President Bush, who once spoke of rigid lines drawn between "good" men and "evildoers," has now been so overrun by fresh hellish events and situational geopolitical bargaining that his old formulations -- "either you are with us or you are with the terrorists" -- have been rendered meaningless.
But even as he fudges his good/evil categorizations when it comes to Mr. Arafat and other players he suddenly may need in the Middle East, it's not clear that Mr. Bush knows that he can no longer look at the world as if it were Major League Baseball, with every team clearly delineated in its particular division. "Look, my job isn't to try to nuance," he told a British interviewer a week after the Passover massacre in Netanya. "My job is to tell people what I think. . . . I think moral clarity is important." 
Mr. Bush doesn't seem to realize that nuances are what his own administration is belatedly trying to master -- and must -- if Colin Powell is going to hasten a cease-fire in the Middle East. Mr. Bush doesn't seem to know that since the routing of the Taliban his moral clarity has atrophied into simplistic, often hypocritical sloganeering. He has let his infatuation with his own rectitude metastasize into hubris.
The result -- the catastrophe of the administration's handling of the Middle East -- is clear: 15 months of procrastination and conflict avoidance followed by a baffling barrage of mixed messages that have made Mr. Bush's use of the phrase "without delay" the most elastically parsed presidential words since his predecessor's definition of sex. It takes some kind of perverse genius to simultaneously earn the defiance of the Israelis, the Palestinians and our Arab "allies" alike and turn the United States into an impotent bystander. 
The ensuing mess should be a wake-up call for Mr. Bush to examine his own failings and those of his administration rather than try (as he did a week ago) to shift the blame to Bill Clinton's failed Camp David summit talks (and then backpedal after being called on it). While the conventional wisdom has always had it that this president can be bailed out of foreign-policy jams by his seasoned brain trust, the competing axes of power in the left (State) and right (Defense) halves of that surrogate brain have instead sent him bouncing between conflicting policies like a yo-yo, sometimes within the same day. 
Speaking to The Los Angeles Times this week about Mr. Bush's floundering, the Reagan administration policy honcho for the Mideast, Geoffrey Kemp, said: "A two-year-old could have seen this crisis coming. And the idea that it could be brushed under the carpet as the administration focused on either Afghanistan or Iraq reflects either appalling arrogance or ignorance." 
The administration of Cheney, Rumsfeld and Powell is hardly ignorant. But arrogance is another matter. "We shouldn't think of American involvement for the sake of American involvement" is how Condoleezza Rice defined the administration's intention to butt out of the Middle East only a couple of weeks after her boss's inauguration, thereby codifying the early Bush decision not to send a negotiator to a last-ditch peace summit in Egypt. Since then, even as Sept. 11 came and went, we've been at best reluctantly and passingly engaged, culminating with our recall of the envoy Anthony Zinni in December, after which we sat idly by during three months of horror. Not until Dick Cheney returned from his humiliating tour of the Arab world in late March did he state the obvious: "There isn't anybody but us" to bring about a hiatus in the worst war the region has seen in 20 years. 
Even then, the 180-degree reversal from the administration's previous inertia was not motivated by the bloody imperatives of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians but by their inconvenient disruption of Mr. Bush's plans to finish his father's job in Iraq. A cynic might go so far as to say that "Saddam Hussein is driving U.S. foreign policy" -- which, as it happens, is what Benjamin Netanyahu did tell The New York Post on Tuesday. 
The goal of stopping Saddam, worthy as it is, cannot be separated from the conflict of the Jews and the Palestinians and never could be. But even now Mr. Bush seems less than engaged in the Middle East. It took him a week after the Passover massacre to decide to send Colin Powell to the region. The president has yet to speak publicly about the spillover of the hostilities into Europe, where each day brings news of some of the ugliest anti-Semitic violence seen there since World War II. He continues to resist the idea that American peacekeepers will be needed to keep the Middle East (not to mention Afghanistan) from tumbling back into the chaos that could once again upend his plans to take on Saddam. 
Peacekeepers, of course, are to Mr. Bush a synonym for nation-building, which he regards as a no-no. If there's a consistent pattern to the administration's arrogance, it's that when the president has an idee fixe of almost any sort on any subject -- from the Bush Doctrine on down -- it remains fixed in perpetuity, not open to question, even as a world as complex and fast-changing as ours calls out for rethinking. 
Never mind that Sept. 11 was the most graphic demonstration imaginable that a missile shield may not be the most useful vessel for our ever more precious defense dollars; it's still full speed ahead. Nor has the bursting of the stock-market bubble dampened Mr. Bush's conviction that Americans should entrust their Social Security savings to his campaign contributors from Wall Street's investment houses. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, once pitched as a quick fix to the (fleeting) California energy crisis, is now being sold as an antidote to our Middle Eastern woes (because some 10 years from now it may reduce our oil imports by 4 or 5 percent). The Bush tax cut, conceived at a time of endless surpluses and peace, is still touted as the perfect economic plan even now that the surpluses are shot and we are at war. In this administration, one size idea, however slender or dubious, fits all. 
To Mr. Bush, these immutable policies are no doubt all doctrines, principles, testaments to his moral clarity. In fact, many of them have more to do with ideology than morality. Only history can determine whether they will be any more lasting than the Bush doctrine on terrorism. Meanwhile, we should be grateful that the administration did abandon its stubborn 15-month disengagement from the Middle East to make an effort, however confused, hasty and perilous, to halt the bloodshed and (one imagines) lead the search for a political solution.
"This is a world with a lot of gray," said Chuck Hagel, the Republican from Nebraska, to The Washington Post late this week. "We can choose either to live in an abstract world or choose to engage in the real world. . . . The reality of that has started to set in with this administration." We must hope that Senator Hagel is right. While it is far too late for an Arafat or a Sharon to change, it is not too late for a young president still in a young administration to get over himself. At this tragic juncture, the world depends on it, because, as his own vice president put it, there isn't anybody else to do the job.

HEADLINE: UPRISING IN VENEZUELA: THE GOVERNMENT; 
VENEZUELA'S CHIEF FORCED TO RESIGN; CIVILIAN INSTALLED

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 12 

 BODY:
A transitional government headed by a leading businessman replaced President Hugo Chavez today, hours after military officers forced him to resign. It was a sudden end to the turbulent three-year reign of a mercurial strongman elected on promises to distance his country from the United States while uprooting Venezuela's old social order.
 Mr. Chavez, 47, a firebrand populist who had said he would remake Venezuela to benefit the poor, was obligated to resign in a meeting with three military officers about 3 a.m. today after large street protests on Thursday in which at least 14 people were killed by gunmen identified as his supporters. 
 Early this morning, Mr. Chavez, in military fatigues and the trademark red beret of his left-leaning movement, was driven off to the Fort Tiuna army base in Caracas, where he was reported to be in custody.
Pedro Carmona Estanga, the head of Venezuela's most important business association, was installed as interim president at a ceremony at 6 p.m. He promised that the new government would adhere to "a pluralistic vision, democratic, civil and ensuring the implementation of the law, the state of law." 
Elections will be held within a year, officials said. 
The Bush administration laid the blame for Mr. Chavez's overthrow firmly with the ousted leader. Officials portrayed the ouster as a victory for democracy, even though Mr. Chavez was a legitimately elected president.
"We know that the action encouraged by the Chavez government provoked this crisis," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. The Chavez government, he added, suppressed a peaceful demonstration and fired on unarmed protesters.
However, Latin American leaders at a summit meeting in Costa Rica criticized Mr. Chavez's ouster as an "interruption of the constitutional order."
A former army paratrooper who won office in 1998, Mr. Chavez presided over a stormy era when he seized control of the legislature, confronted the old-line political elite and steered the country into an alliance with Cuba. 
Mr. Carmona, the president of Fedecamaras, a business association, said early today that Mr. Chavez had "presented his resignation." He spoke flanked by military officers who had rebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday night, the third day of a general strike called by his opponents.
On the streets of this sprawling capital, opponents of the government took to the streets in the early morning hours, honking horns and waving the gold, blue and red of the Venezuelan flag. El Universal, a leading newspaper here, hailed the end with these words, "It's over!"
The interim government quickly moved to undo Mr. Chavez's policies, dissolving the National Assembly controlled by his supporters, firing members of the Supreme Court and changing the country's official name back to the Republic of Venezuela. Mr. Chavez had renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
In addition, the interim government repealed 49 economic laws passed by the Chavez-controlled National Assembly last year, legislation that business leaders feared would damage the economy.
While pledging to hold presidential elections within 365 days, officials said that Mr. Carmona, who had been a leader in the protest movement against Mr. Chavez, will not be able to run. 
Mr. Carmona named new ministers, including two active-duty military officers who rebelled against Mr. Chavez on Thursday night. He also named retired Brig. Gen. Guaicaipuro Lameda to head Petroleos de Venezuela, the huge state-owned oil company, which exports most of its oil to the United States. 
Mr. Chavez had fired Mr. Lameda in February and appointed a left-leaning ally in his place along with five board members close to his government, enraging thousands of office workers at the company.
Mr. Carmona said that operations would return to normal at the oil company. It had been crippled when office and production workers began staging work slowdowns last week in protest.
"Venezuelan society has reached a consensus to find a way forward, a way that necessitated a transitional government that guarantees the reestablishment of democracy," Mr. Carmona told reporters 
Mr. Carmona said that the transitional government was being formed with "the consensus of civil society and also from the military."
Cuba called the change-over a coup and urged other countries to distance themselves from the new government. President Fidel Castro and Mr. Chavez had formed a close friendship. 
The interim government today ended Mr. Chavez's policy of offering oil to Cuba under terms favorable to Havana.
Mr. Chavez's daughter, Maria Gabriela, speaking in an interview on state television in Cuba, said that her father had not resigned. In a phone conversation Friday morning, just before he fell from power, he told her, "I am a jailed president," she said.
The attorney general, Isaias Rodriguez, also said Mr. Chavez had not resigned, but was forced out by military officers. 
President Vicente Fox of Mexico took a strong stand, saying his country would not recognize Venezuela's new government until elections were held. Diplomatic relations between the two countries, however, would continue.
American officials praised the Venezuelan military and the police for defying Mr. Chavez, as well as television stations and other media outlets that continued to function despite government orders to shut down.
"We wish to express our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and look forward to working with all democratic forces in Venezuela to ensure the full exercise of democratic rights," said Philip T. Reeker, a State Department spokesman. 
For now, the government focused on clearing up the events leading to the violence of Thursday afternoon, remembering the fallen and searching for those who were responsible. Mr. Chavez's interior minister, Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, was taken into custody, and the police were looking for a strong Chavez supporter, Freddy Bernal, the mayor of a district of Caracas.
Security forces, meanwhile, searched the homes of members of the Bolivarian Circles, neighborhood groups that were formed by Mr. Chavez's government and that were accused by the interim government of responsibility in the shootings.
Television broadcasts on Thursday showed several men in plainclothes firing semiautomatic handguns from a bridge over a busy street in downtown Caracas. Among the crowd of assailants were people in red berets and T-shirts bearing the name of Mr. Chavez's movement.
Mr. Carmona said that "justice must be done" for the families of those killed. He promised that they would receive government benefits.
Among Mr. Carmona's most pressing tasks now will be to assuage concerns in other countries about how Mr. Chavez's reign ended and deal with the polarization between rich and poor that divides this country, analysts familiar with Venezuela said.
"The goal for his successors is to effectively tackle the pressing socio-economic issues that brought Chavez to power with so much popular support," said Russell Crandall, a Latin America specialist at Davidson College in North Carolina. "Chavez was right about the problems he saw in Venezuela. He was wrong about the solutions and the Venezuelan people made that very clear."

HEADLINE: ON WRITERS AND WRITING; 
Murder in a Cold Climate

BYLINE:  By Margo Jefferson 

 BODY:
It's the why that lets us down in crime novels. You hit the last quarter of the book, and you get impatient or cranky. All will soon be revealed -- and all might not be enough. Criminals are best in action (action includes their thoughts); so are the detectives who partner and track them. And readers are almost pathetically excited by crime that leads to death. Police Inspector Wallander is talking about us, in Henning Mankell's new novel, "One Step Behind," when he says about local crime scene gawkers: "They probably just get a thrill from being in the presence of the unthinkable. . . . Knowing that they themselves are safe." This must be one reason so few popular novels focus on the kind of crime that costs thousands of people their jobs and life savings. Those crimes aren't unthinkable enough. 
 No one tops American writers when it comes to certain "whys": ambition and greed; dangerous liaisons; corrupt organizations, from crime syndicates born bad to law enforcement agencies gone bad. The solitary pursuer casts the longest shadow: the rebel detective, cop, journalist or citizen who has to solve crimes on his or her own. And he or she has to go it alone in a city like New York, San Francisco or Miami; in a particular neighborhood; in a small Southern town or on an Indian reservation. It isn't the nation we think about when we read crime novels. The classic American crime tale is as local as Tip O'Neill said our politics were. 
 Sweden has produced some of the best crime writers of the last several decades, and they couldn't be more different from ours. American power has grown since the 18th century. Sweden, once an imperial force rivaling England and Russia, has had to master the paradox of reduced international power and increased economic prosperity. It is proud of its reputation as a just and practical utopia. So when Sweden looks at itself through the lens of crime, what does it see? 
By 1967, when Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo published the first of 10 now celebrated Martin Beck mysteries, Sweden was struggling to integrate its Old World Lutheran morality (gloomy and fervent) with a New World of youthful, no-nonsense sexual freedom. "Roseanna" begins when the body of a young American tourist who believed in free love and free will is dragged from a canal. Women, dead or alive, keep the crime novel in business -- they're vulnerable and threatening. What writers do with their characters and corpses makes all the difference. As the Stockholm police, led by the shrewd, slightly dour Beck, investigate Roseanna's past they become obsessed and depressed. And you realize, though it's never strenuously pointed out, that all of them have dreary-to-disastrous marriages or catch-as-catch-can relations with women.
Sweden is stalked by the leftover complicities of World War II and by the continuing hypocrisies of the cold war. By the 1970's, when Sjowall and Wahloo's superb novel "The Laughing Policeman" came out, there was the Vietnam War, along with Sweden's first mass murder. ("Mass murders seem to be an American specialty," says one officer.) Benevolent socialism notwithstanding, the poor still exist, while a certain ruthless greed, especially among the prosperous, feels new. Sjowall is a poet; her husband, who died in 1975, was a journalist, playwright and scriptwriter. Their mysteries -- five are currently available in the Vintage Crime/Black Lizard series -- don't just read well; they reread even better. Witness, wife, petty cop or crook -- they're all real characters even if they get just a few sentences. The plots hold, because they're ingenious but never inhuman. The writing is lean, with mournful undertones. American detectives are stoic and hard-boiled; Swedish ones are stoic and melancholy. And they're physically fallible. When they drink too much liquor they tend to act stupid. When they drink too much coffee their stomachs hurt. 
The atmosphere is beautifully done and without excess. (We've all read those show-offy "They'll see I'm a real writer" paragraphs.) "The Man on the Balcony" opens like this: "At a quarter to three the sun rose. . . . The street-sweeping machines had passed, leaving dark wet strips here and there on the asphalt. . . . Five minutes later the tinkle of broken glass had been heard as someone drove a gloved hand through a shop window; then came the sound of running footsteps." As it moves into a tale of pedophilia and murder, we realize that scenes like this have the quiet, fatal exactness of Fritz Lang's still astounding 1928 film on the same subject, "M." 
Henning Mankell published "Faceless Killers" in 1991, and its form and craft showed that he was the heir to Sjowall and Wahloo. The police procedural had been their chosen form. Those dates and times and police interviews noted with such care showed how fragile an invention order is. The form is being stretched, the invention assaulted in Mankell's five novels. Inspector Wallander and his officers -- they include women now -- question their own competence and purpose. Greed and violence go together; one cop notes that a brutally murdered businessman has left no survivors "except for a few grieving, plundered corporations." Immigrants and refugees arrive from Turkey, Poland, the Dominican Republic and Somalia. Racism flourishes; sexual exploitation expands and diversifies.
Homes are no safer. Parents neglect children and each other. Children join cults and attempt suicide. Husbands beat their wives and kids. The old abuse the young sexually, and the young want revenge, even if they have to wait years and find stand-ins for the original culprits. 
Postcolonialism hangs over the country now. The role of Swedish mercenaries in the Congo's struggles after independence is crucial to "The Fifth Woman" (1996). And "The White Lioness" (1993) is a first-class thriller about a plot to assassinate Nelson Mandela upon his release from prison. The plotters include the white South African secret service, black hired assassins and an ex-K.G.B. agent hoping to use his skills in a new country. 
Globalization casts its shadow too. In "One Step Behind," that lethal American export, the serial killer, has found his way to Sweden. "You have to rethink what it means to be a police officer," says Wallander bleakly. "The experience you've acquired after years and years of grinding work doesn't apply anymore." Like Sjowall and Wahloo, Mankell asks readers to rethink what it means to be Swedish. What does Sweden's past, those years and years of work, mean for its future? These books make you ask the same questions about America.

HEADLINE: BLACK STUDIES TODAY; 
Out of Africa, and Back

BYLINE:  By Robert S. Boynton; Robert S. Boynton is director of the graduate magazine journalism program at New York University.

 BODY:
Born of the protests in the 1960's and bruised by the culture wars of the 1990's, African-American studies has always been a place where thorny issues are tackled, whether over affirmative action or the emergence of multidisciplinary fields like ethnic studies. Much as the young discipline of sociology was host to the defining ideas of the 1950's and 60's (the end of ideology, the lonely crowd), black studies is more "open" to hot-button cultural debates than more settled fields in the academic universe.
 It is remarkable, then, that black studies has transformed itself from a peripatetic, quasi-academic pursuit into a mature field of study. No longer is the question whether it is a discipline. Rather, a second generation of scholars is engaged in a series of (sometimes heated) intradisciplinary disagreements about its scope and content. Should black studies be a department or a program? Should it integrate itself into a Eurocentrist curriculum or stand apart from the Western canon? Should it take a global or an American perspective? Is it a form of feel-good nationalism for the black community or a dispassionate academic field? And what are the parameters of scholarship -- a question that Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard's newly appointed president, brought to the forefront when he famously rebuked the star professor Cornel West recently for, among other things, making a "spoken word" CD of social philosophy. 
 Noliwe Rooks, associate director of Princeton's African-American program, views questions about the direction of black studies as a sign of a healthy pluralism. "The field has matured to the point where there are a variety of positions -- Afrocentric, diasporic, social scientific -- about what constitutes African-American studies, all of which are valid," she says. New York University emphasizes urban studies, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst concentrates on history, Harvard on cultural and literary matters. Given the current cachet of globalization among the chattering classes, it is no surprise that the most discussed trend is the move, now cooking at Boston University, nearby Northeastern, Duke and Princeton, to reorient the field's scope toward the African diaspora.
According to the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, there are roughly 400 black studies programs or departments; 140 offer degrees; about 24 of them offer master's and 5 of them Ph.D.'s. (Columbia University is working on plans to offer doctorates within the next few years.) 
However it is defined or constituted -- whether in a department at working-class, Afrocentric Temple University or as a program at elite, white Princeton -- African-American studies has thrived.

Temple: The Black Canon
With 1,150 students enrolled this semester, black studies is one of the more popular departments at Temple, a sprawling public university in Philadelphia of 30,000 students, 25 percent of whom are African-American.
Attend an undergraduate class like "Hip-Hop and Black Culture" and it is easy to see why. Taught by Nathaniel Thompson, a dynamic young visiting professor, the course promises to "engage hip-hop not as a mode of entertainment, but as a medium of communications which impacts, represents and misrepresents the life experience of African people in the United States," according to the syllabus.
His hair set in neat cornrows, Mr. Thompson wears a black, hooded sweatshirt and baggy black jeans. "I'm not of the school that believes hip-hop is a culture," he announces. He then proceeds to analyze the genre using Molefi Kete Asante's Afrocentric categories, as described in his book "Kemet, Afrocentricity and Knowledge": Does it have a cosmology, axiology (value system), epistemology or aesthetic? When the discussion gets too abstract, he brings it down to earth with a seemingly simple question: "Am I dressed hip-hop today?" This leads to a heated debate about the relation between the designer Ralph Lauren and black culture, and ends with the class dissecting the oft-used phrase "Keeping it real." One woman asks, "What is the 'it' that is always being kept real, anyway?"
Temple's African-American studies department, which was founded in 1969, was the first to offer a black studies Ph.D., in 1988. Its fame emanates from Dr. Asante, the graduate program's founder and the chief theorist of Afrocentricity. As defined in his 1980 book of the same title, Afrocentricity is "interpretation and analysis from the perspective of African people as subjects rather than as objects on the fringes of the European experience."
Nathaniel Norment Jr., the department's current chairman, underscores the relationship between the theory and mainstream scholarship: "Ninety-five percent of the research done on African-Americans has been done by whites, and 95 percent of it has been negative," he says. "From 'The Moynihan Report' to 'The Bell Curve,' African-American people have been portrayed as subhuman and inferior. Through Afrocentricity and African-centeredness, African-American studies can act as a corrective to this bias."
A brief listing of this semester's courses -- "The Black Family," "Blacks in Cinema," "African Aesthetics," "The Black Woman," "Psychology of the Black Experience," "Mass Media and Black Communication," "Dimensions of Racism" -- evidence Temple's attempt to redress the shortcomings of the Eurocentric perspective by constructing a distinct, oppositional canon.
During his 12 years as chairman, Dr. Asante built the department into a nationally recognized center that promoted his popular ideology, and he enjoyed unchallenged autonomy. He stepped down in 1996 amid charges that he misappropriated a professor's work for a textbook and then denied her tenure when she complained. The conflict was deemed a book contract dispute, not misconduct, but the junior professor was granted a new tenure review, minus Dr. Asante. The department was further divided during his successor's term. Some faculty members -- and Dr. Asante -- had supported a different candidate and accused the new head, Joyce A. Joyce, of undermining the Afrocentric mission. She accused them of wanting to control the department. She resigned last June after four years of bitter battles. During all this turbulence, half the faculty was lost.
Under Dr. Norment, an imposing, gregarious man who punctuates his cross-campus strolls with frequent pauses to greet students and colleagues with hugs, the department is beginning to get back on its feet. "What is unique about Temple is that our methodology has been the Afrocentric paradigm, however you interpret it," says Dr. Norment, who moved to Temple from City College in 1989. "At Temple we have a different canon, a different body of knowledge." For instance, he explains, "In traditional sociology, there's no mention of any black sociologists, not even William J. Wilson. Our students know both areas of knowledge. We are teaching about those white individuals who have made contributions that have impacted upon the black experience." 
Majors concentrate in one of three departmental tracks: social behavior (sociology, psychology), cultural aesthetics (dance, performance, the arts) or public policy. The policy track was never fully developed, and Dr. Norment plans to build up this area. The department has awarded 84 Ph.D.'s and 127 master's degrees to students who have gone on to teach at Antioch, Howard and other colleges and universities. About 70 undergraduates major in African-American studies each year, with an additional 30 either minoring or double-majoring in it. Currently 65 graduate students are enrolled in the department.
Jason Neuenschwander, 31, has been at Temple since 1989, earning his B.A. and M.A. and working toward his Ph.D. He is part of Temple's Future Faculty Fellows program, which grants full tuition and stipend to members of ethnic groups -- nonblacks, in his case -- that are underrepresented in particular disciplines. He decided on African-American studies because he found few courses in the political science or history departments on the subject he wanted to study: the history of American racial politics. "I'm from West Virginia, and I could never understand why one group of people had such disdain for another group, especially when they had so little contact," he says.
As one of the few nonblack graduate students in the department, Mr. Neuenschwander is aware of the impression he makes. "I'm either seen as a pleasant anomaly or an aberration, an invited guest or an invader," he says. "When my students come in to class and see that their teacher is this big white dude, they are shocked. But it's fine after the second or third class."
Karanja Keita Carroll, 25, of Teaneck, N.J., received a B.A. in psychology with a double minor in history and African-American studies from Montclair State University. He was attracted to Temple's graduate program because of its reputation. "Afrocentricity really opens you up and helps you critique different models of knowledge," he says. He is currently teaching a class on African psychology, which he argues is different from, say, European psychology. "There is no such thing as an Oedipus complex for African people," he says. "It comes from a distinctive cultural perspective that we simply don't have." 
In his course, Mr. Carroll uses Afrocentricity in tracing the roots of the word "psychology," which is usually attributed to the Greek "psyche." He tells students it actually comes from African culture -- the word "sakhu" ("soul") in Medew Netcher, the language of Egyptian hieroglyphics. "But they aren't going to tell you that in a traditional psychology class," he says.
Mr. Carroll says Temple's is the only department where he could pursue his research project (the historian Cheikh Anta Diop's relation to the Afrocentric paradigm). "Other universities call themselves departments of African-American studies but have people teaching from a psychological, sociological or historical perspective," he says. "If you aren't studying from the African perspective, then just whose perspective are you using?"

Princeton: The Diaspora and Beyond
Readings for a recent session of Nell Painter's class, "Whiteness in Historical Perspective," were extremely dull. Even the professor thinks so. "How many of you were bored to death by the reading?" she asks at the start of class. Hands shoot up in agreement. "Well, this is a good thing!" she explains in her best Martha Stewart voice. The readings -- texts by the 18th-century naturalists Carolus Linnaeus and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon -- are intended to give students a taste of the exhaustive but fruitless quest for a scientific basis for racial classification. They are boring, she says, because we don't share the author's 18th-century episteme; we have different ways of thinking about knowledge and racial differences.
The course, which begins with readings by Herodotus, Julius Caesar, Pliny the Elder and Tacitus, promises to examine the "seven great but incommensurate historical circumstances -- European voyages of discovery, the elaboration of natural history, European colonization, 19th- and 20th-century European immigration, the Shoah and the flowering of African-American studies" that, according to the syllabus, "have revolutionized discussions of whiteness." No mention of Medew Netcher here.
In contrast with Temple, black studies on this suburban New Jersey campus is firmly rooted in the European tradition. And it is a program, not a department, a significant distinction. Black studies at Princeton has no faculty of its own. Instead, professors are drawn from related departments, predominantly history and English.
Lacking the authority to hire and promote means the program was not involved in the job offer made last spring to Cornel West, a move he says he is now considering because of what he saw as a challenge to his scholarship and as Harvard's lack of commitment to affirmative action -- and what Dr. Summers saw as a misunderstanding. In a recent interview, Dr. West said he would announce his intentions in mid-April. The philosopher K. Anthony Appiah, also of Harvard's dream team in African-American studies, joins Princeton in the fall. 
"There are other people who are interested in coming here, and we are interested in them," Amy Gutmann, Princeton's provost, said in late March. "Of course, we are interested in Skip Gates," the director of Harvard's African-American studies department. "We are very proud of our first-rate program in A.A. studies," she added, "and if building on their success means going from a program to a department, we are open to that."
Indeed, the program is now in the middle of a well-orchestrated lobbying effort to become Princeton's newest department. As a program, it offers no degrees, only certificates for undergraduates who concentrate in the subject (after declaring a major in a traditional discipline). Roughly 20 students do so each year, a third of them white (200 of Princeton's 2,500 undergraduates are African-American). 
Brigitte Anderson, a 20-year-old from Phoenix, is an anthropology major but concentrating in black studies. Her required senior thesis is on race and elder care. Although she is not sure she would have majored in black studies, she is disappointed it was not an option. "The program doesn't feel like it gets the university's full support," she says. "Maybe it is a remnant of that third-world mentality." Still, it has had enormous impact on her thinking. She had already confronted many of the racial issues some of the white students were learning about for the first time in classes like "Race, Class and Intelligence." But she relishes having a black professor and discussing taboo subjects like affirmative action openly -- "to look at the issues through an intellectual lens," she says.
The eclectic mix of senior theses are further evidence of the degree to which Princeton integrates African-American studies into the rest of the curriculum. "African-Americans in Engineering: From Slavery to Corporate America," "Looking Back With Faith: Experiences With African-American Mormons Previous to the Revelation of 1978," "Common Cent$: How the Private Sector Can Sustain Economic Activity in the Inner City" -- clearly the products of minds who aim to change society from within the system.
But faculty members believe their efforts to design a coherent curriculum are hindered by the discipline's status. "Program, rather than department status, gives the unfortunate signal that Princeton is not fully supportive of African-American and African Diaspora Studies," reasons the program's proposal for departmental status. "Inescapably, and unfortunately, program status further suggests that the field of study and the people being studied are not of central importance to the university's intellectual and social missions."
If their goals are realized (and with the university's new president, Shirley M. Tilghman, it seems more likely they will be), the new department will have a formal connection to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York and have its own public-policy center.
It will also have a new intellectual mission: the growing study of the African diaspora. "There are as many as a billion people of African descent around the world," says Colin A. Palmer, a historian and the program's acting director. "Africa has 750 million, the Americas broadly defined has 150 million, and then there are Africans all over Asia and elsewhere." Dr. Palmer compares the department's curriculum to that of a comparative literature department. Majors would specialize in two geographic areas, perhaps the United States and the Caribbean or Latin America.
In diaspora studies, the emphasis is on the way groups change across geographic space and time. "The interesting question is how do a people of seemingly similar background and history, placed in different contexts, produce something so different," he says. "We'll look at the cross-fertilization of ideas that takes place across the diaspora: Caribbean folk coming to New York, for instance, and transforming the texture of life there. Folks in the Caribbean influenced by black American traditions. This is the study of globalization, but with a particular phenotype and history."
Dr. Rooks and Dr. Palmer argue that this mission requires a method that takes the inherently interdisciplinary, thematic nature of this subject into account. Dr. Rooks, who holds a Ph.D. in American studies, says that establishing an interdisciplinary department is now possible because of the emergence of scholars who have been trained in its methods. "For a long time, interdisciplinary just meant that you grab two disciplines and slap them together," she says. "But now it is possible to hire someone who is not a historian or lit person who just wants to do 'other stuff,' but who is actually trained to do interdisciplinary work. Someone who does interdisciplinary work on, say, poverty is going to draw different conclusions than a sociologist or literary critic."
THE path from program to department is often not smooth: it was not until the head of Yale's program, Hazel Carby, threatened to resign that African-American studies was finally granted departmental status in 2000. 
And not everybody believes it is desirable. "The weakness of being a department is that you risk being cut off from others in your discipline. If you are the only person doing literature in an African-American studies department and there is also an English department on campus, there is something unnatural about that," says the literary scholar Arnold Rampersad, who directed Princeton's program for three years before moving to Stanford in 1998. "I believe that if you draw a sharp line at race as a student, you are doomed," he says. "If you don't see all of literature as your province, you probably won't do anything of great value for African-American literature. For that reason, I think programs are probably the way to go."
Dr. Painter, who ran the Princeton program from 1997 to 2000, understands her former colleague's point, but disagrees. "If you're not a department there is no way to design a coherent curriculum, to guarantee that crucial courses are offered at regular intervals, to create a consistently high-quality intellectual experience for students," she says. "Departments don't have to be intellectual ghettos, especially not departments that depend on communicating with other disciplines." 
Dr. Painter says she is amazed how the relationship between African-American studies and the university has changed, even in the time since she received her Ph.D. in history from Harvard in 1974. The pre-1960's study of black culture took place largely outside of elite institutions, whether it consisted of W.E.B. DuBois's work at Atlanta University or Charles S. Johnson's at Fisk University. "The issues have always been there, but the high level of scholarship is new," she says. "There is just so much more knowledge to reflect on, to teach from, and to add to. The advances of scholarship have given African-American studies a more global vision. It is a field that has the responsibility of examining the ideologies of the whole culture. And this requires that we stay in touch with what is going on everywhere."

 CORRECTION:
Articles on Pages 34 and 36 of the special Education Life section today include outdated references to Cornel West, a professor in Harvard's Afro-American studies department. On Friday, after the section had gone to press, it was announced that Dr. West was leaving Harvard for Princeton.
An article in the Education Life section on Sunday about Princeton's black studies program misstated the number of undergraduates at the university. It is about 4,500, not 2,500.

 BODY:
 After 50 years of cold war, the question was: What will the State Department do now? "You had Ross Perot saying fax machines could replace diplomats," says Niels Marquardt, special coordinator for diplomatic readiness. By 1995, half as many foreign service officers were hired; the qualifying exam was even skipped some years. But the world became something else again: one embassy in Yugoslavia, for instance, grew to six in the Balkans, and peace has proved elusive. To fill jobs, the department spent $700,000 on recruiting in 2001 compared with $25,000 in 2000. The annual test was given yesterday, but for the first time will be repeated, on Sept. 21.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, the Pop Quiz in the Education Life section on Sunday omitted answers for three questions in a sample from the Foreign Service exam. Each answer was "c": For No. 16, an example of an American product that could be produced to optimal output without government intervention, is "new automobiles." For No. 17, the main reason the United States declared war on Germany in 1917 was that "American trade with Great Britain and France was interrupted by German warfare." For No. 18, the reason people are most likely to feel stress is that "They believe they are incapable of dealing with a situation."

HEADLINE: A IS FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION; 
A Minority of None

BYLINE:  By Randal C. Archibold; Randal C. Archibold is a reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
"Kumbaya" is not sung as the pledge of allegiance but it might as well be. White parents marvel that their kindergartners come home singing freedom songs. A gay man and a Jewish woman are co-chairmen of the parents' "multicultural committee." The eighth graders are preparing a trip to Washington to lobby for gay rights and against racial profiling. Everybody is learning Spanish; the sister school is in rural Nicaragua. After second grade, everybody has to spend time once a year on the school's farm in the Catskills, milking cows, shoveling hay and, really, learning to get along.
 But the most remarkable thing about Manhattan Country School, the harbor for this diversity and variety of experience, is that it is an elite private school on the Upper East Side, though worlds apart from its predominantly white, mostly affluent brethren. Even more unusual is that it is descended from the civil rights movement, weathering the shifting currents of race and ethnicity but clinging to its 60's roots. 
 There may be no other private, nonreligious school like it in the country. Minorities are in the majority, and families come from a broad range of economic groups, from doctors and lawyers to social workers. The school attracts parents with liberal politics and an activist bent who are seeking the quality of a private school education but are frustrated that they remain overwhelmingly white. 
"Several schools have achieved racial diversity but very few have the racial and socioeconomic diversity that sets Manhattan Country School apart," says Randolph L. Carter, a senior associate with the Eastern Educational Resource Collaborative, a nonprofit group in Washington that studies diversity in private schools.
In New York City, minority enrollment at top private schools averages 21 percent. Public schools are the reverse -- only about 15 percent of the students are white. But at Manhattan Country, which has 194 students from prekindergarten to eighth grade, 45 percent are white, 27 percent African-American, 20 percent Hispanic and 8 percent Asian-American. To help ensure a cross-section of economic backgrounds, a sliding scale decides how much of the tuition ($15,000 in lower grades, $19,000 in upper) a family pays -- an unusual technique among private schools. As a result, 15 percent of the enrollment pays up to a quarter of the tuition, 29 percent up to half, 19 percent up to three-quarters and 37 percent up to full cost. Additional support comes from a $7.2 million endowment bolstered by donations from foundations and individuals.
Behind the numbers is a progressive approach to schooling: there are few rote exercises, and much of the learning comes from projects, like studying a family's immigration path. Many lessons incorporate discussion of race and culture, equality and justice, with an emphasis on historic black-white relations, or the lack thereof. "Differences must be immediately experienced to be treasured and understood," Gus Trowbridge, a disciple of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., wrote in the charter of the school, which he founded in 1966 with 66 students. "A school which avoids differences, directly or obliquely, places education outside the context of living."
All well and good. But as the school celebrates its 35th year with a commemoration and fund-raiser at Riverside Church this afternoon, it has sought to dispel the notion that it is a 60's relic that has somehow resisted the backlash against affirmative action and, in many quarters, integration -- a noble experiment whose practices have little application elsewhere.
"The question is often asked, 'Are we a museum to the civil rights movement?"' Michele Sola, the school's director, says as she marches with parents and students in the school's annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day procession through Harlem -- accompanied by, yes, the 60's gospel anthem of togetherness, "Kumbaya." 
She answers herself: "That question assumes the lessons of racial peace and harmony only are for one time."
Mr. Trowbridge, 67, speaks wearily these days. The civil rights movement has come and gone, he is sorry to concede, and the world did not catch up to Manhattan Country. But it is still here, as selective, in its own way, as any upper-echelon school, with 200 applications for 18 openings annually. "What does that tell you?" he asks.
Racial and ethnic identity is paramount at Manhattan Country. When a group of eighth graders are asked one day to reflect on how the issue comes up, a spirited but friendly and sometimes frustrated exchange ensues over the role of white people in history. 
"We're constantly studying how white people are bad," says Lotte Collins, a 13-year-old white student whose attempts to fit in have led her at various times to identify herself as black or Hispanic (she has some Spanish ancestry).
"I completely disagree," replies Amy Ramirez, a Hispanic student.
Says Lotte: "We study how white people took Native Americans down. We study how Europeans came to America and oppressed everybody." 
"That," Amy says, shaking her head, "is the history of it."
Jake Eichenbaum-Pikser rises to Lotte's defense. "She is not saying that didn't happen," Jacob explains. "She is saying it's hard to hear it all the time. You can become ashamed of being white." Turning to a visitor, he adds: "I'm white, but I like really to say I'm Jewish. I identify more with my Jewishness because Jewish people have not done as many bad things. If you're teaching history the way it went, there are slight undertones to white people being bad."
Later, Ms. Sola says that the school tries to include white people who have supported civil rights in its lessons. "Obviously I'm not a proponent of children learning through guilt," she says. "However, this observation may be part of the process of turning things upside down a bit at M.C.S. If the onus of guilt falls societally on whites then whites come into this community with inherited privilege they may not recognize."
In the end, students find an atmosphere of tolerance not often found in other schools. Tanisha Colon-Bibb, who is part Puerto Rican, part African-American, arrived at the school as a fourth grader from a predominantly black and Hispanic public school with preconceived notions about whites. But after developing friendships with white classmates and teachers, she came to believe otherwise. "I thought white people were supposed to be all racists," she says. "That quickly changed at M.C.S."
Being self-conscious about race does not always make perfect harmony, however, and may even make it an issue. One teacher was startled to see a boy imitating a Chinese person. A Jewish student was called a name because of his religion. 
Teachers try to turn such moments into lessons. When the word "spic" came up in "Felita," a novel about a Hispanic girl's move from the South Bronx to the north Bronx, Julie Carino stopped her third-grade class for a discussion of the word. "Some of them didn't know what it meant," she recalls. "I had to explain its horrible background."
The curriculum is designed to bust stereotypes. In social studies, the area where the school's multicultural approach is best exemplified, each grade concentrates on a theme for the year. Third graders, for example, study American Indians; fourth graders, immigration; sixth graders, European, Asian and African history and the civil rights movement.
Essays and reports are stressed, as well as role-playing. To study Jackie Robinson, the sixth graders wrote and performed a play based on his life. To study Greek mythology, the fifth grade threw a toga party. Eighth graders are required to go to Albany and Washington to lobby legislators to accept their stance on issues like abortion and gay rights.
And what might that stance be? Not surprisingly, by dint of their upbringing or the tone of instruction, students favor civil liberties. Robin Friedman, who teaches eighth-grade social studies, says she encourages those who break from the pack. "I've had students ask me, 'Do I have to be for a perspective if I choose a topic?"' Ms. Friedman says. Among a group of students studying the death penalty recently, "three kids were anti and one was pro."
To an extent, Manhattan Country is a bubble. Students must eventually leave for a harsher reality. Graduates speak of the shock of encountering self-segregated cafeterias. Jake Eichenbaum-Pikser's sister, who attended Manhattan Country and is now at the Bronx High School of Science, one of the city's most prestigious public schools, warned him of racial cliques.
"It's going to be real weird," he says, "to go to high school."
GO back to 1966, the air charged with racial discord and protest. James Meredith, who caused riots when he enrolled as the first black student at the University of Mississippi, is shot by a sniper during a civil rights march. Stokely Carmichael coins the phrase "black power" and takes over the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Kwanzaa is born. 
Amid this ferment, Mr. Trowbridge, a white schoolteacher, opens Manhattan Country in a town house at 7 East 96th Street, a street that, as the boundary between a poor and wealthy neighborhood, has come to symbolize the line between the haves and the have-nots in New York.
"I wanted the kind of school," he says, "that if King ever should have come for a visit he would say, 'Yes, that's what I was talking about."'
He had been teaching English and history at the exclusive Dalton School for eight years. He started with $15,000 seed money donated by friends and, working from a tiny Park Avenue office, dialed up any foundation and individual he could think of. Not incidentally, he raided his mother's address book, which was full of prosperous liberal women who could identify with a school that was seeking equality. 
Ultimately, Manhattan Country (as in the school's country farm) was a product of its time, riding the spirit of the 60's. Mr. Trowbridge set and met a goal of 30 percent minority enrollment, arriving at that figure by doubling the minority enrollment of the private school with the best record of diversity. He promised a small school with small classes, long before such practices were in vogue. His philosophy was that it would provide students more personal attention but also allow for a "forced proximity" that would encourage talk about racial and cultural differences. One practice that extends to this day, for instance, was requiring groups of younger children to visit one another's homes to see other neighborhoods and how people live.
It has not all been holding hands and singing songs. In the 70's, a group of parents formed the Black Caucus and then the Concerned Black Parents, and several times threatened to pull their children out of the school over Mr. Trowbridge's refusal to create a separate black studies curriculum. He eventually convinced them that such instruction already occurs throughout the school, even if not designated as a separate course, but the school was deeply divided by the tension.
In the early 90's, under pressure from parents and staff members, Mr. Trowbridge adopted a "gender equity" curriculum that incorporated women's and gay rights. It had been pointed out to him that while students were being disciplined immediately for racial epithets, they were not for slurring girls or gays.
Over the years, the school has also weathered the attacks on progressive education as too soft, largely sticking to its guns. It does use standardized tests to assess achievement: students read a grade or two ahead on the Stanford reading tests, and scores on the New York State fourth-grade reading and math tests have been in league with those of other private schools -- well above the average for public schools -- though Manhattan Country is one of the relatively few private, nonreligious schools that have opted to take the tests at all.
In recent years, to strengthen the curriculum, a math specialist was added, as well as a computer lab. Still, parents and staff members lament the lack of a full-fledged science lab (and gym).
"M.C.S. was so committed to social science and humanities that the math and science hadn't taken center stage," says Ronnie Lichtman, the parent of a seventh grader who helps run the multicultural committee, which is dedicated to discussing equity issues involving the school. 
Ms. Sola says adjustments to the curriculum reflected a history of internal "debates about whether we can have an academically strong program and still engage in the outside world."
"That debate is still with us today," she says. For starters, the school does not embrace the academically competitive admissions test used by most private schools. It is taken only by those seeking admission in the second grade or above -- the bulk of students come before then, and it is not weighed as heavily as the interview with the staff and parents' written application.
The school does not seek out only the gifted. It wants shy students and the gabby, those who learn quickly as well as those who need more attention. It looks for families who share its values. And the school's current economic and racial profile must be taken into account: no particular race can be in the majority -- that is, more than 50 percent of the student body. 
Challenges constantly arise. The school struggles to recruit students of Asian descent, partly because neighborhoods with large numbers of Asians are distant from the school, and it has not developed word-of-mouth in newer immigrant communities. With blacks and Hispanics still earning less than whites, the school has had difficulty ensuring that the wealthiest families are not all white. "For us to find a full-paying Latino family is more of a struggle than the low range, for sure," Ms. Sola says.
From time to time, Mr. Trowbridge hears parents express the belief that the school should strive to be another Dalton, to place more emphasis on academics than on social mission. 
Last month, he was interviewed by the sixth grade as part of a project to chronicle the school's history. Toward the end, a black student asked him, "Haven't you achieved your goals?"
"Well, how do you feel in here? Good?" Mr. Trowbridge replied.
"Yes," said the boy.
"How do you feel when you are not in school? The same?"
"No."
"Well, what does that tell you?"

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Hawaii's Tourism Shows Signs of Recovery

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
BECAUSE tourism in Hawaii is almost totally dependent on visitors who arrive by plane, few other destinations appeared so vulnerable to the downturn in air travel after Sept. 11. 
 That vulnerability became obvious almost immediately as Hawaii tourism plummeted 34 percent last September compared with September 2000. Airlines quickly reduced flights to Hawaii and replaced large planes with smaller ones. 
 Tourism dried up so quickly that in October, Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating company, said Hawaii was the only state whose credit was directly affected by the events of Sept. 11. Hawaii's tourism base and reliance on airline traffic for economic momentum "is so significant that the revenue impact could be immediate and severe," the company said, placing the state's rating on its credit watch. If the Hawaiian economy did not recover soon, Standard & Poor's warned, the company would lower the rating on the state's AA- general obligation bonds, making them less attractive to investors. 
Over the next few months Hawaii tourism gradually managed to recover. During the week ending March 4, the average number of daily passengers arriving on domestic flights was within 1 percent of the comparable period a year ago, according to the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. Even Japanese vacationers, who had largely shunned Hawaii after Sept. 11, as well as the United States mainland, are returning. Last November, for example, the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii plummeted 59 percent from November 2000, according to the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism. But at a news conference in Washington last month, Isao Matsuhashi, chairman of the Japan Travel Bureau, the nation's biggest travel agency, said that the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii was at 90 percent of its pre-September level.
Japanese visitors are not the only ones returning to Hawaii; visits by mainland Americans have picked up significantly since mid-March. 
"It's a hot destination," said Roxie Peterson, the owner of Rushmore Travel Service in Rapid City, S.D., adding that her bookings are up about 50 percent over this time last year. She attributed the trend to the array of bargains and the desire to escape to a place that's warm, exotic and on American soil.
Another travel agent who has seen an increase in bookings to Hawaii, though a more modest one, is Terence P. McDonough, the owner of Aladdin Travel in Annapolis, Md., who believes "the fear of flying is turning around." But he also believes a warm winter in the Northeast kept some potential visitors at home. 
Another reason some Easterners may have passed up Hawaii is that most of the promotional efforts this year were aimed largely at the state's two biggest tourist markets: the West Coast and Japan. The Matson Navigation Company in Honolulu spearheaded a separate promotional campaign in January, to "boost Hawaii tourism," in which such other private companies as Aloha Airlines and Starwood Hotels and Resorts also participated. 
Meanwhile, there are still many bargains to be had.
Pleasant Holidays of Westlake Village, Calif., which has been sending tourists to Hawaii for decades, has an array of specials for spring. One includes round-trip air fare and five nights at the 247-room Aston Coral Reef hotel in Waikiki for $471 from Los Angeles with flights on American Trans Air and $710 from New York or Newark on United Airlines. The special is good for travel from May 1 through May 27; (800) 742-9244.
Through June 16, Outrigger Hotels and Resorts, (800) 688-7444, Hawaii's biggest lodging company, is offering 45 percent off its usual rates on every ocean-view room at its hotels on Oahu, Maui, Kauai and the Big Island.
After canceling many flights to Hawaii and reducing the size of the aircraft used last fall, carriers are now adding flights and using bigger planes.
United, for example, recently added two weekly nonstops between Denver and Honolulu. On June 2, it plans to add a second daily flight from San Francisco to Kona using a Boeing 757. On June 15, American Airlines will add a daily nonstop between Los Angeles and Kauai. 
Yet Hawaii tourism is still a long way from its halcyon days of 2000, when 7 million visitors spent $10.9 billion -- each figure a record. This year's forecast is for 6.5 million visitors, slightly more than last year, and for visitor spending to reach $10.35 billion, up from last year's estimated $10.06 billion.
And many of those tourists who are returning appear to be keeping a tight grip on their wallets. Many Japanese tourists now shop for bargains much as Americans do, patronizing discount shops rather than expensive shops on Waikiki or in the Vuitton-controlled DFS duty-free outlets throughout Hawaii. While the Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism said that Japanese spent an average $235 a day per person in Hawaii last year, compared with $170 a day for all other visitors, that figure pales alongside their $298-a-day average expenditure in 1997, and it is positively anemic compared with $354 a day a few years before. 
Meanwhile, in recognition of improved Hawaii tourism, in February Standard & Poor's withdrew its earlier warning that it might downgrade the islands' credit rating, and removed its credit watch.

I Want My 401(k)

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN 

 BODY:
The recession may be winding down, but students know they'll still have to make compromises before grabbing the brass ring. Although most say they feel psychologically prepared to live on their own, 58 percent of 1,742 collegians surveyed last month by MonsterTrak.com, the online college job recruiting service, said they expected to move back with the folks on graduation -- 22 percent for more than a year. 
(The results are consistent with polls by the service last fall and summer of almost 6,000 college students.)
 Part of the reason for the decision may be students' willingness to make sacrifices for their future: in other MonsterTrak polls, 59 percent said they would prefer an unpaid internship at their dream job over a well-paid one elsewhere. But they expect their suffering to pay off: 67 percent said they would be more successful than their parents. 
 "The graduating class of 2002 will enter the work force confident about their abilities to succeed in their endeavors," says Ken Ramberg, president of the Los Angeles-based MonsterTrak. "However, weighed down by debt and with little confidence that Social Security or their future employer's pension plans will see them through retirement, many students are opting to return home to jump-start their savings. There's certainly a strong sense of fiscal responsibility among today's graduates." 
Or, as a respondent posted on the site's message board: "I love to live with my parents or family. Someone who can take care of me." ABBY ELLIN

HEADLINE: DESPERATELY SEEKING DIVERSITY; 
The 10 Percent Solution

BYLINE:  By Jim Yardley; Jim Yardley is a correspondent for The Times based in Houston

 BODY:
CECILIA LARA'S family thinks it's a miracle that she's in college. Her father, a roofer, has a sixth-grade education. Her mother never went to school, period. They waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico and worked for years in the shadows of the Texas economy as illegal immigrants before getting residency. 
 Roberto Farias, on the other hand, always expected to go to college. He just didn't have the money. His mother cleaned houses and office buildings, and when Roberto and his brother fought as boys, she would make him scrub toilets. He does not want to do that for a living. 
Debbie Rosen has done everything possible not just to go to college but to go to the college of her choice. Her father, a dermatologist, emphasized achievement. Her test scores and grades are outstanding. Her life has not been shaped by hardship, but she has worked hard. 
These three students have never met. Two are graduates from one of Houston's poorest high schools, the other a senior at one of its richest. But they do share this: high hopes, determination and lives altered by Texas' top 10 percent law, the much-publicized college admissions program whose influence has been felt across the nation. The premise of the law, which took effect in 1998, is seemingly simple: students who finish in the top 10 percent of their graduating class earn automatic admission to the Texas public university of their choice. But as the students' stories show, the law's impact is anything but simple.
For Ms. Lara, 18, bright and serious, the law has meant salvation. The obvious path for her would have been a community college or the University of Houston, a commuter school. Instead, fifth in her class at John H. Reagan High School, she qualified for the University of Texas' flagship campus at Austin and a special scholarship. Last semester, her first, went well: four A's and a B. But during spring break, she anxiously checked the university's Web site every day, waiting for midterm grades to be posted. It's important she do well. "I'm the only child who went to college," she explains.
For Mr. Farias, 19, college has been a struggle so far. He, too, graduated from Reagan in the top 10 percent. He enrolled last summer on a special scholarship at Texas A&M, the legendary land-grant university in College Station, but got an F in math. His grades improved in the fall, but he still had to petition A&M officials to keep his scholarship. During spring break he was also glued to his computer: he must make a B-plus average this spring. "I had never asked for help in high school," he says. "But I finally let go of my ego and asked."
For her part, Ms. Rosen has been checking the University of Texas admissions Web site for months -- to see if she has been admitted at all. She is a senior at Bellaire High School, which boasts 58 national merit finalists in its current senior class. The valedictorian is headed to Stanford, the salutatorian to Harvard. Competition to make the top 10 is so fierce that students sometimes break down crying during exam weeks.
Ms. Rosen, 17, had fallen just short -- a 4.48 grade point average, enough to rank at the top of most high schools but not at Bellaire, where she placed 79th, or in the top 12 percent. Her twin sister, Jenny, had a 4.52, for a ranking of 66th, making her the last person in the top 10. So while Jenny was admitted to the Austin campus in December and invited to apply to an honors liberal arts program, Debbie has been waiting and worrying. "Had I gotten an A instead of a B in one more class, I would have been in the top 10 percent," she says. "It's disheartening when your state school doesn't want you. It makes you feel really bad about yourself."
The 10 percent law is a response to the Hopwood decision, a 1996 federal appeals court ruling that struck down affirmative action in Texas and caused a sudden drop in the number of minority students enrolling at Texas A&M and the University of Texas. By admitting the cream of every high school, the law intends to make higher education accessible to disadvantaged students -- mostly minorities -- who were often overlooked.
The concept has become remarkably popular with educators as well as politicians in both parties; California and Florida have since instituted percent plans, and other states have expressed interest as affirmative action is increasingly put on the defensive -- a federal appeals court ruling on racial preference in University of Michigan admissions is expected shortly, and the University of Georgia is scurrying to devise new admissions criteria after its system was struck down last year. 
But if the Texas law represents a good- faith effort at remedy, its birth was hurried and its ultimate impact uncertain. Now, four years after the first percenters arrived on a university campus, educators can more accurately consider these basic questions: Does the plan restore minority enrollment and improve access to the state system? And how has it affected the educational system, both at universities and high schools? 
The answer to the first question is a qualified yes. Before Hopwood, enrollment never reflected the diversity of the state, but the decision damaged many of the gains that had been achieved by Hispanics and blacks. The success of the 10 percent law has been in reversing that trend, though the results are uneven. 
At the University of Texas at Austin, considered a trailblazer in tailoring scholarships and recruitment to the law, the percentage of non-Hispanic whites among incoming freshmen is at an all-time low -- 61 percent compared with 65 percent in 1996. Hispanic enrollment has recovered to the 14 percent level that existed before Hopwood. But the primary beneficiaries of the law have been Asians, who now constitute nearly 20 percent of the incoming class but make up just 3 percent of the state's population. And the university still struggles to recruit black students: they make up 3 percent of incoming freshmen, down from 4 percent pre-Hopwood, though they constitute 12 percent of the state's population. 
"We haven't found that magic that makes the numbers jump quickly as we have with Hispanics and Asians," the university's admissions director, Bruce Walker, concedes. "We have a lot of history to overcome." 
The improvement in minority enrollment has been slower at Texas A&M, though the same basic trend prevails. "We're not there yet," says Joseph Estrada, assistant provost for enrollment. 
University administrators and lawmakers continue to tweak the law. Fearing a legal challenge, officials at A&M recently withdrew a new proposal to offer automatic enrollment to the top 20 percent at selected low-income, predominantly minority high schools. Austin has just started the "Keep Texans in Texas!" plan, which matches scholarship offers from out-of-state universities made to students in 130 high schools that have historically sent few graduates to the university.
Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at Harvard, says that it is these efforts -- recruitment, financial aid, academic support -- that attract and retain minorities. The law alone is only a foundation. "If you have a percent plan without those, you don't have too much," he says.
Among the unexpected byproducts of the plan is that it accelerates the nascent trend of de-emphasizing the SAT. The board of regents of the University of California, which began a top 4 percent plan this academic year, is expected to vote in July on dropping the SAT reasoning test, in part because of concerns that it does not reflect high school curriculum but also because it favors middle- and upper-income families. 
For percenters who qualify for automatic admission, the SAT is irrelevant. Ms. Lara scored 1,200 and Mr. Farias a 950, and both got in. The percentage of Austin freshmen who scored less than 990 on the SAT -- far below the school mean of 1,202 -- has more than doubled since 1996. And the percentage of incoming freshmen who scored above 1,200 has declined. 
Critics of percent plans have two major complaints: First, that marginal SAT scores mean students who are ill prepared for college-level work. Second, that qualified students at competitive suburban high schools and private academies -- students with high scores and rigorous course loads who are near the top 10 -- are being squeezed out of the public education system or not getting into the school of their choice. 
The University of Texas answers the first charge by pointing to its data. Most top 10 percenters get better grades than non-top 10 students, even those who scored 200 or 300 points higher on the SAT. "These kids are prospering, they are doing well here," says Julia Gilbert, a vice provost.
Regarding the second complaint, officials blame "misunderstanding" for the perception that only top 10 students are getting in. Slightly more than half of all incoming freshmen are top 10 percenters -- a modest 7 percent increase since the Hopwood decision. Still, admissions is far more competitive, if only because the number of applications has skyrocketed, from 14,000 to 22,000.
"Our job is to serve the whole state," says Larry R. Faulkner, the University of Texas president. "There is not any mechanism of rationing admissions to the university that is going to be perfectly fair in anybody's eyes. There is none."
THE drive to Texas A&M is only about 90 miles from Houston, but the distance divides different worlds. If Houston is an urban melting pot, A&M is pure country and proud of it. Throughout its history, the university has been overwhelmingly white.
Roberto Farias, university officials hope, represents part of a more diverse future. Friendly and gregarious, he did not grow up dreaming about A&M as so many teenagers in Texas do. Before the new law, A&M might not have even accepted him -- his SAT was 250 points below the average.
Freshman year has been bumpy. He picked one of the toughest majors -- engineering -- and has been struggling to regain academic footing since failing math. In the fall he made an A, a B and a C but dropped math and physics. This semester, he is taking math again, as well as history, political science and a class called "Science in the News," which he describes as "a G.P.A. booster." 
"I was used to the slow pace," he says of high school. 
That inequities exist among public schools won't surprise anyone: rich schools like Bellaire enjoy far more resources than poor schools like Reagan. In Texas, that means students can now qualify for admission without having taken a full complement of college-prep courses.
"The state of Texas has defined that those who have achieved top 10 percent status have some coequal academic preparation," says George Scott, an educational researcher and watchdog from Houston. "And that is absolutely 100 percent a lie."
For years, in fact, university officials have complained that the state's public schools do not adequately prepare students. A recent University of Texas study shows that the most rigorous majors, including business and the sciences, have seen a decline in grade point averages since the top 10 law was enacted. Last year, state lawmakers passed a bill requiring students to have taken a college-prep curriculum to qualify for top 10 percent admission, beginning in 2004.
Overall, though, officials at both Texas A&M and the University of Texas say the demand for traditional remediation has not increased. They think the top 10 students are more focused, disciplined and accustomed to fighting to succeed, regardless of their high school. Still, both universities have started support programs.
A&M's "Aggie Access" provides smaller classes for core freshman courses, as well as tutoring on a volunteer basis. The program at the University of Texas is larger. It was created partly because the first waves of low-income top 10 students had a lower freshmen retention rate than the rest of the class. Now, all 626 recipients of Longhorn scholarships, which are geared for students at 70 low-income high schools, are required to participate; counselors help structure schedules, include them in interdisciplinary seminars and steer them to small courses taught by the best teachers. 
Ms. Gilbert, the vice provost who oversees the program, insists it is not remediation but guidance for students who are unfamiliar with the college world. Of the Longhorn recipients, 46 percent have parents who did not attend college and 33 percent have parents who have no degree. The plan seems to be working: the retention rate for Longhorn scholars is now roughly equal to the rest of the class. 
At Texas A&M, Mr. Farias is starting to taste success. He attended workshops with teaching assistants and his midterm grades showed improvement: all B's and a C. He had been thinking about changing his major. Now he thinks he'll stick it out.
AT the end of spring break, the Austin campus finally accepted Debbie Rosen. But it was not all good news. She wants a career in graphics and advertising, so she applied to the university's popular school of communications. But it had filled up, as had her second choice, art. Instead, she was placed in liberal arts; she could not pursue her chosen major.
"It was a hollow admission," says Ted Rosen, her father.
At the guidance office at Bellaire High School, decorated with pennants from top institutions like Skidmore, Harvard, Stanford and North Carolina, counselors have grown accustomed to the fears of parents. A few years ago, after speculation was rampant that students outside the top 10 percent were in trouble, the University of Texas admissions director visited the school to assuage such concerns.
"I refer to it as the top 10 percent mythology," says Bill Lawson, a counselor. "This notion that you've got to be in the top 10 to go to A&M or U.T. is a myth." 
But parents are not mollified. They point to a higher number of students getting only provisional admission -- meaning they must maintain a B average at a less-prestigious state institution and then enter Austin as a sophomore -- or, like Ms. Rosen, not getting into the school of their choice. In fact, the University of Texas' business and communications schools are so overwhelmed by top 10 applications that they have limited their slots to give others a chance.
At the Kinkaid School, a leading private school in Houston whose alumni include President Bush, the headmaster, Don North, says the top 10 law hit his students "like a brick wall" two years ago. Usually, 45 Kinkaid students apply to the Austin campus, with almost all gaining admission. But two years ago, 21 students were admitted provisionally. One student whose score on an advanced placement test had exempted her from freshman English was required to take it again because of her provisional status. "It was crazy," he says. 
The sudden competition for entrance to the Austin campus and Texas A&M has exposed the weakness of other campuses in the state system, Mr. North says. He says Texas needs to pour resources into the University of Texas at San Antonio or at Dallas to make them more appealing. Otherwise, he thinks more students will either turn to private universities within Texas or state universities elsewhere. 
This year, Kinkaid is sending 11 students to the private Southern Methodist University in Dallas, a noticeable increase from years past, as well as more students to Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and Trinity University in San Antonio. He says four students are going to the University of Mississippi while others are looking at Louisiana State University.
"These are kids who in the past would have preferred to go to Texas and would have gone to Texas," he says.
The pressure to make the top 10 has reshaped education in other ways. At Jesse H. Jones High School in Houston, which is divided between a magnet program for gifted students and a neighborhood school, magnet students invariably dominated the top 10 percent of the class. The principal has recommended dividing the school into two, at least on paper, to give students in the regular school a chance. Last year, a similar arrangement was approved for a magnet/neighborhood high school in Austin.
The law has also introduced a certain gamesmanship at schools like Bellaire. For example, an A is worth 4.0. But an A in an advanced placement course is worth 5.0. To get that extra point toward their cumulative grade point average, students cluster A.P. early in their high school careers, delaying as many regular courses as possible until senior year. Every fraction counts in making the top 10 before admissions time. 
As for Debbie Rosen, the acceptance at Austin was welcome but possibly too little too late. She had already missed the deadline to apply for the honors program. Along with her sister, she had been accepted to the University of Georgia and University of North Carolina and could pursue her major at both. Debbie is leery about leaving home, and her parents are not excited about paying out-of-state tuition, but for now she is leaning toward North Carolina. Whatever she decides, the twins plan to go together.
"Not only will they lose one," says Dr. Rosen about Texas, "they'll lose two." 
FIVE years ago, when Armando Alaniz became principal at Reagan High, the school was no hotbed for college recruiters. Nearly all his students were Hispanic and were poor enough to qualify for the free lunch program. The average SAT score was below 900. Recruiters from the University of Texas and Texas A&M came for college night, but that was about it. 
No longer. Suddenly Reagan's poverty and ethnicity are a plus. With race no longer considered in granting scholarships, the universities have instead focused on family income. And since the poorest schools often have large minority populations, the fact that public schools in Texas are largely segregated has become a tool to diversify higher education. The University of Texas acted first with the $20,000 Longhorn grant aimed at specific low-income high schools.
"To be honest, I could care less about what the politics are -- give my kids an even playing field and I feel they can compete," Mr. Alaniz says. "Our kids have a right to the same opportunities as other kids in the state." 
The Longhorn scholarship is the most tangible way to lure poor students. "Colleges have to say to low-income applicants, 'We want you,' not simply, 'We don't care if you're low income,"' says Robert Shireman, program director for higher education at the James Irvine Foundation, a grant-giving organization in California.
In a recent study, the foundation found that of the nation's 40 top-rated institutions, the six with the most low-income students attract them by emphasizing such outreach. "We are explicitly interested in students who have overcome disadvantage," says Richard Black, head of admissions at the University of California at Berkeley, which ranked second in the Irvine study. 
The California system, which was barred from using affirmative action in 1996 by Proposition 209, is also broadening its "comprehensive review" policy for next fall's freshman class: now all applicants will be assessed using subjective factors like overcoming economic hardship. 
There is no question that Cecilia Lara has faced hardship, and that aggressive outreach by the University of Texas is why she is now at the Austin campus. She swears she had not even heard of the University of Texas before. Her parents could not offer any advice in assessing colleges and researching scholarships. The Longhorn made it easy.
"I hate to think where I would have ended up," she says now. 
Ms. Lara finally got her midterm grades over spring break: a B on her history paper and an A on her biopsychology exam. She originally thought she would teach Spanish. Now she's not so sure. The world is much bigger than she had realized. Suddenly her options seem limitless.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
When Art Puts Down a Bet in a House of Games

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
THE two Las Vegas satellites launched last year by the Guggenheim Museum will disappoint those who have been hoping to have their faith in the mother institution restored. Lodged in the base of the Venetian Hotel, an architectural collage of vapid scenographic effects, the two pavilions are not disgraceful. Rem Koolhaas, who designed them, has brought some architecture into the picture. More, in fact, than was strictly necessary.
 Probably no design could redeem the vanity behind this venture. Far from "bringing art to the masses," the Guggenheim has brought corporate branding to an anticipated public that has thus far failed to show up. But the enterprise has delivered a crisis for the museum itself. The Guggenheim's efforts to remake itself in the image of a multinational corporation -- with outposts for culture consumers in Spain, Germany, Austria, Japan, Brazil and elsewhere around the world -- have reached the point of philosophical collapse. 
 The two pavilions form a bifurcated parabuilding within the Venetian's nightmarish trompe-l'oeil. The Hermitage/Guggenheim, jointly sponsored with the Russian state museum in St. Petersburg, draws its opening show from the collections of both institutions. "The Art of the Motorcycle," originally presented in New York, inaugurates the Guggenheim/Las Vegas. 
A vast circular gaming floor separates the two parts. But we are tempted to see this wheel of light and noise as integral to the museum's undertaking, both as a contrast to the art and as an extension of it. Art is a crap shoot, you may imagine: artists risk their lives on the pursuit of visions, without knowing how their fellow creatures or posterity will judge the results.
The Hermitage branch is a brown rectangular box fashioned from oxidized Cor-ten steel. Three fat, free-standing partitions, also of Cor-Ten, divide the space into four galleries. Mounted on pivots, the partitions can be swiveled to create different gallery configurations. Cor-ten, a material widely used by architects in the 60's and by Richard Serra in large-scale sculptures, has been rendered nearly unrecognizable here. Its surface has been waxed, and this treatment eliminates the rough, plummy bloom that the material presents in its raw state. The impression is of leather, or an expensive grade of simulated hide. Each partition, composed of several panels, thus brings to mind a wall of Samsonite Rothkos.
The panels themselves are problematic. Steel contracts and expands according to temperature. The panels require expansion joints, or seams. These create rectilinear patterns of shadow, an awkward background for displaying paintings. Deeper shadows gather at the bases and tops of the partitions, which stop short of floor and ceiling. Above, light emanates without confidence from a folded baffle of pale maple wood. The twilight effect is aggravated by a long strip of glass, set into the pavilion's outer wall, and a vertical window in one corner. The natural light admitted by these apertures is distracting, like glare penetrating a darkened room from a partly cracked-open door.
The group of paintings now on view is small but magnificent, focusing on post-Impressionism at the masterpiece level. The paintings are protected by glass. It's a fine glass, imperceptible from most angles, benignly unreflective, but in combination with the shadowy room, it creates an added challenge to viewing. Here is work by artists who were throwing light and color on squares of canvas as no other artists had ever thrown them before, presented inside a container that sucks the light right out of the room.
Guggenheim/Las Vegas, the second pavilion, is bigger, better and brighter. A well-proportioned version of the space-frame sheds that proliferated in the 1970's, the structure is heavy on hardware but airy with light and space. The roof is supported with large metal trusses, and a wide escalator descends to the lower level; but these machine maneuvers are offset by panels of translucent and transparent glass that help break up the large-span space and give it a shimmery depth.
Like that of the Pompidou Center in Paris, Koolhaas's design descends from Cedric Price's Fun Palace, an unbuilt but highly influential project of 1962. A sort of pinball learning center, with mechanized, movable floors and walls, the Fun Palace was a pivot between the grim modernist megastructure and the comic strip fantasies of the British group Archigram. Price was less concerned with form -- the building was just a kit of prefab industrial parts -- than with the mix of uses. Juxtaposition, density, and flexibility were values it promoted.
Koolhaas's design would lend itself beautifully to a more varied program. As it stands, the space relies for animation on an installation design by Edwin Chan, from the office of Frank Gehry. Made of sheets of stainless steel that have been sculptured into towering whorls, waves and curving walls, the setting goes far toward capturing the spirit of the Global Guggenheim. Motorcycles, paintings, sculptures, altar pieces, designer gowns, performance events, architectural models -- whirling, circling in space, as if they were streams of digital code, 0's and 1's, just waiting to be downloaded into a walk-in terminal equipped with bathrooms and a bookshop, and then back up there again, whirling and swirling, dipping and diving.
Except that art doesn't really work that way. Neither does looking at art. Movement can be a great subject for art, as the Futurists and others since them have shown. And it's been a central subject for architecture all along: we experience buildings by proceeding through them and by walking or riding past them, sometimes even on motorcycles.
But museums are social spaces. They contain material objects. To travel, the objects must be insured, packed, shipped, unpacked and properly lighted. All this is very cumbersome. People don't travel through the cyber-ether, either. They get brutalized by cash-short airlines and worse. None of these things are abstractions. But the Las Vegas Guggenheims leave you with the nagging feeling that you're a statistic on someone else's itinerary. They would have sent you via e-mail if that were possible.
In theory, the Guggenheim and Koolhaas should have made an ideal match. The two have been key players in the cultural politics of the post-cold war era. Koolhaas has emerged as a first-rate satirist of free enterprise run amok. He aestheticizes our ambivalence to the mixed blessings of life after "the end of history." He has been criticized for wanting it both ways -- to be part of the global monoculture while remaining independent from its culturally leveling effects. But this is precisely why so much is riding on him now. In this country, none of us have a choice but to have it both ways. Everyone is in everyone else's pockets. It has become ethically impossible to create architecture in this country without taking the reality of economic anarchy into artistic account.
It misreads Koolhaas to think that he wants to transform society. But some of us think that the creative path of art offers a means of transforming the self, in socially constructive ways, and that those who follow this path thus provide useful and inspiring models for living. Our period happens to be rich in such examples. Koolhaas and many other architects of his generation have been furnishing our global cities with essays in what the sociologist Ulrich Beck has called "reflexive modernism" -- work that addresses the shortcomings of modernity as they reveal themselves over time.
But a reflexive modernist can't do much to redeem an institution that declines to be reflexive about itself. That is the problem that has overtaken the Guggenheim in recent years. A decade ago, Thomas Krens foresaw that museums could be instrumental in shaping the cultural contours of globalization. What he eventually called the "Global Guggenheim" seemed a worthwhile experiment in channeling the flow of international capital toward new visions of cosmopolitan life.
Some Guggenheim shows from the last decade -- "The Great Utopia" and "The Italian Metamorphosis," for example -- were broad, probing surveys that equaled in intellectual scope the director's transnational goals. Increasingly, however, the museum's programs have become pale adjuncts to those goals.
Exhibitions are almost invariably linked to ulterior motives: a donation, a future museum site, the director's personal history, or some primitive desire for notoriety. The temporary installations in Frank Lloyd Wright's rotunda, culminating in Jean Nouvel's obnoxious all-black void, have become indistinguishable from changing disco decor. The "Virtual Guggenheim," a cyber-museum announced with great fanfare, has turned out to be little more than a sophomoric screen saver. Whatever you thought of the motorcycle show when it was first displayed in New York, seeing it again in Las Vegas is like reliving a hangover.
Krens is not alone in the post-cold war boat, and I prefer his ostentation to the demure connoisseurial posturings of his colleagues at other museums. But flamboyance is no substitute for self-reflection, and without that quality Krens has come to resemble a modern version of Wagner's Bavarian patron, mad King Ludwig, putting up palace after palace until his wits gave out.
Krens has been a great architectural patron. But the Global Guggenheim has created an atmosphere in which art and architecture have become secondary to institutional promotion. The art of the deal is what the museum is practicing now, and one does not care to see the ideas of artists presented in such surroundings or to feel that the public's attendance serves mainly as a form of credit for leveraging the next deal. We end up feeling used, and to no purpose of overarching cultural value.
The Guggenheim could not have foreseen the economic and tourist slump that followed last year's terrorist attacks. But it should see the slump as a blessing. The global merry-go-round has stopped spinning. The moment is here to reflect on the possibility that the Guggenheim brand is no longer an asset, but has become a cultural liability in the eyes of many who once thought of themselves as fans.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Showing The Flag Of Culture (Or Not)

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL Z. WISE 

 BODY:
WITH a steeply raked glass facade that appears to fall like the blade of a guillotine, the Austrian Cultural Forum is one of the most striking buildings to have gone up in New York in decades. It's also a dramatic, 24-story, $29 million embodiment of how nations use culture to polish their image.
 Cultural prestige has always followed troops and trade as a measure of a nation's influence. Even when once-great powers lose political and economic dominion, they still yearn to hold sway in the cultural realm. Austria is a prime example: the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 may have relegated the surviving Austrian Republic to the bush leagues of international politics, but fervid promotion of its artistic heritage has enabled this small Alpine nation to retain cultural renown. 
 For decades Austria has bankrolled national treasures like the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival. Now, on Friday, it will dedicate its towering new American outpost, designed by the Austrian-born architect Raimund Abraham. The building, on 52nd Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues, contains galleries, a library and a theater as well as offices. But it doesn't stand alone; it's only the latest in a flurry of gestures by foreign nations to show their cultural bona fides in New York. 
Several countries are opening cultural centers to capture the imagination of the American public and reflect glory back home; still more are lending state support for performances and exhibitions involving their native artists at American institutions.
Yet the phenomenon is mostly one-sided. While many nations have embraced cultural diplomacy and made New York the focal point of it, the United States has been reluctant to use art to communicate American objectives overseas at a time of broad American reach. The end of the cold war and the global scope of satellite broadcasting and the Internet have helped the United States attain not only vast new political power but also an increasingly dominating cultural influence that both attracts and repels. And many officials believe that popular culture can be a potent weapon in the American arsenal, a view cannily underlined by Secretary of State Colin Powell's appearance on MTV in February in which he defended the American campaign against terrorism before a worldwide audience of young people. But American politicians have shown little appetite for using state auspices to export a broader range of American arts than is available through market incentives.
The opposite is happening in Europe. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have helped finance construction of the new six-story Scandinavia House on Park Avenue, run by a nonprofit foundation as a kind of permanent World's Fair pavilion for Nordic art exhibitions, concerts, lectures and films. Spain will open a $19 million arts center on East 49th Street. The Italian Cultural Institute, now operating out of a stately but shabby 1919 mansion on Park Avenue, plans to move by the end of 2003 to more up-to-date Midtown premises, where it can greatly expand its programming.
The lavishness of these facilities attests to their home countries' belief in the importance of culture as a tool of diplomacy. "It's a powerful way for governments and nations to gain positive attention," says Curtis Barlow, director of cultural affairs for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. "At the senior level of government, there is a growing recognition of the utility and importance of this kind of work."
Foreign diplomats and arts administrators alike say that using culture for international understanding has taken on heightened significance. "Since Sept. 11, people are more conscious of the fact that we live in one world and that culture can help bridge our differences," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, one of many New York institutions that benefit from foreign governments' promotional efforts.
Schuyler Chapin, the New York City Commissioner for Cultural Affairs from 1994 to 2001, said: "Propaganda has nasty connotations as a word, but putting a country's strengths and cultural resources in front of people is a very persuasive argument about the legitimacy and general artistic energy that may be found in country X. New York is in many ways the cultural capital of the Western world, so it's natural that countries wishing to represent themselves from the standpoint of cultural life would gravitate to this city."
New York has been a stage for a wealth of foreign-supported cultural initiatives in the last two years. A partial list includes the Lincoln Center Festival performance of the Dutch opera "Writing to Vermeer," a retrospective of the Spanish director Luis Bunuel's films at the Museum of Modern Art, French dance performances at the Joyce Theater, a workshop featuring the German composer Helmut Lachenmann at Columbia University, a symposium on 20th-century Swedish design by the Bard Graduate Center and an evening of Canadian comedy at the 92nd Street Y presented by Michael J. Fox. All were at least partly supported by the nations whose art was on display.
Why would envoys of the Ottawa government help organize an evening of Canadian comedy? "Most people think of Canada in terms of Peter Jennings or cold weather," said Kevin O'Shea, a diplomat who was involved. In an attempt "to get across a more vibrant image," he said, Canada has recently tripled its budget for arts promotion in New York.
The goal of erasing stereotypes comes up repeatedly. Paolo Riani, director of the Italian Cultural Institute, is intent on "presenting an image of the country that is not just Mafia, not just fashion." Flavio Perri, the Brazilian consul general, wants "to show we are more than Carnival."
Explaining why Israel is helping defray the cost of the Batsheva Dance Company's appearance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music later this month, the cultural attache, Ofra Ben-Yaacov, says: "We are too much in the news because of events. It's important to see that we don't only fight, that we have better channels." Max Imgrugh, chairman of the Swiss Institute, which receives part of its financing from the government, aspires "to show that there's more to Switzerland than bank accounts and the Holocaust."
Similar thinking in the mid-1980's led to the attention-getting Austrian Cultural Forum. Austria wanted to break out of the international isolation that had been caused by the revelations of President Kurt Waldheim's service in a German army unit involved in Nazi war crimes. One way to cast the country in a more favorable light, it was decided, would be to erect an arresting, architecturally significant building in the middle Manhattan. But it's not an approach every nation is prepared to take.
How to make a mark on New York's jam-packed arts scene through less concrete measures is the challenge facing dozens of foreign cultural representatives. "It's useless to be gallery No. 1,428 or to make a small concert when it's the 27th on a given night," says Stephan Nobbe, director of the Goethe Institut. For this reason, the $7.5 million that the institute spends each year to promote German culture in the United States -- largely provided by the German Foreign Ministry -- is frequently used to help stage events at local institutions like the Guggenheim Museum or the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center rather than to finance presentations at the Goethe Institut itself, on upper Fifth Avenue.
Less prosperous countries are also resourceful at beating their artistic drums. Mongolia staged a citywide festival in 2000 that included wrestling and archery displays in Central Park and a show of dinosaur relics at the American Museum of Natural History, all of which coincided with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition on the theme of the Mongolian horse.
European powers like Germany and France are old hands at cultural diplomacy. The Goethe Institut was founded before World War II and rapidly became enmeshed in Nazi ideology. But its postwar activities have greatly reinforced the democratic credentials of today's Federal Republic. France, which employs 85 people in 10 offices around the United States to promote French culture, created the Alliance Francaise in 1883 to help regain national prestige after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Since then, France has believed that acquainting foreigners with its intellectual and cultural traditions buys sympathy for its political and economic policies.
The official use of culture can backfire. Chinese interference in the aborted American premiere of the opera "Peony Pavilion" at the 1998 Lincoln Center Festival demonstrated the perils. After agreeing to send the epic work to the festival, Shanghai officials saw a preview of the production and denounced it as "feudal," "absurd" and "pornographic." They then refused to allow performers to travel to New York. (The director pursued other avenues and the opera was staged in 1999.)
But curators and artistic directors say they can recall no other recent instance of overt state intervention in a cultural endeavor here.
While New York arts institutions insist that their bookings are based on artistic criteria, they often rely on cultural attaches to bring new artists and productions to their attention. Foreign governments will also foot the bill for curators and presenters to travel abroad to see the work. "They provide us with a knowledge base," said Robert Harth, artistic director of Carnegie Hall, which does not accept subsidized trips.
The degree to which United States arts institutions receive help from foreign nations varies widely. Ms. Hopkins of the Brooklyn Academy says "it would be tough" for the Academy to keep up its high level of international programming without diplomatic backing. At the Museum of Modern Art, foreign financing has been modest in contrast to the overall cost of any exhibition, says the director, Glenn Lowry. But state support for shows like the recent Giacometti retrospective, backed by Switzerland, helped gain additional money from foundations and private donors.
Once government backing is lined up, cultural attaches often go further, acting as go-betweens to find corporate sponsors from their own countries. Jean-Rene Gehan, the French cultural counselor, said he had helped arrange sponsorships by the media giant Vivendi Universal, the aircraft manufacturer Dassault and the Societe Generale bank.
Officially supported culture used to flow more readily across the Atlantic. During the 1950's and 60's, the United States Information Agency flooded Europe with American orchestras, dance groups, art exhibits and jazz performances as well as the Broadway musicals "Porgy and Bess" and "My Fair Lady." 
No sooner had the communist threat waned after 1991, however, than United States initiatives were cut back severely. In 1999, the U.S.I.A. itself was folded into the State Department. The United States dropped out of Expo 2000 in Hanover, Germany. The network of American libraries and reading rooms overseas has been reduced to 168, from a high of 254 in 1963. Only 22 percent are traditional lending libraries; these "information resource centers," as they're now called, often consist of a single computer terminal.
Sept. 11 and its aftermath raise the question whether slashing cultural diplomacy was prudent. Editorial writers are asking how best to combat distortions about the United States, and the film critic David Denby, among others, has urged that cultural diplomacy be revived in the Islamic world. Writing in the online magazine Slate, he advocated sending a wider range of films abroad as well as dispatching poets, professors and cultural journalists: "We can do it not by boasting or exhorting, but by describing, illustrating, embodying -- that is, by showing up."
America has long had an aversion to official involvement in the arts. Although most foreign countries have national ministries of culture and regard protection of their artistic heritage as a public responsibility, Americans have been wary of such bureaucratic control. From the Depression-era Works Projects Administration through more recent upheavals involving the National Endowment for the Arts, federal support of culture has set off heated debate. 
Patricia Harrison, the assistant secretary of state for Educational and Cultural Affairs, agrees that there's a need to refocus cultural diplomacy to correct misperceptions abroad. Along with cultural programming, Ms. Harrison oversees the Fulbright Program, which offers 4,500 grants a year to foreigners to study in the United States and to Americans to go abroad. "We need more opportunities for dialogue," she said, but she cautioned that that it could take years for any new cultural programs to have an impact. Ms. Harrison said the Bush administration had not substantially reversed the cuts in cultural diplomacy, but added, "We have put a tourniquet on the hemorrhaging." 
Joseph S. Nye Jr., dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, argues that America's commercial cultural exports already make up a form of "soft power" that influences other societies by implicitly promoting American values like personal freedom, upward mobility and democratic openness. But he also believes that the government can't do much to offset the hostility that popular products like "Baywatch" or Britney Spears videos can provoke. "Efforts to balance the scene by supporting exports of American high culture -- libraries and art exhibits -- are at best a useful palliative," Professor Nye said. 
To be sure, advocates of reviving American cultural diplomacy do not suggest that Washington merely trumpet the upper reaches of American artistic achievement. "We can't simply say we have great novelists and great architects," said the historian Richard Pells, author of "Not Like Us: How Europeans Have Loved, Hated and Transformed American Culture Since World War II."
"But we need to engage people abroad on why they feel uncomfortable when they encounter America in their own living rooms," Professor Pells said. "Many people interpret America in terms of its most visible artifacts -- the Golden Arches or Mickey Mouse. American cultural diplomacy could demystify these artifacts and engage in a dialogue on why they're so popular."

HEADLINE: Calling in Europe 

 BODY:
To the Editor: "More Overseas Choices for Cellphone Users" (Travel Advisory, March 31) omits what may be the most economical plan: do as the Europeans do and simply purchase a phone from one of the many phone stores that dot European cities.
 The reason it's cheaper: there are no contracts to sign; you simply buy a phone and as many minutes as you'd like to use. 
Even better (unless you're roaming in another country), there are no airtime charges for incoming calls, whether they originate next door or overseas. 
 In Ireland last July, I bought a Speakeasy phone for the equivalent of $55, which included a $34 credit for calls (local calls are charged at 60 cents a minute daytime and 20 cents a minute evening and weekend).
In conjunction with the phone I also chose an international calling option of $23 for about 40 minutes of calls to the United States).
I can use this same phone anywhere in Europe (and in several other places as well, including Canada), although at a pricey, out-of-Ireland roaming charge of $1.75 per minute for outgoing calls and $1.20 for incoming calls.

HEADLINE: ART; 
Bold Enigma, From Varied Themes

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
"UN in the U.S." is the 146th exhibition in the Wadsworth Atheneum's showcase for innovative contemporary art known as Matrix.
 Most Matrix shows feature a single artist, but this one, which is headier than most, is a collaboration between a Dutch architect, Ben van Berkel, and an art historian, Caroline Bos. 
 UN stands for United Network, the name of their partnership, which began in 1988. Its mission is to recognize all of the factors that go into the practice of architecture; while designers and technologists are indispensable, "clients, investors and users" are also essential. 
This outlook is brought down from the theoretical level to a visual one for specific projects through a series of large "high resolution photographic prints on polyester cloth." 
The pair applied their way of thinking to their installation here, and decided that a classical museum look was best. The large, bold yet enigmatic pictures, which evidently are realized after a long time, are certainly seductive. "Work," whose dates are 1997-2002, features mannequins who look very feminine but also like automatons on an assembly line. "The Bridge Master's View" (1995-2002) is a cage-like structure under a romantic sky. "Exhibitions" (1995-2002) is a reminder that a contemporary museum exhibition involves works of art, but that fashion and glamour are nearby. 
Although the works are very clear and intriguing visually, they need explanation, or at least some background. These are provided in a brochure by Nicholas Baume, the museum's curator of contemporary art, who is responsible for Matrix. In explaining the function of UN Studio, Mr. Baume invokes the concept of "deep planning," which means taking into account "infrastructure, urbanism, economics and program."
An intended consequence of this way of working is to thwart the star system in which the architect reigns supreme. Yet it seems that anarchy and chaos might result if someone is not at the head. 
UN studio has taken care of this through another practice called "coherence." Mr. Baume uses collage as a model; its essence is that disparate elements are juxtaposed to become a whole.
The name of the practice, United Network, might seem to be a redundancy at first. Any network, if working right, is united. 
Mr. van Berkel and Ms. Bos perhaps want to emphasize the hoped-for absolute seamlessness of their concepts. 
Mr. van Berkel and Ms. Bos are more than visionaries. They are builders, their most famous project being the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, with its striking profile. 
Although asymetrical, it has been called swanlike.
One reason that UN studio is featured in Matrix is that the studio has been commissioned by the Wadsworth Atheneum to produce a plan for the museum's planned renovation, coherently linking a complex of historic but disparate buildings. 
"UN in the U.S." is at the Wadsworth Atheneum through April 28. Information: (860) 278-2670

HEADLINE: Q. & A.; 
A Tenant and a Rent Overcharge

 BODY:
 Q. I live in a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan. The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal recently revoked a rent increase for all rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments in my building. The state agency also ordered the landlord to repay an overcharge to those tenants within one month of the division's order. Although three months have elapsed since the order, the landlord has neither adjusted the rent nor returned the overcharge. Since the order, I have been paying the reduced rent, but the landlord continues to bill me at the higher rate and counts my deductions as arrears on my rent statement. Am I within my legal rights to pay the reduced rent? Can I deduct the full amount of the overcharge the landlord was ordered by the agency to repay? . . . Jacqueline Ancess, Manhattan.

A. Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan tenant lawyer, said it appears that the letter writer is entitled to pay the reduced rent and to deduct the overcharge. "She should be cautious in doing so, however, because the landlord might be appealing the decision," Ms. McGuire said. She explained that when an order is issued by the rent administrator after the first stage of a Division of Housing and Community Renewal proceeding, the landlord has 35 days to file a petition for administrative review.
 "Since three months have already elapsed, it is likely that there has not been an appeal filed by the landlord,' Ms. McGuire said. "But the tenant should confirm this with the state agency." (The agency's Office of Rent Administration can be reached at (718) 739-6400.)
If it turns out that the landlord has filed an appeal, Ms. McGuire said, and the decision is reversed, the tenant would likely be responsible for any rent or overcharges that had been deducted. As a result, Ms. McGuire said, if an appeal has been filed and the letter writer continues to deduct amounts from her rent, it would be wise to set aside the money until the matter is resolved.
She added that if the rent reduction was ordered because of violations at the property, and the landlord makes the necessary repairs, it is likely he will apply for a rent restoration order. 
If the agency grants the landlord's application, Ms. McGuire said, it will restore the rent retroactively to the date of the application. So, she said, once the letter writer receives a copy of the application, the letter writer should set aside the difference between the reduced rent and the legal rent so the money is available.

Paying Interest On Escrow Accounts

Q. Before last year, the mortgage on my condominium was held by a large New York-based bank. Each year, the bank paid a small amount of interest on the money it held in escrow to pay my property taxes. Last year, the bank sold my mortgage to another large bank, in Wichita, Kan. That bank now tells me that it does not pay interest on mortgage escrow accounts. Is the bank required to pay interest on the money it is holding in escrow? . . . Raymond W. Townsend, Manhattan.

A. Joel E. Abramson, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that under Section 5-601 of New York State's General Obligations Law, banks that are subject to the state's Banking Department -- basically, any bank licensed to do business in the state -- are required to pay interest on escrow accounts. "The banking board sets the interest rate," he said. "The current rate is 2 percent per year."
Mr. Abramson said that even though the holder of the letter writer's mortgage is based in Kansas, there is a good possibility that the bank is subject to New York State's Banking Department since many large lenders are licensed in New York. If, however, the new lender is not subject to the New York Banking Department, it would not be required to pay interest on escrow accounts. 
The letter writer can determine whether the new lender is licensed in New York by contacting the department at (800) 522-3330.

HEADLINE: Boatmen Fear New Federal Catch Limits 

BYLINE:  By STUART MARKUS 

 BODY:
WHEN the members of the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council met in Montauk for three days last month, they passed routine resolutions about the management of flounder, scup and squid from Long Island to North Carolina, but their minds were really focused on Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine. 
 At issue is a proposal by the National Marine Fisheries Service to impose even tighter restrictions on the boats that fish for cod, haddock and hake off the New England coast. Long Island fishermen fear that a clampdown there will push more boats southward to the waters off New York and New Jersey, putting pressure on fish stocks and competing with a local industry still recovering from years of low catches and lost jobs. 
 "There'd be an exodus from New England for a lot of boats to our waters," said Bill Grimm, 49, a fishing boat owner and a partner in Montauk Inlet Seafood, which transfers fish to wholesalers and processors. The company says it is the largest such operation in New York. 
The Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council is one of eight regional councils -- each state gets three representatives -- that advise the National Marine Fisheries Service on setting policy. The federal agency's proposal would limit boats with groundfish permits -- a category that includes cod, haddock, fluke, flounder and sole -- to 11 days at sea from May through July. During that period, each day at sea would count twice against the annual limit of 88 days. In the Gulf of Maine, the restrictions would extend from May through October.
The federal permits cover the area from three to 200 miles off the coast. Fishing inside the three-mile limit is regulated by the states.
The proposed federal limits stem from a 1999 lawsuit by several environmental groups, including the Conservation Law Foundation, Ocean Conservancy, Oceana, National Resource Defense Council and National Audubon Society. The plaintiffs contend that the fisheries service has not adequately enforced the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation Act of 1996, which set target population levels for dozens of species and a time frame for reaching them. Lax enforcement, the environmentalists charge, has kept the fish populations from rebounding as much as they should.
Judge Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court in Washington agreed in December, prompting both sides to propose tighter restrictions. Five days of mediation ended Tuesday without agreement. The judge has given the parties until tomorrow to file additional briefs and has indicated that she expects to rule in the case by May 1, the beginning of the fishing year and the starting point for counting days at sea.
Sema Freierman, 49, the general manager of Montauk Inlet Seafood and a member of the State Department of Environmental Conservation's Marine Regional Advisory Council, said: "What's happening is, these enviro-glomerates are putting their feet to the fire. They haven't seen this many codfish in 7 to 10 years, yet they're taking away people's days at sea."
While acknowledging that some species still need stringent protection, she accused the environmentalists of playing a "numbers-crunching game" that does not acknowledge that fish populations are generally increasing or that fishermen need to make a living.
If catches are limited for groundfish, then trawlers may turn to other species. "They will have no choice but to hit on some of the mid-Atlantic species that they might not bother with," Ms. Freierman said. Many boats that fish the New England waters have mid-Atlantic permits that they don't usually use, she said.
Mr. Grimm, the boat owner, noted that seven years ago, groundfishing days at sea were cut from 250 to 88. "The overfishing problem has really been taken care of," he said. "There's a tremendous amount of fish around."
In 2001, 69,200 metric tons of groundfish were caught off New England, more than twice the 32,600 metric tons caught in 1998.
Anthony Chatwin, a marine scientist with the Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, acknowledged that some species have rebounded significantly, but he said said that cod was not one of them. He contends that the cod population is still only a third of what it should be and that the populations of white hake, American plaice and redfish, also known as ocean perch, are also severely depressed.
Douglas Hopkins, the senior lawyer in Environmental Defense's Boston office and a member of the New England Fisheries Management Council, is concerned about what could happen if all the boats with groundfishing permits actually fished as much as their permits allow. He said that 1,700 boats in New England have permits with nearly 150,000 days at sea available; of these, about 65,000 were used in 2000. 
"That's just not sustainable," Dr. Chatwin said. He put the sustainable figure at 45,000 days at sea. 
Long Island has 261 boats with permits to fish in federally regulated waters, and of these only 172 actively fished in 2001. The government is not issuing any new permits. The permits, which were free, were issued to particular boats, not to individuals, and they remain with the boat when it is sold.
A recent $10 million federal buy-back program induced 245 boat owners to give up their permits. The government accepted bids ranging from $1,400 to $127,000.
Dr. Chatwin agreed that if the New England boats come to local waters, local fishermen and fish populations could be hurt. "I think that's a very legitimate concern, and I think that's a problem with the government's proposal," he said. 
Teri Frady, a spokeswoman for the fisheries service, said she could not speculate about how many New England boat owners might sail southward to Long Island. "It's like 1,700 small businesses," she said. "That the potential is there is certainly correct, but it's hard to estimate for whom it's going to be a good business decision."
Mr. Grimm and Ms. Freierman also questioned the federal agency's estimates for fish populations. Research boats haul nets like the ones commercial fishermen use, and by counting the number and kinds of fish they catch, government scientists come up with the estimates of fish populations that are used to adjust quotas and fishing seasons. In side-by-side tests in March and September last year using commercial and research boats, Mr. Grimm said, "what they come up with in their nets is nowhere near what we come up with," suggesting that fish populations are higher than government estimates.
Ms. Frady acknowledged the discrepancies, but said the research boats used the same equipment they started with in 1963, for comparison purposes. In gauging populations, the agency looks at the ages and sizes of the fish, along with evidence of reproductive activity and total commercial and recreational hauls. 
Dr. Chatwin said, "We would expect commercial vessels to catch more fish than the research vessels because they use more efficient equipment." 
But local fishermen have environmentalists on their side, too. Emerson Hasbrouk, a specialist with the Cornell Cooperative Extension's Fisheries and Marine Environmental Issues program in Southold, said the 1996 law sets unrealistic goals, because maximum sustainable yields are listed for all species. "You can't have both predator and prey at maximum levels," he said. 
The Magnuson-Stevens law also requires the fisheries service to consider the economic impact of regulations, and that, he says, has taken a back seat to population figures. 
Anthony DiLernio, a professor of marine technology at Kingsborough Community College and a member of the mid-Atlantic council, said the proposed restrictions could prompt some fishermen to avoid the double-counted days from May through July, pushing their working season into the winter. And that, he contends, would violate a clause in the law that calls for the promotion of safety at sea. "While the environmental community was well intentioned," he said, "it appears they're being inflexible in their resolution."

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE; 
Wanted: Nurses. Benefits? Just Ask.

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
SIGNING bonuses. Flex time. Tuition benefits and scholarships. 
Are these enticements from Fortune 500 corporations for prospective new hires?
 No, these lures are for nurses. 
 With a dearth of professional nurses in the wards, as well as student nurses in the pipeline, small wonder that hospitals, nursing homes and nursing schools are seeking ways to recruit and retain prospects. 
Whether it's dangling financial incentives to recent and prospective nursing school graduates, sending recruiters into middle and high schools to entice more students to consider nursing or redesigning career-changing programs, various organizations in the county are doing what they can to cope with the nursing shortage.
Enrollment in registered nursing school programs declined by 4.6 percent in the fall of 1999, representing the fifth consecutive decline in as many years, according to a report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
Recently, White Plains Hospital began the White Plains Hospital Center Nursing Award program, an incentive aimed at attracting nurses. Under the program, $55,000 in scholarships have been made available to 11 nursing students and graduates from Westchester Community College who promise to join the hospital's staff. The hospital's goal is to develop a million-dollar scholarship fund that will ultimately sponsor 20 to 25 students annually. The award program will give $5,000 for up to two years. Each recipient agrees to work for the hospital for one year for each year of aid. 
Florence Younkin, vice president for nursing at White Plains Hospital Center, said: "There are not enough nursing school graduates to fill all the openings that Westchester hospitals have. Last year, there were 200 graduates from all the Westchester nursing programs. One hospital could have taken all the graduates." 
Among the scholarship recipients is Catherine Latson, a mother of two, who said she was attracted to nursing after working as an emergency medical technician. 
"When I was on the ambulance, I missed the patient contact, and what happened to the people afterward," she said about her decision to return to school to get a nursing degree. She had earned a bachelor's degree in biology and art from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., and had spent more than 20 years as a scenic artist painting backgrounds for sets in films and television. 
Tina Dubose-O'Hagan, a former social worker and the mother of a 14-year-old and a 3-year-old, said: "I borrowed for this semester, and charged my books on my credit card. My husband and I talked about it. We decided the sacrifice was worth it. But the scholarship helps, and it eases my mind about having a job and not getting stuck." 
Frustrated with working environments or lured by opportunities in pharmaceuticals or insurance, increasing numbers of registered nurses have left the field. Those who have remained are getting older; the average age is now 45. 
"The demands and responsibility have increased, and the numbers of patients who are more ill have increased," said Dr. Kathleen Dirschel, director of the Cochran Nursing School and vice president of education at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers. "Nurses stay at the bedside more. They now need to have skills in care, organization, teaching, management and computers." 
Few expect a short-term solution to a problem that has been in the making for more than a decade. 
"During the 1990's, with managed care and consolidation, and more focus on the bottom line, nurses were forced to do more while support services were cut back," Mark Genovese, a spokesman for the New York State Nurses Association. "Nurses were leaving the profession. The hospitals were trying to squeeze more out of their nursing staff. Now some hospitals are doing recruitment, but that's only half of it. They have to make it worthwhile for the nurses." 
At a career fair last month at Pace University in Pleasantville, recruiters from more than 60 employers including the military, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, psychiatric centers, assisted living residences and local and tri-state hospitals often seemed to outnumber the prospects. 
Recruiters offered T-shirts, tote bags and coffee mugs along with bulging information packets. 
The situation is starting to improve slightly, with a 30 percent increase in applications reported for next year at both the Lienhard School of Nursing at Pace and the Cochran Nursing School at St. John's Riverside Hospital. The Lienhard School has expanded its career-changers program so that students with a bachelor's degree can earn a nursing degree in one year. 
With starting salaries in the mid-$50,000 range for registered nurses at top Manhattan medical centers and from $43,000 to $46,000 at hospitals in Westchester and Rockland Counties, the field is attracting people from other occupations, especially in areas hit by the economic slowdown. 
"We were losing ground for a couple of years there," said Dr. Donna Demarest, dean of the School of Nursing at the College of New Rochelle. "Last year, we stopped the decline. For fall of 2001, we had a class of 22 freshmen. For next year, our applicant pool has doubled. We would be very happy with a freshman class of 40.
"We're finding there's heavy recruitment of our seniors," she added. "The community used to reserve recruitment to those who had experience, but now they're willing to work with brand-new graduates. It's definitely the graduates' market."

HEADLINE: 2001 Manhattan Condominium Market; 
Fewer Sales, Higher Prices

 BODY:
The median price per square foot of the 3,739 condominium apartments that were sold in Manhattan rose 17 percent last year, according to the annual report of the Real Estate Board of New York. The median price per square foot of a prewar unit rose to $590 in 2001 from $503 in 2000, while the postwar-unit median price increased to $600 from $511. 
 The median square footage for a prewar condo sold last year was 5 percent higher than the previous year, at 1,135 square feet, and for a postwar condo was up 7 percent, at 877. 
 According to Gregory Heym, the chief economist of the Real Estate Board, the median sales price last year for a two-bedroom prewar condo was $817,500, compared with $668,250 in 2000, while that for a two-bedroom postwar condo was $885,000, compared with $750,000 in 2000.
The terrorist attacks hurt sales somewhat, at least south of 42nd Street, the report said, and the vast majority of the year's sales were completed by Sept. 11. The 23 percent fall in the number of prewar apartments sold and the 15 percent drop in the sale of postwar condos were largely attributed to the recession and the scarcity of available condos. Sales of prewar condos fell to 1,071 last year from 1,399 in 2000, while sales of postwar apartments totaled 2,668, down from 3,140 in 2000.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
A Project for Active Adults Near the Fairfield Border

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THIRTY years ago, Dr. James Mooney bought 635 acres of land on Riggs Street in the town of Oxford. "Real estate was booming with corporate headquarters and we thought we could get some of that," he said. "We got a zone change from residential to industrial, ran ads and had multiple brokers. We got a few bites, but people wanted to be in Fairfield County."
 Until five years ago, the property was a haven for snowmobilers, hunters and horseback riders. Dr. Mooney was semiretired and anxious to be rid of it. "We came up with the idea of an over-55 community with a golf course," he said. "Two-thirds of property taxes goes for education, so by eliminating children under 18 we created a situation that was good for everybody -- and the town went for it." 
 The zoning was changed to allow a planned residential golf community and approved by town boards and commissions, at which point Dr. Mooney contracted to sell the land and concept to Andrew Tedford, Robert Smith and Phil Craft, principals in Timberlake Development Partners L.L.C. of Milford. 
This fall, the new partners will break ground for the Oxford Greens Estates and Golf Club, a $150 million gated community of 400 homes for active adults age 55 and older, and an 18-hole golf course designed by Cornish, Silva & Mungeam. The project will cover half of the property, leaving the rest as open space.
Children will not be permitted except as visitors or on college breaks. One person in the household must be 55 or older, but 20 percent of the homes can be occupied by people 40 and older.
"We saw an unfulfilled niche," Mr. Tedford said, "to build housing for active adult baby boomers in Fairfield County, where a portion of the 13 percent population growth in Oxford was coming from. Maybe not Greenwich, but from Fairfield towns and greater New Haven."
The development's two-bedroom, two-bath homes with ground-floor master bedrooms are expected to sell for $300,000 to $400,000, and the 18-hole, par-72 golf course will be open to the public, but residents will have preferred access. A heated outdoor pool and tennis courts will be built, and a fitness center and indoor pool and spa will be housed in an 11,000-square-foot community building, accessible only to homeowners. The golf clubhouse will have a pro shop, lockers and dining room. 
Four models of homes will range from 1,754 to 2,645 square feet, with eat-in kitchens, laundry rooms, separate dining rooms, cathedral-ceilinged great rooms, two-car garages and front porches. Two additional bedrooms and one additional bath are optional in lofts, second stories or walkout basements. 
The first of four phases of construction will include models and 100 homes to be completed in the spring of 2003. The golf course is to be finished in 2004. Residents will own their houses, but lawns and all common areas will be owned and maintained by a homeowners' association.
Active adult communities are a growing segment of housing for older people who are not necessarily retired but want a relaxed, semiresort style of living. According to Myril Axelrod, president of Marketing Directions of New Fairfield, "the concept is flourishing because so many people are rattling around in large homes with children grown and gone; they are isolated in their own communities where young families have replaced former neighbors. 
"The reality of assisted living is living with people who are in much worse shape than you are. One gentleman who moved into an assisted living complex told me he was the only one not on a walker. There is a sense of the end of life."
Joanne Carroll, president of the Fairfield County Home Builders Association, added: "It is true that people don't like combining active and assisted living. A lot of boomers who turned 55 last year feel that assisted living is an institutional environment."
But Jon Spooner, public relations manager for Athena Communities, which has eight assisted living and continuing care complexes in Connecticut, out of about 55 statewide, said, "We have many active adults needing no assistance and we haven't gotten any feedback on people feeling uncomfortable about being with others who are less active."
About 20 active adult communities exist in the state, ranging from modular home complexes where prices are $70,000 to $150,000 to luxury projects in Farmington, Cromwell, West Hartford and Milford, priced at $300,000 to $700,000. According to Ms. Axelrod, the industry is recognizing that the rush to the Sun Belt, where most of the country's active adult communities were built, failed to consider the fact that people from 55 to 64 are probably still working and want to be near friends and relatives.
"There are 314,000 people in the state in that age group," said Paul Emrath, assistant vice president for housing research at the National Association of Home Builders, "and only about 6.7 percent move in a given year. Three-fourths move within the state, and half within the county. You need to build something attractive enough to get them away from what is probably a very nice situation."
IN terms of location, Oxford is something of a wild card -- a bit remote from shopping and cultural activities. As one of the Naugatuck Valley towns, Oxford -- like Waterbury, Seymour, Naugatuck, Derby and Ansonia -- was once part of the industrial engine of the state. When industry fled south, the valley fell into deep decline in the 1960's. "The valley is still very blue collar," Ms. Carroll said. "Towns like Oxford carry that connotation."
Mr. Tedford disagrees. "The demographics do not support the concept of Oxford being a blue-collar town," he said. Indeed, Oxford's estimated median income for 1997, supplied by Queens College, was $70,236, up from $56,966 in 1990, and currently higher than neighboring, upwardly mobile Southbury with $62,110.
Moreover, Oxford's prevailing house prices in the $300,000's to mid-$400,000's cannot be classified as blue collar. 
Southbury and Oxford, bordering Fairfield County, and Middlebury, adjacent to Litchfield County, have been luring developers with their open land, lower construction costs and ease of east-west travel on Interstate 84 and north-south travel on Route 8. "A lot of builders are moving up here from Fairfield because they are running out of land," said Lisa Giordano, sales manager of the William Pitt Real Estate office in Southbury. 
Leslie Marks, executive director of the National Council on Senior Housing, an affiliate of the National Association of Home Builders, said: "People who buy active adult housing have money, they are healthy and they know what they want. It's our area of expertise, because that's what our builders do -- single-family homes. Assisted living is not what we focus on."
Ruth Murphy, owner of Murphy Real Estate in Southbury, says prices in the region had increased markedly since 1998. "Most of what's available is brand new and we are seeing people who live or work in Fairfield County come here because it's more affordable. We have almost no starter homes anymore -- anything around $130,000 has disappeared."
David Robinson Sr., chairman of Oxford's Planning and Zoning Commission, said: "The town has changed drastically from 10 years ago. We had a population of about 7,500, now it's close to 10,000. Houses that cost $250,000 in the mid-80's cost in the high $300,000's today. Two houses have been built here for between $3 million and $10 million. There's talk about extending natural gas lines and increasing the minimum lot size from one and a half acres to two acres." 
Since it was first settled in 1678 as part of Derby, Oxford was home to produce and sheep farmers, grist mill and saw mill operators and later small industries. Today, it is a sparsely populated community of 33 square miles that include a volunteer fire department, a police department of three resident state troopers and six officers (two work part time), several parks, the Waterbury-Oxford Airport, a combined Town Hall and Public Library, and organizations like the Oxford Grange, Oxford Historical Society, Horse and Livestock Association, Horseshoe Club and a local newspaper called Voices.
Most people in town are optimistic that Oxford Greens Estates will be beneficial. Joseph Andreana, executive director of the Oxford Economic Development Corporation, said: "I think everyone views it as a win-win situation. It will provide tax revenues and the kind of amenities that will bring in the kind of people we want.
"What has fueled our growth to date has been small businesses. We have about 2,500 acres of industrial-zoned land and we welcome development proposals. Industrial growth will keep residential taxes in balance and help the town build a new library, a new senior center and a high school Oxford students attend Seymour High School . I think it's safe to assume that we are going to see the same level of growth over the next 10 years."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Makes, the World Takes 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

 BODY:
FROM the docks in Elizabeth and Camden, from cargo flights out of Newark International Airport and on rails extending to Canada and Mexico, New Jersey is extending its reach far into the global economy.
 Blueberry wine to Tokyo and cranberry juice to the Caribbean. Typhoid tests to Bangladesh. Valves for rocket launchers and fiber-optic switches for Europe. For that matter, the world's entire supply of Calvin Klein cologne is exported from Mount Olive. 
 While New Jersey is typically viewed as a state of bedroom communities and shopping malls, it is every bit a major player in the international economy, supporting an estimated 600,000 jobs with global trade. 
It is not difficult to see why, when the state is situated on the Atlantic coast, with its well-developed ports and air cargo facilities, making it a convenient launching pad into overseas markets.
The numbers tell much of the story. For instance, New Jersey ranks eighth among states in the dollar value of its exports at $25.93 billion in 2001, according to data provided by the United States Commerce Department. To be sure, a strong dollar and a sluggish economy overseas drove exports down 9.88 percent in 2001 after a major boom in the late 1990's. But that was after a 36.9 percent increase in 2000 from $21 billion in 1999.
"It's clear that New Jersey is a powerhouse when it comes to international business and international trade," said Joe Gonzalez, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. 
The state's leading exports last year were chemicals and pharmaceuticals with $7.22 billion in sales, followed by computers and electronic equipment valued at $5.97 billion.
Canada, the state's largest foreign market, received $4.21 billion in New Jersey exports last year. It was followed by Japan with $2.27 billion and Mexico with $2.19 billion.
"New Jersey's economy is more closely tied to the global economy than most states, both as a pass-through and in production," said Gus Faucher, senior economist at Economy.com, an economic forecasting company in West Chester, Pa. "These places employ a lot of folks even if it is just taking production from other states and exporting overseas."
And the numbers keep telling the story. For example, wholesale trade now accounts for 7.1 percent of all employment in the state as against 5.3 percent nationwide, Mr. Faucher said.
"We had a slump in 2001 which reflects the U.S. recession and the fact that our chief trading partners have been in a recession," said George Nagle, secretary of the state's Council of Economic Advisors. "We had a coordinated slowdown around the world and our numbers did slide, but New Jersey production probably didn't drop as much as it would if we didn't have that international trade."
New Jersey also has a place in the global economy as host to foreign companies that have based their United States headquarters or manufacturing operations in the state. Foreign companies invested $35.3 billion in plants, equipment and offices in New Jersey as of 1999, making it, again, eighth among the states. Germany and Japan were tied with 16.5 percent each of the state's total foreign investment followed by Switzerland with 13.2 percent.

Foreign Investment Is Slowing
Mr. Gonzalez spelled it out this way: There are 1,300 companies from 40 countries doing business in New Jersey, with more than 245,000 jobs being supported by foreign investment in 1999.
Moreover, foreign investment usually represents cutting-edge industry that sells at a premium price, supporting high-end jobs. "You're not going to make an investment half-way around the world unless you've got a product that is technologically advanced," said Mr. Nagle.
Still, foreign investment in the state is slowing, he cautioned, in part as a result to the creation of trading blocs in Europe, Latin America and North America that have brought down trade barriers around the world.
"Everybody is rethinking where they should be and how they're going to access different markets," Mr. Nagle said. 
The way it was explained by Axel Velden, chairman of the New Jersey District Export Council, who retired 18 months ago as director of the export division at Johnson & Johnson, trading blocs were transforming export patterns.
Mr. Velden said Johnson & Johnson now exported less raw material from the United States because production that was once split among many countries to make the best of trade and tariff rules had been consolidated. In the meantime, that consolidation created enough volume to support the development of local suppliers.
"We used to ship chemicals to Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile because they all manufactured locally," he said. "Now with a common market, a major part of that has gone away."
Nonetheless, high-end products are still made in the United States, he said, including sutures in Somerville.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Velden said that some goods once made in Mexico and Canada because of import rules and duties were now being manufactured in the United States. But some labor-intensive products like medical supplies were being made in Mexico and shipped back to the United States for sterilization and distribution.
On the other hand, China's entry in the World Trade Organization has yet to have much effect, said Mr. Faucher.
"People tend to oversell the benefits of free trade with China," he said. "It's still very much a developing economy."
While the state is still home to large multinational corporations, those operations are increasingly focused on research or administrative work. For now, the core of New Jersey's export growth is among small to mid-sized companies, many of which were founded by refugees from the state's business giants who have found specialized markets in every corner of the world.
Indeed, Mr. Gonzalez said that with the Internet, smaller companies now have better access to information about global markets and are often faster to seize opportunities than larger companies.
"It's all in these niches," said Mr. Gonzalez. "These are smart people, who may have started working for Allied Signal or American Cyanamid where they got a fix on a product. There are so many of these small companies, 100 or 150 employees. It adds up."
Michael Katz first traveled outside the United States in the 1970's when he was working for a large medical diagnostics company that was branching into Europe through a joint venture in Finland.
"What quickly came to my eye was that that the pastoral image of Europe was a tourist image, never a business image," Mr. Katz said. "These companies were roaring. These were business people with traits developed over centuries. They were adept at selling products from anywhere in the world. I had my eyes opened."

Exporting Goods and Services
In 1981 he struck out on his own, founding Cenogenics, a manufacturer and distributor of medical tests for everything from pregnancy to arthritis, to strep and colon cancer. 
In 1990, Cenogenics, in Morganville, was named the National Exporter of the Year by the Small Business Administration.
Today, exports make up 63 percent of company sales, Mr. Katz said, though competition from abroad is forcing the company to focus more on the domestic market.
"The margins are dropping in export markets,"he said. "The competition is intense right now, and the prices are being driven down very hard."
Beyond the export of hard goods, the state also is a major exporter of services. For example, it is home to several large engineering and construction companies that have evolved from building roads to power plants to high-tech production plants for companies around the world.
The state's experience with hazardous waste and Superfund remediation has also made it a leader in the export of environmental consulting, a business that began to take off in developing countries in the 1990's, said Derish Wolff, chairman of Louis Berger Group in East Orange.
Mr. Wolff said that Louis Berger, which began working overseas in the 1950's as an engineering firm, now brings in a third of its overseas revenue from such services as design and consulting.
"A lot of what is happening in construction is on the soft side," said Mr. Wolff. "To build a clean room for Intel is not that expensive, but it is very hard to design these things, and California and New Jersey do it very well."
Mr. Wolff said the company had also evolved from building roads to building societies. For example, it is to develop poverty programs and other economic assistance plans on contract for governments and development agencies. The company has done this work in Peru, Russia, and Macedonia recently. Louis Berger was an advisor to the pre-Taliban government in Afghanistan, and in January the company announced it was reopening a Kabul office with a new contract for the Asian Development Bank.
He recalled New Jersey's reach into Lebanon in the mid-1980's when he and members of his company were working on a reconstruction plan for the war-torn country. They came under shelling from the battleship New Jersey and were evacuated to Cyprus by the troop ship Trenton.
Military might aside, Mr. Wolff said that New Jersey's stature as a research-intensive state also makes it a breeding ground for new niche products that can be sold globally.
"The state is perceived by people in other countries as a place where important things happen," he said.
But the might of the American dollar has become a major obstacle to exporters, said Tom Schaefer, vice president of sales and marketing at Hatco Corp. in Fords, which makes esters used in windshields and in high-performance lubricants. For instance, Mr. Schaefer said 60 percent of the world's jet engines used Hatco lubricants.
"It's been very difficult in recent years because of the strong dollar," he said. "We've held our own, but growth has been difficult."
Mr. Schaefer said to get around that problem, the company had formed a joint venture with a German chemical-maker, Celanese AG, to build a new ester plant in Germany.
He said that while the new plant would not lead to less production in Fords, it would siphon off expansion that might otherwise have occurred in New Jersey.
Still, overseas markets also can provide comfort during a downturn at home.
"If you look at the U.S. telecom industry, it's going through a very difficult time at the moment, and that's not as true in other parts of the world," said Harry Carr, chief executive of Tellium Inc., a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment in Oceanport with 540 employees.
Mr. Carr said Tellium's goal was to go global when it was founded five years ago by optical networking experts from Bell Communications Research. The company's target customers are the 25 largest carriers in the world, most of whom are oveseas.
"In telecom you have to understand that to be a significant player you can't just be U.S.-based," he said.
The state's high-tech exporters are also facing strict regulations on the transfer of technology because of security concerns on the part of the government officials, said Tom Marotta, chief executive of Marotta Scientific Controls -- a family-controlled company with 200 workers in Montville -- which makes complex control valves used on satellite rocket launchers and in defense on ships and submarines.
"The whole high-tech industry here has been slowed down by the amount of scrutiny we're getting," said Mr. Marotta. He said the government intensified its scrutiny even before Sept. 11 -- near the end of the Clinton administration -- primarily out of concern over China.
Mr. Marotta said that despite its size, the company was not at a disadvantage when competing with multinational corporations. "We can operate more quickly. We have more innovative people and we're stronger in our niche markets. We're clear on where we're going."
Many New Jersey exporters rely heavily on relationships with distributors and importers to shepherd their products into foreign lands.
Charles Tomasello, president of the Tomasello Winery in Hammonton, said his company began exporting blueberry and other fruit wines to Japan four years ago when Japanese consumers became obsessed with the health benefits of blueberries. The winery now ships several thousand cases of wine a year to Tokyo. 
"It's absolutely, definitely a niche," said Mr. Tomasello. "That's the key. It's such an obscure little niche you find clientele that are very interested in it."
In addition, Mr. Tomasello said that the fruit wines seemed to blend into Asian cooking styles. 
"Culture is always an issue," he said. "Your ultimate consumer in those countries has to be able to make your product fit into their cooking, lifestyle and cultural perception of taste. A lot of times our perception of what the level of sweetness should be is one thing and our importer's view is another. Consequently we defer to their judgment because they live there. You have to accept the fact that they have a better sense of the consumer."
With such current obstacles as the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, in the way of cracking foreign markets, exporters said they were concerned that state support for export programs was waning.
Mr. Katz, the medical tests exporter, said state programs in his early days in business led him to helpful federal programs and paid several hundred dollars for overseas medical trade shows that were crucial in connecting with new customers.
"If we had not been led to those markets when we had the bad economic conditions in the late 1980's and early 1990's," he said, "we would not have continued to grow. We would have been laying off people."

Tough Times Spur Business
But Mr. Katz said he was worried about the future. "If we're battling other companies in other states who are getting this kind of information, who's going to win? That is the dilemma New Jersey business has."
Mr. Velden, the chairman of the district export council, said last year the council supported six bills in the legislature aimed at export promotion, but all died.
"I think that what happens is when the economy is good people are not so interested in exporting because they can sell what they want here," he said. "But when times get tough and markets in the U.S. get tough, all of a sudden people are interested in export. I don't know if this recession has been long enough for that."
Rodney Stuart, director of the Trenton Export Assistance Center for the Commerce Department's commercial service, said New Jersey promotion budgets had been cut.
"Among the states with higher trade promotion budgets than New Jersey were Mississippi, Kansas and Iowa," Mr. Stuart said, noting that New Jersey fell behind 23 other states in export promotion.
Mr. Gonzalez said business people around the state were eager to see what direction the state's Commerce and Economic Growth Commission took under its new chief executive, William D. Watley.
"Right now it's still early on," said Karen Wolfe, a spokeswoman for the commission. "We'll be reviewing our strategies to make sure they're cost-effective and address New Jersey's business needs."
Mr. Stuart said the state has five Foreign Trade Zones, where businesses received certain tax and tariff breaks, but added that they played a small role in the state's export volume.
For now, he said the climate for export seemed to be improving.
"Since Sept. 11 we saw a noticeable decline, but since then it picked up dramatically, and I'd say we have seen many more requests for information from numerous companies that seem to have been successful."
Mr. Faucher, the economist, said most forecasts called for an improvement in the overall economic environment.
"The economy has slowed worldwide, but we're expecting to see a pickup toward the end of this year," he said. "That will help boost U.S. exports, and strong U.S. growth is going to spill over into New Jersey."

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
To Conquer Burnout, Think Smaller

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
IT was the defining moment of Mary Lou Quinlan's career: While in a taxi on her way to work two years ago, Ms. Quinlan, then chief executive of the N. W. Ayer ad agency in Manhattan, fantasized about breaking all her limbs in a traffic accident -- or at least a leg or two. "I thought to myself, 'Maybe if I jump in front of this cab, I can go the hospital and finally get some peace and quiet,' " she said.
 That dark thought jolted her out of the rat race. "After 20 years of manic working," she said, "I realized I had hit total burnout." 
 She received permission for a five-week sabbatical, and for the first time in two decades, she said, she felt like a human being again.
"For once, I was able to wake up and drink my morning coffee after the sun had already risen, instead of before," she said. "I began living life the way normal people do."
When the five weeks were up, she resigned from the agency, which had 500 employees, to start her own company, Just Ask a Woman, a low-key marketing company in Manhattan with a staff of a dozen. She says she has never looked back.
Ms. Quinlan is somewhat of a trend setter, career experts say. In the recently rocky economy, burnout among managers has been rising -- so much so that many have quit jobs without the slightest clue as to what they will do next.
A study by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm in Chicago, showed that more than 470 chief executives of major companies left their jobs in the first half of 2001, up 22 percent from a year earlier. Though poor performance can never be ruled out, many of the chiefs cited stress and burnout as reasons for their departures.
"The pressure managers feel to perform is higher than it's ever been," said William C. Byham, chief executive of Development Dimensions International, a human resources consulting firm in Pittsburgh. "It used to be that you'd have a couple of years to make mistakes before you were really under the gun. Now, you're under immediate pressure to show results."
George Ludwig remembers fretting that his days were numbered. As a national sales manager at Johnson & Johnson from 1992 to January of last year, he led a team of 35 people that specialized in advanced sterilization products. "There was enormous pressure for us to be successful," he said.
As the economy softened, Mr. Ludwig said, his fear that his team would not meet its sales goals kept him awake at night. Instead of waiting to be dismissed, he quit his job and became a motivational speaker and consultant. Based in Cary, Ill., he now advises managers from Fortune 500 companies on avoiding burnout by developing a social life outside work, creating outlets to unload pressure and, in some cases, pursuing less stressful careers.
David N. Rosen also escaped from the rat race. As the technical team leader of the technology consulting division at Oracle, he had been working for a year and a half on a project that required him to fly every week from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore.
Working through the night at the client's office early last year, he witnessed the emotional meltdown of a colleague at 2 a.m. The project was not going well, and the client had complained to Oracle's top management. The two men had a talk, and the colleague "basically had a nervous breakdown," Mr. Rosen said.
"He sank into the wall and began crying and saying he couldn't take it anymore," Mr. Rosen said. "All that was running through my mind was, 'This could be me soon.' "
Within days, Mr. Rosen persuaded his companion, Stacy Van Heusen, to leave her management position at an ad agency in Los Angeles and go with him to Italy. They spent five months drinking red wine, trolling farmers' markets and discussing their next career moves. They recently moved back to the Los Angeles area, set up a television production company, Stubs the Cat Productions, and have vowed never to return to work as executives at large companies.
"We were both washed up in our late 20's," said Ms. Van Heusen, 28, who worked 100-hour weeks creating campaigns for Levi Strauss. "We knew something had to change."
Taking a breather can help managers put their careers in perspective. Joseph R. Weintraub, an organizational psychologist and management professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., recommends that executives on the verge of burnout take a few weeks off before making any drastic moves. "Don't do anything intellectual," he said. "Relax, get some exercise and try to see things in a new light."
He also urged managers to do some soul-searching to make sure that the stress is not self-inflicted.
Such an exercise in introspection paid off for Nan Napier, president of Tres Mariposas, a clothing store in El Paso. She was thinking of dropping her 23-year career because of stress, but she examined her management style. "I realized nobody but me was making me work as hard as I was," she said, acknowledging that she often became bogged down in problems that one of her 25 employees could have handled easily.
Now Ms. Napier has taken a step back. "If there's a minor problem, I just walk out the door, gritting my teeth and hoping someone will fix it by the end of the day," she said. The tactic has given her more time at home with her two teenagers.
MANAGERS who change to more tranquil careers should be wary of falling back into old ways. Ms. Quinlan, the ad executive, realized that her inability to say no had also hurt her. "Now I say no a lot, and I have a lot more energy, which I use to garden instead of sitting in some meeting," she said.
Mr. Rosen and Ms. Van Heusen now force themselves to do yoga several mornings a week and to take weekends off.
"It took us a lot of personal upheaval to get where we are," he said. "We're not about to go back to being the maniacs we used to be."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
A Flood of Office Space Is Offered for Subleasing

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
SEPT. 11 continues to have a major effect on the New Jersey office market, in exactly the opposite way real-estate experts' instincts initially indicated.
 "There's a ton of sublet space out there now," said Ken Flynn Jr., a vice president of the commercial broker Trammell Crow, "as there has been since 9/11, when just about anything that was empty was put on the market." 
 A total of 13 million square feet of office space is available in north and central New Jersey -- 2 million square feet of that Class A space -- according to Cushman & Wakefield's first quarter report. Thirty-five percent of the space on the market is sublease space, whereas a year ago sublease space accounted for only 26 percent of the total available.
The sublease glut has helped to drive the overall vacancy rate to 18 percent or more in northern and central New Jersey, according to various quarterly reports. Cushman & Wakefield said that an increase of a full percentage point came in the first quarter of 2002. 
For larger Class A office spaces -- anything over 75,000 square feet -- the overall current vacancy rate is 17 percent, according to Robert Rudin, an Insignia/ESG managing director who represents corporate tenants seeking such blocks.
For direct leases, by comparison, the vacancy rate remains stable at 9 percent, various statistical sources agree. 
"What we have is continuing negative net absorption -- more sublease space coming on the market than is being taken up," Mr. Rudin said, "and that is a bad thing for landlords." In some prime spots, he noted, there is top-quality office space that has been sitting vacant for a year or more.
Given all this, some landlord representatives have moved to seize the bull by the horns, or perhaps wrestling a bear is the better metaphor under the circumstances. "It's now a tenant's market," Mr. Flynn said flatly, "and any landlord that isn't offering tenant incentives better start."
Mr. Flynn recently brokered the sublease of 30,400 square feet of space at the Basking Ridge Corporate Plaza One for the master tenant, United Health Care. Trammell Crow had taken over marketing the space -- and another chunk roughly the same size -- last August, three weeks before the terrorist attack on New York. 
The total 60,000 square feet of Class A space had been offered at $29 per square foot by the previous broker. But it had remained empty for more than six months. 
Then, the attack came, and there was a "thin wave" of subleasing to displaced New York City firms in New Jersey, as Mr. Flynn put it, and a huge wave of sublease space thrown on the market.
"Most companies put any space they could out to sublease after 9/11," Mr. Flynn said. "Some were truly altruistic and opened up any floor that was empty for New York companies that lost their space. Other decisions were based on practicality, as in, 'We need to downsize, and here's an opportunity.' "
In any case, Jersey City, directly across the river from the Financial District, had its vacancy rate plunge to nearly nil -- but mainly with short-term leases. The impact elsewhere in the region was scattered and slight, according to all quarterly real estate reports issued since.
By October, Trammell Crow advised United Health Care that if it really wanted to sublease the Basking Ridge space, it needed to pull out the stops.
"We told the landlord that you've got to price very aggressively in this situation," Mr. Flynn said. "We said you've got to be prepared to make aggressive concessions on the terms of lease."
Trammell Crow drew up a list of prospective tenants -- whether or not they had expressed interest in the property -- and drew up sublease proposals providing as many concessions as possible. "We directly solicited tenants with letters," he said. "We held open houses. We generated as much interest as we could."
BY February, the 30,400-square-foot space was leased for $22.50 per square foot, $6.50 per square foot less than had originally been asked. 
Furthermore, a 1 percent bonus fee was awarded to the broker who brought in the tenant, the One Beacon Insurance Company.
"This is what you need to do," Mr. Flynn said after the deal was struck, "if you want to sublease space." 
Other brokers do not go quite so far with their assessment, or their tactics. Some label this a "tenant favored" market or a "market on the precipice." Some say it's "almost" time to step out aggressively with price breaks; others say it is merely time to consider offering a few months' free rent with a long-term lease, not a lower rate.
Still others say the only concession they would support concerns "work orders" -- how much a landlord will absorb of the cost of custom-fitting an office for a sublease tenant. 
But there is not much room for interpretation about which way market trends are headed. In its first-quarter report, Grubb & Ellis says, "We are witnessing the direct impact of this recession on the northern and central New Jersey office market as corporate consolidations have resulted in rising availability." A total of about 900,000 square feet of space was put on the market in the first quarter of this year -- according to Cushman & Wakefield, and more is coming. Toys "R" Us is moving to consolidate its headquarters in the vacant former American Cyanamid building it purchased in Wayne, for example, and marketing its offices in Paramus.
Also, Pharmacia has reportedly agreed to purchase AT&T's former lavish headquarters in Basking Ridge (the asking price was $260 million). While the deal would take 2.7 million square feet out of the pool of unoccupied space, it would lead Pharmacia to sublet three more standard-size office spaces it currently occupies in Peapack, Bedminster and Bridgewater.
"Pharmacia will add another 800,000 square feet," said Daniel J. Tichio, a tenant's broker with Cresa Partners/New Jersey. "If that's not a wake-up call to landlords, nothing will be."
Mr. Tichio said he was already holding five requests from clients to put space on the sublease market before the Pharmacia-ATT negotiation became known last month.
In Parsippany and in the rest of Morris County generally, the office market problems are most acute. The vacancy rate in Parsippany stubbornly remains at 20 percent after the departure of several major companies in the past two years. The Staubach Company of New Jersey has been unable to sublease the "beautiful, barely used" office of Aventis, a pharmaceutical company, for 18 months, said a managing principal, Thomas J. Stanton III.
"When this kind of real estate sits empty," Mr. Stanton said, "there does come a time where ownership will say: if a deal comes, any kind of deal, I want to make it."
Next door in Morristown, the computer company Tycom is marketing both of its new headquarters buildings, one of which it occupies. "The headquarters turns out to be too large to suit Tycom's needs," Mr. Flynn said. "It's a situation where if the building Tycom is in gets rented first, Tycom will move out. You can do that in this market, because you can find a place to go."
He added that the Tycom rental is "a great deal for some tenant" because Tycom is offering its top-grade furniture as part of a lease package.
Some brokers are still not ready to go for broke. "I would say we're tending toward a tenants' market," Mr. Rudin said gingerly. "Everybody with vacant space right now certainly has an obstacle that has to be managed intelligently, but I'm not ready to say everyone has to offer concessions and price breaks yet."
Mr. Rudin said he was paying close attention to how the market goes in the next few months, as several large companies are known to be shopping for space.
"I think these next deals will determine the direction of the market," Mr. Rudin said. Meanwhile, he said, landlords who want to be aggressive have to follow their instincts. He quoted advice given to him by a mentor, the late Edward S. Gordon, who was ESG's founder.
"Always set your price six months out," he said. "Be proactive. Set it where you think it will be six months from now, and you'll be in business."

Reopen Fresh Kills: Brilliant or Boneheaded?

BYLINE:  By MARJORIE J. CLARKE; Marjorie J. Clarke is scientist in residence at Lehman College, the author of many articles on waste management and vice chairwoman of the Citywide Recycling Advisory Board.

 BODY:
New York's garbage disposal is in a mess. The cost of hauling trash to distant landfills is rising fast, and recycling is being reduced. Some have suggested reopening the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, at least until a better plan is devised. Two experts debate the issue: 
 THE city has lurched between hasty schemes to incinerate solid waste or export it. Now comes the idea of reopening Fresh Kills. Here's why it is ill advised. 
 Landfilling is the worst environmental alternative. Fresh Kills, unlike modern landfills, has no protective liner under it, which is why it annually contaminated ground water and wetlands with 1.5 billion gallons of toxic runoff and emitted more than 15 billion cubic feet of greenhouse and carcinogenic gases. Reopening it would require multiple liners, water and air quality controls and numerous permits and environmental reviews. Increasing the dump's height atop slippery liners could make it unstable.
Reduction of waste at the source, along with reuse, recycling and composting are the solutions favored by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the city's official citizens' advisory boards. The city has pursued these ideas halfheartedly, continually cutting important programs. Ten years ago, the city came close to building its own recycling plants and was developing local markets for the materials. But it awarded the opportunity to sort and market recyclable items to multinational conglomerates. The city could save tens of millions of dollars with approaches like setting up buy-back centers for recyclables in low-income areas, leaving grass clippings on lawns and offering economic incentives to encourage recycling and reduction of garbage.
Landfilling is a step backward. While the city wasted time and money on ill-conceived plans to export garbage, other cities achieved 50 percent recycling rates without breaking the bank. They collect and market recyclables efficiently. They buy products made of their recyclables. Cities like San Francisco compost food waste, which represents 15 percent of New York's garbage.
New Yorkers want to recycle. Even though the Mayor has proposed ending the city's container recycling program, a recent poll by Channel 11 showed that 84 percent of New Yorkers want the program to continue.
Staten Islanders pushed for the 1996 state law that mandated the closing of Fresh Kills, and they haven't changed their minds. Their feelings are understandable. For the city as a whole, instead of resorting to failed policies of the past, we should create a forward-looking system that is under our own control.

HEADLINE: It Is, for Deer, All Over but The Shooting 

BYLINE:  By JEREMY PEARCE 

DATELINE: BERNARDS TOWNSHIP 

 BODY:
TO shoot or not to shoot. That is no longer the question.
 In New Jersey's rich -- and deer-rich -- suburbs, the guns of winter are now silent, momentarily marking the end of a debate that has pitted neighbor against neighbor and drawn crowds to normally sleepy township meetings. 
 More and more suburbs are ignoring pleas from animal rights supporters and choosing instead to solve problems of shrubbery raids and deer-car collisions by hiring professional sharpshooters. The list of towns that have adopted this approach now includes Summit, Millburn, Bridgewater, Princeton, Scotch Plains, Springfield and Berkeley Heights. In addition, state wildlife officials say they have have fielded inquiries from another 30 towns. 
"They're grappling with these issues, but most townships see shooting as the most efficient and economical solution," said Susan Martka, a wildlife biologist who oversees New Jersey's Community-Based Deer Management Program, which was approved by state legislators two years ago.
Just last month, a state appeals court dismissed a challenge by antihunting groups to overturn the deer program, which sets guidelines for municipal deer hunts. In the past year alone, about 700 deer were shot in local culling programs. 
In Bernards Township, the conflict erupted into a colorful campaign with signs cropping up on front lawns like so many daisies protesting the culling of 93 deer in recent months. The Somerset County community shares a porous border with the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, normally closed to hunting and known to harbor deer herds. Opponents of hunting want local officials to consider nonlethal options of transporting deer or darting them with contraceptives.
"Just to shoot for the sake of getting rid of deer, that is a waste," said Al Rome, a Bernards resident who put out a series of protest signs.
For their part, township officials said they reviewed those options but found them impractical. Indeed, the notion of cutting deer numbers through contraception has been waning in academic circles. For the method to work, female deer must be darted two times in the first year of treatment and then once annually -- a task most scientists agree is close to impossible. Other contraceptives introduce chemicals that can harm if the deer is eaten by hunters. As a result, no deer contraceptive yet has won federal drug approval.
"Show me a bottle of the stuff that has F.D.A. approval and we will use it," said Bill Holmes, a member of the Bernards Township Committee who voted for hunting after counting 250 local accidents in the past year involving deer being hit by a vehicle. "Until that day, we're going to keep shooting."
Last week, Millburn ended a second year of deer controls after hiring sharpshooters to remove 160 animals. Complaints of damage to lawns and shrubs prompted the Essex County community -- which includes Short Hills, with large homes and sprawling, landscaped properties -- to shoot 115 deer and trap and transport 45 others out of state.
In Somerset County, Bridgewater did the same thing, hiring sharpshooters to kill 104 deer. Princeton's own hunt ended in February, with a tally of 303 deer that were netted and euthanized. Even so, few towns killed enough deer to meet their target numbers.
"I was disappointed," said Mr. Holmes. "We were hoping to get 500."
Spurred by protestors, all three townships investigated contraception before rejecting it.
"Whatever the animal rights folks say, you couldn't procure a contraceptive even if you wanted one," said Mary McNett, a member of the Millburn Township Committeer.
Bette Nuse, the town clerk in Bridgewater, said: "We looked at all the nonlethal methods. But we wanted to do something now. We've been working on this problem for five years."
The question of just what to do with New Jersey's stubbornly proliferating deer population has indeed attracted a great deal of attention. Monitoring the conflicts, Dr. Larry Katz, a reproductive biologist at Rutgers, called attempts to dart deer with contraceptives absurd and unworkable.
Dr. Katz said that protein injections into female deer were capable of blocking conception, but that such methods, known as immunocontraception, required an annual booster -- and therefore yearly recapture -- at a cost estimated at $1,000 for each deer. Permanent sterilization through a single vaccination has not been developed.
"Deer are destroying our ecosystem," said Dr. Katz. "Realistically speaking, that means culling is the only way to save the environment."
Other scientists say deer crowding is a matter of perspective. Dr. Allen Rutberg, senior research scientist of the Humane Society of the United States, argued that complaints of overcrowding were more a question of human behavior, better handled with road warnings, animal repellants and barriers.
As New Jersey's suburbs strive to reach a density of 20 deer to a square mile -- a number advocated by the state division of fish and wildlife -- Dr. Rutberg said that any limit was arbitrary.
"Biologists have recorded deer concentrations as high as 185 to the square mile in Union County's Watchung Reservation," he said. "Densities of 60 to 80 deer are considered to be relatively common. You could equally well argue that theres a human overpopulation."
Yet out of the conflict has risen an entrepreneur with a shotgun.
Don Barwick, a Linden police officer and erstwhile hunter, answered a call for volunteer shooters when the Watchung Reservation began reducing its deer herd five years ago. Anticipating wider demand, Mr. Barwick founded Deer Management Systems Inc., a company of professional sharpshooters, in Hunterdon County. This year, the compnay signed up Bernards Township, Summit, Millburn and Bridgewater.
Following state guidelines, Mr. Barwick baits deer with corn, erecting tree stands for shooters to conceal themselves above the bait piles. The company's sharpshooters use shotguns and solid projectiles called slugs to lower the risk of injuries to the public. State rules do allow professional hunters to use rifles, but few sharpshooters have chosen the more powerful weapons because of their longer range and risk of ricochet.
Though confined to a shooting season that runs from October to April, Mr. Barwick said the demand for deer control had nonetheless soared. Deer Management Systems removed 330 deer this year at a cost to the township of $190 for each animal. All venison is donated to food banks. In the infant business of New Jersey deer control, the chief competitor is White Buffalo, a Connecticut company hired this year by Princeton.
"There are some days when there are no deer, when you are making three dollars an hour," said Mr. Barwick. "Then again, we do no advertising. We don't have to."

HEADLINE: LAW AND ORDER; 
Where Are the Troopers When They're Wanted?

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

 BODY:
IT was in December 1921 that the first group of New Jersey state troopers fanned out to patrol the rural hamlets and small towns that did not have police departments. Today, the state's police are being called back.
 Of those original 81 troopers, about 60 patrolled on horseback, primarily in the southern part of the state, while the rest rode motorcycles throughout central and northern New Jersey. 
 For nearly 81 years, the service was provided at no cost to the towns. But now the state -- more urbanized and with the highest population density in the nation -- has come upon some difficult financial choices. 
Indeed, to try to close a $5.3 billion deficit, Governor McGreevey is proposing as part of his $23.7 billion budget that the 98 municipalities benefiting from full or part-time state police coverage pay for it.
Officials say they expect the plan to save $11.7 million in the first year alone, though many mayors contend the notion is penny-wise and pound foolish.
It is an odd turn of events, since the mayors thought they had a friend in Mr. McGreevey, who as mayor of Woodbridge had to grapple with the same issues -- keeping property taxes down.
One of them, John Palovits, a 79-year old retired bus driver who has been the mayor of the Morris County borough of Victory Gardens for 12 years, said bluntly, "I think the man's crazy; he's going ape."
And Mr. Palovits is a fellow Democrat.
Mayor Palovits had nothing but praise for the state police, though he said he saw cars on patrol once a day at most. "We have a mile and a quarter to go around in," he said. "It only takes 10 minutes at most."
By contrast, Knowlton Township is a rambling 27 square miles, a sparsely settled community in Warren County where the occasional transgression is a bear filching a pie from somebody's kitchen. The mayor, Frank VanHorn, said he knew and liked Mr. McGreevey and sympathized with his economic concerns but added, "We think it's a bonehead idea."
Another fellow Democrat heard from.
Mr. VanHorn, who noted more than once that he grew up on a farm milking cows, said rural communities already paid double to the state what they get back in return. He added: "We've only 2,900 people here, so crime is very low. And how often do the state police come into rural communities?"
The New Jersey State League of Municipalities, which lobbies for the state's 566 communities, has come out strongly against the plan. So has Robert E. Littell, a Sussex County Republican who is co-chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, which will have to act on the measure, since 13 towns in Sussex are patrolled by the state police.
To William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the League of Municipalities, it was not difficult to understand why local officials were so upset. Mr. Dressel said that the municipalities would have to pay the fee, create their own departments, seek help from the county or enter into shared service agreements with neighboring towns, probably resulting in a property tax increase.
By comparison, it cost Califon, a borough of about 1,000 residents in Hunterdon County, $89,315 in the current budget to finance its part-time police force of two, said Mayor Merwin Grimes. "We're in better shape than some of the surrounding communities because we do have a part-time police department," Mayor Grimes said.
Even as Governor McGreevey pursues his plan, neighboring states continue to provide policing services to communities without charge, an additional irritant.
The primary duty of the Pennsylvania State Police -- created in 1905 as the first statewide police agency -- is to patrol the rural and small towns that constitute 85 percent of the state. In Connecticut, nearly 50 percent the state's 169 municipalities are covered at no charge by the state police.
New Jersey's 98 communities that are under the gaze of the state police are situated in 14 of the state's 21 counties; Atlantic County has 6 municipalities that now get part- or full-state police service; Burlington has 14; Cape May 3; Cumberland 11; Gloucester 1; Hunterdon 16; Mercer 1; Monmouth 6; Morris 1; Ocean 2; Salem 8; Somerset 2; Sussex 13 and Warren 14.
It currently costs $70 million a year for the state police to provide services to 24 communities that have part-time police departments of their own and 74 that have none, said Ralph Siegel, a spokesman for the state Department of the Treasury.
The assessment to towns is $23.5 million. But because the state budgets follow the fiscal year, which begins July 1, and localities follow the calendar year, towns will be assessed beginning Jan. 1, 2003, and the first six months will cost $11.7 million. But the mayors have yet to learn how that will be broken down.
"I don't know what the numbers are going to mean to the borough and whether it will be reasonable enough for the services provided or whether it's going to create a burden for the high percentage of seniors in town," said Mayor Brian A. Nolan of Rocky Hill, a borough of 600 residents.
Mr. Siegel said that once the budget was approved, the reimbursement rate for each community would be determined by the treasurer, the Attorney General, and the commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. "The governor takes this seriously in that the proposal is for three cabinet-level officials to work on a formula together," Mr. Siegel said.
Senator Littell was not impressed, and said that the measure would not pass if he had anything to say about it, noting that a similar proposal made during the administration of Gov. William T. Cahill in the 1970's had failed. "Most of these towns are small towns and needy and have at least one state highway running through the center and some times two," said Senator Littell. "So it is the responsibility of the state."
But George L. Kelling, a professor at the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, said it might be time for communities to pay for coverage.
Professor Kelling said the first state police departments -- Pennsylvania, New York State, Michigan and New Jersey -- grew out of the progressive movement in politics that wanted to do away with corrupt city departments and establish a centralized police department -- above reproach -- at the state level. The first step was for the state police to provide services to rural areas and then take over the cities. 
"But that agenda never happened and now we have the situation in New Jersey of rural areas being policed by the state police," he said. "We have this historical oddity and it seems to me that what the governor is doing is facing up to that."
Thomas A. Reppetto, the author of "The Blue Parade," a history of policing published in 1978, said, "Sometimes there's more cost in upsetting established procedure than gain."

Closing A Door on Open Space

BYLINE:  By WENDY GINSBERG 

DATELINE: MILLVILLE 

 BODY:
AT a time when civic leaders are stampeding to get their piece of the $1 billion the state has set aside to preserve open space, elected officials in this rough-hewn little city, where bald eagles soar over shuttered factories, have done the unthinkable: They have asked the state for a moratorium on open space preservation.
 The move, which bucks the growing trend to participate in the state's popular farmland preservation programs, is what officials here say is a wake-up call to the administrators in Trenton who might not notice the effects that overly aggressive land acquisition have wreaked on this 44-square-mile city in Cumberland County. 
 "We wanted to shock the state," Vice Mayor W. James Parent said about a resolution approved by the city. "We wanted this to be like hitting them over the head with a two-by-four." 
The state Department of Environmental Protection declined to comment except to say that representatives were willing to talk with officials in Millville, where nearly 22 percent of the land is owned by the state or by environmental non-profit organizations. Another 15 percent of the land is undevelopable wetlands.
Around the state, voters are approving open space taxes by a ratio of nearly two-to-one in most referendums, said Judy Jengo, executive director of the Garden State Preservation Trust.
"More than 175 New Jersey towns currently participate in the state's open space programs, ten times more than participated just five years ago," Ms. Jengo said. "The city commission's rebuff of the program marks one of the first times a town has passed legislation criticizing the state's preservation efforts."
What local officials want to attract are businesses and industries that will add to the town's tax base without greatly flooding the schools or impeding trash collection.
While there is more than $66 million in taxable businesses in the city, that is about $2 million lower than previous years. And earlier this year, nearly $10 million in taxable land was purchased by the growing school district and stricken from the tax records.
To guard against losing more taxable land, the five-member city commission approved in February a resolution that told the state that open space preservation could have a detrimental effect on economic development and job creation, and asked that a moratorium be imposed on such purchases.
"We agree that there are certain open spaces that should be preserved," said Mayor James F. Quinn. "But we have to have tax ratables, too. If land is taken by a state agency, that land is gone forever. We have to make sure we think about the future of this town."
For his part, Mr. Quinn said he wanted the state and the nonprofit organizations to slow down their land acquisition efforts or raise the price they pay.
Although most people here believe that the commissioners had the town's best interest in mind when they passed the resolution, residents and environmentalists have nonetheless criticized the measure, calling it out of step and ill-advised.
"Every city needs ratables, but you have to remember that Millville is not a dying town," said Paul R. Porreca, a farmer and former city commissioner here. "The resolution just doesn't address the problem."
Millville is a post-industrial city that was once in the heart of New Jersey's glass-making mecca. Though many large companies have fled, T-Fal, which makes pots and pans, and Durand, a manufacturer of fine glassware, are still situated here. The southwest section of the city is home to a 916-acre airport, and the north end has the large manmade Union Lake.
Just a mile from the Pinelands National Reserve, Millville is home to acres of habitat for endangered species as well as the environmentally sensitive Maurice River.
Yet the city is also one of the state's 30 poorest school districts, known as Abbott Districts. The commission's latest idea for rejuvenating the city has the downtown -- which is nearly vacant -- transforming itself into an arts district.
"More than 25 storefronts on the town's main street have been sold over the past two years," Mr. Quinn said.
Local officials are also toying with the notion of luring a race track to the southern end of the city. They originally hoped to attract a Nascar event to the site, but the racing league expressed no interest -- preferring Atlantic City or sites in North Jersey. Now the commission hopes to attract luxury racing car owners to a $35 million race track, of which about $10 million would be publicly financed, Mr. Quinn said.
"Theyll come for a weekend, stay at our hotels and spend money is our downtown," Mr. Parent said. "Why Millville? Well, why not?"
City estimates show slightly more than 4,000 acres are ready for development, with water and sewer lines nearby. But some of that land is being considered for a crucial habitat designation because the endangered bald eagle, which nests in parts of the city, has been seen flying to the area.
Donald S. Ayres, director of economic development here, said he feared that the bald eagle's flying radius could be wide enough to allow most of the city to be considered a crucial habitat area.
"We just want to be told what they're planning to do," Mr. Ayres said. "And we want the state to make concessions when they build on land we think is developable."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE -- BUZZ; 
Happy Days Are Here Again, Rich Are Buying Rollses Again

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
THE SETTING -- The home of Bentley Manhattan, the dealer of $300,000 automobiles, at Madison Avenue and 49th Street. Of the 2,000 Bentleys and Rolls-Royces made each year in Crewe, England, this store sells about 100.
 Last Wednesday, amid reports of an easing recession, there seemed to be slightly less sticker shock at the shop. Six cars sparkled in the showroom, teasing nearby office workers on lunch break. Visitors were not afraid to indulge their fantasies as they drooled over burr walnut dashboards and 420-horsepower engines. 

THE BUZZ -- "The last six weeks have been very busy," said Steven A. Schneir, the manager of the showroom. "We probably sold 15 in the last six weeks. It's a slightly better economic outlook."
Like most car dealers, Mr. Schneir, who this day wore a taupe double-breasted suit and a slicked-back mullet, has a game plan. 
"I give everybody 90 seconds," he said. "If the price doesn't make them run out the door, I offer them my assistance."
Jerome Brownstein walked straight up to a Continental R Mulliner, a "pre-owned special" for $245,000. He did not flinch. "Once you've bought one, you're sucked into the fantasy," he said, reminiscing about a Rolls he gave up in 1972.
But Mr. Brownstein, a retired lawyer, had no intention of buying. "My limo is now yellow, and my driver speaks Farsi." He left with a $160 souvenir pen.
The showroom attracted more oglers than walk-ins. By midafternoon, the store windows were smudged with sweaty palms. "They're the most flashiest right now," said Jermell Simmons of Harlem. "These are the Puff Daddy cars."
Mr. Daddy's, or Mr. Diddy's, people had called recently about another Bentley, his fourth. Not to drop names, but Chris Rock and Ralph Lauren are also in Mr. Schneir's Rolodex. "Our average demographic earns $14.4 million a year and owns five cars, 3.5 homes and part of an aircraft," he said. "Eighty-five percent pay in cash."
No one left that day with car keys, but one showroom regular stopped by to eat lunch in the "commissioning booth," or sales office. 
"The Bentley is a Fifth Avenue apartment on wheels," said Eitan Goldman, who owns a diamond company and, until he swapped it for a Porsche 911 Turbo, a 1999 Bentley Arnage. "I'm optimistic. The market is going to go up." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM; 
Black Heritage Vanishing, One Frayed Icon at a Time

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MATLOFF 

 BODY:
Over the past century, the red-brick Dwyer warehouse was a majestic fixture on the Harlem landscape, commanding the intersection of 123rd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. Its stature as an architectural beacon never dimmed, even when it frayed into an abandoned, water-scarred shell. 
 Despite being eyed by preservationists, the nine-story structure never won landmark status -- and it certainly won't now. On April 2, a ceiling collapsed during work to convert the property into luxury lofts, killing a construction worker. The building is now slated for partial demolition. 
 Champions of Harlem heritage bemoan the loss. More important, they fear they will lose many more historic buildings to neglect or developers, who want to tear down or alter local architectural icons in the wake of gentrification.
"People come from around the world to discover the fable of Harlem," said Michael Henry Adams, an architectural historian and one of the neighborhood's most prominent defenders. "Increasingly, they are coming here and discovering that Harlem is being destroyed."
Large parts of Harlem, with its swaths of intact rowhouses, are virtually unchanged from the 19th century. And as the nation's black cultural capital, its history is rich and fertile.
The Landmarks Preservation Commission says it has made strides in recent years to landmark more property in the area above 96th Street, where 1,190 -- or 11 percent -- of Manhattan's 10,728 designated buildings are situated. This includes more than 900 buildings in Harlem, mainly in unspoiled pockets of Mount Morris, Hamilton Heights and Striver's Row.
But Mr. Adams wants 2,000 more Harlem properties protected, including the former residences of the artist Norman Rockwell, the musician Scott Joplin and the magician Harry Houdini, along with apartment buildings, synagogues, churches and blocks upon blocks of town houses. 
Paradoxically, some of the worst offenders in the preservationists' eyes are churches, like the powerful Abyssinian Baptist Church and the Convent Avenue Baptist Church, which have amassed, but not protected, property in the name of local economic improvement.
In a February resolution requesting emergency designation for four structures, Community Board 10 urged the city to reverse what it called a "long-term pattern of neglect." Some preservationists note that affluent areas like Greenwich Village tend to enjoy a high level of landmarking. 
Sherida E. Paulsen, the Landmarks Commission's chairwoman, noted that over the past two fiscal years her agency designated 380 buildings in the Hamilton Heights-Sugar Hill area and was considering many others. 
"We take three things into account -- architectural, historical and cultural," she said. "If Harlem is where we should be, we will be there." JUDITH MATLOFF

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Honda Civic Hybrid; 
Getting Environmental Kicks on Route 66

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

DATELINE: AMARILLO, Tex. 

 BODY:
WE have traced Route 66 for two days, but our adventures haven't measured up to those of Buz and Tod in the television series of the early 1960's. We have enountered no lynch mobs, game poachers or Las Vegas showgirls.
 Maybe it's the times. Maybe it's us. Maybe it's the car. 
 The boys of "Route 66" had an eye-catching Corvette convertible. My husband and I are driving an unassuming 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid. They got more admiring glances. We are getting better fuel economy. 
 Our new-age road trip is taking us 2,400 miles from Palm Springs, Calif., to our home in Ohio in one of the first truly practical alternative cars. We want to see how easy the Civic Hybrid is to live with, on both high-speed interstates and slower-paced blue highways like the remnants of America's "mother road." We are mostly holding to the speed limit, usually 75 miles an hour in the wide-open West, but we not babying the car to get an unrealistic economy rating.
The Civic Hybrid, which goes on sale this month, is one of the most fuel-efficient and technologically advanced sedans in America. It uses the second generation of Honda's hybrid-drive technology, which combines a gasoline engine with an electric motor that gives a boost when more power is needed.
The Civic is the third hybrid car on the market. The two-door Honda Insight came first, as a 2000 model, and Toyota imported its Prius sedan for 2001.
Detroit's automakers have yet to offer a hybrid vehicle. Ford is expected to be the first, with a hybrid Escape S.U.V. late next year. DaimlerChrysler says it will start selling a hybrid next year, possibly a Jeep Liberty or a minivan. (The company had originally planned a hybrid version of its big Durango sport utility.) General Motors has promised a hybrid full-size pickup in 2004.
Unlike the Insight or Prius, both designed solely as hybrid cars, the Civic is significant precisely because it is not exotic. Honda has put its advanced powertrain in an existing car that has all the attributes and amenities of any Civic, including room for five people and a respectable trunk. This Civic just happens to get 40 percent better fuel economy.
It is a more expensive Civic, too, with a base price of $20,010, about $2,000 more than a comparably equipped Civic EX. With gas prices at current levels, one is unlikely to save enough on fuel to make up the difference, though that could change if gas prices spike, or if the government offers a green-tax credit for hybrid cars.
 This is not an electric car that one plugs in to charge batteries. It has a 1.3-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine that gets an assist from a small electric motor. (The regular Civic has a larger, more thirsty 1.7-liter engine.)
When cruising, the car uses the gas engine only. When we slow down, the electric motor converts some of our momentum into electricity, which it sends to a battery pack behind the rear seat. When we need extra power -- to take off from a stoplight, to accelerate onto the highway, to climb a hill -- the electric motor kicks in.
Compared with the continuously variable automatic transmission of our test car, the standard-equipment five-speed manual extracts more power from the electric motor. But even with the variable automatic, the Civic Hybrid does not feel like an underpowered vehicle with a dinky engine.
We left Palm Springs on Thursday afternoon, spent a night in Kingman, Ariz., and arrived here in Amarillo Friday night, having driven 923 miles. We have averaged only 38.3 miles per gallon, a relatively poor showing partly due to the 75 m.p.h. speed limit and partly to our steady climb through much of Arizona.
We have watched a display on the instrument panel show the battery being recharged and discharged. Another display continuously estimates our mileage. We think we are capable of greater things.
The government estimates that the Civic Hybrid will get 48 m.p.g. in town and 47 m.p.g. on the highway with the automatic, and 46 in town and 51 on the highway with the stick shift. A gas-only Civic EX automatic is rated at 30 city, 38 highway.
On Saturday morning, we are at the Cadillac Ranch, a pop art monument on the outskirts of Amarillo. where 10 old Cadillacs are embedded nose-down in concrete, their tailfins punctuating the plains around this automotive Stonehenge. Now covered with graffiti, the cars represent one version of the American dream.
Driving up in a hybrid car adds new layers of symbolism to the site. These old Caddys have gone bumper up. Are hybrids a first step toward turning the internal-combustion engine into a dinosaur?
The Civic Hybrid is a quiet revolutionary, since it doesn't look much different from any other Civic. Although Honda has changed a few things -- making the front bumper more aerodynamic, for instance -- the car doesn't attract any notice as we head to Oklahoma to look for Lucille's, a service station and souvenir stand operated by Lucille Hamons since, we have read, 1941.
But there are other differences. Honda calls the Hybrid not just the highest-technology Civic, but the most refined Civic. The interior is more upscale and there is more standard equipment (antilock brakes, side air bags). Oddly, the color choices do not include green.
The Hybrid also drives better. Although it uses the same parts, the suspension has been firmed up. Putting the batteries in the trunk improves the car's balance, making it feel less nose-heavy and more fun.
It also feels more structurally solid and more stable than the Prius. It leans less on corners.
Because the Civic Hybrid's gas engine is small, it is also quieter and less prone to vibrate than the larger engine in the standard Civic. The new electric power steering is also much more responsive.
As we head to Lucille's, we notice that cutting our speed by 5 miles an hour raises our mileage by about 2 m.p.g. When driving 65 m.p.h., we are getting 44 m.p.g.
These days, there isn't much left of Route 66 or its landmarks. When we finally find Lucille's, just yards from Interstate 40 in Hydro, Okla., we learn that the proprietor has died. A wooden cross serves as a memorial; her little outpost is padlocked.
As we slow down to look around, we realize that we have tuned out the slight engine whine that we originally thought was a distant fire truck.
From St. Louis we picked up U.S. 50 and held to the 50 m.p.h. speed limit. The route crosses flat prairie and runs along the Illinois Central Railroad tracks through small towns, each with its claim to fame. Olney, Ill., for instance, is the Home of the White Squirrels. (The town has a preponderance of albino squirrels.)
Soon we are entering Indiana over the Red Skelton Bridge over the Wabash River. After 134 miles on U.S. 50 at 50 m.p.h., we've averaged 61.3 m.p.g. -- our best mileage of the trip.
Although this 1.3-liter engine is much smoother than the 1.7-liter in the standard Civic, there is a disadvantage to its size. At start-up, with a light foot on the gas pedal, there is some slight vibration, though it fades above 1,500 r.p.m.
The seats aren't very comfortable for long distances, but they are far better than the seats in the Insight, which have virtually no padding. To achieve high mileage, Honda built the Insight to be as light as possible.
After 2,400 miles, it is clear that the Civic Hybrid is not just good for the environment, but good to drive, too, without the discomforts of the rough-riding Insight. You need not give up much to be environmentally friendly, other than 2.9 cubic feet of trunk space taken by the batteries.
Honda expects to sell 24,000 Civic Hybrids a year, and that seems reasonable. A recent survey by J. D. Power & Associates estimated that Americans will be buying 500,000 hybrids a year by 2006, even if gas prices change little. And why not? A car like the Civic Hybrid offers a painless way to be green, even if it doesn't come in green.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Tough Times Linger for Software Industry

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
COMPUTER software stocks have been shrinking in value. 
 Excluding Microsoft, a group of 116 companies tracked by Morgan Stanley has lost 22 percent of market capitalization since the start of the year. That number is now around $550 billion. 
 Last week, Thomas Siebel, chief executive of Siebel Systems, rattled investors when he said the contraction was not over. At the start of the year, Mr. Siebel was bullish. 
Charles E. Phillips, computer software analyst at Morgan Stanley, talked last week about the difficult conditions in this high-margin business. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Why were so many people initially optimistic about prospects for software companies?

A. The December quarter was good enough to get people excited. People were allowed to do a lot of year-end budget spending. In hindsight, what went on then was an aberration. It was assumed that an improving economy is a good thing, and that technology spending would closely follow that. But from a profitability standpoint, corporate customers are still under pressure.

Q. What are the prospects for the two broad components of the software business, applications and infrastructure?

A. Applications software is a packaged business process. Intuit, which sells tax software, is an applications company.
Infrastructure is for backup and recovery, tools you need to help back up applications. Companies like Veritas Software, Computer Associates and Oracle are infrastructure software companies. 
During a downturn, infrastructure software tends to do better. Applications software sales are totally dependent on new projects. So the applications guys tend to fall off farther and faster.

Q. What is the outlook for software?

A. The first quarter tends to be the toughest of the year. We do monthly surveys of chief information officers. Those surveys got worse all through last year, stabilized at the end of the year and have gotten a little worse since then.
I don't expect to see much of a recovery until the fourth quarter, with better prospects for 2003. 
When the pickup comes, it won't mean big numbers, but improved numbers. The likelihood of returning to the days of 50 percent growth are pretty much gone. Excluding Microsoft, the independent software companies generate about $90 billion worth of revenues. In the aggregate, we will be lucky to get growth of 10 percent to 12 percent. The industry is maturing.

Q. Is the software business bad everywhere, or just in the United States?

A. Business in the United States has definitely fallen off more, but things are slowing in Europe and Asia now. But the decline there will not be as severe. Those regions did not have the same excess Y2K- and Internet-related buying binge as American customers.

Q. Mr. Siebel predicted that a lot of small software companies would go out of business this year. Would consolidation help?

A. Consolidation will help some, may help margins a little bit, but these small companies weren't relevant anyway. A lot of them shouldn't have been started in the first place.

Q. Are the barriers to entry in software low?

A. Some segments have high barriers. There won't be any new database software companies. Microsoft, I.B.M. and Oracle will battle it out there for years to come. And SAP, PeopleSoft and Oracle have the back-office applications segment for accounting and manufacturing.

Q. Are software stocks attractively priced?

A. The stocks have come off a lot, but they were overvalued. And earnings are less now than they were. For the most part, valuations are in line with where they should be. But the stocks are not bargains. In the near term, most of the sector will be revising guidance on earnings down, and the second-half numbers will be coming down.

Q. Should investors avoid software?

A. The average investor should probably stay away. They are volatile stocks with a lot of risk, too much risk for the average investor.
There are definitely companies that will be around for 10 years, but they could still underperform the market during that time frame. Companies like SAP, PeopleSoft, Oracle, Veritas Software and Computer Associates are going to be viable for years to come.

Q. Do you give any of the the stocks an "overweight" rating, Morgan Stanley's highest?

A. SAP and Peregrine Software, which builds software to track assets in a company, are rated "overweight." Lots of the rest are rated "equal weight," which means they will perform in line with the rest of the market.

HEADLINE: One Small Step for Man, 25 Backward for Women 

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
ANYONE keen to argue that America is in the midst of a second wave of feminist backlash doesn't have to work hard to stack the arsenal. A new book, "Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest for Children," by the economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett, paints a profoundly gloomy picture for career women (or those merely unattached) who hope to delay life's McClaren stroller phase past the age of 35. Last week the book formed the basis of a "60 Minutes" broadcast and a Time magazine cover story featuring an illustration of a mournful-looking woman cradling a blanket that held a briefcase and a Palm Pilot.
 Such a woman would find little to improve her mood in "The Bachelor," a new reality show on ABC that exists as a hyperbolic reminder of the pernicious view that man-catching at this point in history has odds analogous to hitting the superfecta. On the first episode of the show, which has won healthy ratings on Monday nights in prime time, 25 young women with names like Amber, Angelique and Trista were dispatched to a beach house in Malibu to compete for the attention of a 31-year-old management consultant, the kind of young man to whom the gods have apparently denied nothing. 
 Each week the bachelor, Alex Michel, winnows the group down to an ever more select few. Tomorrow night begins a three-episode final round in which four women parry for the title of Mrs. Right. Or at least that is what they are ostensibly doing. Mr. Michel is under no contractual obligation to propose to any of them, Mike Fleiss, the show's producer, said, though the audience is allowed to nurture the impression that the process will result in marriage. So far, the woman with whom Mr. Michel seems most infatuated is a 24-year-old operations assistant from Dallas named Shannon, who announced to the camera last week during a date at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, "I am Pretty Woman!"
Realists would say that this is not the sort of woman that fate would otherwise choose for Mr. Michel. Unlike Rick Rockwell, the discredited orange-toned prospective husband of "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire" a few seasons back, Mr. Michel is a bachelor of considerable social advantage. Born in the horse country of Charlottesville, Va., he grew up in Darien, Conn., the son of a chief executive. He studied at Harvard and Stanford business school, working in between at C-Net, a San Francisco technology company.
Since "The Bachelor" began, friends of Mr. Michel have been amusedly exchanging e-mail messages and phone calls, and most are not dumbfounded that his path would lead him to such an outing.
"There isn't a wedding I know of from Harvard or Stanford or any of the derivative feeder schools like St. Paul's that Alex isn't invited to," said David DiDomenico, a friend from college and graduate school. "He's an incredibly brilliant guy, and he has a level of charisma that is Clintonesque."
Arguably the most distasteful aspect of "The Bachelor" is a class dynamic that has women from a very different universe vying for Mr. Michel's legitimization. Besides the predictable number of aspiring actresses, the initial group consisted of a bartender, a woman who sold power tools and a dancer for the Miami Heat (who is still very much in the running). In last week's episode, a 23-year-old events planner from Chanute, Kan., who is falling for Mr. Michel declared that he was raising her standards in men.
"We tried to find smart women," explained Mr. Fleiss, already looking hard for another single man for "The Bachelor 2." "They didn't have to be bluebloods. We had at least one Ivy Leaguer. I think we tried to find a good cross section of people." As for the selection of Mr. Michel, Mr. Fleiss said, "He seemed like a real catch, the kind of guy you lose a girl to -- the guy with the good family and money and the handsome grin."
Mr. Michel's friends are quick to say that he has an enormous capacity to appreciate the absurd, and that he should find himself immersed in the bizarre world of reality TV somehow makes sense. When Owen West, an acquaintance from Harvard and Stanford, heard about Mr. Michel's latest adventure, he said, "I was not that surprised." 
Ben Nemo, another Stanford friend, said: "I think the likelihood of his finding a lifelong match from this is not very high. But I've never known Alex as someone who needed to be the center of attention, which makes me think that part of his motivation for this is genuine."
Five years ago, Mr. Michel said, "I would never have done this." He heard about "The Bachelor" from a friend, he said, "and I thought the odds of meeting someone great would be pretty high." He has had serious relationships and spent plenty of time as a dater. 
Producers subjected him to an intensive background check that included a personality inventory, blood tests and interviews with former girlfriends. (No one wanted a repeat of the "Marry a Millionaire" debacle, when Mr. Rockwell turned out to have been the subject of a restraining order for threatening a fiancee.) When Mr. Michel told his parents about his latest project, "they were supportive," he said, "but they were definitely concerned and thought it was a pretty weird thing to do."
Mr. Michel comes across as a genial and affecting suitor, the kind of guy who seems almost squeamish about the process of rejecting. Still it is Mr. Michel who has been letting women go. The chosen ones have the right to turn down his offer to continue toward a proposal of matrimony at the end of each episode, but so far no one has done so. 
Last week, one of the women, a real-estate agent from Texas, fled in tears after having been rejected and experienced a panic attack, on camera, that required medical assistance. "If I had to make a list, he has it all," she said earlier in the episode, even though she had not spent more than half an hour with Mr. Michel. Most of the women received no compensation; the four finalists, who will have taken off from work for five weeks for taping, are promised a few hundred dollars each.
That the conceit of the show is blatantly sexist, that the women seem prepared to defenestrate one another for 10 minutes of time alone with Mr. Michel are observations he objects to. "I think that's overblown," he said. "No one is saying 'this is how dating should be.' " 
"I don't think of these women as desperate," Mr. Michel added.
Meanwhile, Mr. Michel's friends are entertaining themselves with elaborate betting pools that aim to guess who he will keep or cast off at the end of each episode. One, pool, titled "Al Madness," initiated by Mr. Nemo, is formatted on an Excel spreadsheet and modeled after brackets used for betting on the college basketball championships. Tiebreaker questions include "What is the combined weight of the Episode 5 finalists?" Another group of businessmen with a $1,200 pool have been trading options on various contestants. "There was literally a scheduled conference call for this," said one of the participants, who did not want to be named. 
Some of the players might now be wishing they had bought options on a young woman not seen on "The Bachelor" who was spotted holding hands with Mr. Michel in Los Angeles last week, gossip columns reported. "There's no romance," Mr. Michel said on Friday. "She's a friend." A friend, it turns out, from Harvard.

Venture Capitalists See Investors Grow Mutinous

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
IN March, Battery Ventures, a leading venture capital firm, held an annual meeting in a Florida resort for its limited partners, which include some of the biggest pension funds and endowments. 
 A moment of levity came when Thomas J. Crotty, a Battery executive, awarded a trophy to a limited partner who had won a golf tournament. As he presented the cup, a cheap $100 job, Mr. Crotty said it showed "just how desperate V.C.'s are to give anything to a limited partner these days." 
 The remark drew laughs, but it also reflected the escalating tension between venture capitalists and their investors. In the two years since the Internet bubble burst, venture investors have watched their lush profits shrivel. Yet many venture capitalists are still doing quite well for themselves because of the large management fees they collect from investors. Fees are based on their funds' size, so as funds ballooned over the last few years -- about 40 have at least $1 billion in capital -- so have the fees. 
With typical fees at 2 to 3 percent of a fund, a venture capital firm with a $1 billion fund would collect $20 million to $30 million annually from investors, even if only a small amount of the fund has been invested -- and into money-losing companies at that.
The incongruence is at the heart of a brewing investor rebellion. While limited partners have little legal recourse, many are demanding more information and pushing venture capitalists to make changes, like reducing the size of funds and, therefore, the fees. At least five big firms have scaled back funds this year.
"Limited partners have gone from sullen to mutinous," said Howard Anderson, the senior managing director of YankeeTek Ventures, a venture capital firm in Cambridge, Mass. "What's driving them nuts is that the venture partnerships do well in bad years. If rewards are shared, the pain should be shared, too."
Those tensions have boiled over at some of this season's annual meetings, which began in February but hit full stride this month. They are the one time when venture capitalists formally address all of their investors, and are usually polite affairs where criticism, if any, is reserved. But with the bulk of meetings still to come, venture capitalists are bracing for the worst.
"The limited-partner community is scared, angry and in a mood to be more challenging of their money managers," Mr. Crotty said. Although Battery's performance is better than many, he said, "we weren't sure what kind of audience we were going to face."
Mr. Crotty's colleague, Anthony Abate, put it more colorfully: "We thought they were going to storm the Bastille."
Battery's meeting went better than its investment leaders had expected, they said, partly because they spoke frankly and tried to answer all questions. But meetings at some other firms have been strained.
THE annual meeting of Redpoint Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif., was held in February at a nearby hotel. People at the meeting said one investor stood up and challenged the firm's capacity to invest its $1.25 billion fund prudently. Redpoint partners offered their rationale but, according to one attendee, "the dogs weren't eating the dog food." A month later, Redpoint reduced its fund size by 25 percent.
The most uncomfortable standoff may have been at the meeting of Idealab, the technology incubator, held in March in Pasadena, Calif. The firm has been sued by investors including Dell Computer and Moore Global Investments, who have accused Bill Gross, its founder, of mismanagement. Mr. Gross is fighting the suit. 
The meeting was contentious from the start. Idealab insisted that a court reporter, brought in by some aggrieved investors, leave the meeting. The firm distributed rules of conduct for the meeting, stating that it could stop discussions that exceeded two minutes, used derogatory references or concerned confidential information related to the lawsuit.
Presentations by Marcia Goodstein, who is the president and chief operating officer and Mr. Gross's fiancee, and by a director, Robert Kavner, a former executive vice president at AT&T, were among those prompting pointed questions, according to two people who attended. Idealab said it invested about $1 million a month but spent twice that much a month to operate its fledgling companies. The largest operating expense, it disclosed, goes to salary and benefits: Mr. Gross's compensation, including salary and bonus, exceeded $750,000 in 2002, up from $250,000 in 2000. During that same period, the plaintiffs charge, Idealab lost half their $1 billion investment. Idealab says some of the money was invested in companies that are still going concerns. Several investors walked out early.
The mood is a far cry from that of the late 1990's, when the meetings were more like lovefests and investors didn't care to hear the details because the cash was flowing in. 
"Limited partners are forcing the general partners to go back and rethink whether they can invest their money within a reasonable amount of time," said Jonathan Axelrad, a lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, a law firm that represents technology companies. "This is a unique set of circumstances the venture industry has not faced before. People are casting about for creative solutions."
That partly explains the fund-cutting in the venture world. Some prominent firms, like Mohr, Davidow Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, have voluntarily reduced size and averted investor criticism. "If you see this palace revolt coming, maybe you head it off and take some action," Mr. Anderson of YankeeTek said. 
The cuts have pressured other venture capitalists to trim funds or split them up. Fund size is "an area of significant concern to limited partners, and properly so," said Alan Austin, chief operating officer at Accel Partners, which has proposed splitting its $1 billion fund into two. That would reduce some management fees but still lock up investors' capital. It is unclear if Accel investors, who voted on the change by mail, have approved it; results will be tallied in time for annual meeting on April 25. If it is defeated, the meeting "could be a real food fight," one investor said.
Few regulations cover what venture capital firms must disclose, and the level of information they provide to their investors varies widely. Some gloss over details at their meetings, but that approach is not going over well this year. To some extent, the funds are feeling the same pressures for openness that has roiled the broader investing world since the collapse of Enron.
Battery Ventures spent months preparing for its meeting, where it dissected the firm's performance, good and bad. It detailed write-downs and write-offs and went over a "watch list" of troubled investments. (Three were shut down, three received more financing and one was sold for $350 million.) Battery also told investors that the 2001 revenue of its 27 portfolio companies was $275 million less than it had forecast.
From an investor's point of view, such transparency is helpful in difficult times.
"We want as much information as possible," said Richard J. Hayes, a senior investment officer at Calpers, the huge pension fund. "Most of our partners are getting into the nitty-gritty details of their investments. That's what we want."

HEADLINE: The Memory Maker 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM 

 BODY:
DOZENS of times a day, every day of the year, for half a century, a little drama played itself out in a three-story red-brick building on East Kingsbridge Road just off the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. 
 In a second-floor apartment that had been transformed into a photography studio, a neatly dressed man with haunted eyes ducked under a black velvet cloth. You could hear him rustling around, adjusting the 8-by-10-inch Kodak studio camera perched on the three-legged mahogany stand. As he peered through the camera, a miniature image of a family stared back at him, the children wriggling slightly in their starched clothes, waiting solemnly in the glare from two enormous floor lamps for the signal to smile. 
 Silently, photographer and subject regarded one another. Then a slender hand emerged and squeezed the terra cotta-colored rubber bulb, preserving for posterity the image of yet another Bronx family. 
The man in the white shirt and tie was Kourken Hovsepian, who reigned for half a century, from the mid-1920's to the late 1970's, as one of the borough's premier studio photographers. 
Mr. Kirk, as he was known to everyone from Yankee Stadium up to Van Cortlandt Park, would never have called himself an artist. "For him it was making a living," said his daughter, Mimi Vang Olsen, a small, effervescent woman who saved all her father's work. But in the process of making a living, this Armenian refugee left a remarkable legacy, creating thousands of images that offer a portrait of a golden place during a golden age, or so it is recalled by those who look back misty eyed. 
The fabled heart of this world was the Grand Concourse, a true boulevard of dreams for the waves of upwardly mobile Jews, and some Irish, who streamed there from lesser addresses around the city, drawn by the street's almost palpable sense of promise. The four-and-a-half-mile-long tree-lined thoroughfare was completed in 1909, and by the mid-1930's it and its environs were as much a state of mind as a geographical destination.
Sleek Art Deco apartment houses had sprouted along the edges of the Concourse, complete with sunken living rooms, airy corner windows and doormen in dashing little capes. Adding to the neighborhood's luster were legendary landmarks, like the 4,000-seat Loew's Paradise. There, real goldfish swam in a marble pool, the decor included $10,000 worth of artificial birds, and virtually every Bronx girl of a certain era got her first real kiss under a ceiling of twinkling stars and drifting vapor clouds. 
The great flowering of this world was well under way when Mr. Kirk made his appearance, and like countless Armenians before him, he arrived with few belongings but considerable psychological baggage, in the form of nightmarish memories of his escape from his ravaged homeland.
In 1913, when he was barely a teenager, marauding Turks wiped out his native town of Harput. They murdered his father and sent his mother, sister and two brothers on a pitiless death march into the scorching desert; Kourken survived only because he escaped over the Caucasus to Russia. In a tape recording made for his daughter near the end of his life, he described the massacre with terrifying clarity: "Bodies melting like wax, floating down the river in the hot sun." 
Thousands of miles away, in Worcester, Mass., America's largest Armenian diaspora, a cousin named Kazar Melikian had already established a thriving photographic studio. It was there that Kourken Hovsepian, who arrived in America in 1920, found his calling. By 1927, newly married to a pretty young Hungarian girl named Lilly, he was proudly ensconced in his own studio at 52 East Kingsbridge Road, just above Spotless Cleaners, taking his place with those other icons of midcentury life in the borough: Sol and Moe's candy store; Brownstein's hardware; Star Drug; G and R Jewish bakery; Fountain Beauty Salon; the Irish bars. 
"He'd tell people it was between the Concourse and Jerome Avenue, even though it was really between Morris and Creston," his daughter recalled. "Everyone knew the Grand Concourse." 
In those years, long before the arrival and subsequent popularity of the Kodak Instamatic, the Polaroid and the photo chains, the local studio photographer was a fixture of life. While the field of commercial photography would produce a number of photo-world stars and was rich with its own traditions and aesthetic, the role of the neighborhood studio was primarily social, the major venue through which, in that era, families recorded milestones large and small.
"The studio photographer created the record of how people wanted themselves seen, how they wanted themselves to be remembered," said Bonnie Yochelson, author of "Berenice Abbott: Changing New York: The Complete WPA Project" (New Press and the Museum of the City of New York, 1997). "He was the one entrusted with creating their legacy. He told the story of ordinary people."
This was a perfect description of Mr. Kirk's role. Over the years, he recorded every variety of ethnic and religious celebration: bar mitzvahs for the Jews, communions and christenings for Irish, Italian, Greek and German clients, and weddings for everyone. Family portraits, the earliest preserved on fragile 8-by-10 glass negatives, trace the evolution of households almost from cradle to grave. In the wedding pictures -- Mr. Kirk's big, taffeta-covered albums were a specialty of the house -- starry-eyed brides emerge triumphant from a sea of attendants, their enormous trains swirling about them like giant organdy fishtails. 
June brought to Mr. Kirk's studio beaming graduates clutching new diplomas. During the war, a parade of soldiers, sailors, Wacs and Waves -- many of whom had trained at the Kingsbridge Armory just up the street -- came by for portraits to give their parents before being shipped overseas. Buried under the pictures of ceremonial events are luscious, creamy-limbed women adrift in chiffon -- aspiring actresses, perhaps; thanks to a trick of focusing, their faces and bodies are gauzy as a dream. 
As you riffle through these photographs, which have been carefully stored in cartons in Ms. Olsen's Hudson Street row house in Greenwich Village, a long-vanished world leaps into life. You can almost hear the buoyant tarantellas, the cantor's lyric chant. You can almost hear the clink of Champagne flutes. Your fingers long to caress the plush Persian lamb coats. You can almost smell the Shalimar.
 THE four-room apartment on East Kingsbridge Road soon housed a family of four; a son, Kirk, was born in 1935, a daughter, Mimi, in 1938. But domestic activities were tucked away in the back bedroom and kitchen, and the remaining two rooms were devoted to the studio. The parents slept there, on a foldout sofa. The children slept in the tiny rear bedroom, in foldout chairs that became beds, and were constantly shushed. A walk-in closet had been converted into a darkroom and retouching area, and in the bathroom, drying negatives hung from a wooden frame above the tub and damp prints dried on a cheesecloth-covered rack.
When customers arrived, Mr. Kirk would wheel over one of his painted backdrops, either the richly colored brocade or the pale, pastoral scene. A family might be grouped in front of the oak plant stand with the claw feet or near the antique library table that now sits in Ms. Olsen's front room. 
Once the subjects were arranged, Mr. Kirk would dip into his drawer of props for the perfect accessory: the velvet stole that made possible the off-the-shoulder look (a girl had to be over 16 for that); the bouquets of dried roses and camellias; the prayer book for confirmation and communion pictures; the snap-on bow tie that made every young man look spiffy. 
"He never diverged from certain poses or certain props," his daughter recalled. "Babies got a tin rattle to shake. Older children got a red rubber ball, a truck or a doll. Sometimes my doll." 
Sunday, the day the brides came, was a madhouse. The entire wedding party, or two or three, descended in full bridal attire after the ceremony, and everyone had a drink in honor of the occasion. Impressionable little Mimi was in heaven. After the last click of the shutter, the participants and Mr. Kirk headed off to a reception at one of the great Bronx ballrooms or restaurants. 
Later, when the place was quieter, Mr. Kirk retreated to his darkroom, where for decades he measured his chemicals using an old-fashioned brass scale fitted with miniature weights, and then to his workbench, to retouch his images and print the best of them. Until the arrival of color photography, he hand-tinted all his pictures, using toothpicks wrapped with wisps of cotton and dabbed in special oil paints, a task his daughter eventually assumed. 
"I was more bold," said Ms. Olsen, who started helping her father when she was 11. "Perhaps it was because he was never trained as a painter. He didn't see a lot of color in black and white photos." 
Or maybe, she suggested, the explanation was more complicated. Looking at Mr. Kirk as he bent earnestly over his light box, his slender frame silhouetted by the light streaming in behind his shoulder, a Lucky Strike dangling from his lips, you might not know how troubled a soul he was. As with so many of his countrymen, the demons of his childhood haunted him until his death. 
The same horrific past may explain why the refrigerator at 52 East Kingsbridge Road was always bursting with rolled grape leaves, salted black olives, lamb meat pies and other tempting Armenian delicacies. And perhaps why he never switched on a radio when he worked, even as the sounds of Sinatra and doo-wop bounced from nearly every corner of the borough.
"He didn't want to leave his apartment, except for photography jobs," his daughter said. "He'd been wandering for so long alone in his youth. He just wanted a safe place with his little family." 
Yet even a home and family could not keep the nightmares at bay. And so he drank, and by the late 1950's he was drinking heavily. Sometimes he slipped downstairs for a few whiskeys with Vinnie Orotelli, who owned the barbershop next door, but more often he drank alone. Liquor made him aggressive, not physically but verbally, as his family remembered all too well. Afterward, he tumbled into bed and slept it off, only to have the cycle repeat itself the next time the past drew too near.
 OF all the milestones preserved in amber in Mr. Kirk's trove of contact sheets, few were more lavish than the 1949 wedding of Betty Kanganis, the daughter of a florist, and Nick Raptis, the nephew of a florist. Their romance was the talk of New York's Greek community, mostly because Betty was really just a child when it began, a sophomore at Walton High School, her Sweet 16 party still a year away. 
Her father, George, ran the florist shop on Kingsbridge Road and Jerome Avenue, with his brother, Charlie. Nick, born in America but raised in Greece, worked for a wholesaler in the flower district.
The two young people met at one of the flower dances held at the Pennsylvania Hotel, an annual ritual for the Greek florist community. One of Betty's aunts had mentioned "a gorgeous hunk of man," and, truth be told, when Nick first asked her to dance, Betty was a little disappointed. But some months later, when Nick announced his intention of returning to Greece, she changed her mind. After a courtship conducted under the watchful eye of Betty's grandmother, the marriage finally took place. The bride was 17, the groom nearly 25. 
The Rev. Basil Efthimiou performed the Greek Orthodox ceremony on Feb. 27, at Holy Trinity Cathedral on East 74th Street. (In a lovely echo, Father Basil's son, Milton, would preside decades later at St. Barbara's in Toms River, N.J., where the couple retired in 1989.)
Betty wore an ivory satin gown from J. Thorpe, hand-trimmed with lace and seed pearls, with a matching beaded crown and her glossy dark braids piled high on her head, giving her the look of a young Greek princess. Her father made her bouquet of orchids and lilies of the valley in his shop. At the reception in the garlanded ballroom of the Concourse Plaza Hotel, 320 guests rumbaed and tangoed to the George Kravas Orchestra, the city's reigning Greek musicians.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Kirk had taken pictures in the Kanganis apartment on East 196th Street: the adjusting of the bride's gown, the arranging of the flowers, the (mock) carrying of the bride over the threshold. But the real prologue to the wedding lies in the dozens of Kanganis family portraits that Mr. Kirk had taken over the previous two decades, pictures that show Betty maturing from a solemn infant to a beautiful woman. 
Here she is at 2, plopped on a chair like a rag doll, all bobbed hair and ruffled yoke, "the best-dressed little girl in town," as she remembered it. At 4, one leg tucked under her in the classic Shirley Temple pose, an enormous bow in her hair. At 6, with a headful of ringlets, courtesy of her patient mother. At 9, in a maroon velvet sailor dress that was her favorite that year, her hair long and flowing, tucked in her mother's embrace. At 10, with her hands stuck adorably in a muff. Her eighth-grade graduation from Public School 86, wearing the white organdy dress she had made in sewing class, arm in arm with her cousin Helen, "closer to me than a sister," who was maid of honor at her wedding. 
Then, newly engaged, displaying the $400 diamond in a white gold setting that Nick had bought in Washington Heights. Nick was earning $30 a week at the time, and though he emptied his bank account, he was still short. A friend offered a loan. Within six months, Nick had paid back every cent.
 BETTY and Nick Raptis longed to live on the Concourse. "Oh, God, we wanted a place on the Concourse so bad!" Mr. Raptis said years later. Nothing in their price range was available just then, and so in 1954 they bought a house in Yonkers, a short commute from the florist shop they now ran. But even as they were packing their bags, powerful currents were beginning to flow that eventually transformed the world of the Concourse. 
Because of complex social and economic forces that echoed far beyond the borough, low-income blacks and Puerto Ricans in the South Bronx began pushing north into neighborhoods that had been rooted, stable and, more to the point, almost entirely white. Crime, much of it drug-related, and urban disarray increased, accelerating in some quarters a never quite disguised racism. When Co-op City opened the first of its nearly 16,000 apartments in the northeast Bronx in 1966, it was as if a sluice gate had opened. Whole buildings seemed to move there en masse. 
Jews, like the Irish, have always been ready to move out of changing neighborhoods. Other groups, like Italians, tend to stay put longer. But across many ethnic lines, the next generation usually yearns to move up and out. If Co-op City had not been built, the exodus of the Jews of the Grand Concourse and the accompanying transformation might have been slower and less convulsive. But who can say it would not have taken place? 
In 1980, Ms. Olsen moved her parents to Starrett City in Brooklyn, where friends had settled. Her father, then 80, died within the year. Her mother died in 1986.
Were Mr. Kirk's ghost to walk the streets of his old neighborhood today, it would come upon a new world. Spotless Cleaners is long departed. Botanica San Lazar, its successor, serves a thriving Latino population that has restored a modicum of the area's earlier stability. Its shelves are lined with pastel potions bearing enticing labels like "Ven a mi" ("Come to me"), "Steadywork," "Dominantemaster" and what sounds best of all, "Jinx removing." A statue of St. Barbara is wreathed with miniature red carnations. "You don't want to leave the saint naked," Sandra, the Brazilian owner, said.
One of the few survivors of the past is Mr. Orotelli, the barber. He retired to New Jersey, but comes back a few days a week to don a crimson jacket and cut a little hair. "After 35 years, you have a lot of memories," he said. But not much else has remained. No one who lived on the block when he arrived is still around, he said. The last holdout, who lived at No. 56, died a couple of years ago. 
Still, there is another survivor of the Bronx of those days: Mr. Kirk's marvelous photographs. The daughter who used to dab color on the black and white prints and who went on to study painting at the School of Visual Arts made sure of that. In an apartment whose layout mirrors the place of her birth -- "It's an identical setup," she said, "I'm so conscious of it" -- she also creates domestic portraits. 
Her subjects too are people, and their pets, in their homes; she creates oil portraits for the well-heeled urban dweller. While she works, tucked away behind Mr. Kirk's oak library table and the little brass scales, boxes and boxes of photographs, glass negatives and faded purple proofs slowly gather dust and memories.

HEADLINE: Will Rural America Have a Future? 

BYLINE:  By Chuck Hassebrook; Chuck Hassebrook is executive director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb.

DATELINE: WALTHILL, Neb. 

 BODY:
As the farm bill continues to be debated in a conference committee seeking a compromise between House and Senate versions, the prospects for a good law are worsening. The choice is simple. Congress can write bigger checks to the nation's biggest farms -- which seems to be where the consensus is heading -- or it can make a significant investment in creating genuine opportunity in rural America. It cannot do both. 
 Opportunity is in short supply in much of rural America. Stretches of Nebraska and the Dakotas include the nation's two lowest-income counties and more than half of the bottom 20. Across a wide swath of rural America, communities are dying and churches and schools are closing. 
 Community decline is driven by agricultural decline. Small and medium-size farms are being driven out by falling prices for farm commodities and aggressive competition from large farms armed with six-figure federal payments. As a study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment concluded, "Communities that are surrounded by farms that are larger than can be operated by a family have a bimodal income distribution with a few wealthy elites, a majority of poor laborers and virtually no middle class."
That is not progress. That is social decay.
The farm bill can be a vehicle to restore social progress and economic opportunity in rural America.
But the conference committee reconciling the House and Senate farm bills must resolve two critical issues.
First, conference committee leaders must find the courage to stop subsidizing the large farms in such a way that they are assisted in pushing their smaller neighbors out of business. The Senate bill caps payments to large farms. The House does not.
Farmers and nonfarmers agree on this issue. A recent survey covering 27 states found that 81 percent of farmers polled want farm income support payments carefully targeted to small farms. And my farmer friends will be pleased to learn that nationwide polls find that Americans will support farm payments -- but only if they help small family farms.
Second, we must balance the immediate relief provided by farm income support programs with investment in rural America's future. The budget framework now being developed by farm bill conferees does not do this. Support for agricultural and rural development initiatives has been cut in half from the levels set by the House and Senate bills; such initiatives would get less than 1 percent of the amount spent on farm income support programs.
As a result, programs to assist beginning farmers and bolster research to develop new farming methods that strengthen family farms are in jeopardy.
Financing for the development of cooperatives that help family farmers reach higher-value markets -- markets that offer real opportunity -- is also in danger.
Consumer surveys find that most Americans would pay premium prices for food produced on environmentally responsible family farms. But they can do so only if we build the new cooperatives and markets that link them with the farmers who have what they want.
As matters stand, the prairie land that welcomed my homesteading great-great-grandfather is beginning to look too much like the feudal country he left behind. It does not have to be that way. This Congress can create genuine opportunity in rural America, build stronger communities and serve consumers better.

HEADLINE: The World; 
. . . and How Two Nations Escaped It

BYLINE:  By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

 BODY:
ISRAELIS and Palestinians have been tearing at each other for so long that bloody conflict between them seems almost as foreordained as war between France and Germany seemed a century ago. Yet for nearly 50 years now, France and Germany have lived peacefully together, each the other's largest trading partner, in mutual prosperity.
 So why can't Israelis and Palestinians do it too, especially now that the Arab states have finally agreed to recognize Israel within secure borders, if Israel will accept the reality of a Palestinian state? 
 One difference is that, in separate ways, both Israelis and Palestinians still believe that fighting will allow them to achieve their aims. Fighting between France and Germany went on for hundreds of years, as long as both countries believed that war would enable one of them to dominate the rest of the European continent. So the struggle continued, from Louis XIV to Napoleon to Bismarck to Hitler, until World War II made clear that military logic would lead ultimately only to complete destruction.
Germany accepted its defeat in 1945, and a few years later Konrad Adenauer united with France and the rest of western Europe, economically supported by the United States, against the Soviet threat.
Now the Soviet Union is gone, but Europeans have never had it so good and fighting between France and Germany is literally unthinkable.
For all the horror of suicide bombings and crushing Israeli military sweeps, neither Israelis nor Palestinians have yet reached the low point -- the "zero hour," the Germans call it -- that Europe reached in 1945. Both Israelis and Palestinians see themselves as doomed to violence, and each thinks it can somehow prevail: Israel by military superiority, ensured by the United States, and the Palestinians by wearing down the Israelis with intifadas and suicide bombers.
Europeans gave up irreconcilable claims against each other after World War II and united in the belief that peace and trade with each other, in an alliance with the United States, was their best guarantee of security.
Israelis and Palestinians are still making irreconcilable claims on the land they both occupy. 
And, though both sides trust Washington as an interlocutor, it is hard to imagine that they see the United States as some of the Europeans did in both 1917 and 1945 -- as the only country that could save them from what they could do to themselves.

Realizing the American Dream

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Homeownership, long a dream of Americans, is more and more a reality. Sixty-eight percent of adult Americans owned their own homes in the fourth quarter of 2001, according to the Census Bureau. 
That is the highest level since the agency began keeping track of such data.
 The highest rate of homeownership is in the Midwest, while the lowest is in the West. The difference can be explained in part by demo-graphics, according to Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. The Midwest, he said, generally has an older, more stable population. "The West has been a gateway to immigrants, and they are predominantly young and low income," he said.

Lower Expectations For the Stock Market

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
Affluent investors have scaled down their expectations for the stock market over the next decade to single-digit annual returns, according to a new survey.
The respondents estimated that the annual return for stocks over the next 10 years would be 9.5 percent, compared with projections of 13.5 percent immediately after Sept. 11. 
 "Recent events like the Sept. 11 attacks, the collapse of Enron and other incidents around the world have greatly tempered the previous high level of expectations of affluent Americans, which are now much more grounded in reality," said Elliot Savitzky, senior vice president of the Opinion Research Corporation, which conducted the survey from March 15 to 24. It has a margin for error of plus or minus five percentage points, the company said. 
 Looking at the shorter term, respondents forecast stock market returns of 7.6 percent over the next six months. 
The survey was based on a national sampling of 2,044 adults with investments of at least $100,000. Their average portfolio was $738,000, and their average investment allocation was 37 percent in equities, 20 percent in cash, 13 percent in fixed-income instruments and 30 percent in other investments, including real estate.

HEADLINE: Special-Purpose Entities: Complicated but Useful 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "The Brick Stood Up Before. But Now?" (March 10) went a long way toward distinguishing between apparent abuses of special-purpose entities and the legitimate uses of these critically important financial structures. S.P.E.'s have been tarred with a broad brush recently, but in fact they represent American financial innovation at its best. 
 S.P.E.'s are a vehicle to which companies sell pools of cash-producing assets, like loans. The entities then issue asset-backed securities to investors and provide businesses with access to new capital, often at a lower cost than is available elsewhere. Consumers also benefit: homeowners, credit card borrowers, students and car buyers gain access to more widely available credit and lower interest rates. Simply put, the beneficial use of these and other types of S.P.E.'s helps America's economy run better and more efficiently.
It is our strong hope that the collective wisdom of Congress, financial regulators and the industry will ensure that remedies developed to address what happened at Enron do not harm the economy, or impair the ability of businesses and the financial markets to operate as efficiently as possible.

BYLINE:  By ANDREA KANNAPELL

 BODY:
MIDEAST -- The second week of Israeli raids aimed at the "Palestinian terror infrastructure" destroyed far more, while U.S. calls for "immediate withdrawal" went unheeded and suicide bombers struck again.
 Fighting left the the centuries-old casbah in Nablus in ruins, and there was vast destruction -- along with rumors of massacres that the Israelis denied -- in Jenin. In many West Bank areas, roadways and buildings were demolished, and families hid inside their houses, running out of food and water. Many injured were untreated; many dead lay unburied. Fire and gunfire damaged the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, and a priest was wounded by an Israeli sniper trying to pick off one of the 200 Palestinians inside. By week's end, more than 4,000 Palestinians had been at least briefly arrested and an unknown number -- possibly hundreds more -- were dead, while 28 Israeli soldiers had been killed. 
 And shelling by Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas at the Lebanese border prompted Israel to suggest that it might retaliate directly against Syria. 
The Israelis said that 20 suicide-bomb labs had been found in Nablus and that more than 100 men arrested in Jenin were on Israel's "wanted" list. Bomb supplies and disguises for suicide bombers were found in the headquarters of the Palestinian office of preventive security, they said. They gave the U.S. documents that they said linked the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, which organizes suicide bombings. At Mr. Sharon's request, his rival on the right, Benjamin Netanyahu, flew to Washington with the message that "Yasir Arafat's terrorist regime must be toppled, not courted." Is reconciliation possible? Page 1. 
Arab protests turned more violent, with a fatality in Egypt and another in Yemen. A fuel truck rammed into a synagogue in Tunis. Turkey, Israel's best friend in the region, called the raids "genocide." Iraq, saying it hoped to disrupt the U.S. economy, stopped its oil exporting, sending oil prices up. 
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell repeated the calls for withdrawal as he flew from Morocco to Madrid to Egypt, meeting with incensed Arab and European leaders. Shifting alliances, Page 5. He arrived in Israel after the first suicide bombing in 10 days, a bus attack that killed eight, and met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who said the raids would continue. 
Then, another suicide bomber struck near a Jerusalem market, killing six. Mr. Powell postponed a Saturday meeting with Mr. Arafat, insisting on a statement condemning the attack. Yesterday Mr. Arafat complied, and the meeting was scheduled for today. 

AFGHANISTAN -- More than 10,000 Afghan refugees began returning from Pakistan after Afghan poppy farmers ended violent protests against a government program to plow under their fields. But in western Afghanistan, fighting between warlords delayed the start of a U.N.-backed plan to repatriate some two million Afghans living in camps in Iran. A second earthquake in three weeks struck in the north, killing at least 30.
Since late October, the U.S. has dropped more than 22,000 bombs and missiles on Afghanistan, military officials said, and about 75 percent -- a relatively high rate -- hit their targets. Precision-guided weapons, which made up over half the ordnance, had about 90 percent accuracy. That also means that more than a third had a much lower accuracy rate of just over 50 percent and that more than 5,000 bombs went astray. 
Four hundred families gave petitions to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul asking for compensation for the loss of family members and homes. Neither the Defense Department nor the State Department has advised the embassy on how to respond. 
In the eastern city of Jalalabad, a bomb exploded as a crowd waited to greet the defense minister, killing 4 and injuring 18. It was the latest evidence of a campaign to undermine the U.S.-backed interim government. 
The U.N. sent a forensic team to the Bamiyan region, about 80 miles northwest of Kabul, to investigate reports of mass graves. The Taliban long targeted a religious and ethnic minority there, the Hazara. It is the same region that held the two huge 1,500-year-old statues of Buddha, which were destroyed by Taliban soldiers just over a year ago. The interim government hopes to reconstruct at least one of the statues. 

DOMESTICALLY -- Congress took the first steps toward an overhaul of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has been faulted for laxness and ineptitude since the Sept. 11 attacks. Does any government agency actually work? Page 4.
The White House tried to defuse a month of tensions by allowing Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security, to brief a House subcommittee. But lawmakers insisted that they should be able to question him at will. The next day, a top administration official said President Bush was considering making Mr. Ridge's position cabinet-level, putting him unambiguously under Congressional oversight. Congress is most interested in how he coordinated the administration's request for an extra $5.1 billion for domestic security this year, and $38 billion for next year. ANDREA KANNAPELL

HEADLINE: China's Growing Deserts Are Suffocating Korea 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, April 12 

 BODY:
School was called off throughout much of this sprawling city last Monday because of inclement weather.
 It was not a freak spring snow storm, a heat wave or torrential rains. 
 Rather, it was an immense cloud of dust that blew in from China's fast-spreading deserts, about 750 miles away. 
It hid Seoul from view throughout the morning, obscuring the sunrise just as surely as the heaviest of fogs. Clinics overflowed with patients complaining of breathing problems, drugstores experienced a run on cough medicines and face masks that supposedly filter the air, and parks and outdoor malls were nearly empty of pedestrians. 
With the arrival of the huge dust storms for the third consecutive year, Koreans have begun to grimly resign themselves to the addition of an unwelcome fifth season -- already dubbed the season of yellow dust -- to the usual four seasons that any temperate country knows.
Like the harmattan in West Africa, when skies throughout that region turn a soupy gray for weeks at a time because of seasonal wind patterns that bring airborne dust southward from the Sahara, Korea's new season is a disturbing reminder for Asians of global interconnectedness and the perils of environmental degradation.
"There is no way for us to deter this," said Kim Seung Bae, deputy director of South Korea's national weather service. "All we can do is try to forecast the yellow dust storms as early as possible, but with the current technology we can only detect it one day ahead of time at best. For now, our main innovation will be to add predictions of the intensity of the dust to our weather reports."
In Seoul, a measurement of 70 micrograms of dust per cubic meter of air is considered normal during most of the year. At 1,000 micrograms, experts say, serious health warnings are indicated. Earlier this week, in the fourth storm of the season, a record measurement of 2,070 micrograms was reached in this city. Mr. Kim said two or three more storms could hit Korea this month.
Scientists say the dust storms, which are distinctly visible on regional satellite weather maps as gigantic yellow blobs, are the result of the rapid desertification in China and a prolonged drought affecting that country and other parts of Northeast Asia. 
The term yellow dust refers to the color of the sand when it coats parked cars and windows rather than the color of the skies, which all this last week were a thick, acrid gray.
According to China's Environmental Protection Agency, the Gobi grew by 20,000 square miles from 1994 to 1999, and its steadily advancing edge now sits a mere 150 miles north of Beijing. As in West Africa, which weather experts say is the world's leading source of dust, China's environmental changes are accelerating because of overfarming, overgrazing and the widespread destruction of forests.
But unlike West Africa's dust, which is carried to the southern United States by winds known as the tropical easterlies, dust from the Gobi and Taklimakan deserts in rapidly industrializing China is binding with toxic industrial pollutants, including arsenic, cadmium and lead, increasing the health threat.
Changes like these have long made springtime synonymous with respiratory distress in Beijing. 
But as the dust storms have grown, their impact has been spreading rapidly eastward, blighting the air over the Korean peninsula and beyond.
This has been an unusually dusty spring in Tokyo, for example, and fingerlike plumes of the airborne sand now travel 7,000 miles aboard the jet stream reaching Portland, Ore., and San Francisco, where the main effect so far has been to create breathtaking sunsets.
"There is no smoking gun yet that proves that man is causing this," said Charles S. Zender, a professor of earth system science at the University of California at Irvine, "but rather lots of anecdotal evidence."
"The puzzle of Asian dust is a huge question in weather science right now," he said, "and if human activity is proven to be the cause, it stands to reason that this problem is going to keep getting worse."
As a mood of resignation has set in over the persistence of this phenomenon, Koreans have already begun to focus on the economic costs. What was only recently regarded here as a minor nuisance is now seen as posing a serious threat in areas as diverse as public health, travel, retail shopping and even high-tech manufacturing.
This last week, for example, in addition to the school closures, scores of domestic flights have been canceled because of poor visibility. Workplace absenteeism has risen, too, and retail sales have dipped, as a result of people staying indoors.
"I've had a little bit of a cough," said Choi Byoung Su, 30, a businessman who was at a downtown pharmacy stocking up on medicine for a sore throat, which he said was caused by the dust storms. "I'm not too concerned about my health for now, but it is really a hassle for my car," he said, explaining that he needed to have it washed at least once a day now.
Even South Korea's major industries are suddenly complaining about the worsening effects of the storms. Semiconductor manufacturers, for example, which are highly sensitive to contaminants, have reportedly had to change their sophisticated air filters much more frequently and require workers to take longer showers before beginning assembly work. Workers are also being discouraged from entering and exiting the factories any more than is strictly necessary.
Hyundai Motor, meanwhile, a major automobile manufacturer, has reportedly begun to wax its cars differently and shrink wrap them in plastic sheeting before export to protect them from the dust.

HEADLINE: Southeast Asia's Press Is Under Pressure 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, April 9 

 BODY:
A bitter fight in Thailand between the government and the press reached a high point recently when a cable station was suddenly interrupted, cutting off a critic of the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in midsentence.
 Afterward, the Nation Group, which controls the editorial content of the station, accused the government of deliberately interrupting the transmission of an interview with a former foreign minister, Prasong Soonsiri, a well-known opponent of the current prime minister. 
 The editor of the Nation Group, Thepchai Yong, said he believed the transmission was cut on the orders of the government. 
If so, the blackout was the most obvious of a number of moves against the press in Thailand, particularly against the Nation Group, a major media company, which started a feisty Thai language newspaper last year. As well as attacking the company, the government threatened to expel two journalists who work for the Far Eastern Economic Review, banned an issue of The Economist and ordered the office that combats money laundering to investigate the personal finances of Thai journalists. 
After the shakeout from the Asian financial crisis five years ago, there were high hopes that a more open press would emerge in the region, along with greater transparency in law, banking and commerce. Some believed that one of the lessons of the meltdown would be the need for a better-informed and more vibrant discussion of important issues. 
But across Southeast Asia, governments have shown little patience with press freedom. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, some of those with Muslim populations have objected to the interpretation of Islam in Western magazines and pulled issues from newsstands.
Malaysia, which has repeatedly hamstrung its newspapers, has held up the distribution of issues of Western magazines, including Time. In Bangladesh, an issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review, owned by Dow Jones & Company, was banned this month because it described the nation as a "cocoon of terror." 
Few people assert that an across-the-board crackdown on the press is under way. Rather, they say, a free press is having a hard time establishing permanent roots. 
"What we're seeing is a messy contentious battle with freedom of the press around the region," said Lin Neumann, the Asia consultant for the Committee to Protect Journalists, which is based in New York.
The nervousness about press freedoms comes as Washington is cutting back on support for the media in the region. The war on terror has prompted a retreat from Clinton-era programs that gave American money for journalism training and start-up financing for newspapers as countries moved away from authoritarian forms of government. 
The idea in the 1990's was to help set up newspapers and television outlets that would encourage pluralism, foster debate and plant the seeds of democracy. That policy is now being edged out by a new Bush priority of assisting primary and secondary education, particularly in countries with large Muslim populations, American officials said. 
In Indonesia, for example, Washington is planning to cut back on a nongovernmental group, Inter News, which specialized in training Indonesian journalists, and to increase funding for government-run schools. 
The problem in Indonesia is not so much restrictions on the news media, although the government did bar a prominent Australian correspondent, Lindsay Murdoch of The Sydney Morning Herald, from completing his three-year assignment. 
For the most part, according to Mr. Neumann and some local journalists, Indonesia suffers from too much press of inferior quality. About 600 newspapers, many of them retailers of rumor and innuendo, have opened since the fall of President Suharto in 1998. Gone are the days under President Suharto when the quality newsmagazine, Tempo, was banned. 
Under President Megawati Sukarnoputri, the explosion of newspapers has included tabloids with titles like Wow, Sexxy, Lipstick and Pop. For her part, Mrs. Megawati is suspicious of the press, and recently her staff ruled that reporters covering her must stay at a distance and may not toss impromptu questions at her. 
Since 1999, Indonesia has had a law prohibiting censorship. It contains a provision calling for two years in prison for "standing in the way" of a free press. Some news outlets have taken advantage of the new liberties. On Oct. 9, one newspaper carried a front-page headline that said "Satan America." The same newspaper carried a headline that said "Bush and Blair to the gallows." 
Even though there are rowdy headlines, and often titillating stories about political scandals, the Indonesian press is not as free as it may seem. Often, journalists in Indonesia, many of whom earn less than $100 a month, are paid by politicians or others to slant articles and ignore the facts, according to the Alliance of Independent Journalists in Jakarta. About 80 percent of Indonesian journalists avail themselves of what is known as "envelope journalism," meaning payment of a bribe, the alliance said in a recent report. "Such low wages often lead to justifying the acceptance of bribes or 'envelopes,' which clearly hampers a journalist's integrity and independence," the association said. 
A former Indonesian attorney general, Ali Said, once said: "I fear 10 soldiers more than 100 journalists, from whom I can protect myself through 100 envelopes." 
In Thailand, Mr. Thaksin, a wealthy businessman with a thin skin who became prime minister, has made a concerted effort to tame what he sees as a challenging press. Mr. Thepchai, the editor of the Nation Group, said he viewed the effort to investigate the personal finances of journalists as "government intimidation of the media."
"It doesn't bode well for the media," he said. 
The difficulties for the Nation Group intensified, Mr. Thepchai said, after the Nation newspaper criticized the government for wanting to deport two reporters for the Far Eastern Economic Review. 
"The prime minister is a very successful businessman who doesn't brook any criticism," the editor said. 
The authoritarian rulers of the 1970's did not tolerate dissent either. But, Mr. Thepchai said, the current situation is more disappointing. "Then at least we knew whom we were facing," he said.

HEADLINE: Founder Watches His Educational Charity Move Toward Independence 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Evidence of the Rose family's philanthropic largesse abounds in New York, from the Rose Center for Earth and Science at the American Museum of Natural History to the Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center and the Rose Main Reading Room at the New York Public Library. 
 But the cause that has captured Daniel Rose's heart, mind and a hunk of his wealth is the Harlem Educational Activities Fund, a nonprofit program that helps children from Central Harlem and Washington Heights get into the best public high schools and then into college. 
 "Isn't it brilliant?" Mr. Rose clucks proudly, pointing to pictures of national championship chess teams whose members were coached, cajoled and coddled by the fund. "Not the darlings of Dalton, with their expensive private coaches and proud parents, not the Russian kids from Brighton Beach who have chess in their genes, but kids from the inner city, from right here in Harlem." 
Mr. Rose, a senior member of a family that has built a fortune in real estate, speaks with the fervor of a highly educated evangelist and he is indeed on a mission. At 72, Mr. Rose's dearest wish is that the fund, which has relied on him for most of its financial and moral support since he founded it in 1991, comes to stand on its own and that it receives the recognition and independent financing he thinks it deserves. 
"The goal is to not only have it outlive me, but to continue its trajectory of growth and achievement," he said. "I'm embarrassed and concerned that it is seen as a one-man show precisely at the time when it is emerging as such a successful, more disciplined program."
There is no one recipe for the successful transition of the many small nonprofit groups that are the pet projects of philanthropists or inspired founders. Were there such a recipe, Mr. Rose would certainly be following it. Rather, these groups have tried different strategies with different results. There is Studio in a School, the art education program founded by Agnes Gund, which is flourishing since Ms. Gund stepped down. Then there is the Martha Graham Dance Company, which has gasped for breath ever since Miss Graham died. 
"These institutions have had very different experiences institutionalizing themselves," said Richard A. Mittenthal, president of the Conservation Company, which advises nonprofit groups. "There's no one good way of making the transition."
After toiling in relative obscurity for more than a decade, the fund is finally getting some attention. Which explains Mr. Rose's skittishness about granting an interview -- strange for a man who is so talkative that his wife, Joanna, has been known to hold up placards in fund meetings reading, "Shut up, Dan." 
The fund is making its transition in tandem with Sean Scott, its first participant, who will graduate from Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey next month. "I knew where I wanted to go, and HEAF gave me what I needed to get there," said Mr. Scott, one of 2,050 students helped by the fund. 
Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of African-American studies at Harvard University and a member of the fund's board, recalled his surprise on first meeting Mr. Rose, who pulled a picture of Mr. Scott from his wallet. "He was even carrying a copy of his report card," Professor Gates said. "I was so taken by Dan's enthusiasm and that someone like him had the audacity to think he could do something about public education in New York." 
Mr. Rose's reduced role is already having an impact on the fund. The 15-member board has been organized into formal committees, and all members attended the December meeting, a first, and they are asking tough questions.
"The transition is getting off to a good start, I think," said George Price, a retired general and longtime board member. "This process is going to give HEAF not only a good chance of surviving but of growing and thriving." 
The board's stepped-up involvement has started to pay off. For instance, the staff was concerned about a drop in the academic ability of children joining the fund's program, which they attributed to efforts to draw students from a wider variety of schools. But board members insisted on a full report, and to the staff's surprise, statistics showed no academic difference between newer and older participants. Rather, limited social skills accounted for the differences, and so social workers were hired, saving the fund a costly misallocation of money. The board's new scrutiny "has added a layer of rigor to what we do, and that's challenging," said Courtney Welsh, the executive director. 
The board is trying hard to pare costs. Mr. Rose likes to say that over a decade the fund spends $25,000 on each participant, which consultants say is relatively high. 
The secret to the fund's success may well lie in expenditures beyond those costs. The fund helps pay for everything from driver education classes to a navy blazer for an interview. Every participant goes to college armed with an 800 number to call and gets frequent care packages as well. For younger students there are speech classes, Broadway tickets and dining at fine restaurants. "We're basically doing what middle-class parents do for their kids," Mr. Rose said, "and what our parents would do if they had the wherewithal." 
The board must find a way to maintain that role while reining in costs. Doing that is tricky, said Gary Walker of the research group Public/Private Ventures, because the fund's longterm and intensive dedication to its students is key to its success. "We find very few programs around the country that deal with kids who are as high-risk as those HEAF brings in," he said, "and then sticks with them through college, whatever it takes." 
In a way, the fund's search for a future beyond Mr. Rose's involvement parallels the students' search for a future beyond the fund. "I need to prove to myself that I can do some things without HEAF," said Yasmin Moya, a 2000 graduate of Bryn Mawr who is teaching third grade at her old school, P.S. 192 in Washington Heights. 
The fund is helping her pay for graduate courses, and Mr. Rose has written a recommendation for her application to become an Urban Fellow in New York. There has even been a discussion about whether the fund should help pay for her wedding this summer. "I go back and forth on how much support is too much," Ms. Moya said. "I know I can succeed, but by how much?" 
As Mr. Rose lessens his involvement in the fund, a complicating factor is that contributions, like those to other small nonprofit groups, have fallen as the economy and stock markets have weakened. 
Pressed, Mr. Rose will only say that he and his wife have contributed "what a banker would call mid- to high-seven figures" to the fund over the years. The rest has come from close to 500 other donors, most of whom have given between $1,000 and $10,000. 
Those donations have dropped so much that the fund almost had to cancel a summer camp program that was one of its more controversial projects. The staff originally objected to Mr. Rose's idea of shipping students off to the same camps where Manhattan's wealthy send their children.
He persisted, though, and the program was a huge success, with camps lining up to shoulder a portion of the costs. When the fund moved to eliminate the program earlier this year, the camps agreed to plug the hole in the budget to keep it alive, Mr. Rose said. But why didn't Mr. Rose just write a check himself, as he might have done before he started reducing his role? "It's a weaning process," he said.

HEADLINE: After Killing Brooklyn Teacher In Poconos, Man Kills Himself 

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
Less than a day after a man shot his wife to death in Pennsylvania on Thursday, investigators located him in a tiny Brooklyn motel room by tracing his cellular phone calls across state lines, the authorities said yesterday.
 But as the police in Brooklyn crept close to the motel, the Riviera Motor Inn, on Atlantic Avenue in East New York, and prepared to storm the room, they saw through the window that the man they were pursuing was already dead, the victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
 The suicide of the man, Sean David White, 32, on Friday ended a two-state odyssey that left his estranged wife, Dalvis Small-White, a teaching coordinator in a Brooklyn school, dead inside her home in Smithfield Township, a tiny village in the Pocono region of eastern Pennsylvania. Ignoring an order of protection that his wife had obtained against him in January, Mr. White entered her home early Thursday morning and shot her in the head, arm and leg with a .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, the authorities said. 
The couple moved to Pennsylvania from Brooklyn about three years ago, said Mark Pazuhanich, an assistant district attorney in Monroe County, Pa. Mrs. Small-White, 33, left her husband nearly a year ago and was living about a quarter-mile away with her 14-year-old son, Casheem Gaines, Mr. Pazuhanich said.
It was Casheem who called the Pennsylvania State Police on Thursday morning to report that his mother and Mr. White were arguing violently in the house, Mr. Pazuhanich said. He said the troopers who took the call reported hearing gunshots while Casheem was on the line.
While a motive has not yet been established, witnesses saw the couple arguing last week at an H & R Block tax office in Stroudsburg, Pa., Mr. Pazuhanich said..
Mrs. Small-White commuted every morning from the Poconos to Brooklyn, where she had just been promoted from a schoolteacher to a teaching coordinator for District 16, he said. Mr. White was unemployed but was living off the proceeds of a large settlement he had received from the New York Police Department in a civil case, Mr. Pazuhanich said. No further information was available yesterday about the case, but he said Mr. White had expensive audiovisual equipment in his home and drove a luxury sports utility vehicle.
When he fled to Brooklyn after the shooting, he left his own son, Sean Jr., 8, behind in Pennsylvania alone, Mr. Pazuhanich said.
Mr. White was tracked to New York by the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Fugitive Task Force, a unit that is made up of both city police officers and federal agents, the police said.

Memories Would Not Be Enough In Montreal

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
IF this is the last go-round, if there is no future for a baseball team that has become more the unwanted property of major league baseball than the city of Montreal's, then what will Claude Raymond tell 4-year-old Thierry when the boy is old enough to ask which team his grandpa played for?
 "I'll say, 'I was the first French-Canadian to play for the Expos,' and he'll say, 'The Expos? Who's that?' " Raymond said in the visitors' clubhouse at Shea Stadium. "And that will break my heart." 
 Weeks before his 65th birthday, at the start of a season heartlessly billed as the probable prelude to extinction, Joseph Claude Marc Raymond has, apparently just in time, made it back into the uniform for the team he pitched for, even when he was in the employ of another major league club. 
It was the winter of 1968-69 when the Expos, an expansion team without a game to its name, called the Atlanta Braves and wondered if they might borrow Raymond, the Braves' veteran relief pitcher by way of St. Jean, Quebec, to help rouse the Montreal business community, a 15-minute drive from where he grew up.
"I made calls and sold tickets and was thrilled to do it for them," Raymond said. "Major league baseball in Montreal was a dream come true." By August of the following season, traded from Atlanta to Montreal, with dozens of his neighbors from St. Jean cramming into old Jarry Park to watch him pitch, Raymond did not want to be pinched.
He was 10 years old when Jackie Robinson played for the old Montreal Royals at Delorimier Yards. Raymond's youth included nights watching the likes of Duke Snider and Don Drysdale pass through French Quebec, on their way to greatness in Dodger blue. "The Royals set minor league attendance records," he said. "Montreal was a great baseball town. Still could be."
Few people, if any, agree with the man who retired from the Expos in 1971 to spend three decades calling their games on radio and television and working in community relations. Now there are no games on TV to call and the community doesn't want to be related to. The Montreal fans went away long before the last owner, Jeffrey Loria, bailed out to take control of the Florida Marlins. Bud Selig, the commissioner on a mission to contract two teams, turned the Expos into the house franchise last winter, guaranteeing them life support for one season under the management of Omar Minaya in the front office and Frank Robinson on the field.
Raymond, given the title of roving coach as spring training began, said: "I can't believe it's the last year. I just can't."
The bespectacled, gray-haired man they call Frenchy can't forget the nights when every seat in Jarry Park was taken, when fans even came out to stand, when peanut vendors could get whiplash from answering all the calls for a bag. "The place had a buzz," Raymond said sadly, knowing that Olympic Stadium, the Expos' poorly conceived home since 1977, now has the reputation of the baseball graveyard it may very well be.
It was the eerie quiet that startled Robinson one night after the Expos drew 34,351 for the home opener with, of all teams, the Marlins. "We had the owner thing going so the fans were into it that night," he said. For Game 2, the announced crowd was 4,771, and Robinson said the place was so quiet he could eavesdrop on box-seat conversations.
He also caught the irony of the Expos' trip to South Florida before they hit New York for the weekend series they evened yesterday with an 11-inning, 9-8 victory. The Marlins drew roughly 23,000 for their home opener. "They ran out of hot dogs and there were no programs," Robinson said. By Thursday night the crowd was 4,466, and Claude Raymond, among others, was asking: "They want to contract us?"
He knows Montreal at least has a history of requited public affection; as recently as 1994 the Expos were in first place with a partial season's attendance of nearly 1.3 million when the players struck. They never recovered, and the selling off of quality players became a virtual death wish, as baseball slipped into the current era of economic imbalance for which there is no remedy in sight.
For years, pro-labor critics have told baseball's big-market owners to share more television revenue with the little guys, the way they do it in football. Turns out the players aren't too keen on that, either. They don't want to discourage the moneyed owners from forever stretching the salary scale. For all of the owners' fudging of their financials, the players refuse to accept much responsibility, if any, for the yawning disparity so apparent already this season in New York, which has been visited, in order, by the budget-challenged likes of Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay and now Montreal.
Raymond hopes that these Expos, who are not without talent, can win enough to attract a new owner and that his team will get a stay of execution, even if it means it is shifted south of the border. "At least the franchise wouldn't die," he said. "At least the players like Steve Rogers and Gary Carter will say, 'That's the team I played for, when it was in Montreal.' "
At least his grandson, who attended opening day and, as Raymond said, "got to see Pappy in his uniform," will know his grandfather dressed for the first major league baseball team in Quebec, and the last.

HEADLINE: For the Crossroads of the World, Far Less Traffic From Foreign Tourists Since Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
The Rev. Richard Watkins, pastor of Mount Neboh Baptist Church, sees the problem in the empty pews and collection plates each Sunday.
 Not so long ago, Harlem churches like Mount Neboh would be packed with hundreds of foreign tourists. The foreign visitors dropped money in the collection plates. The tour operators who brought them also made generous donations. 
 But on a recent Sunday, Mount Neboh, on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, had only about 60 foreign guests in the balcony of its sparsely filled sanctuary. 
"Our European clientele has dropped 78 percent since Sept. 11," James Davis, a sales manager at Harlem Spirituals, a tour company, explained while standing in the balcony at Mount Neboh. "We are all hurting."
As many New York businesses report improvements since Sept. 11, and many hotels have fewer vacancies, local businesses that depend on foreign tourism say that they are still in pain. It may be easier to get a ticket to see the Statue of Liberty these days, but city officials say the downturn is terrible for the economy. That is because foreigners make up about 18 percent of the annual tourists to New York, but generate 42 percent of the revenue in the industry, according to NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau. (The city defines a tourist as anyone who travels at least 50 miles one way or stays overnight, excluding commuters.) 
At the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square, for instance, the usual throngs of Japanese and German tourists are nowhere to be found. .
Along the streets of Chinatown, business leaders say, the American tourists are back but there are not many foreigners looking for discounts. Their absence has even hit the boutiques on the Upper East Side and in SoHo.
According to NYC & Company, the average foreign visitor spends about $1,040 per trip to New York, compared with $319 per visit from domestic tourists. Among tourists who stay in hotels, rather than with friends and relatives, tourism officials say, the difference between foreign and domestic visitors is even greater.
"We are seeing a lot of people from the Midwest and New York," said Robert Ianniello, president of the Little Italy Merchants Association, whose 54 members include Italian and Chinese businesses around Mulberry Street. "They are bringing American dollars to an American city, but international tourists are so important."
Experts have different explanations. "A lot of it has do with what is broadcast on the foreign media, and if you are sitting in some province in the south of Germany and all you are seeing are pictures of ground zero, you are thinking New York is not a place to be right now," said Jeffrey Stewart, vice president at the Travel Business Roundtable, a lobbying and marketing group based in Washington.
Mr. Stewart, who works in New York, also cited cultural differences. "In Japan, part of the reason they are not coming is that they saw our city as going through a mourning period and that it would be disrespectful to come so soon," he said. 
Economic problems in countries that provide the greatest number of high-spenders are contributing as well.
"In a lot of countries we have a double whammy," Dr. Lalia Rach, dean of the Tisch Center for Travel, Tourism and Hospitality at New York University, said of the fears of terrorism and the weak economies in some countries of Europe, Asia and South America. She noted that economic slowdowns are occurring in five of the top six countries for foreign tourism to New York: Germany, France, Japan, Brazil and Italy.
In other countries, like Argentina, that send fewer tourists but some of the most free-wheeling spenders, economic problems and a strong dollar have hurt tourism to the United States. The foreigners most likely to come, officials say, are those who live close to the United States, or those who have already been to the city. 
Catriona Watson, 27, a marketing worker from Melbourne, Australia, is an example of what tourism officials hope catches on quickly. "A lot of people coming here want to see ground zero, and to see the rest of New York at this profound time," Ms. Watson said, explaining the reason for her 10-day trip to the city.
One country that has continued to contribute tourists to New York is England, where a better economy than many other countries and close business and political ties have helped, officials said.
John Hillhouse, 50, a tourist from Chester, England, who was visiting the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Washington Heights recently, put it this way: "We have had terrorism for years. To tell you the truth, we are not going to let things like that bother us. We are brothers in arms, and America deserves support from our country."
But support from the British is not enough for people like Muriel Samama. A French immigrant who has led Harlem Spirituals tours for almost 15 years, Ms. Samama, the president, said her company had been forced to lay off half of its 14 employees, drop contract tour guides and bus drivers and expand its operations in other areas of the city.
"The week after Sept. 11 we registered 4,000 cancellations," she said, adding that foreign visitors made up about 90 percent of her business at the time. In 2000, Harlem Spirituals gave tours to 100,000 people and grossed $2.5 million. "I don't even want to think about this year's numbers," Ms. Samama added.
For Kenneth Woods, the situation is no better. Mr. Woods, a manager at Sylvia's, the Harlem soul food restaurant that in recent years has become a popular stop for foreign tourists, said international business had dropped 80 percent since September. "Normally this time of year we would have a great influx of international tourists," he said from the hardly packed dining room. "We are really hurting."
Even in places like the Upper East Side boutiques and galleries on Madison Avenue, where the drop has been less severe, it has still been noticeable. "I think everyone was concerned," said Matthew Bauer, the president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District. "We have luckily been able to weather the storm because much of our clientele comes here often or have apartments here and consider themselves part-time New Yorkers."
City tourism officials are so concerned that Cristyne L. Nicholas, the president of NYC & Company, has devoted an increasing amount of her time to the international market. Ms. Nicholas has played host to travel agents, tour operators, journalists and others from foreign countries, and has traveled to Paris, Berlin and London in recent months. She plans a trip to Tokyo this month as a part of a federal tourism delegation led by Commerce Secretary Donald Evans. 
On her trips, Ms. Nicholas said, her agency has worked to counter perceptions that New York is overpriced or not ready for visitors. 
In many quarters, there is a new sense of appreciation for overseas travelers. On a recent weekend, a group of foreign tourists were warmly greeted by residents along a block in Hamilton Heights. "We are glad that they are back," Edward Ford, 68, said as he walked past a Harlem Spirituals bus full of tourists from Ireland, England, Mexico, Australia and Sweden. "It's good for the economy."

HEADLINE: Man Resists Two Robbers And Is Shot In the Village 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
It was like one of those terrifying crimes of 10 or 15 years ago, when the sound of gunshots was common and New Yorkers were wary of their own streets. A young couple came out of a nightclub in Greenwich Village at 2:30 a.m. yesterday and were walking to their car on a dark, deserted street when two robbers confronted them.
 It happened fast. There were only fleeting impressions: they were black men in their early 20's with thin, clean-shaven faces; one had shoulder-length dreadlocks, the other short braids; both wore dark baggy clothing, and one had on a maroon long-sleeved T-shirt. 
 One drew a small black handgun, the police said, and they demanded money. But for some reason -- perhaps pride or a protective instinct -- Kirill Nekrasov, 25, did not comply. Instead, he reached for the gun.
There was a struggle and two shots went off. Mr. Nekrasov, struck in the head and critically wounded, crumpled onto a sidewalk grate in front of the five-story tan brick apartment building at 176 West Houston Street, near Bedford Street. As the assailants ran off, Mr. Nekrasov's companion, Natalya Shimunova, 27, began screaming.
The sound of the shots awoke Richard Benedetti, 57, who retired as a police officer 16 years ago and lives just across West Houston in the Breen Towers. He looked out his second-story bedroom window as the drama unfolded.
"I heard boom, boom!" he said. "It just hit me like that. My instincts kicked in. I knew they were gunshots. Then all of a sudden, I heard a woman start screaming. She was grabbing her cellphone, trying to get help. She was real panicky."
In the shadows -- the nearest streetlamp was 25 yards away -- he saw a man lying on the sidewalk, and beside him the woman stood shrieking into her phone in heavily accented English. He said, "She's shouting, Houston Street, Houston Street," pronouncing it like the Texas city, not HOUSE-ton, the way New Yorkers say it.
"She was screaming, 'He's still breathing! He's still live! Please come! We need help!" Mr. Benedetti said he reached for his own telephone to call 911, but before he could get through he heard the sirens approaching.
Across the Avenue of the Americas, at a firehouse that is home to Engine 24 and Ladder 5, Firefighter Marcel Claes was on duty and heard banging on the front door. He pulled it open.
"A civilian was standing there and said, 'Someone was shot.'
"I said, 'How do you know he was shot?'
"He said, 'I heard it.' "
Firefighter Claes strode across the intersection, where two police cars had already pulled up. More emergency vehicles were wailing closer. "Before I had time, they were already there -- the paramedics, the cops, everybody," Firefighter Claes said. He saw the victim lying on his side, the paramedics kneeling beside him. "I could only see half his face," the firefighter said. He remembered that the man appeared to be wearing a running suit.
The paramedics hooked up an intravenous drip, lifted Mr. Nekrasov onto a stretcher and slid it into the back of an ambulance, which sped away to St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital a few blocks north. Mr. Nekrasov was listed in critical condition last night.
The detectives took Ms. Shimunova with them to ask her what she remembered of what had happened, as police cars zigzagged through the neighborhood, searching for the vanished assailants.
Aside from Ms. Shimunova, who was not injured, there appeared to be no eyewitnesses. The windows of the apartment building were dark. The real estate office on the ground floor and Z's Basement clothing store, down 12 steps beyond the fire-engine red railing, were both shut, as was the laundry and a cleaners up the block. Only the Quick Stop Gourmet Deli down West Houston was open, but the line-of-sight was bad, and nobody there saw anything, investigators said.
At the high-rise apartment building where Mr. Nekrasov lives, at 303 Beverly Road in the Kensington section of Brooklyn, friends and neighbors said that he was a Russian immigrant who had been brought by his mother, Klara, from what was then Leningrad about 23 years ago, when he was 2.
They said he was a structural engineer who had earned his degree at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and worked in Manhattan. They said that he still lived with his mother, and they described Ms. Shimunova as a college friend of Mr. Nekrasov's, not his girlfriend.
"He spends a lot of time with his mother," a cousin, Misha Gutkin, said at the hospital, where Mr. Nekrasov's mother and other relatives and friends gathered in a room to await word from the doctors. Mr. Gutkin said they had been told only that Mr. Nekrasov had been given a blood transfusion and had undergone surgery.
Luba Isayez, a neighbor, called him "a very nice boy, a very smart boy," who was "very good to his mother." She said that mother and son sometimes took walks together in nearby Prospect Park, and added: "He's very quiet. I don't even believe that he was out so late in Manhattan. He doesn't go out very often. He's always with his mother. He loves her very much."
Ms. Isayez said the mother had brought her son to the United States in search of economic, political and religious freedoms. "Everyone was leaving," she said. "They were looking for a better way of life."
Other neighbors said that the Nekrasovs had lived in the building for 10 years and attended a synagogue at East Fifth Street and Church Avenue in Kensington.
After years of declining street crime in New York, the shooting seemed like a throwback to a more dangerous era, when killings and robberies, often a result of the crack cocaine trade, were common and residents thought twice about walking out of doors late at night.
In the light of day, the scene of the crime seemed less menacing. Traffic slid by on Houston and the Avenue of the Americas, and pedestrians were out in droves in the area, a nexus of Greenwich Village and SoHo, with busy restaurants and shops, art theaters like the Film Forum and clubs down the side streets.
Under a spindly, leafless tree, bloodstains still flecked the iron grate where Mr. Nekrasov fell, despite the efforts of Vincente Gamez, the superintendent in charge of maintaining the 22 apartments at 176 West Houston. He had hosed down the sidewalk before the Saturday crowds got up .
"It's a shame," said Mr. Benedetti, the retired police officer. "I hate to say it, but that's the way life is sometimes. Not just in New York but everywhere." 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 7, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 14 about a robbery and shooting in Greenwich Village gave an outdated name for the university where the victim earned his engineering degree. An article on April 15 about the police investigation repeated the error. The institution is Polytechnic University, formerly the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. The university reported the error at the time, but this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

HEADLINE: Legal Fighting in Paradise: Fury Over Napa Vineyards 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: NAPA, Calif., April 11 

 BODY:
This wine growing region was once considered a vision of rural bliss. It was America's Arcadia, an idyllic blend of commerce and nature, where agriculture was boundlessly profitable and San Francisco's bustle, though just an hour away, was kept safely at bay.
 It still looks that way, with its nearly perfect Mediterranean climate, pastel inns and softly rolling hills, their sides draped with a geometric filigree of trellises. But for many environmentalists and residents here, Napa is another prosperous community on the brink of destruction. 
 It is not just the three million tourists who visit each year, stirring the resentments familiar in destinations that become too popular for their own good. It is also the residue of heavy industry: the 18-wheel wine tankers competing for space on two-lane roads; the removal of Douglas firs and redwoods for ever-larger vineyards; the soil erosion that has clogged the Napa River, once home to salmon and steelhead. 
Napa's alternative to suburbia has itself become the issue, as wine growers and environmental activists fight for control of the valley's trees, fields and streams. Community groups are fighting vineyard sprawl and what they call industrial wineries; grape growers say the groups threaten their livelihoods. 
Environmental lawsuits against the vineyards and the county have tied the hands of Napa's planning commission, which has begun requiring voluminous studies of water, soil, forests and fish before granting permits to expand, replant or open vineyards. Owners say approvals take years if they come at all, costing them dearly. 
The battle has spread with California's wine culture, into neighboring Sonoma and down the Pacific Coast.
"More and more people look at a vineyard and see a quarry," said Lee Hudson, who has cultivated grapes in Napa for 30 years.
Hudson Vineyards has 200 acres of lowlands in the valley and has been trying to expand plantings by 50 percent. County officials have said no. Cows graze the alfalfa and barley on one of Mr. Hudson's prime meadows, where he envisioned grapes for premium chardonnays and syrahs.
He called this madness for wine country, where farmland sells for up to $189,000 an acre. "There are people here who hate the wine industry so much they'd rather I build a feedlot or a slaughterhouse," he said.
While wine has become big business, this conflict has the intensity of a family quarrel. On one side are green, antiurban alumni of the University of California who have come to Napa to live. On the other side are green, antiurban alumni of the University of California who have come to Napa to farm.
Most vineyard owners live amid their vines. Many farm organically and use pesticides sparingly. Agriculture does not get much cleaner, and they resent the charge that they pollute.
It was in fact an alliance between grape growers and environmental activists that prompted Napa to declare itself an agricultural preserve in 1968, the first place in the United States to do so. Wine was merely a hobby then, but the policy kept Napa from becoming another Bay Area bedroom community.
"If I weren't growing grapes I'd probably be a tree hugger," said Charlie Smith, who co-founded Smith-Madrone Vineyard on Spring Mountain in the early 1970's after graduating from the University of California at Berkeley. "But I want the right to use my own land."
Yet environmentalists argue that the wine business has run amok. Vineyard owners have plundered Napa's hillsides, they say. Too many have planted on steep inclines, making for prized Zinfandels but creating erosion. Some vineyard owners cut forests anywhere it suits them, leaving beige scabs where old-growth trees once provided habitat.
"You should hear the thunder when they cut up the hills," said Chris Malan, a community advocate. "The boulders come crashing down, the snakes and bobcats are fleeing, the trees are falling. 
"For anyone who cares about the quality of life, it rocks you."
Ms. Malan is a mental health worker who became an amateur environmentalist after her grape-growing neighbor stripped a ridge in view of her back porch. She began renting planes, taking aerial surveys of vineyards to compare them with blueprints submitted to the county. She kayaks along private stretches of the Russian and Napa Rivers to peer into farmers' backyards.
Though she speaks of the environment with more passion than technical precision, her inquiry formed the basis of a lawsuit backed by the Sierra Club in 1999 against Napa and five vineyards. In a settlement late last year, the county agreed to apply California's rigorous environmental code strictly and assess each vineyard's impact on soil, water and wildlife before issuing permits.
Gridlock ensued. With more than a hundred applications pending, the county has denied permits unless vineyard owners pass lengthy environmental inspections, like those required of chemical manufacturers and oil refineries. Farmers say these cost tens of thousands of dollars for even the smallest operations and could even require them to uproot vines if problems are unearthed.
Ms. Malan and other community leaders have pushed an initiative they hope will appear on the November ballot that would compel vineyards to plant at least 350 feet from prime streams and 1,000 feet from wetlands, a requirement that farmers say could shave 10 percent off their cultivated acreage.
At a well-attended community meeting one recent evening, local residents joined San Franciscans with weekend homes in Napa to discuss the petition. Several people complained that it did not go far enough. They wanted tree cutting to stop completely. Organizers said they would have liked to do that, but were advised by lawyers that only a narrower effort to protect watersheds would withstand legal challenge. No one asked about the effect on grape growers.
Even so, the wine industry is not about to disappear. Napa has 270 vineyards covering 45,000 acres of the most complex and hospitable soil for wine grapes anywhere. While a recent glut has reduced wine prices at the low end of the market, a premium Harlan Estate Cabernet sells for $475 a bottle, and the Napa appellation ensures a premium for even the lowliest table wine.
Moreover, some of the biggest names in Napa, like the corporations behind the Mondavi and Hess brands, remain relatively quiet, their hundreds or even thousands of acres safely "in grapes" on the valley floor. The environmental push poses a bigger threat to boutique vintners who increasingly seek to cultivate on hillsides, sometimes on grades of up to 30 percent, where yields are low but the grapes robust. 
So the dispute has an internecine side, with hillside vineyard owners suspecting that some colleagues in the valley are staying out of the fray -- or even secretly backing environmentalists -- to limit competition and keep a tight lid on the valuable Napa name.
While that may be true, the politics of wine has turned tannic for everyone, including the biggest players. Ms. Malan has set her sights on stopping Australian-owned Beringer Blass Wine Estates from building a 1.5-million-square-foot winery and expanding plantings on 115 acres of what she calls "precious wetlands." In nearby Sonoma, community groups have singled out the industry goliath, E. & J. Gallo Winery.
Gallo bought the Sonoma ranch of the late actor Fred MacMurray -- rocky, heavily forested land that rises over the Russian River. When bulldozers upended trees and rearranged the landscape to ease planting, even some grape growers cried foul. They pressed the county to reject plans for Gallo's two-million-bottle winery and have sought to slow conversion of the ranch.
"There is a revolution going on against the industrial vineyard," said Martin Griffin, a longtime grape grower who helped found Friends of the Russian River. "When you do it like they do it, you might as well build subdivisions."
Like Mr. Griffin, many vineyard owners are environmentalists themselves, and most are apologetic about opposing green groups. They say they have only a few "bad apples," as Tom Gamble of the Napa Farm Bureau put it, who ignore the collateral impact of their work.
But they argue that it is really the environmentalists who have run amok. No one has shown that grape growing drove the fish from the Napa River, they say. Most fish runs ended in the 1950's, long before the wine industry took off. They acknowledge that planting vineyards requires cutting down trees, but say that the Napa Valley remains unusually forested for a prime agricultural area. They also question if trees are the best use of the land under the new world's Bordeaux.
"This is not Yosemite," said John R. Guilliams of Guilliams Vineyards. "Napa is, and should be, about wine."

 Re "Iraqi Oil Cutoff Tied to Drilling in Alaska" (news article, April 11): First the Bush administration said drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was needed to avert the California energy crisis. 
Then it asserted that drilling was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. Now we hear that it is needed because Iraq has cut off oil exports. 
 The fact that the administration's rationale changes from month to month makes me suspect that there isn't any rationale at all.

HEADLINE: Wife of a Salesman 

BYLINE:  By David Willis McCullough; David Willis McCullough's most recent book is a historical anthology, "Wars of the Irish Kings."

 BODY:
 SEA GLASS
By Anita Shreve.
378 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $25.95.
 WHEN the entire second paragraph of a novel reads: "The year is 1929. A June day. A wedding day. Honora is just 20, Sexton is 24," it is almost impossible not to hear dark background music, an ominous rumbling deep in the string section. Clearly, trouble lies ahead.
Honora had been a teller at a bank in a small town in New Hampshire when she was swept off her feet by Sexton, a handsome stranger, a typewriter salesman with a 1926 Buick whose territory, he says "covers the three P's -- Portland, Portsmouth and Providence -- and everything in between." On their wedding day, they settle into a huge old dilapidated house that had once been a convent and a home for unwed mothers. Located near a dying factory town, it is in a secluded beach community that will be familiar to readers of two of Shreve's previous novels, "Fortune's Rocks" and "The Pilot's Wife." Indeed, the house itself -- now appearing in at least its third Shreve novel -- takes on a strong presence of its own as the couple struggle to save it.
Although it is against company policy for wives to accompany their husbands, Honora is soon on the road with Sexton, demonstrating how fast and easy it is to use a typewriter as he gives his well-practiced sales pitch. Orders pour in. Commissions have never been larger, and by shaving the truth only a little bit (and not telling his wife about that) Sexton is able to get a mortgage for their tumbledown house on the beach. And it is still only Labor Day weekend, a month or so before Wall Street will crash.
Honora is the principal character in "Sea Glass," but other lives become entwined with hers. Each is first presented in isolated chapters telling their individual stories. As the novel progresses, and one by one they meet and come to know one another, the various threads are woven together, not unlike the strands of cloth produced by the imperiled cotton mills not so far from Honora and Sexton's home.
First there is McDermott (no one uses his first name), a 20-year-old millworker who is as direct and honest as Sexton is devious. Having worked among the looms since he was 12, he is all but deaf, but can anyone doubt that -- when the time is right -- he and Honora will fall in love? There is little Alphonse, a French Canadian the age McDermott was when he went to work, who lives with his mother and five brothers and sisters in a grim industrial slum and seems doomed to a life worthy of one of Dickens's blacking-factory boys. And there is wealthy, madcap, not-altogether-sober Vivian, one of the summer people up from the big city, who has an investment adviser smart enough to keep her Depression-proof. Is there any doubt that she will have a heart of gold and generosity to match, once -- of course -- she meets Honora?
Hard times bring these people together. Sexton loses his territory, and the bank is about to foreclose on the house. He is lucky to get a low-paying job at one of the factories. The already hellish living and working conditions in town become worse as some mills close and others desperately cut hours and speed up the machines to get more out of their workers in less time. The call goes out for a strike from McDermott and some of the other union leaders. And what better place for a secret strike headquarters than Sexton's house at the beach? It's huge and besides a wife who knows how to cook, he has an invaluable typewriter and duplicating machine that he never gave back when he lost his sales job.
At first, the strike provides all the fun and excitement of an MGM musical, with Judy and Mickey putting on a show in the barn. Until everything goes tragically wrong, all involved are having the time of their lives. There's drama and tension and more food than most of them can ever remember eating. A strike newspaper has to be published. Even comic relief is provided by two professional organizers from New York, who talk like bad translations of Karl Marx. Shreve's characters are not complex, but what makes the strike scenes so successful is the slowly growing, guilt-ridden realization of these people that they are very much enjoying the sheer fun that is buried in the serious -- and dangerous -- work they are doing.
The elements are here for unabashed soap opera, complete with that overbearing background music. The book's title, for example, refers to worn and polished bits of glass that Honora picks up along the beach and arranges on an antique white platter. The smooth colored shards are contrived to be brought onstage at key moments in the story. Someone always asks what they are. After an all but tangible pause for that unheard music to swell, someone else points out that it is "garbage" or "trash" that through the pounding of the sea has been revealed to be beautiful and tough. Sea glass doesn't break. And this mismatched collection of people that adversity has brought to Honora's endangered home? A reader would have to have a heart of stone to ignore the moral of the tale, the meaning of it all.
But Shreve does not use her characters frivolously. They reveal who they are through their actions, with the author -- who writes with admirable economy -- rarely having to point a finger or underline the obvious. The true power of her novel comes from the appalling social conditions she describes so vividly, the grim but heroic lives her characters live. When members of the old British Labor Party belted out the hymn with William Blake's words about "dark satanic mills," they were singing of the same injustice that Shreve is now writing about with equal fervor. And she makes it very easy to share both her outrage and her sadness about the fates of Honora, McDermott and the rest.
Still, there is something almost quaintly antique about all this, something of a Colonial Williamsburg reconstruction with industrial grit. You wonder what this muckraking spirit would do if it were unleashed on a contemporary social outrage.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley's Spy Game 

BYLINE:  By Jeffrey Rosen; Jeffrey Rosen is an associate professor at George Washington University Law School and the legal affairs editor of The New Republic. His last article for The Times Magazine was about the growth of surveillance.

 BODY:
Gilman Louie is one of the most successful computer-game developers of all time. "I'm your classic entrepreneur," he told me recently. "I started my first business with my fraternity brothers at San Francisco State." Louie, an amateur fighter pilot, had his first big success in 1987 with a game called Falcon, which allowed players to simulate the flight of an F-16. Falcon sold millions of copies, not only to teenage boys but also to pilots in the United States Air Force, who found it so realistic that it helped them learn to fly real fighter jets. Louie's biggest success came in 1988, when he imported from the Soviet Union an unexpectedly addictive game called Tetris, which became the best-selling computer game ever. "Between Nintendo sales and PC sales, 70 or 80 million copies of that game sold," Louie says. "We even found out that Hillary Clinton loved playing Tetris on the Game Boy." 
 Lots of companies were impressed by Louie's success, including Hasbro, which put him in charge of creating its games Web site. And then in 1998, Louie was recruited by an even more powerful employer: the Central Intelligence Agency. "The C.I.A. actually thought that my computer-game background was a valuable asset," Louie recalls. "I look at the world as one big system -- one big game." 
 The C.I.A. had just founded an unusual venture-capital firm called In-Q-Tel, and the agency wanted Louie to be the C.E.O. "The 'Q' stands for the 'Q' factor -- it's named after the character in James Bond," says Louie. In-Q-Tel was the brainchild of George Tenet, the C.I.A. director, who believed that by investing $30 million a year in Internet startups in Silicon Valley, the C.I.A. could encourage the development of cutting-edge technologies that might be useful for national intelligence. Louie's marching orders were to provide venture capital for data-mining technologies that would allow the C.I.A. to monitor and profile potential terrorists as closely and carefully as Amazon monitors and profiles potential customers. 
The valley has long indulged its own antiestablishment mythology -- rebellious, libertarian hackers in their parents' garages, bucking the system by inventing world-changing, personally empowering technologies -- and Louie was worried that persuading programmers to collaborate with the C.I.A. would be "borderline ludicrous." Despite his doubts, Louie agreed to open one In-Q-Tel office in Menlo Park, Calif., and another near Washington. He quickly discovered that far from recoiling at the idea of working with the C.I.A., Internet entrepreneurs flocked to his door. The chance to play with the government's cool toys trumped their fears of Big Brother.
After the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley, desperate for venture capital, began to depend more and more on the federal government. Then came Sept. 11, and the establishment of the Office of Homeland Security. In-Q-Tel now finds itself just one of several deep-pocketed federally financed investors that are eager to back technological solutions to our new security challenges. The Bush administration is asking Congress for $38 billion for homeland security, and much of this money will be parceled out among competing federal agencies -- including the Defense Department and the F.B.I. -- which can then use the money either to invest directly in security technologies or to follow In-Q-Tel's model of providing venture capital to young companies in the private sector. Like the C.I.A., the Office of Homeland Security has concluded that the same technologies that were useful before Sept. 11 for tracking, profiling and targeting potential customers can be turned today on potential terrorists. In the wake of the bursting of the tech bubble and in the thick of the war on terrorism, Silicon Valley is reinventing itself as the new headquarters for the military-technological complex.
As always, the entrepreneurs are following the money. In January, this led them to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest trade show of futuristic gadgets in North America. After Sept.11, the conference organizers decided to sponsor a special exhibition hall at the Riviera Hotel for technologies that are especially well suited to homeland defense. That old familiar gold-rush feeling was in the air at the Riviera: one speaker estimated that federal spending on security technologies would grow by 30 percent a year, rising to $62 billion by 2006. ("God bless America" read the PowerPoint slide, over an image of firefighters raising the flag.) In the buzzing exhibition hall, participants admired a hologram of the Statue of Liberty, as well as a man in a gigantic thumbprint costume, who had been hired by a company called DigitalPersona to advertise its fingerprint-recognition device. 
After displaying their wares, the technologists flocked to an In-Q-Tel reception near the exhibition hall, trolling for federal investors from the C.I.A., F.B.I. and Defense Department. "All we served was pot-stickers and 7-Up," Louie recalls, "but people didn't want to leave." 
In Las Vegas, several companies predicted that profiling techniques that are now used to detect credit-card fraud could soon be used to detect potential terrorists. A few weeks later, this prediction turned out to be a reality, when The Washington Post reported that the federal aviation authorities and two technology companies called Accenture and HNC Software are planning to test at airports a profiling system designed to analyze each passenger's living arrangements, travel and real-estate history, along with a great deal of demographic, financial and other personal information. Using data-mining and predictive software, the government then plans to assign each passenger a "threat index" based on his or her resemblance to a terrorist profile. Passengers with high threat indexes will be flagged as medium or high risks and will be taken aside for special searches and questioning. 
Our system "will check your associates," Brett Ogilvie of Accenture told Business Week. "It will ask if you have made international phone calls to Afghanistan, taken flying lessons or purchased 1,000 pounds of fertilizer." The only problem: in order for the system to obtain answers to those questions, the nation's privacy laws will need to be relaxed. Federal laws currently restrict the personally identifiable information that the government can demand from credit-card and phone companies except as part of a specific investigation. 
When I called Brett Ogilvie to ask what data Accenture proposes to analyze, his spokeswoman, Stacey Jones, said that she couldn't reveal that information: it's a trade secret. "Anyone who is interested in beating the system can, once we start divulging what the systems are," she explained. I said that I wasn't interested in the specific profiling factors; I only wanted to know whether Accenture proposed to include information in its database that the government isn't now permitted to examine. But Jones stuck to her script: "National security and client confidentiality prohibits us from divulging what the factors are." 
Accenture's profiling scheme is open to question not only because it would almost certainly violate the privacy rights of airline passengers, but also because it seems unlikely to work. Investigators will tell you that people who commit credit-card fraud often fit a consistent profile -- using the stolen card to buy gas at self-service stations, for example, and then using it to buy clothes. By contrast, terrorists don't fit a consistent profile: you're looking for a needle in a haystack, but the color and the shape of the needle keep changing. Mohamed Atta might have been kept out of the country if immigration officials had been aware that there was a warrant for his arrest in Broward County, Florida. But Accenture's profiling system is not designed to check passengers against a watch list of suspected criminals or terrorists. Instead it is designed to compare the purchasing activities and personal behavior of millions of passengers with those exhibited in the past by a tiny group of terrorists -- to create a predictive profile of likely hijackers.
Lawrence Lessig, who teaches law at Stanford and is the nation's leading authority on the law and architecture of cyberspace, argues that the Accenture system is unworkable. "I can understand these massive data systems to deal with things like stealing from the government or not paying your taxes -- systematic repetitive large-scale deviations from the law," he says. "The problem I really have with the terrorism stuff is, do we have any good reason to believe we could ever predict this type of behavior?" Because the sample of known terrorists is so small, Lessig says, the profiles are bound to be inaccurate. 
The entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley are undaunted by questions about whether it makes sense to profile terrorists the way they profile e-business consumers; they haven't been so enthusiastic about a race to innovate since the height of the dot-com bubble. In the glory days of the late 90's, Silicon Valley was consumed by the search for the "killer app," the software application that was just so cool and effective that everyone had to buy it. After Sept. 11, the consensus in the valley is that the national-security "killer app" will allow government agencies to access and share information about Americans that is currently stored in different databases -- from your chat-room gossip to your shopping history to your parking tickets, and perhaps even the payment history for your child-support checks.
"Today, every federal intelligence and law-enforcement agency and all manner of state and local bodies maintain their own separate databases on suspected criminals," Larry Ellison, the founder and C.E.O. of Oracle Corporation, wrote in The Wall Street Journal last October. "Do we need more databases? No, just the opposite. The biggest problem today is that we have too many. The single thing we could do to make life tougher for terrorists would be to ensure that all the information in myriad government databases was integrated into a single national file." Oracle, in fact, is the world's largest database manufacturer, and Ellison offered to donate the software for a single national database free of charge to the United States government. (The company, Ellison added, would charge for upgrades and maintenance.) 
Oracle's office in Reston, Va., is near the headquarters of the C.I.A., which is appropriate enough: when Larry Ellison founded the company 25 years ago, his first client was the C.I.A., to whom he sold a program called Oracle, the world's first "relational" database. At that time, information in computer databases was stored in unrelated files: a company like Ford, for example, could keep one file of its employees and another file of its departments, but it had no easy way of relating the two files. Ellison saw the commercial potential of the relational database and began marketing it in 1979. By the height of the dot-com boom in 2000, Ellison's net worth had soared to $80 billion, making him (briefly) the richest person in the world. 
When I visited Oracle in January, the security guard in the lobby gave me a high-tech ID badge that could track where I was in the building at all times. I was ushered upstairs to a bright conference room where seven people were sitting around a huge oval table. One of them, David Carey, turned out to be the former No. 3 man at the C.I.A.; he had just retired as executive director after 32 years with the agency. Carey joined Oracle to head its new Information Assurance Center, which was founded in November to design homeland-security and disaster-recovery solutions and market them to the federal government. 
Like his colleagues, Carey was in an expansive mood. He said that the United States government accounted for 23 percent of Oracle's multibillion-dollar licensing revenue last year and that he expected the federal side of the business to improve after Sept. 11. "How do you say this without sounding callous?" he asked. "In some ways, Sept. 11 made business a bit easier. Previous to Sept. 11, you pretty much had to hype the threat and the problem." Carey said that last summer, leaders in the public and private sector wouldn't sit still for a briefing. Then his face brightened. "Now they clamor for it!" After Sept. 11, Carey and Ellison held a series of top-level meetings in Washington about the use of Oracle technology for homeland security. "In November, Larry had a serious discussion with Vice President Cheney, and I met with Ridge, Ashcroft and Mueller," Carey says, referring to the director of the Office of Homeland Security, the attorney general and the director of the F.B.I. 
I asked to see an example of Oracle's new homeland-security technology, and I was ushered into a demonstration hall outside the conference room that looked like something out of the last "Star Wars" movie. "I'll give you an overview of 'Leaders,"' said Brian Jones, then the head of Oracle's health-care consulting unit. "It stands for Lightweight Epidemiology Advanced Detection and Emergency Response System." By collecting health-care information from hospital emergency rooms across the country, Leaders is designed to monitor outbreaks of suspicious diseases and provide early warnings for biological attacks. 
At 9:20 a.m. on Sept. 11, Jones had received a phone call from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which feared that the attack on the twin towers might be followed by a bioterrorism attack. Working for 10 straight hours, Jones put into his computer the address of every hospital in New York State, to detect unusual disease outbreaks, like smallpox. "Every hospital was capable of submitting data to a repository," he explained. "The Centers for Disease Control's experts could sit back in Atlanta and pull up a map just like I'm showing you here." Jones punched a key and a digital map of New York City appeared on the screen. Using a combination of 7,500 digital photographs and architectural plans of more than 6,000 miles of underground pipes, Oracle has created a detailed map of every building, sewer and water line and curb in the city. By the evening of Sept. 11, Jones was ready to monitor every emergency-room bed in the state. 
Oracle is now working with the federal government to apply the same surveillance system to hospitals throughout the country. The system would allow hospitals to report incidents of suspicious diseases like anthrax, smallpox and Ebola to a central database. The program can then send out e-mail or voice-mail alerts to law-enforcement officials if it detects suspicious patterns of diseases anywhere in the country. Steve Cooperman, Oracle's new director of homeland security, said, "We're going to build a bioterrorism shield, so eventually everyone is going to have to participate -- every hospital, every clinic, every lab." 
The prospect of every hospital in America reporting your medical condition to a central Oracle database might cause some patients alarm. (Oracle insists that the information can be stored in ways that can't be linked to individual patients.) The same potential for invasions of privacy is raised by Larry Ellison's proposal to centralize all of the separate criminal databases run by federal and state authorities into a single national database. After we filed back into the conference room, David Carey explained that Oracle is already discussing with various federal agencies methods of sharing information that are currently restricted by law. 
"We think of it as a triangle," said Tim Hoechst, a senior vice president for technology at Oracle, holding up a Dorito. "At one corner is privacy, at one corner is assurance of security -- how safe is the data -- and at another corner is usability. It's all a matter of trade-offs. What we focus on is making the Dorito here, and putting you in any corner that you feel comfortable with. On Sept. 12, most Americans would say, Privacy out the window; go catch the folks. So we would have moved it all the way to usability. But maybe day to day, we move it a little bit more toward security." 
As the databases are consolidated, I asked, who should decide the proper balance between privacy and access? How do you avoid a situation in which someone could be kept off a plane because he had skipped jury duty or had an overdue parking ticket? A hush fell over the room, and people looked awkwardly at their sandwiches. 
Finally Hoechst spoke up. "You'll notice that we all became suspiciously quiet when we started talking about policy questions," he said. "At Oracle, we leave that to our customers to decide. We become a little stymied when we start talking about the 'should wes' and the 'whys' and the 'hows,' because it's not our expertise." 
The Tom Lehrer song about the Nazi rocket scientist who defected to America popped into my head: "Once ze rockets are up, who cares where they come down?/That's not my department,' says Wernher von Braun."
"I expect that if you ask Larry Ellison the question he'd give you a much better answer," one of Hoechst's associates chimed in. Hoechst agreed. "My experience with him is that he knows an extraordinary amount about a lot of things. Every time I think I know something, he knows much more. He's read more books on it."
So I set off for Silicon Valley to meet Larry Ellison. The Oracle campus near the San Francisco airport is known as the Emerald City, for its artificial lakes and silo-shaped towers of glass and silver. Ellison's private palace, however, is a $30 million mansion in nearby Atherton, modeled on the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. I was checked in there by two bodyguards with dark shirts and dark tans and escorted into the house to wait. The living room was large and airy, with lots of blond wood and shoji screens. It overlooked a beautiful Japanese garden, where ducks swam and waterfalls shimmered.
Ellison appeared a few minutes later from behind one of the screens, wearing a pressed charcoal suit over a black turtleneck. He appeared fit and tanned, with piercing hazel eyes and a trimmed beard slightly flecked with gray. He suggested that we talk in the garden, but the loud whine of a neighbor's mulcher made this impossible. (In Silicon Valley, even $30 million doesn't buy you quiet.) Defeated by the noise, we retreated to the dining room, with its high-backed black lacquer chairs and black lacquer table. 
Ellison is not a shy or enigmatic billionaire. He is entertainingly indiscreet -- he answered every question with a torrent of confident opinions. "The Oracle database is used to keep track of basically everything," he said. "The information about your banks, your checking balance, your savings balance is stored in an Oracle database. Your airline reservation is stored in an Oracle database. What books you bought on Amazon is stored in an Oracle database. Your profile on Yahoo is stored in an Oracle database." Much of the information in these separate commercial databases is also centralized in large databases maintained by credit-card companies like TRW to detect fraud and to decide whether customers should get credit at the mall. 
When it comes to government data, by contrast, there are hundreds of separate, disconnected databases. "The huge problem is the fragmented data," he said. "We knew Mohamed Atta was wanted. It's just that we didn't check the right database when he came into the country." Ellison wants to consolidate the hundreds of separate state and federal databases into a single Oracle database, using the centralized credit-card databases as a model. "We already have this large centralized database to keep track of where you work, how much you earn, where your kids go to school, were you late on your last mortgage payment, when's the last time you got a raise," he said. "Well, my God, there are hundreds of places we have to look to see if you're a security risk." He dismissed the risks of privacy violations: "I really don't understand. Central databases already exist. Privacy is already gone."
As Ellison spoke, it occurred to me that he was proposing to reconstruct America's national security strategy along the lines of Oracle's business model. When Oracle moved its business to the Internet in 1995, Ellison complained that its customer information was scattered across hundreds of separate databases, which meant that the German office couldn't share information about customers with the French office. By consolidating 130 separate databases into a single database on the Internet, Ellison said, Oracle saved a billion dollars a year and found it easier to track, monitor and discriminate among its customers. This was what Ellison now wanted to do for America.
I asked if there would be any controls on access to the database. For example, would Ellison want people to be kept off a plane because they were late on their alimony payments?
"Oh, no, I don't think we would keep anyone off on alimony payments," Ellison said. "But if the system designed to catch terrorists also catches mere bank robbers and deadbeat dads, that's O.K. I think that's a good thing. I don't think it's a bad thing."
There are, at the moment, legal restrictions prohibiting the sharing of data by government agencies. The most important restriction was passed in 1974, to prevent President Nixon from ordering dragnet surveillance of Vietnam protesters and searching for their youthful marijuana arrests. I asked Ellison whether these legal restrictions should be relaxed. "Oh, absolutely," he said. "I mean absolutely. The prohibitions are absurd. It's this fear of an all-too-powerful government rising up and snatching away our liberties." Since Sept. 11, Ellison argued, those qualms no longer make any sense: "It's our lives that are at risk, not our liberties," he said.
Ellison proposes to link the central government database to a system of digital identification cards that would be optional for citizens but mandatory for aliens. He wants each card holder to provide a thumbprint or iris scan that would be stored in the central database. I recalled that Lawrence Lessig of Stanford Law School had explained to me that a national fingerprint database was probably the most invasive of all possible designs for an identification system, because it would allow the government to dust for fingerprints in a nightclub or a protest scene and identify everyone who was there. I asked Ellison why the government couldn't minimize these privacy concerns by storing the fingerprint on the ID card.
Ellison dismissed the suggestion. "Everyone's got this amorphous idea that the government will somehow misuse this," he said, "but no one has given me a substantive example of what will happen that's bad." 
I tried again. What about the centralized storage of health information, as Oracle was proposing to do with the Leaders system. Would Ellison want government officials to have access to personally identifiable genetic information? 
"I feel like Alice has fallen through the looking glass," Ellison said. His voice rose; he was starting to get a little testy. "Does this other database bother you here? We can't touch that database because I won't be able to use my credit card. Like, I won't be able to go to the mall!" He took on the voice of Sean Penn's stoner from "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." "Like, that's really disturbing. Like, don't mess with my mall experience. O.K., so people have to die over here without this, but that's not going to affect my experience going to the mall." He exhaled, and in his regular billionaire voice asked, "I mean, what the hell is going on?"
Ellison said he was late for an appointment at Intel and started to make motions to leave. I tried one more question. Were there no differences between Oracle and the United States government, I asked, that should make us hesitate before centralizing all of our national databases using Oracle as a model? 
"From the information-science standpoint, there's no difference at all," he replied. "These central databases are cheaper and better and they solve all these problems. We can manage credit risks that way. We should be managing security risks in exactly the same way."
It's not surprising, of course, that Larry Ellison sincerely believes that what's good for Oracle is good for America. But there are, in fact, differences between an e-business and the American government, differences that perhaps should make us hesitate before reconstructing America along the business model of the Oracle Corporation. 
"Depending on how these technologies are designed, they can respect traditional values of liberty or not," says Lawrence Lessig, "and whether they do depends on the values that drive the designers and the institutions we build to check the design." Although Lessig's path-breaking book "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace" argues that it's possible to design technologies that protect privacy and security at the same time, he has become pessimistic that Silicon Valley, left to its own devices, will get the balance right. "The reality is that all the market power is going to be on the side of delivering the security, and there's no strong claim on the other side for delivering the privacy," he says. "There's no court that will stand up and push the demand for heightened review for privacy, and there's no politician. And then you have Larry Ellison types riding in with the glow of the market. He's like a rich version of a North Korean dictator." 
Here, then, is the Catch-22 of the integrated databases that are being constructed in the wake of Sept. 11: the technologists want the politicians to decide the balance between privacy and security, but because the technology is so complicated and unfamiliar, very few politicians seem up to the task. I visited Maria Cantwell, the newly elected senator from the state of Washington and perhaps the most technologically savvy member of the Senate. (She complains that Congressional rules prohibit her from taking her BlackBerry wireless communicator onto the Senate floor but allow her to use a spittoon.) Cantwell learned about the importance of Internet privacy as an executive for RealNetworks, which markets one of the most popular Internet music players. In 1999, RealNetworks got into trouble when privacy advocates noticed that the player could send information to RealNetworks about the music each user downloaded. RealNetworks had the capability to match this data with a Globally Unique Identifier, or GUID, that exposed the user's identity. Although RealNetworks insisted that it had never, in fact, matched the music data with the GUID, the company was eager to avoid a public-relations disaster, and so it quickly disabled the GUID. The experience helped turn Cantwell into a crusader for privacy, but her time in the Senate has made her more pessimistic that her colleagues in Congress have the understanding or inclination to regulate technology in a meaningful way.
"What I don't think people realize is that we are just at the tip of the iceberg," she told me. "I think they're trying to be prescriptive on some very basic things, not understanding the world that's yet to come. I try to explain some of the new technology to my colleagues" -- by which she means her fellow senators. "You're going to be able to be driving and say, 'Hey, take me to the nearest Starbucks,' and they all think that's great. And then I say, but it also might be stored in a database that may also be able to track where you were at 2 o'clock in the morning." 
Cantwell worries that her Senate colleagues are so swept up in the search for a technological solution to our security problems that regulating access to the databases isn't on their agenda. "I mean, databases can become a threat in themselves if you don't think through the right safeguards," she said. "People are getting enamored with the power of the technology and not thinking through the privacy issues and how they might apply."
In the face of Congressional indifference and judicial passivity, it has fallen to the technologists to sort out the appropriate balance between liberty and security. But this is a challenge that the technologists are ill equipped -- by culture and temperament -- to meet. 
The gonzo entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley like to think of themselves as antigovernment libertarians; the business nostrums of the precrash era assumed that the Internet would lead inevitably to the end of hierarchy and centralized authority and the flourishing of individual creativity. When the e-business technologies of tracking, classifying, profiling and monitoring were used to identify the preferences of American consumers and to mirror back to each of us a market-segmented version of ourselves, Silicon Valley could argue that it was serving the cause of freedom and individual choice. But when the same software applications are used by the government to track, classify, profile and monitor American citizens, they become not technologies of liberty but technologies of state surveillance and discrimination. They threaten the ability of Americans to define their identity in the future free from government predictions based on their behavior in the past. Far from leading inevitably to the end of centralized authority, the age of the Internet turns out to include powerful economic and political forces that are determined to centralize as much information about individuals as possible. 
The technology for integrated databases already exists, waiting to be activated by the flip of a switch. In the wake of Sept. 11, few politicians or judges seem willing to keep the forces of centralization in check. And no one should count on the technologists to police themselves.
I had one last question for Larry Ellison. "In 20 years, do you think the global database is going to exist, and will it be run by Oracle?" I asked.
"I do think it will exist, and I think it is going to be an Oracle database," he replied. "And we're going to track everything."

In theEye of the Storms, the Markets Stay Calm

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
LOOK at the headlines from the Middle East, then glance at the financial markets' volatility, a barometer of investor worry. The first suggests that the world is on fire. The second indicates that investors are complacent.
 Despite the escalation of violence -- and the oil-price surge caused by fear of supply disruptions -- the index of stock market volatility compiled by the Chicago Board Options Exchange is just above its recent lows. That means investors are not expecting any big market moves. Another sign of calm is the low volatility in currency markets, where the euro has been trading in a tight range against the dollar. 
 The discrepancy between the Middle East's upheaval and the markets' calm, some analysts say, results partly from a recent pattern of bad things turning out better than expected. That was true of the Asian economic collapse in 1997 and the Russian default and near failure of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund, in 1998. It has also been true since September. "We've had our bout with terrorism, we've had our bout with the recession, and everything is on the mend," said Bernie Schaeffer, chairman of Schaeffer's Investment Research. "The feeling is that the worst is over."
Richard Medley, president of Medley Global Advisors, a consultant to hedge funds and investment houses, disagrees. He says there has been more volatility in markets directly affected by the Middle East crisis, especially oil. In other financial markets, the lack of volatility does not mean complacency but "deep, deep uncertainty," he said.
"Is the war in the Mideast good for the dollar or bad for the dollar?" he asked. If you wanted to make a bet, he said, you wouldn't know how to do it.
Saying the lack of volatility in stocks and currencies is complacency, he said, is like saying "a deer frozen in the headlights is complacent because it is not running."
Mr. Medley said his clients were indicating that business confidence was eroding and that investment decisions were being put off because of worry that crude-oil prices could hit $40 a barrel in a few months.
He suggested that low market volatility was also a sign of a declining appetite for risk, because many big investors lost a lot of money in the first quarter. Two large losses, he said, involved bets on falling interest rates in the United States and a rising dollar against the Japanese yen.
The sharp rise in Treasury interest rates at the end of 2001 led many people to assume that rates would fall at the beginning of this year, he said, with the economy still in recession. Instead, rates shot higher in March, when economic data and then Alan Greenspan himself said the recession had ended much sooner than expected. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note jumped more than half a percentage point from the end of February to March 14, when it hit 5.41 percent.
The bet on a rising dollar against the yen also went bad. The yen rallied quickly, to 127.56 to the dollar in early March from 134.68 at the end of February -- up 5.6 percent. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks also had a surprising gain that caught many of the same investors who were betting against the yen leaning the wrong way on stocks, too. From Feb. 6 to March 11, the Nikkei rose 26.5 percent. "People got crushed," Mr. Medley said, and firms reduced their risk limits.
WHILE Mr. Schaeffer and Mr. Medley interpret the low volatility differently, both are worried. To a contrarian like Mr. Schaeffer, low volatility means stocks are likely to fall in the near term. Mr. Medley said that if the geopolitical uncertainty led to a freezing of corporate investment, "you don't get the second leg of the recovery that Federal Reserve is hoping for."
There is one positive in all of this. Because the Middle East crisis could push oil prices high enough to threaten the economic recovery, Fed policy makers probably will not raise interest rates as soon as some analysts have predicted. The first increase may not now come until August. If the fallout from the Middle East worsens, the Fed could wait even longer, to assure that the economic recovery takes hold.

Yellow Flag May Be Out for Parts Makers

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO 

 BODY:
STRONG car sales have propelled the shares of auto parts manufacturers, the mostly small to midsize companies that sell to giants like Ford and General Motors. As the broader stock market drifted sideways during the first quarter, the stocks of some of these companies rose 20 percent to 50 percent.
 As a group, auto parts makers are up 28 percent this year, as measured by the Dow Jones Auto Parts Index, which has risen 61 percent from its 52-week low on Sept. 21. 
 But the good times are unlikely to last, some analysts say. For one thing, the sudden increase in demand for auto parts came after a sharp decline last fall, as automakers let inventories run low. When sales of new cars and trucks held up despite the recession, automakers ramped up production, flooding contractors with orders for new parts. 
Rising interest rates could also put the brakes on these stocks, as could the declining market share of domestic automakers. Sales of auto parts are expected to decline 5 percent in 2002, to around $280 billion, according to the Original Equipment Suppliers Association. On the other hand, the number of parts in the average new car or truck is increasing, a trend that could favor the makers of specialty products.
Two companies that could benefit from the rise of gadgetry are Superior Industries International in Van Nuys, Calif., and Gentex of Zeeland, Mich. Superior makes aluminum wheels, lighter but pricier alternatives to steel that help automakers meet fuel efficiency standards. That is a necessity that won't go away, said Adriano Almeida, an auto sector analyst at Dreyfus, which holds about 60,000 shares of both Superior and Gentex.
Gentex makes mirrors that dim automatically for bright headlights, as well as enhancements for the mirrors, like cellphone adapters and garage-door openers. So far the mirrors have been popular on higher-priced vehicles, including Cadillacs and sport utility vehicles like the Lincoln Navigator and Chevrolet Suburban. Gentex could profit by increasing sales to midprice vehicles, Mr. Almeida said.
Shares of Superior have risen more than 25 percent this year and now trade at $50.40, about 15 times Mr. Almeida's 2003 earnings estimate of $3.40 per share. The stock traded at 30 times forward earnings in 1993, when the economy was last recovering from recession, Mr. Almeida said. Gentex is up more than 16 percent, to $31.05, about 26 times Mr. Almeida's 2003 earnings estimate of $1.20 per share. It traded as high as 45 times forward earnings in 1993, he said. 
The two companies are attractive partly because they are almost debt-free, he said. "That's actually quite unusual for the group. Many companies are burdened with too much debt, and they've gotten to where they are with a lot of acquisitions."
That was the case for some stocks with the biggest gains this year. Shares have soared more than 50 percent in companies like Dana of Toledo, Ohio, and Tower Automotive of Grand Rapids, Mich. These companies had a lot of ground to cover just to catch up to their competitors, said Darren S. Kimball, a Lehman Brothers analyst. High fixed costs kept the companies from being nimble enough to adjust to swings in the auto market, he said.
"Both companies were being priced as if they had one foot in bankruptcy," he said, but the market has re-evaluated their finances. Shares in Dana, which dipped as low as $10.25 on Nov. 1, closed at $21.64 on Friday. In October, Dana said it would eliminate 11,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force. "What has Wall Street excited is that they have reduced their fixed costs, and the industry volume is starting to get a bit better," Mr. Kimball said.
But Michael Bruynesteyn, an analyst at Prudential Securities, who covers the group, thinks auto parts stocks are unlikely to sustain their recent gains in the short run.
He recommends holding off on any new investment in auto parts stocks until after interest rates rise. Shares of auto parts companies and automakers did well at the first sign that the economy was emerging from recessions in 1983 and 1992, but they slumped as soon as the Federal Reserve started raising rates.
"There are some who argue that that won't hit stocks this time," he said, because the Fed would simply be taking back rate cuts imposed to cope with a short-term financial crisis caused by Sept. 11. "That's possible," he added, "but I wouldn't bet on it."
Low and no-interest car loans helped prop up auto sales during the recent economic downturn, but those offers can hardly be sustained if the Fed raises rates this year.
Many domestic auto parts manufacturers face another question: How can they overcome their addiction to the Big Three automakers? 
The market share of domestic automakers has been falling steadily to foreign competition. Though many Japanese and European companies now manufacture cars in North America, they tend to have fewer North American-made parts than the Big Three, according to analysts.
ONE company that has emphasized sales to foreign carmakers, Johnson Controls of Milwaukee, is the biggest supplier of car seats to the North American operations of Toyota and Nissan, according to Prudential Securities. "Johnson Controls has done a phenomenal job of navigating through the downturn," Mr. Kimball of Lehman said. Johnson closed at $92.33 on Friday, up 14 percent this year. 
But Johnson is an exception that proves the rule. The two auto parts companies most obviously tied to domestic automakers are Delphi, a spinoff of General Motors, and Visteon, a spinoff of Ford. But even smaller companies like Superior and Gentex rely heavily on the Big Three. Superior sells about 88 percent of its aluminum wheels to domestic automakers, while Gentex books about 60 percent of its sales to the Big Three, according to Mr. Almeida.

HEADLINE: Wait a Second: What Devils Lurk In the Details? 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
ARE the glory days of nonstop earnings growth over at the General Electric Company?
 Management doesn't appear to think so. Last Thursday, when G.E. reported its first-quarter results, Keith S. Sherin, the chief financial officer, was decidedly upbeat. Acknowledging that the business environment remains difficult, he pointed to the company's strong balance sheet and the diversity of G.E.'s businesses and said they enabled the company to produce what he called consistently excellent earnings growth. "The business model works," Mr. Sherin proclaimed. 
 But investors weren't so sure. Just moments after Mr. Sherin uttered those words, shareholders began dumping G.E. stock. By the end of the day, the shares of G.E., the nation's largest company by market capitalization, had lost 9 percent of their value, sinking to $33.75. By the close of trading on Friday, they had drifted down to $33.55. 
It has been a long time since the gap was so wide between what G.E. management reported as a strong performance and what its investors were hoping for. In fact, while G.E. executives said the company had delivered "excellent earnings growth" as always, what they actually issued was a report that investors, and even some analysts, found lacking in both substance and performance. And that is raising questions.
"We went through a decade where we just accepted G.E.'s numbers," said Thomas K. Brown, the chief executive of Second Curve Capital, a hedge fund in New York. "Now the more we look at them, the more we say, 'wait a minute.' I don't understand what's going on here, and the more I understand it, the more I'm concerned."
For the first quarter, G.E. reported that earnings rose 17 percent, to $3.518 billion -- but those results excluded the effects of a mandated accounting change. Including the change, a charge to earnings for a writedown of good will, G.E.'s earnings actually fell 2.7 percent. Revenue, meanwhile, dropped in most segments of its operations, even at GE Capital Services, its powerhouse financing arm.
Robert A. Olstein, an accounting expert and fund manager, has turned decidedly bearish. "G.E. is going to stumble before the year is out," he said.
After the long boom, contending with a stagnant economic environment is unfamiliar territory for G.E., where Jeffrey R. Immelt took over as chief executive from the legendary Jack Welch just last September. Heightened investor interest, even suspicion, toward financial reports is a completely new challenge. Even for G.E., gone are the days when investors accepted at face value what corporate managements told them about their businesses and their books. Now investors are far more likely to dissect financial statements for themselves.
Mr. Olstein, who manages the $1.5 billion Olstein Financial Alert fund, is one of them. An expert in spotting accounting practices that burnish immediate results but that do not necessarily translate into long-term earnings growth, he has managed to deliver a 7.25 percent increase in the value of his fund this year and 22.7 percent a year, on average, over the last three years. He does it, in part, by avoiding companies that report results that look better than they actually are and by sticking with those that have solid earnings.
 HAVING taken his pencil to G.E.'s financial statements, Mr. Olstein has sold a modest number of G.E. shares short in his fund, betting that they will fall. 
"Reading the 10-K, I felt that after eliminating all the sources of lower-quality earnings, any attempt by the company to grow at 18 percent a year was a dream," Mr. Olstein said, referring to management's pledge of such gains. "After reading the quarterly results, my suspicions about the quality of their growth continue."
G.E. is doing nothing improper in its accounting, Mr. Olstein is quick to point out. Rather, he says a good portion of the company's earnings come from what he calls financial engineering, not growth in the operations that make aircraft engines, high-performance plastics and medical equipment, operate television networks and finance equipment purchases. 
While such techniques produce earnings gains, they are not the kind of gains that investors typically pay a premium for, simply because they are not sustainable. As a result, he said a more appropriate value for the shares would be around $25, which is 25 percent lower than they are now.
In the year ended last December, G.E. earned $13.7 billion, or $1.41 a share, on sales of $126 billion. Although the profit figure was up 7.5 percent from the previous year, by Mr. Olstein's reckoning, about 25 cents a share, or 18 percent of the profits, came from nonrecurring sources at the company. 
Several areas have produced gains for the company that may not be sustainable. First, some gains result from the sale of assets. The sale of a satellite unit, known as Americom, generated $642 million after taxes, equivalent to $4.7 percent of G.E.'s earnings in 2001. G.E. sold the unit to SES Global for a gain of $1.16 billion last November. Portfolio gains including this sale generated 6 cents a share in earnings for G.E., Mr. Olstein said. 
Next, he calculated that a $1.5 billion gain in the company's pension plan, left over from the heady bull-market days, accounted for 8 cents a share in G.E.'s earnings last year. Even though such gains cannot be taken into a company's coffers, under accounting rules they can be added to earnings as a so-called noncash item.
David Frail, a G.E. spokesman, said: "Pension income doesn't change all that much from year to year, so as far as being a contributor to earnings growth, it's not that much."
But a measure of how fleeting these pension gains can be is seen in the company's annual filing. It said the unrecognized gain in the pension plan had fallen to $3.5 billion in 2001 from $12.6 billion at the end of 2000. Assets in the plan also declined by 10 percent. "The company's gains from the bull market mania days are fast running out," Mr. Olstein said. 
Gains on the packaging and sale of G.E.'s loans, known as securitization, to special-purpose entities that are off the balance sheet also helped earnings last year, Mr. Olstein said. The total gain was $1.3 billion, up from $500 million in 2000, and accounted for 6 cents a share in earnings last year. Such gains, however, cannot be counted on year in and out.
FINALLY, Mr. Olstein estimated that the entire gain shown by GE Capital, whose financing operations contributed 40 percent of G.E. profits in 2001, was a result of a significantly lower tax rate. That tax-rate decline added 5 cents a share to the company's earnings. 
Adding all these gains together means that G.E.'s continuing operations produced earnings of around $1.16 a share last year, Mr. Olstein said. And at a stock price of $33.55, that means investors are paying 29 times core earnings to own G.E. shares even as its revenue is in decline. By contrast, Mr. Olstein says a cyclical growth company, growing at the same rate as G.E., should sell for a multiple of 20. 
Other investors are growing uneasy about G.E.'s balance sheet. In its most recent annual report, G.E. for the first time outlined the size of the obligations that are off its balance sheet in special-purpose entities. Such potential liabilities could burden the company if its triple-A debt rating were to decline. At the end of last year, that figure stood at $43.2 billion. Some analysts say that taking a conservative approach to the balance sheet would require that those off-balance-sheet obligations be added to the total debt held by the company, which stood at $220 billion at year-end. 
Those off-balance-sheet obligations would increase G.E.'s debt by 20 percent. Mr. Frail said that only the highest-quality assets are in the special-purpose entities. 
Beyond these accounting queries, a new, tangible question has arisen about the health of GE Capital Services. In the fourth quarter of last year, G.E. gave GE Capital a $3.043 billion cash infusion. The contribution has made some analysts wonder whether GE Capital has experienced losses in its financing business that required the parent company to shore up its balance sheet. That $3 billion infusion to GE Capital was equal to one-third of the subsidiary's tangible net worth -- shareholder's equity minus intangible assets -- at the time. The $3 billion contribution offset a $2 billion decline in GE Capital's tangible net worth at year-end.
A casual reader of G.E's financial statements might not have recognized how significant the $3 billion contribution was to GE Capital's net worth. Such a conclusion requires consulting a completely different financial filing, that of GE Capital Services, in addition to the parent company's annual filing.
Neither stated any reason; the companies were not required to explain the infusion.
G.E. said it had not made any more cash contributions to the capital subsidiary in the first quarter.
The company said it had made the $3 billion contribution to GE Capital so that the subsidiary could acquire Heller Financial last year. As for the $2 billion decline in tangible net worth, Mr. Frail would say only that there was a mark-to-market loss of $890 million on derivatives at the company. "The rating agencies don't look at this as relevant," he said. 
But the soundness of any financial institution, such as GE Capital, is judged on the basis of its tangible net worth, or book value, by investors, rating agencies and lenders. The company must keep certain financial ratios above set levels if it is to continue to have its debt rated triple-A. A decline in GE Capital's book value of $2 billion is nobody's idea of good news. 
IF GE Capital is experiencing losses in its business of financing consumer and company purchases of refrigerators and turbines or in its securities trading activities, it would not exactly be a surprise. Losses have mounted at many banks and financing companies in recent quarters. But GE Capital's earnings growth had held up remarkably well in the economic downturn that forced companies to curtail capital expenditures sharply. For the full year, earnings at the subsidiary grew 4.3 percent and accounted for 40 percent of G.E.'s earnings for 2001. 
While the company's first-quarter results, made public last week, were not as detailed as reports that the company will file later with the S.E.C., they confirmed some investors' fears about the unsustainable nature of some of G.E.'s past growth. 
For instance, one of the few areas of strength at the company came from its power systems subsidiary, which sells turbines to energy producers like Calpine and Entergy. But many of G.E.'s customers in this business have sharply curtailed their plant-building plans, leading them to cancel turbine orders. The customers were required to pay cancellation fees, generating $476 million in revenue at the subsidiary, or 9 percent of its total sales. This resulted in net profits of $326 million, or 3 cents a share in the quarter, that are unlikely to recur.
While canceled orders are producing increased sales and earnings now, the gains will not last. "It's real profit, but it won't be recurring," Mr. Olstein pointed out. "Besides, who wants to make money from cancellations?"
G.E.'s first-quarter results had one final peculiar aspect worth noting. The company's cash flow from operations declined by 53 percent, yet earnings grew by 17 percent. Careful analysts are always on the lookout for wide discrepancies between reported earnings and cash flows. When earnings growth at a company exceeds the growth in its cash flows, the disparity can be a sign that accounting gimmicks are being used to dress up reported earnings. 
 THE company said the discrepancy reflected the decline in so-called progress collections, the intermediate payments customers make for purchases of turbines and jet engines while they are being built. The drop in cash flow reflected a drop in those payments as orders were canceled. 
G.E.'s first-quarter results also indicate that the Capital Services juggernaut, which has powered the company's overall results for more than a decade, is finally slowing. Revenue at the subsidiary fell 6 percent -- largely a result of a decline in sales, general and administrative expenses -- while earnings rose 8 percent. The tax rate in the subsidiary fell again, to an extraordinarily low 20 percent. 
The company said this was a result of a greater portion of its business being conducted overseas, where tax rates are lower than the 35 percent rate that is standard in the United States.
Robert E. Friedman, accounting analyst at Standard & Poor's equity research unit in New York, found another flaw. While GE Capital has fueled much of the parent company's growth, he said, it does not generate high returns on capital when its debt is stripped away.
"You cannot have a P/E of a magnitude such as G.E.'s and have a company that generates relatively low returns on capital," he said. "Sooner or later the chickens are going to come home to roost." 
GE Capital's uncollectible debts, which it calls nonearning receivables, have also been rising, raising flags. In the full year 2001, these rose to 2.9 percent of receivables from 2.3 percent. And in the first quarter, they rose an additional $143 million, to $3.4 billion. Such increases point to the distinct possibility that reserves for bad debts will rise, cutting into earnings. 
The company says it is comfortable with its current reserves.
Mr. Olstein, however, said: "G.E. is getting growth from things it can't keep doing. This leads us to believe that the company is going to have problems down the road." 
Mr. Brown, of Second Curve, added a final concern for investors: "The more people analyze G.E., which is made possible by the increased disclosure by the company, the more they realize they don't understand this company. So then you have to say as an investor, 'that's uncertainty.' And when you have increased uncertainty, you're going to pay a lower multiple for a projected earnings stream."

 If a case for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration has ever been made more effectively than Paul Krugman's April 9 column, "The Third Oil Crisis?," I haven't read it. 
 Until renewable energy technologies are further refined and become economically viable, the inescapable truth is that our economy will continue to run primarily on fossil fuels. And until we expand our own domestic production of those fuels, our economy will be vulnerable to the whims of Iraq, Venezuela and others.

 "A PROBLEM
FROM HELL"
America and the Age of Genocide.
By Samantha Power.
Illustrated. 610 pp. New York:
A New Republic Book/Basic Books. $30.
 Raphael Lemkin, a Jewish linguist who escaped Nazi-occupied Poland in 1941, coined the term "genocide" as a kind of speech-act. He meant not only to name a crime whose magnitude, combined with its sweeping singularity of motive, distinguished it even in the annals of coldblooded mass murder. He meant for the crime's very name to be a call for universal opprobrium -- one that would inspire, if it did not mandate, punishment and prevention.
As Samantha Power recounts in " 'A Problem From Hell': America and the Age of Genocide," it was Lemkin who devised and lobbied tirelessly for the Genocide Convention, which the United Nations adopted in 1948. Defining genocide as the commission of certain crimes with the "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such," the convention called for perpetrators to be punished and for contracting parties "to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide." Nervous about its own record on race, however, the United States did not become a party to the Genocide Convention until 1986, when President Ronald Reagan backed it as a face-saving measure following his visit the previous year to Bitburg cemetery, where 49 Nazi SS officers are buried. Even then, three Republican senators -- Jesse Helms, Orrin Hatch and Richard Lugar -- attached so many reservations to the American signature that the convention would not meaningfully bind the United States to much of anything.
Yet those reservations could not prevent "genocide" from becoming the speech-act Lemkin intended in popular parlance. Associated above all with Nazi horrors, the term has become so powerful a talisman, and so unarguable a synonym for evil, that its very invocation seems an incitement to act. By the same token, it is a word loaded with demagogic potential. Paranoid tyrants, including perpetrators of genocide, are fond of manipulating public emotions by claiming that their own people are threatened with impending genocide. American political leaders go to great lengths to avoid uttering the word in cases where they hope to remain disengaged; they do not hesitate to use it, however, when they wish to stir up public outrage in support of military action. Hence, Serbian war crimes in Kosovo were quickly deemed genocidal, whereas in the more obvious case of Bosnia, State Department officials carefully picked their way around the g-word.
It will hardly come as a surprise to most Americans who follow foreign affairs that Bosnia, and not Kosovo, is the norm. In " 'A Problem From Hell,' " Power expertly documents American passivity in the face of Turkey's Armenian genocide, the Khmer Rouge's systematic murder of more than a million Cambodians, the Iraqi regime's gassing of its Kurdish population, the Bosnian Serbian Army's butchery of unarmed Muslims and the Rwandan Hutu militias' slaughter of some 800,000 Tutsi. (Power has room, in this substantial volume, for only passing mention of the massacres of similar and larger scale in Nigeria, Bangladesh, Burundi and East Timor, among other places.) This vivid and gripping work of American history doubles as a prosecutor's brief: time and again, Power recounts, although the United States had the knowledge and the means to stop genocide abroad, it has not acted. Worse, it has made a resolute commitment to not acting. Washington's record, Power ruefully observes, is not one of failure, but of success.
Self-interest trumps humanitarian concern in United States foreign policy with striking consistency, Power demonstrates. Cold-war calculations led the Nixon and Carter administrations first to pave the way for the Khmer Rouge's ascent to power, and then to continue to justify its right to rule Cambodia long after a Vietnamese invasion dislodged Pol Pot. Business interests and the desire to contain Iran's revolution induced the first Bush administration to support Saddam Hussein economically as he gassed and bulldozed Kurdish villages. Of Bosnia, former President Bush's secretary of state, James Baker, famously proclaimed, "We don't have a dog in that fight." Rwanda, the subject of Power's most shattering chapter, lay even farther from any vital interest of the United States. There, the Clinton administration ignored early warnings of impending catastrophe, declined to intervene and, according to many, opposed United Nations peacekeeping efforts. When at last the Clinton White House was stirred to action in Kosovo, it was, Power writes, largely out of concern for NATO's credibility and the administration's own domestic image. "I'm getting creamed," she quotes President Clinton as saying when the lobby of opinion makers calling for intervention in Bosnia had grown deafening. It would be too humiliating to go through that again.
Power, the executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, gives us a Washington that is vibrant, complex and refreshingly human. Within it, she finds an unlikely, bipartisan collection of men and women whose courage and moral commitment she admires. Among them are Henry Morgenthau, Charles Twining, Claiborne Pell, Madeleine Albright, Robert Dole and a group of junior State Department officials who resigned to protest American inaction in Bosnia. Senator William Proxmire regaled the Senate with a "speech a day" for 20 years, urging that the United States become a party to the Genocide Convention. Peter Galbraith, when he was a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, fought fruitlessly for recognition and condemnation of the Iraqi Kurdish genocide, traveling at great personal risk to northern Iraq. 
The same Washington, of course, is a place of defeatism, inertia, selfishness and cowardice. Warnings pass up the chain and disappear. Intelligence is gathered and then ignored or denied. The will of the executive remains steadfastly opposed to intervention; its guiding assumption is that the cost of stopping genocide is great, while the political cost of ignoring it is next to nil. President Bush the elder comes off as a stone-hearted prisoner to business interests, President Clinton as an amoral narcissist. Perhaps nobody looks worse than former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on whose watch both Bosnia and Rwanda self-destructed. "When innocent life is being taken on such a scale and the United States has the power to stop the killing at reasonable risk," Power writes, "it has a duty to act." She objects not only to the fact that the United States declines to intervene militarily in genocidal conflicts, but also that frequently it declines to do anything -- even to rebuke perpetrators publicly. 
Where are international institutions in this picture? They depend on the financing and political will of the United States. Unfortunately, like many observers of the Bosnian peacekeeping fiasco, Power appears to have given up on international institutions. She does not argue for empowering them, for liberating them from the narrow interests of the powerful or for altering their terms of engagement in genocidal conflicts. Instead, she presses for the United States to act like something other than the self-interested superpower it is.
The most utopian among us will have difficulty imagining a United States that functions as disinterested protector to the world's imperiled peoples. Outside its borders, the country is even less frequently perceived as the white knight it might imagine itself to be; rather, conflicts of interest, real or perceived, trail it wherever it intervenes. Power does not take such concerns seriously. If she did, she would not be so swift to dismiss the role of international institutions in favor of American unilateralism. Are the world's powerful the most trustworthy guardians of its powerless? Not on the evidence of this book. Could it be otherwise? Samantha Power might say that this is an empirical question, and it is on this ground that her idealism and her pragmatism meet. She believes that Washington is made of individual wills, and that these wills are open to suasion. Those who refuse cynicism, she insists, whether they are journalists, politicians or ordinary citizens like Raphael Lemkin, have the power substantively to alter our leadership's notion of what is, or isn't, in the American interest.

Unreal Estate

BYLINE:  By Charles V. Bagli 

 BODY:
 Last month, Donald J. Trump put a $58 million price tag on the 20,000-square-foot penthouse apartment of Trump World Tower. A week earlier, Trump and his Japanese partners signed a contract to sell the Empire State Building for $57.5 million. Sure, the vast duplex -- about 10 times the size of the average American home -- has wraparound windows and 18-foot ceilings atop Manhattan's tallest residential tower. But is an apartment on First Avenue across from the United Nations worth more than the city's tallest and most famous skyscraper? It boggles the mind. But let's do the math.

The Empire State Building
Raymond Cirz, C.E.O. of Integra Realty Resources, who has appraised some of the tallest buildings in the world, estimated that a building like the Empire State is easily worth $400 million -- possibly as much as $600 million. The relatively minuscule sale price of $57.5 million, however, is related to the skyscraper's complex latticework of ownership. The building's 950 tenants collectively pay more than $100 million a year in rent. But under the terms of a 1961 lease, most of the revenue goes not to the owner but to an investment group headed by Peter L. Malkin, which controls the 114-year master lease for the entire tower. Trump and the Japanese investors got only $1.97 million a year; at those numbers, the ownership comes in for a hefty discount. The deal provides only a 3 or 4 percent return, but Malkin's group paid $57.5 million to merge the lease and the title, because once they are under one entity the building's resale value increases.

The Apartment
The penthouse has got libraries and gyms, but experts including Cirz say its price is in its name. "I guess it's the Trump factor," he said. (While people associate the Trump World Tower with the man himself, few link Trump to the Empire State Building.) "Some people are willing to pay a premium for being associated with something." Cem Uzan, for one, a member of the Turkish family that owns the Telsim telecommunications group, was prepared to pay $38 million for the penthouse (that price would have topped the most ever paid for a Manhattan apartment: $37.5 million). Alas, the once high-flying Uzan defaulted on his contract and lost his $8 million deposit. Trump, the superlative-prone developer, stands by his latest asking price of $58 million. But many brokers said the penthouse is hardly worth what he wants. This is nothing new for Trump. When he tried to sell his debt-ridden casinos in Atlantic City for a hefty sum, there were no takers.

Sixth Quarterly Loss At Computer Associates
Computer Associates International (NYSE: CA) of Islandia said Monday that despite an increase in revenues, it would post a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31. This will be the company's sixth straight quarterly loss. It would not specify an exact amount but said that it would be smaller than the 4 to 5 cents a share it originally projected. 
 The company said that revenues rose during the quarter to $770 million, compared with $733 million for the same period a year ago. The company said that quarterly results would be hurt by amortization expenses and write-offs that could reach $300 million. 
 Computer Associates also announced the sale of part of its InterBiz line to SSA Global Technologies in Chicago. As a result of the sale, Computer Associates will reduce its work force by about 750 employees, or 4 percent.

Circuit Maker Posts Loss
Steven J. Bilodeau, the chairman and chief executive of the Standard Microsystems Corporation (Nasdaq: SMSC) of Hauppauge, said last week that although the company ended its fiscal year on Feb. 28 with an unprofitable quarter, he predicted the company would show a profit in the first quarter.
"The fourth quarter demonstrated the company's success in achieving a profitable business model, even under current weak economic conditions," he said. 
Standard Microsystems, which makes integrated circuits for personal computers, reported a profit of $5.9 million for the fiscal year, down from $26.9 million the previous year. The company posted a loss of $123,000 for the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $79,000 for the same quarter a year ago.

Sales Drop at MSC
The MSC Industrial Direct Company (NYSE: MSM) of Melville reported Tuesday that its profits dropped to $8.17 million for the second fiscal quarter ended March 2, down from $14.4 million for the same quarter last year. Net sales dropped to $194.8 million, down from $233.1 million during the same quarter last year. The company distributes instruments, cutting tools and safety equipment to industrial customers throughout the United States.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
How a TaxOn Cigarettes Can Help The Taxed

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
THE people who run the country's cities and states seem to have developed a new philosophy of government: when cash is short, hit up the smokers for more money.
 In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wants to raise the city's cigarette tax to $1.50 a pack, from just 8 cents. Knowing that most Americans' distaste for smoking outweighs their skepticism of new taxes, politicians from other states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have made similar proposals in recent months. 
 But this approach has its own difficulties. A just society should not solve its problems by creating a group of pariahs and then overtaxing them. If the government does not have enough money to run its programs, one wonders if it should either rein in its ambitions or increase taxes for everybody. 
Also, raising cigarette taxes instead of income or real-estate taxes, as Mayor Bloomberg wants to do, seems likely to hurt the poor and the middle class, who spend a greater portion of their income on cigarettes than the wealthy do.
But to a rapidly emerging field of economics, this analysis is all wrong. These economists make the counterintuitive argument that increasing cigarette taxes helps smokers more than anyone else.
To understand their position, start by thinking about the smokers you know (or yourself, if you are among the 20 percent or so of Americans who smoke). The chances are good that they have often said they would like to quit, and some have probably tried to do so more than once. In the end, though, short-term desire, or addiction, tended to trump long-term happiness.
For years, economists would have said that actions speak louder than words. Whatever smokers say about quitting, they are rationally deciding that the pleasure they derive from cigarettes exceeds their cost.
Jonathan Gruber was one of these economists when he worked in the Treasury Department in the Clinton administration. Mr. Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, remembers telling other policy makers that economic theory says they should not increase cigarette taxes. People should be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to smoke, he told his colleagues. Those who smoke may hurt themselves, but they will not drain the country's resources because so many of them will die before running up large Medicare bills.
Mr. Gruber called it his most embarrassing moment in government, and his discomfort with his own argument caused him to begin researching the issue when he returned to academia. The central question is whether smokers really do rationally weigh the pluses and minuses of smoking, as traditional economics would suggest.
TO find an answer, Mr. Gruber and Sendhil Mullainathan, another M.I.T. economist, studied surveys of Americans' and Canadians' reported happiness over the last 30 years. These surveys have become popular in the hot field of behavioral economics, whose followers say human beings do not always make rational choices.
Mr. Gruber and Mr. Mullainathan used about 10 variables that are correlated with smoking, including age, income, household size and religious observance, to identify who the smokers in the survey were -- thus catching former smokers as well. The two also collected data on changes in cigarette taxes in the United States and Canada.
While controlling for other variables, the two economists found that after cigarette taxes increased, unhappiness declined among the smoking subset, indicating that they had quit or cut down smoking and were pleased about it. The taxes are also less regressive than they appear, because poorer smokers are more likely to quit when the price increases. 
Researchers already know that smokers are price-sensitive. Studies show that a 10 percent price increase produces about a 5 percent drop in smoking. The new work -- available at http://econ-www.mit.edu
/faculty/gruberj/ -- shows that taxes push people to take a step they had wanted to take before but couldn't.
"We all know smokers who really want to quit, but there is nothing in the private market that can force them to quit," Mr. Gruber said. "The government can provide that."
Some smokers, to be sure, do not want to quit, and they receive no benefit from higher taxes. But society still might. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that the current level of cigarette taxes was not high enough to pay for the health problems caused by smoking.
The beauty of cigarette taxation is that it is among the few public policies that can both raise revenue and cut costs.

HEADLINE: Falling Behind on Free Trade 

BYLINE:  By Robert B. Zoellick; Robert B. Zoellick is the United States trade representative.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States has been falling behind the rest of the world in pursuing trade agreements. Worldwide, there are 150 regional free-trade and customs agreements; the United States is a party to only three. Each one sets new rules and opens markets for those that have signed on and creates hurdles for those outside the agreement. Trade legislation that could help remedy this imbalance is awaiting Senate consideration. Prompt action is needed to clear the way for America's international trade leadership and economic interests.
 Last Dec. 6 the House of Representatives passed a trade promotion authority bill that would allow the president to negotiate trade agreements that Congress would then consider through an up-or-down vote. Within a week of House action, the Senate Finance Committee passed a similar bill by a vote of 18 to 3, demonstrating strong bipartisan support. On Jan. 4, in a speech on America's new economic challenges, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle emphasized his support for this trade bill and his intent "to bring it up for a vote in the full Senate early this year." Earlier this month, President Bush called on the Senate to act by April 22. 
 Trade promotion authority, while critical, is not the only trade-related legislation stuck in the Senate.
The Andean Trade Preference Act, after a decade of helping Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia counter the narcotics trade, will come unraveled after May 16 without decisive action in the Senate.
The Generalized System of Preferences, which has been helping the poorest countries export to the American market since 1974, expired last September and awaits renewal by the Senate. Important amendments to the highly successful African Growth and Opportunity Act have been passed by the House and now depend on Senate action.
Failure to act on these measures will devastate thousands of small businesses in poor, struggling democracies.
While awaiting Congressional action, the Bush administration has regained America's momentum on trade. In Doha, Qatar, last year, the administration reversed the failure of the World Trade Organization's Seattle meeting in 1999 by launching new global trade negotiations -- the Doha Development Agenda, a new type of trade round that seeks to secure the link between development and trade. The administration played a key role in overcoming the obstacles to China's and Taiwan's entering the W.T.O. It also reinvigorated negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, with targets for action in the first half of this year.
We are also closing in on agreements with Chile and Singapore and are eager to launch new negotiations, starting with Central America. Yet we need Senate action on trade promotion authority before we can move ahead in a strongly credible way.
This administration has left no doubt that it will enforce American laws against unfair trade practices. We have reassured Americans anxious about change by demonstrating that the administration, under international rules, will use safeguard provisions, like the recent decision to place temporary tariffs on some imported steel, to defend America's economic interests. And we will support Americans facing loss of work through expanded and improved trade adjustment assistance, which offers expanded unemployment benefits and worker retraining programs.
There simply is no cause for further delay by the Senate leadership. Most senators -- Democrat and Republican -- support the bipartisan bills on trade promotion authority crafted by Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Charles Grassley. The revival of this authority -- which earlier sessions of Congress granted to the previous five presidents -- will contribute to our economic recovery by enhancing our ability to open markets for American exports and by lowering the cost of supplies for American families and businesses.
While the United States idled its free trade negotiations, others did not. The European Union now has 29 free trade or special customs agreements, 22 of which it negotiated in the past decade, and is in the process of negotiating with 12 more countries. Mexico sped past the United States after the North American Free Trade Agreement to negotiate nine free-trade agreements with 29 countries.
Japan has finished its agreement with Singapore and is exploring options with Canada, Mexico, Korea, Chile and countries in Southeast Asia. Even China, which just became a member of the World Trade Organization, is pursuing a free trade agreement -- with the countries of Southeast Asia.
Each agreement without us may set new rules for intellectual property, emerging high-tech sectors, agriculture standards, customs procedures or countless other areas of the modern, integrated global economy -- rules that will be made without taking account of American interests.
The price for inaction will eventually be paid by American workers and consumers. One in three acres on American farms is planted for export -- generating some $53 billion for farmers and ranchers last year. Our exports support an estimated 12 million jobs and accounted for 25 percent of American economic growth over the course of the last decade. Our last two major trade agreements -- Nafta and the global Uruguay Round -- resulted in higher incomes and lower prices, amounting to an annual benefit of $1,300 to $2,000 for the average American family of four.
America's international economic leadership necessitates opening the Senate logjam so commerce can move, economic networks can expand, and prosperity can flow freely at home and abroad.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Latin Dance; 
A Coup by Any Other Name

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
WHEN is a coup not a coup? When the United States says so, it seems -- especially if the fallen leader is no friend to American interests.
 What else to call the fall on Friday of Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez? An armed transition of power? By any other name, though its European and Latin American allies deplored it, it was a consummation devoutly wished for by the White House. 
 "The actions encouraged by the Chavez government provoked a crisis," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said on Friday. That sentence was spring-loaded, given the history of Latin American coups tacitly encouraged or covertly supported by the United States. 
For Washington, the real crisis in Caracas was Mr. Chavez. It ended with his leaving office at gunpoint. Now 1.5 million barrels of Venezuelan oil a day will keep flowing to the United States. And none will go to Fidel Castro's Cuba -- Venezuela's new leader, an oil man, immediately declared that tap shut.
In Latin America, the United States has long preferred friendly faces in presidential palaces, playing reliable roles, whether or not they are wearing uniforms. It supported authoritarian regimes throughout Central and South America during and after the cold war in defense of its economic and political interests.
In tiny Guatemala, the Central Intelligence Agency mounted a coup overthrowing the democratically elected government in 1954, and it backed subsequent right-wing governments against small leftist rebel groups for four decades. Roughly 200,000 civilians died.
In Chile, a C.I.A.-supported coup helped put Gen. Augusto Pinochet in power from 1973 to 1990. In Peru, a fragile democratic government is still unraveling the agency's role in a decade of support for the now-deposed and disgraced president, Alberto K. Fujimori, and his disreputable spy chief, Vladimiro L. Montesinos.
The United States had to invade Panama in 1989 to topple its narco-dictator, Manuel A. Noriega, who, for almost 20 years, was a valued informant for American intelligence. And the struggle to mount an armed opposition against Nicaragua's leftists in the 1980's by any means necessary, including selling arms to Iran for cold cash, led to indictments against senior Reagan administration officials.
Among those investigated back then was Otto J. Reich, a veteran of Latin American struggles. No charges were ever filed against Mr. Reich. He later became United States ambassador to Venezuela and now serves as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs by presidential appointment. The fall of Mr. Chavez is a feather in his cap.
THERE is so far no evidence that the United States covertly undermined Mr. Chavez. He did a decent job destabilizing himself. But the open White House embrace of his overthrow will not be lost on Latin American leaders who dare thumb their noses at the United States, as did Mr. Chavez.
Yes, he was freely and democratically elected, and his starry-eyed visions of a united South America unshackled from the dominance of Washington's power did not bother the administration much. But his selling oil to Mr. Castro? His alliances with his brothers in petroleum production, Saddam Hussein and Muammar el-Qaddafi? His not-so-tacit support for the Colombian rebels? And the potential threat he posed to thousands of American gas stations?
Above all, the United States wants stability in its backyard. Mr. Chavez did not fit in with President Bush's vision of "the century of the Americas" in "a hemisphere of liberty."
The Organization of American States, the most venerable alliance in the Americas, has a new Democracy Charter, signed by every one of its members, including the United States, on Sept. 11. It requires strong action against military coups. Yet, in all likelihood, it will be ignored in Venezuela's case, because Washington wanted Mr. Chavez gone. 
Today, armed dictatorships cannot flourish as easily as they did in the cold war. Ideologies have little power left in Latin America. But civil institutions have less. Laws, legislatures and legal mechanisms have been starved by strong armies and weak democracies. The promised land of political empowerment pledged by free traders still seems far away. And in Venezuela, despite its oil, more than 85 percent of the people are still dirt poor.
"Venezuela has been in and out of crises like this for 50 years, with arrogant elites overthrown by popular uprisings whose leaders become arrogant elites," said David J. Rothkopf, chairman of Intellibridge, a Washington consulting firm run by former senior intelligence and foreign policy officials. "The only cure would be to extract all the oil from Venezuela at once."
The cure for Washington was the army's extracting Mr. Chavez.

AS events spun disastrously out of control in August of 1914, Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign secretary, summed up the situation in a despondent remark that has been remembered ever since. "The lamps are going out all over Europe," he said. "We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime."
 Things in the Middle East have not reached that point yet, and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is an inveterate optimist. But a less sanguine man, confronted with the task of promoting peace at a time when the Israelis and the Palestinians are locked in a cycle of reciprocal violence, savage even by their standards, might pronounce a verdict almost as gloomy as Sir Edward's. 
 The Middle East has been one of the most flammable parts of the world for many decades, of course. War and near-war have been the norm there for much of the half-century since the end of World War II. But there are good reasons to consider the current crisis not only more severe but significantly different from those in the recent past. 
It has potential implications far beyond the Holy Land, indeed far beyond the Middle East -- implications for the American war on terror, for the relationship between the United States and its European allies, for India and Pakistan. It could spill over into Syria, which might jump at the chance to confront Israel if Israeli officials follow up on their veiled threats to hit Syrian targets. It could destabilize Jordan, a force for moderation.
Until it is defused, the prospect of significant European or Islamic support for an attempt to oust Saddam Hussein of Iraq is next to nil.
And if an explosion in the Middle East should tempt someone like Mr. Hussein to interrupt oil flows or unleash weapons of mass destruction, the stakes quickly become global, challenging the major powers, even more than they are challenged today, to distinguish what is prudent from what is rash.
In that way, if in no other, the situation today evokes the trap of out-of-control events that history set for Europe in 1914. Then vanity, miscalculation and new weapons and tactics set the stage for military stalemate on a catastrophic scale, and once war started, rigid alliances assured that virtually all of Europe would be involved. Rigid alliances are not the problem today, of course, and Americans seem justifiably confident of their superiority on the battlefield. But broad resentment of the United States -- in the third world especially, but in corners of Europe too -- could unite other countries in ways that frustrate American faith in an inevitable victory in the long war against terror.
"Afghanistan and Iraq, the Middle East and the rest of the Islamic world -- they're separate now, but they're all related, and none of us knows exactly how they will interact," said Richard C. Holbrooke, the veteran diplomatic trouble-shooter under Democratic presidents. "Many different scenarios could lead us into 'The Guns of August.' Our goal must be to prevent that."
But that will be difficult to do at a time when the leaders of both the Israelis and the Palestinians appear to believe that the very existence of their people is at stake (whether that is correct or not), and that only the use of brute force will keep them from being exterminated. Mr. Powell tried last week, without immediate success, to disabuse them of that view, warning Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel that no matter how long he pursued his offensive, it would not end terrorism.
"The violence and anger and frustration which feeds that will still be there unless we find a negotiating process," he said. But at almost the same moment, the White House was describing Mr. Sharon as "a man of peace," and the events of the last few weeks have only strengthened the two leaders' popularity with their publics. They have little incentive to change course.
A European diplomat, not at all unfriendly to the United States, commented last week: "It has become a self-fulfilling prophecy -- in the Middle East, terrorism pays. The extremists have destroyed the Oslo peace process. Meanwhile, I fear we're creating more terrorists by the minute."
Mr. Sharon and his nemesis, Yasir Arafat of the Palestinian Authority, are both playing much stronger hands now than they held a year or so ago.
Seemingly fading in his role as the international spokesman for the Palestinians earlier this year, Mr. Arafat has been accorded near-martyr status by the Israeli tanks that have pinned him down in Ramallah. Under formidable international pressure to pull back from the West Bank, Prime Minister Sharon has been reinforced in his defiance by a series of Palestinian suicide bombings that have come at crucial moments.
"The situation is totally, completely out of control, in a way it has never quite been before," said Judith Kipper, a top Middle East specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. "There's no adult supervision, which can come only from the United States."
Early on, the Bush administration adopted a more passive approach to the Middle East than most of its predecessors. For a time, it had no special envoy to the region, and when it began sending prominent officials there, most recently Secretary Powell, it did so without explicit mandates, according to American and other diplomats.
AT a time when the United States boasts the greatest military force in its history, when it is able to project that force around the world, it faces a precipitous decline in its influence in one of the arenas of greatest importance. In large part, this has resulted from the rashness of the two leaders, which makes the usual diplomatic, political and economic pressures less useful; but the United States did little to restrain them before the situation began going rapidly downhill.
Neither the European Union nor the United Nations has any significant influence over Israel, and public opinion in Europe has turned sharply against United States policy in the region. The sweeping support enjoyed by President Bush's anti-terror policy has dissolved on the Continent. European leaders argue that the American president has failed in what they see as his responsibility to rein in Mr. Sharon, on whom they place much of the blame for the current violence.
On the surface, Britain has proved a more steadfast ally. Prime Minister Tony Blair has not only dispatched Royal Marines to Afghanistan but also made a speech in Texas pledging support for any American campaign in Iraq. But he is well out ahead of public opinion, especially within his own Labor Party.
"I don't remember the last time Europe and the United States looked at an important issue as differently," said Anthony Sampson, the British author and journalist. "Maybe Vietnam."
In truth, Europe is still trying to adjust to a world with a single superpower, and it is having a hard time doing so. It sees American military spending that far outstrips its own and worries, but is unwilling to allocate more money to defense. Respect for American military successes in Afghanistan coexists with resentment of American power. They fear being left out of big decisions, even as Mr. Bush appeals for unity against terrorists.
"To tell you the truth," a European minister told an American acquaintance recently, "we really don't know where we are. We don't know what the United States will do, or the Israelis, or the Palestinians, or the other countries in the Middle East. And we don't know what we should do, either." As Barbara Tuchman wrote about the beginning of World War I in "The Guns of August" (Macmillan, 1962), when so many elements in the equation are changing it is easy for strategists to delude themselves into thinking that, with a bit of luck, they can prevail. Rational calculations become difficult. So they appear to be these days.
If all the lights are not yet out in the Middle East, they are rapidly blinking off. In the murk of death and destruction, with alliances in flux, it is harder and harder, even for the experts, to see who will be able to switch them back on, and when.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AFGHAN-AMERICANS; 
They Can Go Home Again, and Hundreds of Refugees Can't Wait

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: FREMONT, Calif., April 12 

 BODY:
The phone rings all day at the Pamir Travel Agency here in "Little Kabul." All day, every day of the week, and 9 times out of 10, Hashmat Ansari knows exactly what the caller wants.
 "Every one wants to go back to Afghanistan," he said with a sigh. "The waiting list is four weeks, more than 500 people." The phone rang, and he sighed again. "I'll stay here to book the flights," he said after telling the caller about the four-week wait, "and then, maybe in a year, I'll get to go myself." 
 In Fremont, where 10,000 of the estimated 60,000 Afghan refugees in the San Francisco Bay area live, everyone knows someone who has returned to the country, or is planning to, even if only for a couple of weeks.
The recent skirmishes between rival political factions in Afghanistan and the uncertain outcome of elections in June have made expatriates nervous. But those developments have not stopped many here, in the largest Afghan community in the United States, and elsewhere in the country, from wanting to go home again. While hard numbers are difficult to come by, the anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that refugees are anxiously returning to see what has become of their country and, in most cases, to help rebuild it.
The Pamir Travel Agency has booked more than 700 customers in the last few months, said Mr. Ansari, who is 32 and arrived here in 1987. Many were just children when their families escaped the 1979 Soviet intervention. They have gone to school here, become citizens, found their niche. Still, more than half of those who want to return are in their 20's, and think of the trip as a kind of personal Peace Corps mission. Mr. Ansari said.
Others are elders still aching for home two decades after they fled. 
"We're getting calls from all over the country," Mr. Ansari said, adding that many callers want to book their flights to Kabul by way of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, from an Afghan-owned agency.
Return of Qualified Afghans, an agency in Washington that was started in December to bring college-educated professionals back to Afghanistan for up to a year to help in the rebuilding effort, has received 300 applications from the United States, among 4,000 from 27 countries all over the world. The program, begun by the International Organization for Migration, which has conducted similar programs in Bosnia, Armenia and several African countries, is set to run through 2004. By that time, the organization hopes to have 1,500 Afghans placed in fields including technology, law, medicine, agriculture and economics. 
Hekmat Karzai, the program's director (and a cousin of Afghanistan's interim president, Hamid Karzai), said that as of the beginning of April, 50 Afghans had been placed in positions including deputy ministers in the government and administrators in nongovernmental organizations. 
"What we do when we receive a request from Afghanistan is to match the position with the applicants in our database," said Mr. Karzai. "There is a tremendous need in Afghanistan for these people and their expertise, in all sectors."
Although the program is not part of the Afghan government, it succinctly addresses interim President Karzai's call for Afghan professionals to return to help their country. 
Some in the program leave after a brief period, Hekmat Karzai said. Others who make the trip to the homeland out of a sense of moral responsibility end up wanting to repatriate.
"We may send someone for three months," he said, "and at the end of that time the person says they don't want to go back."
Rona Popal, who came to Fremont as a young bride in 1979, and raised three children in the United States, plans to divide her time between here and there. She plans to establish ties between the California School for the Deaf and a school for the deaf in Kabul, as well as work on projects that will help women become more self-sufficient.
But Ms. Popal, who is president of the Afghan Women's Association in Fremont, formed after the Taliban seized power in 1995 to help Afghan women leave the country and come here, said that more Afghans here would be flocking to the homeland if the situation there was more stable.
" Right now, Afghanistan is in the process of making a new 
government," said Ms. Popal, a community organizer who is also director of an umbrella group of eight local Afghan organizations. "Everyone is starting from zero. So for people who are wanting to go back, they just don't know yet when or where to go or for how long. It's a puzzle."
Ms. Popal hopes to bring representatives of the International Organization for Migration to Fremont in June, to speak to members of the community who are considering a return. "The best we can do is to try and give people information and ideas, so if they want to go back they can know how to go about it and what to expect when they get there."
But Nilufar Shuja is not waiting. At age 25, she has spent most of her life in this country, where her family settled after fleeing Afghanistan in 1980. Still, on April 19, she is returning to the land where she was born on a one-way ticket.
Her first trip back last month, where she led a fact-finding group of 14 women, convinced her Afghanistan was the place for her, she said. She will leave behind her mother, brother and sister. Ms. Shuja, who has a degree in business information systems, is a community organizer and a founding member of the Society of Afghan Professionals. In Kabul, she plans to work as a coordinator for educational tours conducted by Global Exchange, the human rights organization in San Francisco.
"In my mind I'm going home," Ms. Shuja said. "And I'll be coming back here to visit."

HEADLINE: In a Forceful Speech, Gore Criticizes Administration 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., April 13 

 BODY:
Declaring that "here in America, patriotism does not mean keeping quiet," former Vice President Al Gore re-emerged today at the scene of the 2000 electoral crisis, forcefully -- and noisily -- taking on President Bush on tax cuts, the environment and other issues.
 "I'm tired of this right-wing sidewind," Mr. Gore said to the 2,500 partisans here for the Florida Democratic Convention. "I've had it. America's economy is suffering unnecessarily. Important American values are being trampled. Special interests are calling the shots." 
 On the environment, the economy and values, he said, "this administration is following the same pattern: selling out America's future in return for short-term political gains."
Mr. Gore even dared to do what many Democrats had said he was afraid of doing in the 2000 campaign: embrace President Bill Clinton.
"I think Bill Clinton and I did a damn good job," Mr. Gore said, practically shouting. 
While Mr. Gore has spoken numerous times in the 16 months since the acrimonious 36-day standoff over the counting of votes in Florida -- and offered sharp criticism of Mr. Bush at a meeting of Democrats in Tennessee, his home state, in February -- his address here carried particular weight because this was the first political event he has attended with other Democrats who have designs on the White House.
It was also a crucial first test of whether Democratic loyalists here would stand behind him in a rematch with Mr. Bush in 2004. His certainly received a hero's welcome, with delegates often jumping from their feet and waving placards proclaiming, "Still Gore Country!" over an outline of the state of Florida.
While he did not declare that he was running, Mr. Gore seemed very much the candidate today. He drew some of his biggest cheers when he scolded Mr. Bush for not sharing information with Congress and the public. "America's policies should be decided in the open and not in secret back room meetings where average citizens get the door slammed in their face while polluters get the welcome mat," he said. "Let's have a little Florida sunshine."
And Mr. Gore could not resist analogies with the nearby Walt Disney World. "They're the party of Fantasy Land; we're the party of Tomorrow Land," he said. "We're the party of Main Street U.S.A.; they're the party of Pirates of Enron."
Though Mr. Gore insists he has made no decision, Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman, who exercised with the former vice president this morning, said: "I think he will run. That's my personal opinion."
If he does run, Mr. Gore would face a knotty political situation in this state. Some Democrats showed their continued loyalty. Yet even some who proudly wore Gore stickers were not ready to sign up again with their standard-bearer from 2000. Others are embittered, blaming him for losing the White House, and say they are ready to switch loyalties.
Mr. Gore inspired mixed sentiments late Friday night when he and his wife, Tipper, strolled into the lobby of the Wyndham Palace hotel and were greeted by a clutch of wide-eyed supporters.
"I want you to vigorously pursue the nomination," said Fred Rader, 54, a delegate from Homestead, Fla.
Mr. Gore smiled and replied: "Thanks for the encouragement. I appreciate it."
Another delegate, after shaking Mr. Gore's hand, exclaimed, "Oh man, goose bumps!"
But others, like Representative Corrine Brown, a Democrat from Jacksonville, were not so enamored -- or forgiving -- of the candidate who won the popular vote in 2000. She said she was not sure she would back Mr. Gore again.
"It depends on him," she said. "He has to be hungry." Asserting that Mr. Gore did not aggressively battle the Republicans during the recount, Ms. Brown added: "They sent in the lions. And he let them take it away from us."
Several White House hopefuls seized on the convention this weekend to begin convincing Florida Democrats of their political appeal. They competed with one another in holding private receptions and in wooing reporters. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, for one, invited several reporters to dinner on Saturday night. Presumably not to be outdone, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. Gore's running mate in 2000, invited many of those same reporters for cocktails beforehand. Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman and their wives reunited over breakfast here this morning.
Other Democrats who appeared here were Senators John Edwards of North Carolina and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.
The spectacle of so many presidential possibilities was evidence that Democrats were wasting no time in their quest to topple President Bush.
"This is the first pitch of spring training," said Senator Bob Graham of Florida. "The Yankees have gone from Tampa to the Bronx. The presidential candidates have just opened spring training in Florida."
In his speech this morning, Mr. Edwards told the delegates, "It's because of you we're going to win the White House in 2004."
Despite the parade of contenders, the politician whom everyone is watching most closely -- and who has the most at stake -- is Mr. Gore.
Many Democrats in recent months have accused him of squandering opportunities to take on Mr. Bush. But Mr. Gore has also been mindful that if he is too strident in criticizing the president in wartime, he risks appearing like a sore loser and, worse yet, unpatriotic.
As evidence of the touchy spot Mr. Gore finds himself in, 8 in 10 Democrats nationwide said he should say nothing critical of Mr. Bush, according to a USA Today-CNN-Gallup poll released on Friday. Forty-three percent of the Democrats said they would back another candidacy by Mr. Gore; that is down from 65 percent last August.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
White Plains Business Group Appoints a New Director

BYLINE:  By Elsa Brenner 

 BODY:
 The White Plains Downtown Business Improvement District has appointed a new executive director, Kathleen Gunn, formerly an economic development policy specialist for the city. Ms. Gunn was also a grant manager for a nonprofit group and a district representative for Congresswoman Nita M. Lowey. 
 The private, nonprofit Business Improvement District -- whose members are downtown property owner -- works with the city administration to improve the commercial area bordered by Hamilton Avenue to the north, North Broadway to the east, Post Road to the west and Maple Avenue to the south. That area, which is known as the central business district of White Plains, had a commercial office vacancy rate of 22 percent at the end of February, according to figures from the Stamford, Conn., office of Insignia/ESG, the commercial real estate company; the rate was 14.8 percent in the county as a whole.

HEADLINE: REFLECTIONS ON CREATIVE WRITING CLASS: THE TAUGHT; 
From the first day, it was clear Frank McCourt's class would be different.

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Greenberg; Jonathan Greenberg is the author of "Staking a Claim: Jake Simmons Jr. and the Making of an African-American Oil Dynasty" (Atheneum) and co-editor of "Buying America Back" (Council Oak Books).

 BODY:
The year was 1974 and I had just turned 16. The sexual revolution, Nixon's resignation and marijuana filled the air with new possibilities. I was about to enter my junior year at the academically elite Stuyvesant High. My school uniform was a used Army jacket, a beat-up brown cowboy hat and shoulder-length hair. 
 The previous term, I had dozed through English grammar as the teacher -- soon to retire, nose red, gray hair flowing out of his ear (teenagers fixate on such things) -- diagrammed sentence after sentence day after day. It was the most boring class I had ever taken. So when, junior year, we were permitted to select one elective, I jumped at the chance to take creative writing. 
 From the first day, it was clear Frank McCourt's class would be different. There was that impish smirk and lyrical Irish accent -- I had never heard English spoken so poetically -- and most unforgettably, the way he transformed the world into a divine comedy through his stories. 
They weren't written stories. Mr. McCourt would not publish his first book, "Angela's Ashes," until 1996, when he was 64 and living on a teacher's pension. Instead, they were spoken tales of his Catholic-school upbringing in Ireland, his first jobs in New York City, his wondrous new daughter and his periodic battles with the school administration. 
Writing stories and reading them to the class was our job, he said, not his. Mr. McCourt was the first teacher who ever suggested that our lives, even at 16, were useful. "Grist for the mill," he would call our juvenile experiences, and then he would try to find ways to get us to write about them. If we learned to write observantly, if we could bare our souls "with alacrity!" and "make it real," then we, too, could be writers. 
Classes followed no fixed format: on any given day, it was impossible to predict whether he would be discussing our writing assignments, his ride on the subway that morning, the purpose of life or his lamentable salary. A photo I took for photo shop captured the theatrical spirit of the class. Mr. McCourt stands grasping the room's American flag, in front of a blackboard, upon which he has written: "FRANK McCOURT ANTI-LEUKEMIA FUND. GOAL: $1 FROM EVERY STUY STUDENT. ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE." 
There was, of course, no fund, and Mr. McCourt never tried to collect any money. But there were more than 2,000 Stuyvesant students -- enough, theoretically, to dig him out of some impossible financial bind. It was an idea worthy of Jonathan Swift (a regularly assigned writer). And such wit made intellectualism cool. 
Being cool at 16 was everything. The first of the dozens of handwritten stories I wrote during four terms of McCourt classes was a parody of Johnny Carson called "The Johnny Cockroach Show." It earned a 75, with the comment: "Too slick and glib. This reveals little (if anything) of your writing skill. I wanted an essay/story piece so that I could see how you plan and develop an idea." Mr. McCourt was even less impressed by a story I wrote soon after, a disjointed science-fiction short about a microscopic universe. Mr. McCourt let me know cheap shots would go unappreciated. He gave me a 65, commenting, "Awkward, trite, irrelevant conclusion. You dragged it in by the ears. The story itself goes nowhere. What is the point, the conflict?" 
The problem, it seemed, was that I wasn't digging inside for my material. To make us think more like writers, each of us had to write a short composition, then pass it around the room to classmates. By learning to critique our classmates, we would begin to turn such observations inward. For that assignment, I wrote about my reaction, as a 5-year-old, to the John F. Kennedy assassination. 
Joel Moscowitz's unpunctuated comments and grade of 75 were typical of the student responses I received: "Grammar horrible even worse than mine a lot of errors...." More telling than my paper or the comments, however, was my response to them. For posterity, I attached a note to the composition and comments that read: "We were to write a composition for my creative writing class and nine people would grade and comment on it. From these comments, I support my views of the patheticness of the marking system and the theory that most men (and women) are created idiots. They spoke of handwriting and spelling, without making any comment on the content." 
Smart-aleck 16-year-olds like me were often insufferable. But Mr. McCourt kept at it, assignment after assignment, commenting on more than 150 papers every week. 
His "write a modern fairy tale" assignment resulted in one of the first stories I wrote that had a point to it as I managed, finally, to plan and develop an idea. In "Alice in Learning Land," Alice skips merrily into Stuyvesant, curious about what game we are playing. She joins us in the game of School, and sits in on the math class of an ugly malcontent named Trout (as in Kilgore Trout -- I was reading Vonnegut at the time). When Trout is scolded by the teacher for not having his math homework, he looks to his classmates for support, but none are there for him, except Alice, who kisses him on the forehead. Mr. McCourt wasted no time getting to the point. "Despite the title, this is not about Alice: it's about the 'ugly' boy. And it's promising. But, oh boy, do you need to discipline your writing. You must organize your stuff. Do you keep a notebook? 85." 
I was encouraged, and started a notebook of school trips, my after-school job, street crime, growing old, my recently deceased grandfather and, eventually, my favorite teacher. This quote struck me as worth recording: "Sex is like good food -- you do it because you feel like it.' Frank McCourt, Dec. 11, 1974, in English class." I imagine the comment was in response to some misconstrued remark one of us had made about sex. 
Mr. McCourt insisted we read -- Rabelais, H.L. Mencken, Aretino, Mary McCarthy, the Bible. Shakespeare was complemented with Tom Stoppard's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," "Beowulf" with John Gardner's modern sequel, "Grendel." Later, on reading "'Tis," I was struck by how similar his admonitions were to those he had received 25 years earlier, fresh off the boat, from a Third Avenue pub owner, Tim Costello, who banished him until he had read Samuel Johnson. 
Sometimes Mr. McCourt would read particularly eloquent passages of text to the class, making the words sing. At other times, he made no attempt to conceal his frustration with us. On one handwritten story I submitted, he circled every crossed-out word and threw it back to me, gradeless, with the comment, "I refuse to read any more sloppy manuscripts. Sloppy." Every few months, he would saunter to the front of the class and announce that he was just too fed up to teach. He would then challenge one of us to take his place: "I'm tired of playing zookeeper. Who wants to teach the class today?" 
One diatribe was on the importance of doing one special thing for ourselves every day, to appreciate the moment. "Walk through the park, take a detour, help a blind person across the street, buy yourself a pint of ice cream and eat the whole thing by yourself." That night, I bought a pint of H* agen-Dazs coffee ice cream and ate the whole thing by myself. I had never eaten anything so delicious! I began treating myself to special walks, to random acts of kindness, to opening my eyes when I might have otherwise been on automatic pilot. And it worked: I began developing a sense of appreciation. 
Despite these life lessons, immaturity often took center stage in my stories. A spiteful take on Poe's "House of Usher," entitled "The Fall of the House of Weinstein," received a well-deserved 70. A boy travels to a grimy, boarded-up building on a desolate Harlem block where his grandparents, the last Jewish residents in the neighborhood, reside. As he walks in, his insane grandmother asks him to cover her as she breathes her last, lying beside the grandfather, who has already been dead a week. Her last words: "Don't call an ambulance. Let me stay ... with my house!" 
Mr. McCourt's comments filled the back page: "My dear old Jonathan: You have a great deal of intellectual imaginative and spiritual energy. But you are a slob! You're a disgrace to yourself. In your smart-alecky way, you still betray a sensitivity to people. Now, Jonathan, settle down and -- THINK. Your friend, The Teacher"
Our weekly creative writing assignments provided an opportunity for me to rail against what I saw as an oppressive, needlessly competitive school establishment. One such story was a classic subversive teenage fantasy. The character, Greenberg, gets a 65 in economics from "the almighty holiness and judge of academic standing Mr. Lama," who had determined that, despite participating in class more than anyone else and knowing the subject (though not the test answers), "the pleasure of my company could be valued at 65." Thirsting for revenge, Greenberg hides in the school with a can of gasoline until after closing, then breaks into Stuyvesant's student records office. He douses the files of 2,700 students. "The files went up in an array of heat, flame and smoke. It was a beautiful sight. When they grow older, they'll thank me, I knew." Outside the burning building, Greenberg phones the firemen, and when a cop asks whether he had set the fire, replies, "The fire has been set for many years. It was just a matter of someone lighting the match." 
Instead of calling the nearest law enforcement office, Mr. McCourt mixed understanding with a positive review. He called it an "excellent last line" and gave me a 95. He wrote, "Skillful narrative, energetic, lively. Dostoyevskian (in a way). Much of your writing is based in hostility. I wish you'd branch out." 
It was not until the last term of senior year that I began writing from the heart. It took a long time before I was willing to expose my life to an audience. While I had been reading my hostile fantasies out loud to classmates during previous terms, I had been mostly interested in feeling clever. Suddenly, the readings became a sort of confessional. It was probably the most transformational process of my adolescence. Every week, I would summon the courage to take my life public and would chronicle my emotions in front of 30 fellow students. Gradually, instead of lashing out, my stories began to look inward, expressing the raw, desperate melodrama that is teenage life. 
The last story I read to the class, appropriately titled "Jonathan Greenberg," was a dialogue between myself and a "voice that blazed through the darkness." In the end, blood poured from pinpricks over my entire body and the voice, along with Mr. McCourt and my two closest friends, laughed while I cried. 
What I remember most is the feeling of baring my soul: the terror of standing in front of Mr. McCourt and my classmates, tears streaming down my face as I awaited their feedback, Room 205 soundless and still. 
The following week, a classmate I barely knew dropped a note on my desk. She wrote: "I can still see you standing there, with your cowboy hat and your big brown eyes, pouring out your heart to the class. I wanted to reach out to you, to tell you that what you had to say was important, at least to me. But I didn't.* Everything you read was personal. You wanted to share it, and you really cared how we felt about it. So when the class criticized you, it hurt. To tell you the truth, I thought that what you wrote was pretty raunchy. But I'm glad you read it anyway, because I know you didn't read it for effect. For some strange reason, everything you have read has had an effect on me. So I want to share my feelings with you, and to thank you for being one of the few people who really care. But most of all, I just want to tell you that I think you're beautiful." 
It made me feel wonderful to read that letter, and perhaps it made her feel wonderful to discover the courage to write it. 
When it came to teaching us to express ourselves, Mr. McCourt was a master therapist. I became a writer that year, and have remained one ever since.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF; 
Jaw-Dropping Tales of Excess and Success

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
FROM the beginning of time, there have been women who have known the harsh secrets of housework, women who have mastered everything from the scrub brush to the garden hoe in the course of beautifying their surroundings and making people feel welcome in their homes. 
 But few besides Martha Stewart have had the imagination, really, to figure out how to monetize those womanly arts, treating each and every one of them as a full-blown opportunity to enrich themselves and transcend the working class altogether. For Ms. Stewart, the transformation from suburban housewife to multimillionaire career woman was so complete, in fact, that if she were ever caught doing housework again, the world would know that it was an act of choice. 
 A new book called "Martha Inc.: The Incredible Story of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia" (John Wiley & Sons, $27.95) tries once and for all to solve some of the riddles of her storied life. Does she really know how to make her own topiary, or is she just some pretty face propped up by legions of experts versed in the most daunting domestic details? Has success made her as unbearable as people say, or is she just misunderstood? And most important, is any of this self-made success replicable? 
The author, Christopher M. Byron, a newspaper columnist whose acid pen and financial skills are well known to readers of The New York Observer and The New York Post, is up to the task, though the book could be better. Shorter, for instance.
Readers must wade through off-pitch digressions, such as the many ways the author's life has intersected with Ms. Stewart's. For all the connections, Ms. Stewart declined to cooperate, not a bad thing since it turns out that she is less than reliable on the subject of herself. Another caveat: a lot of material in this book, while dishy, might be familiar to people who have followed Ms. Stewart's career.
Those who have not will learn that Ms. Stewart, 60, grew up in Nutley, N.J., as Martha Kostyra, chafing at her working-class life. She attended Barnard College but moonlighted as a domestic on Park Avenue to pay the bills. Blessed with good looks, she did some modeling and was named one of America's 10 "Best Dressed College Girls" by Glamour magazine in 1961, even though she was probably the only winner who was stitching her own clothes. That same year, she snagged a smart, up-and-coming husband, Andy Stewart, who promised to change her life for the better. 
But being the stay-at-home spouse was only the fallback plan. Ms. Stewart first tried Wall Street. Famous for wearing hot pants to work, she spent five years furiously peddling duds like Levitz Furniture to friends before quitting and retreating to the safety of Westport, Conn. She and her husband had stretched to buy a $33,750 fixer-upper, and in it she found the glimmerings of a new and even better career: professional homemaker. 
A woman who reads her cookbooks front to back, Ms. Stewart was soon catering dinners for people who did not want it known that they had subcontracted out the cooking, handling huge theme parties and alienating people who helped her along the way. Her husband's success in publishing eventually helped her cut a book deal with Crown Publishing in 1982 for "Entertaining," the first of what became a series of best-selling books that, Mr. Byron says, "launched Martha on her way to becoming America's pre-eminent marketer of daydreams and fantasies for women." But then, Mr. Stewart, too, fell out of favor for stacking firewood the "wrong" way and other transgressions and parted ways with her and her billion-dollar dreams.
LEADERS would expect no less from a well-known queen of mean like Ms. Stewart, whom Mr. Byron describes as being "deeply rehearsed in the politics of abuse." Mr. Byron will not disappoint those who crave even more evidence of her excess. Lacking Ms. Stewart's participation, Mr. Byron had to make do with interviews with her ex-husband, ex-friends and ex-business partners. All that seems missing is the ex-manicurist dispensing tidings with every coat of Jungle Red. 
We learn, for instance, that Ms. Stewart's father ordered his six children never to slice English muffins but always to tear them. That gives us a hint of where Ms. Stewart got her sense of domestic decorum.
Weekend guests to Westport were nearly always expected to pitch in. "A visit to the Stewarts became not much different from volunteering for stoop labor on a farm," Mr. Byron writes.
Once, the author writes, when her husband became ill on a trip to Colombia, so feverish he could not stand up, Ms. Stewart became angry, declared "you're not going to ruin my vacation" and left him at the local hotel while she went sightseeing.
"It would be Martha with an ashtray, Martha examining a poncho, Martha holding some coffee beans," Mr. Byron writes.
Another time, during the mid-1980's, Ms. Stewart received an invitation to join Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis for lunch and then kept her waiting nearly an hour without explanation or apology. One of Mrs. Onassis's biographers later said Mrs. Onassis "made it a point never again to be able to remember Martha Stewart's name," the ultimate snub for a person so famished for fame.
The most jaw-dropping scenes come late in the book. Ms. Stewart, on location with a television crew, was flying over the Alaskan Yukon in a single-engine plane. She casually mentioned to the pilot, Larry Nagy, that she had a pilot's license, and the pilot handed her the controls. Neither Mr. Byron nor his researcher could find any evidence that she had anything of the sort. 
On the larger question of whether Martha Stewart is some kind of walking, talking Potemkin village, Mr. Byron clearly thinks not. Other journalists have taken Ms. Stewart's projects and pronouncements to task for being hard to follow and doomed to fail when tried at home, as if she were too busy being Martha Stewart to be expected to get the fine details right on some trivial home economics project. 
Mr. Byron, however, makes a convincing case that the woman has an almost scary command of the homemaking skills she demonstrates through her television show, magazine, books, Web site, newspaper column and appearances. 
A marvelous scene describes her audition for the role of corporate spokeswoman for Kmart in 1987. The company's chief executive at the time, Joseph Antonini, is quite taken by Ms. Stewart's poise, expertise and looks. But he recoils when he sees her broken fingernails and calloused knuckles.
"They weren't the hands of a TV star; they were the hands of a field laborer," Mr. Byron writes. 
Mr. Antonini convinces himself that they mean she works hard, and he instructs his minions to conceal her hands in the advertising.
Later, according to Mr. Byron, Mr. Antonini almost comes to rue his pitchwoman's devotion to the job. Another pitchwoman, Jaclyn Smith, was content to show up, smile for the cameras and cash her checks. Ms. Stewart insisted on being involved in anything bearing her name, down to the thread count of the merchandise. 
Mr. Byron is also more reverential than some about Ms. Stewart's business acumen. It is true that she is street-smart. She grasps the power of promoting herself as a brand and of spinning pretty fantasies for a nation of overworked women.
Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the anecdote Mr. Byron tells about Ms. Stewart's plans for a television show in 1993. Proposed segments showed viewers how to make their own compost -- and gave one television executive cold feet. "Martha, the people in the cities where we have to sell this show are in urban environments," he sputtered. "They're working-class people. These people don't even have gardens."
"Yes, but they want them," she said. 
A LOT of her success is captured in that one insight. But whether she deserves to be called a genius, as Mr. Byron does, much less the "the richest self-made woman in America," is less clear.
Her story still has a way to go. Kmart has filed for bankruptcy and may be in no position to renew her deal. The billion-dollar-plus payday she congratulated herself for making on her 1999 initial public offering is now worth about $600 million. Her 63 percent stake cannot easily be sold without swamping the stock. So the fortune exists mostly on paper -- and in her dreams.
Now, if she figures out how to monetize that, then, yes, she will be more than another American success story. She will be a true financial genius.

HEADLINE: Bush's Welfare Proposal 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush's welfare proposal (editorial, April 8) runs counter to all the rhetoric we've heard about strengthening families. By increasing work requirements without any increase in child care support or transportation, it is unlikely that mothers will have any quality time with their children. 
 The president and Congress should aggressively support equal pay for equal work. This would be the single greatest improvement for the economic well-being of households headed by women. In addition, they should scrap the family formation programs and substitute an educational bonus that would reward states for increasing their high school graduation rates and their G.E.D. achievement rates. 
 The president's proposal continues to focus too narrowly along ideological lines. With a more enlightened view, so much good could be done.

HEADLINE: Cox Empire Seeks Growth (on Its Own Terms) 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
SOME years ago, James Cox Kennedy, the chairman of Cox Enterprises, was flying to Hawaii with his mother and some friends. Unhappy that she was smoking, Mr. Kennedy admonished her to stop. When she paid no heed, he tried leverage. "It's a company plane," he warned.
 "It's my company," Barbara Cox Anthony, now 79, shot back. 
 True enough. Cox Enterprises, which had $8.7 billion in revenue last year, drawn from newspapers, cable, television, radio and an auto auction business, is controlled by trusts set up for Mrs. Anthony and her 82-year-old sister, Anne Cox Chambers. It ranks as one of the nation's largest private media companies, along with Advance Publications, Hearst and Hallmark. The two Cox sisters are each worth $11.3 billion, according to Forbes, and are tied for 11th in the magazine's ranking of the richest Americans. 
But these days, Cox Enterprises, which has been run by family members since its founding in 1898 by James Middleton Cox, who would become the governor of Ohio and a presidential candidate, may be finding it harder to retain its iron-grip control -- if, that is, it wants to grow.
All around it, media companies are acquiring one another, expanding their portfolios of media properties and otherwise combining forces. In the wake of a recent Federal Communications Commission ruling that allows companies to own both television stations and cable systems in the same market, further consolidation is inevitable.
Cox, led by Mr. Kennedy since 1988, has already tried to do a deal, but had it go sour. Last December, Cox Communications, a subsidiary that is 65.5 percent owned by the family and 34.5 percent public, lost a bid for AT&T Broadband, the cable business of AT&T, to the Comcast Corporation.
Although Cox has never disclosed the exact terms of its offer, the company initially appeared willing to reduce its equity stake in the combination to 35 percent.
"I was surprised that they were willing to become minority shareholders in a larger company," recalled Karim Zia, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "The family has always been reluctant to give up control."
But Cox was not changing its stripes, according to a Wall Street executive familiar with the bid. Cox's offer was said to be only slightly lower than Comcast's, but it sought control of the merged company's board. "They had no intention of remaining passive investors," this person said. "That is in part why they lost."
Comcast's $47 billion winning bid gave it 33 percent of the new company. 
In March, there were rumors that Cox might try to merge its cable operations with those of AOL Time Warner, a deal that would have reduced the gap between AOL, No. 2 in the industry, and AT&T, the leader. The talk proved false.
But it is only a matter of time, many analysts believe, before Cox makes another attempt at buying growth -- and bulk.
Under James Cox Kennedy, the company's revenue has increased 14 percent annually, on average, over 10 years. Though Mr. Kennedy keeps a low profile, he is well regarded by investors for bringing in strong managers and giving them free rein. 
During a lengthy interview at his offices at Cox's headquarters here, Mr. Kennedy, 54, dressed in khakis, a sports shirt and a pullover, said the company was indeed eager to expand its cable operations. "We want to get bigger," he said. "Size would reduce our costs for programming and equipment. With those savings, the growth will be faster." But company officials say they feel no pressure to make acquisitions.
MR. KENNEDY is keenly aware that as other cable operators consolidate, economies of scale will reduce their costs and increase their profit margins, and Cox -- No. 5 in terms of subscribers -- has not been able to move up.
But a large-scale acquisition would require Cox to issue stock, which could dilute the family's holdings, or take on more debt, which could hurt its credit rating.
For 2001, Cox Communications -- the cable business -- had cash flow of $1.6 billion, and analysts say its debt-to-cash-flow ratio is about 4. That's not highly leveraged for a cable company; still, a large acquisition would likely saddle Cox with enough debt to reduce its debt rating from triple-B, the lowest investment grade.
Last year, as the economy weakened and Cox's newspapers and TV and radio stations were hurt by the drop in advertising spending, Cox Enterprises, the private parent company, sold 13.5 million shares of Cox Communications, or 2.3 percent of it, raising $500 million to pay down debt.
Several people close to the company say Mr. Kennedy is weighing a move to combine either all or some of the public and private businesses if Cox Communications or its parent decide to pursue more acquisitions.
But a deal may not be in cable. "We would not rule out doing something with TV, but it is not something we are likely to do either," Mr. Kennedy said. "We will do what makes the most sense. When the next growth opportunity comes along to take a big bite, we have all those different options." 
While the cable industry is under a cloud because of its heavy debt and because few cable operators generate profits, Richard A. Bilotti, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, bets that Cox's future growth is likely to be in cable because it is the company's core business and because management likes it.
But the family remains determined to hold on to its diversified media conglomerate, which has always been run by a family member. From its origins as a newspaper company, Cox Enterprises has expanded and owns 17 daily newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 30 weeklies, 15 TV stations and a car auction business, Manheim Auctions. It has an interest in professional women's soccer.
In 1996, after the radio industry was deregulated, Cox Enterprises spun off 28 percent of its radio business to the public as Cox Radio, expressly to use its stock to buy radio stations. That division owns, operates or provides marketing services for 81 stations. It has a market capitalization of $2.97 billion and had $395.3 million in revenue last year.
But the most visible and fastest-growing entity is Cox Communications, of which at least 25 percent has been publicly held since 1995, when Mr. Kennedy spun it off to ease the purchase of Times Mirror's cable systems. Today the unit, which had 2001 pro forma revenue of $4.06 billion, up 14 percent from 2000, has a market capitalization of $21.02 billion and 6.2 million subscribers. Its stock closed on Friday at $34.99, well below the peak of $58.375 reached during trading on Jan. 24, 2000.
"Cox has generally had the highest multiple of the cable operators because of its early entry into telephony and high-speed Internet access," said Dennis H. Leibowitz, who manages Act II, a hedge fund specializing in media companies. "And Wall Street has always had high regard for its management."
But as deals become bigger, Mr. Kennedy may want to combine some of Cox Enterprises' private assets with its public assets, to strengthen the cable company and give it more firepower for deals.
MR. KENNEDY can ponder his options, but he must also consult his mother and his aunt.
The two women, who between them have five children and six grandchildren, have strikingly different lifestyles. They are not particularly close. There has never been a reunion of the entire clan.
Yet the sisters are of a single mind about Cox's future. Both are extremely private and rarely give interviews, but in a recent telephone conversation from her home in Hawaii, Mrs. Anthony said, "We have always tried to keep as much of the company private as we could, and we will do that as long as we can."
Mrs. Chambers concurs. "We really prefer to keep it a private company," she said in a telephone interview. "I think like most sisters we were very different. We are close the way siblings are: loving one another and hating one another. But even though we are very different, she and I have always had the same goals and pride in the company. We have never disagreed about how and where the company should go."
Mrs. Chambers is the more cosmopolitan of the pair. She has an elegant Regency-style home in Atlanta, a duplex apartment in Manhattan and a home in Provence in southern France. She was a major fund-raiser for former President Jimmy Carter.
Mrs. Anthony maintains that she is far more interested in the business of Cox Enterprises than is her older sister. She lives in Honolulu but also spends time at her two ranches in Australia. She is an accomplished horsewoman and breeds cattle, but wherever she is, she talks to her son "about four times a week," she said -- "mostly about business." 
Mrs. Anthony recalls a close relationship with her father that fostered her interest in business, which for the family's empire began with the purchase of a newspaper in Dayton, Ohio, still owned by Cox and now called The Dayton Daily News. 
"One time in Dayton, I overheard a whole conversation and it was about buying The Atlanta Journal," she recalled. "I told the wife of someone who worked for us and she told my father and he gave me hell."
But she did not push her only son (or her daughter, Blair, who lives in Australia) toward business.
During his childhood in Honolulu, "Jimmy worked at a surplus store and then in construction," Mrs. Anthony recalled. "After college, he raced motorcycles for a while." He did not show much interest in Cox. "I told him: 'You should go to the company for a year, just to learn it. You should because you own it.' "
So, in 1972, after graduating from the University of Denver, James Cox Kennedy, then 24, joined the family business, starting in production at the Atlanta papers. By 1979, he became president of the Grand Junction Newspapers division of Cox in Colorado and was soon publisher of The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. In 1985, he transferred back to Atlanta as vice president of Cox Newspapers. Three years later, after moving to Cox Enterprises as executive vice president, he was named chairman and chief executive.
In his early days at Cox, he was the object of quiet ridicule from employees who thought that he was more interested in trapping pigeons on the Cox building's roof than in working. He said he trapped pigeons once.
Over time, he has won the respect of the family and public shareholders, although he acknowledges that in the beginning, he was "absolutely terrified" that he would not succeed. He began to feel some confidence that he could master the corporate world in 1990, when, under his leadership, Cox's car auction business beat back competition from a start-up, General Electric Capital Auto Retail Services, owned by GE Capital and Ford Motor Credit.
Mr. Kennedy is particularly proud of his bet on cable. When he took over, some advisers thought that Cox should sell its cable systems and cash in, but he thought differently. "I felt close to cable," he said. "I believed in it." He also decided to make a heavy bet on telephone services.
Cox Communications has offered phone service since 1997, and 14 percent of its cable subscribers have signed up. "Cox has enjoyed solid, impressive low-double-digit cable cash flow growth," said Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch.
The reputation of the company's flagship newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, has receded somewhat in recent years, though it remains the voice of its region. During the 1950's and 1960's, Ralph McGill and Eugene Patterson won Pulitzer Prizes as editors at what was then The Atlanta Constitution and were leading white voices of moderation in race relations. Then its stature declined.
In 1986, Garner Anthony tried to bring it back. Mr. Anthony, then chief executive of Cox, and Charles Glover, who headed the newspaper division, hired Bill Kovach, a former Washington editor for The New York Times, "to create the world's next great newspaper," Mr. Kovach recalled in a phone interview.
Two years later, "they cut the budget, killed the Sunday magazine and cut the newsroom staff," said Mr. Kovach, who resigned. He is now chairman of the Committee of Concerned Journalists, which is financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Mr. Kennedy said Mr. Kovach "was editing for outside constituencies."
"I only care how the papers are viewed in Atlanta," he added. "I am proud of the paper. I don't care what people in New York or Chicago think about it." Mr. Kovach said his Pulitzer entries in his last year were for local coverage.
TODAY, other businesses within Cox dwarf the newspaper holdings. Indeed, the privately held auto auction business, with $2.26 billion in revenue last year, is the company's second-largest operation, after cable. Its revenue is nearly twice as high as the $1.35 billion of the newspaper unit. Cox Television posted $617 million in sales, while the radio unit had $395 million.
Within Cox, in fact, it is widely accepted that should anything happen to Mr. Kennedy, "either Dennis or Jim Robbins would take over," Mrs. Chambers said, referring to Dennis Berry, the president and chief operating officer of Cox Enterprises, and James O. Robbins, the chairman of Cox Communications. Mr. Berry, who has run the newspaper division, received the nod to leadership at Cox in part because he had helped the auto business more than triple its revenue over six years.
Beyond those succession plans, there are family members who may one day take over.
Mrs. Chambers' grandson, Alex Taylor, who is 27, is a reporter at The Austin American-Statesman, a Cox paper in Texas. "I am very pleased that he wanted to go into the business," she said. Mr. Kennedy, who has two sons, James and Clay, and a daughter, Barbara, hopes family members will join the company.
During the interview, he pointed to a small papier-mache statue of a man carrying a briefcase on his bookshelf. Beside it is a framed letter written by one of his sons, then 10, in 1992. "When I grow up, I want to do what my Dad does," it says. "He is the boss of a company. I look up to my Dad. I want to be like him."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
With an industry convention drawing near, agencies try to accentuate the positive.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IN April 1993, the American Association of Advertising Agencies held its annual meeting at an exclusive Southern California resort hotel as the industry struggled to recover from a recession. Because of the sluggish economy and the reluctance of East Coast executives to cross the country, the conference was sparely attended and participants were too gloomy even to gather for after-dinner drinks in the lobby.
 This week, the association returns to Southern California -- to the same luxurious hotel, no less -- as the industry struggles to emerge from an even worse downturn. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the 84th annual meeting, formally known as the 2002 Management Conference, will carry the upbeat theme "Looking Forward." 
 "No one wants to look backward," said Ken Kaess, president and chief executive at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, who is the 2001-2002 vice chairman of the association.
"We are seeing some signs of economic recovery," he added, "though it hasn't hit our business as much yet as it has the stock market."
Still, Mr. Kaess, who is to be elected during the meeting as the 2002-2003 chairman of the association, said he was striving to be positive.
"We can either go 'Woe is me' or say the glass is three-quarters full instead of three-quarters empty," Mr. Kaess said.
"Nizan Guanaes, a partner at our DM9 DDB agency in Brazil, has this great expression, 'When it's raining, sell umbrellas,' " he added. "There's an opportunity to show clients there is value in expanding their relationships with us."
One reminder of the economy is the registration for the conference, which begins on Wednesday afternoon at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel in Dana Point, Calif., and continues through Saturday. So far the registration is among the lowest ever for the conference.
Attendance is likely to be "a little over 300," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the association, known as the Four A's. By comparison, about 320 people attended the conference last year in Naples, Fla., he added, and about 450 went to Southampton, Bermuda, for the 2000 conference.
"Actually, the turnout is going to be better than I had anticipated," Mr. Drake said, "given that we're going out West," where attendance tends to dip compared with meetings held closer to the East Coast headquarters of the larger agencies.
"Everyone wants to go out to California in a good mood and say, 'Things are getting better,' " Mr. Drake said, "so they're looking for signs of a recovery."
"Frankly, I don't think anyone is seeing that yet, because there is not a real pickup in ad spending or new business," he added. "But it's not getting any worse, either, so I think it has bottomed out."
In a speech he is to make on Thursday morning, Mr. Drake said he would "gear my remarks to the future, what we need to be doing, announcing several big projects to be launched in the coming year."
Among them, he said, will be an effort to improve training for agency employees by using the Internet, which is appropriate for the association to take on because the budgets for such initiatives at the member agencies "get clobbered" in hard times.
Another executive who is to speak on Thursday, Brendan Ryan, the 2001-2002 chairman of the Four A's, said he would also gladly embrace the theme of the conference.
"We certainly had a challenging year, to put it mildly," Mr. Ryan said, "but I'm not going to be getting up and whining." The reference was to the loss of big clients like PepsiCo at his agency, Foote, Cone & Belding in New York, where he is the chief executive. The accounts left because of conflicts created after the Foote, Cone parent, True North Communications, was acquired by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"The packaged-goods companies, the Krafts and Nabiscos of the world, are doing pretty well and should sustain good ad-spending levels this year," Mr. Ryan said.
"But it's time for us to take a step back, take a deep breath and think about how to raise our profiles as people to be trusted and valued by clients," he added.
"As an industry, I think we have some problems, and some of them are self-induced," Mr. Ryan said. "Sometimes, when people feel their pants are on fire, it's the guy next to you setting them on fire."
The intensified competitiveness among agencies for accounts and the fact there is "less collegiality than there used to be," he added, help make it difficult to demonstrate to more marketers "the value of advertising" and why they should increase their ad budgets -- or at least not cut them.
"It's still a great business, and it's still a great way to make a living," Mr. Ryan said. "Let's get back to being more joyful. It's corny, but it needs to be said."
As corny, to rewrite Oscar Hammerstein II, as California in April.

HEADLINE: Political Battle Looming Over Superfund Plan 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14 

 BODY:
Drawing sharp battle lines with the White House, Democratic leaders of the Senate are moving to force a showdown vote on a measure that would provide billions of dollars to clean up toxic waste sites through the federal Superfund program.
 The measure would reinstate an industry tax that was a main source of money for the program until 1995, when the tax expired. The White House and Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to reinstate it, even though a trust fund established to pay for the Superfund program has been running out of money. 
 A spokeswoman for Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the Senate majority leader, said he intended to schedule a vote on the measure very soon. 
Democrats, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, say they hope to force Republican lawmakers to break ranks with the White House and support their plan for financing the program.
Short of that, Democrats see an opportunity to score points politically by forcing Republicans into the position of voting against an environmental program that they argue has broad support among Americans.
The Superfund battle is just the latest example of how the two parties are trying to draw distinctions between each other in an election year on issues like the federal budget, oil drilling in Alaska and the appointment of federal judges.
"These toxic waste sites aren't only in states with Democratic senators," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, who sponsored the Superfund measure. "I think Republicans are going to be in a very difficult position. They are going to have to take a stand."
Some Republicans say they welcome the fight, arguing that the solution Democrats are proposing -- a tax increase -- is politically foolhardy in an election year.
An aide to Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said the tax increase Mr. Torricelli and his supporters were seeking might damage the economy just when it was beginning to pull out of a slump.
"That's not going to be good for jobs in New Jersey or anywhere else in the country," the aide, Brook A. Simmons, said. "I would be shocked if there aren't some members of Mr. Torricelli's own party who aren't asking the same tough questions."
Even supporters of the measure acknowledge that their tactic has its drawbacks, since some conservative and moderate Democrats may indeed be wary of voting for a tax increase, even to pay for Superfund.
At least one influential Democrat, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, has privately told colleagues that he will not support the Torricelli measure when it comes to the floor, according to Senate aides involved in the issue.
The maneuvering in the Senate comes as the trust fund that pays for the Superfund program runs out of money. On Sept. 30, the trust fund had $860 million. But the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that it will have only $28 million by Sept. 30, 2003.
The trust fund's main source of money had been a series of special taxes imposed on chemical and oil companies and other businesses. But those taxes, which brought in about $1 billion a year, expired in 1995.
President Bill Clinton sought to reauthorize the taxes, but the Republican-led House balked under pressure from industry representatives.
Since it was established in 1980, the trust fund has cleaned up toxic waste found in so-called orphan sites, in which the polluter either cannot be identified or has refused to pay.
The trust fund has cleaned up about 30 percent of the 1,500 sites on the Environmental Protection Agency's national priority list, while corporations have paid to clean up the other 70 percent.
Most companies have preferred to pay for the cleanups themselves. The government is allowed to charge them three times the cost -- not to mention penalties -- if it has to undertake the cleanup itself.
At the heart of the current battle is the Bush administration's refusal to seek reauthorization of the business taxes. Democrats say that since the taxes expired, taxpayers have had to pay for an increasing share of the Superfund program. In 1994, taxpayers paid $250 million for Superfund cleanups, or about 21 percent of the $1.2 billion fund, and corporate taxes provided $950 million, or about 79 percent.
By 1999, the share paid by taxpayers had climbed to $350 million. The Bush administration has proposed that taxpayers pay $700 million, or more than 50 percent of the $1.3 billion fund, in 2003.
The plan Mr. Torricelli is proposing would resurrect the business taxes, with one major change. It would maintain the tax on oil and chemical companies, on the premise that they are the biggest polluters, but reduce the tax on other types of businesses.
Mr. Torricelli and his allies say that change might make the plan palatable to moderate Republicans. The taxes are expected to raise $1.5 billion a year for the Superfund program, Mr. Torricelli's office said.
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said the Torricelli plan was in keeping with the premise under which Superfund was created two decades ago: "The polluter pays." 
"It's hard to explain why you would want the general taxpaying public to subsidize polluters," Mrs. Clinton said.
Democrats hope such appeals carry weight among moderate Republicans in the Northeast, like Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island. They also hope to pick up support from Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, whose state has 94 Superfund sites, the third-highest total in the nation.
There are signs that the issue has placed Republicans in something of a political bind.
Jeff Neal, a spokesman for Mr. Chafee of Rhode Island, said the senator supported "the principle of reinstating the Superfund tax" because he was concerned that the program would otherwise have to be paid for with general taxpayer dollars. But Mr. Neal said Mr. Chafee had not decided whether he would vote in favor of the Torricelli plan.

HEADLINE: 'Baywatch: The Bronx'? City's Allure Draws Foreigners as Lifeguards 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
In less than two months, Kinga Drzewiecka, 21, a sociology student at the University of Warsaw in Poland, expects to be perched atop an extremely high chair at a beach or pool in New York, guarding a splashing, shrieking mass of sopping city dwellers. 
 She is trying, without success, to imagine what it will be like. 
 "So many cultures, so many people, no?" Ms. Drzewiecka (pronounced drez-WICK-ah) said from her home in Warsaw. "Chinatown. The Bronx. Harlem. Negroes -- no, I'm sorry -- blacks, yes? Greenpoint -- where Polish people live, no? Imagine -- Polish people in New York!" 
Prezmek Szaniawski, who studies economics at the University of Warsaw, is also going to be a New York lifeguard this summer. While he is here, he said, he intends to look into some tales about New York from friends who have visited the city. 
"I hear that almost everybody has a gun," he said. "I hear everybody has a big car. I have heard that blacks, Chinese and Italians live together, work together, eat together -- so different from Poland, where everybody is white. I want to check this for myself."
Grzesiek Mazurkowski, a lifeguard and student at the Warsaw University of Physical Education, has more specific plans. He wants to watch a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden. Mr. Mazurkowski knows enough about American basketball to know the season will have ended before he arrives, but he is hoping the Knicks might play an exhibition game at the Garden.
"I'm a big fan of basketball," he said. "I am always on the Internet, checking scores. I want to be a basketball trainer, and the basketball books and texts, they all come from the U.S."
The three Polish students are among the first group of lifeguards from overseas hired by the city to supervise New York's pools and beaches. After two months of recruiting foreign students by contacting the East Coast offices of groups like the British Universities North America Club, a nonprofit group that places foreign students in summer jobs in the United States, the city's Parks Department has received inquiries from hundreds of university students from Eastern Europe, South Africa, Australia and Brazil.
Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe said he had hoped to hire as many as 100 foreign students for lifeguarding jobs this summer, but because recruiting did not start as early as he had hoped, the number may be lower. He said if the project goes well, it will be expanded next year.
The idea of easing the city's chronic shortage of summer lifeguards by looking abroad was broached by Michael R. Bloomberg during his mayoral campaign last year. At the time, some city officials considered it impractical. A former parks commissioner, Betsey Gotbaum, a Democrat who was running for public advocate, called it "outlandish." 
The city has had success recruiting foreign teachers to ease the shortage in the public schools, but critics of the lifeguard plan said that scarce summer jobs should go to New Yorkers. 
But the city has not, within memory, been able to hire the 1,200 qualified lifeguards needed to supervise its 53 pools and 14 miles of beaches. It does not seem to be for lack of trying. The hunt for summer lifeguards starts in September, Mr. Benepe said, when the city sends thousands of fliers and scores of recruiters to high schools, colleges, and community and athletic clubs throughout the New York metropolitan area. (A city residency requirement was dropped years ago.) In a good year, 950 of the 1,200 slots are filled. Last year, 904 were.
"It's terrible," said Richie Scher, who teaches physical education at Bushwick High School and has been a city lifeguard for 44 years. "Nobody knows how to swim on the East Coast, especially in New York City. In the 70's, if a school had a pool, you had to pass a swimming test to graduate. Now pools are empty all year. Cool is basketball and maybe baseball and football. Not swimming."
Each year, the lifeguard shortage forces sections of Rockaway Beach in Queens to be roped off and closed to swimmers, swimming hours to be shortened at most pools, and other pools to be closed for one or two days a week. 
There is not much use in looking to the rest of the country for lifeguards, Mr. Benepe said. The shortage is nationwide. Mr. Scher, who is also a recruiter, said he recently got a call from a municipal official in Florida requesting that surplus New York lifeguard candidates be sent his way. 
Swimming may not be cool in New York, as Mr. Scher said, but elsewhere in the world, it is. Lifeguarding is so prestigious in Australia that guards work for free. In Brazil, New Zealand and, curiously, the wintry countries of Eastern Europe, swimming is taught in schools and is nearly as popular as soccer, Mr. Mazurkowski said.
He said he thought it would be a great adventure, guarding swimmers in "Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, New York places I know from television."
A director of the British Universities North America Club, Jim Buck, called that type of reaction "the 'Baywatch' scenario."
"To be a lifeguard on an American beach for the summer," he said, "it's sexy, let's face it."
"Baywatch," though, was set first in California and later in Hawaii, a far cry from Red Hook or City Island.
"It's all the same to them," Mr. Buck said. "It's all the U.S." 
The three Warsaw students -- among the first group to be hired -- all said their parents were rather uneasy about their summer plans. 
"My mother is really nervous about terrorism," Ms. Drzewiecka said. "And everybody -- when I say I'm going to New York City -- they say: 'Oh my God! Be careful!' But I think about fun, about culture, about visits to places. Not about dangers or terrorists."
Still, ground zero is one place she and the other Polish lifeguards said they wanted to visit. 
"I want to buy some flowers and put them there," Mr. Szaniawski (pronounced zan-ee-AW-ski) said.
Mr. Mazurkowski said the Sept. 11 attacks made him want to see New York even more. 
"I have a lot of feeling about this," he said. "In Poland, I could do nothing. I could only see and hear radio and TV. But I think, to die in a stupid accident like this, it is not so right. I think, I want to do something for these people."
So far, the strongest response has come from Eastern European countries like Russia, Latvia and Yugoslavia. At least 30 students are applying, Mr. Buck said. His and similar nonprofit groups are recruiting from Europe, South America, South Africa and Australia. 
Though all the students must have lifeguard certificates from their own countries, they will also be required to take the city's lifeguard course and pass its test before working. The pay is $10.04 an hour, and rooms at Y.M.C.A.'s are being reserved. The rent is $500. The students will also pay for their travel.
At the very least, Ms. Drzewiecka said, lifeguarding in New York will be vastly superior to waitressing in Spain, her last summer job.
"I think of Central Park -- amazing, no? Such a big city like New York to have parks. People lying on the grass, no? Picnics? In such a big city, that's quite funny to me. And I think about Wall Street -- people smoking, with mobile phones and suitcases. Work, work, work and work.
"New York!" she continued. "I see it on television and read about it in magazines. Is it a great place or a bad place? Dirty or clean? Funny or very sad? It's a new world, America. I don't know anything about it and people are telling me different things. I have to go see it for myself."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: ARAFAT'S COMPOUND; 
Inside a Siege, Signs of Life and Loss

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, April 14 

 BODY:
The one they call "old man" walks the halls of what is left of his once-proud compound here. In the wee hours, Yasir Arafat's followers can hear him prowling past the makeshift quarters where they have been confined by Israeli tanks and snipers for 17 days now, sharing mattresses on the floor.
 "Sometimes he comes down and looks around, and checks the rooms," said Mohamed Masharqa, 42, a journalist who works for a Palestinian daily newspaper, Al Ayam, and has been living in the compound. "He talks to his guys: 'How are you? Don't worry. Take care of yourselves. Stay away from the windows,' he says. 'It's not safe.' We sleep in shifts. I hear his voice sometimes in the morning." 
 The Israeli siege has left Mr. Arafat and a few dozen aides, sympathizers and international peace protesters virtually isolated in a few rooms, often without electricity, water or working plumbing. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit to the compound in a heavily armed and armored motorcade this morning gave outsiders a rare look inside, and it was fairly grim.
"I am down to the last analgesics," said Dr. Zedi Abu Shawish, a surgeon and deputy director of hospitals for the West Bank who said he has been caring for a half dozen wounded Palestinian fighters inside with dwindling supplies left by the Red Cross, performing an amputation below the knee on one man with just local anesthetic. "I need first of all the water. It's the most important here for us, because if I have more diarrhea here, it will be messy."
As Israeli tanks pulled just far enough away to let Secretary Powell's convoy pass, the 14 American journalists traveling with him got only the briefest glimpse inside the compound today, and a sanitized glimpse at that, people staying in the compound said. They said the Israelis had restored water on Saturday just long enough to clean the place up a bit, and flush the toilets, before a tank rumbled over a makeshift supply pipe and left the compound dry again. This morning, the corridors were filled with the sweet smell of disinfectant.
Machine-gun bullet marks pocked the stucco walls outside, at least one of which had a gaping hole in it. A building that Mr. Arafat once used to receive V.I.P.'s stood open to the sky, its rafters bare of red tiles destroyed in a rocket attack, and other walls were charred and streaked with the residue of rocket fire. But a broad courtyard had been cleared of the burned-out cars and rubble that people in the compound said had filled it only days before.
As reporters waited in what had been a small office on the first floor, CNN came beaming live onto a television in the corner, with its correspondent reporting on the visit from a perch back in Jerusalem, and a clutch of Palestinians talked into cellphones that they said suddenly began working the moment Secretary Powell arrived. They minute he left, they said later, the Israeli Army began jamming them again.
The dust was so thick here that the Secretary Powell's bodyguards had to turn on the washers and wipers of their armored Chevrolet Suburbans to see through the polarized, bulletproof windshields. Big loops of concertina wire littered the perimeter of the complex. A radio transmission tower drooped like a gooseneck floor lamp, its guy wires destroyed. A man inside held up a placard with a drawing of a hand making the V-sign for victory, its two upraised fingers adorned with Palestinian flags.
On Israeli orders, the American journalists, held behind a rope and rusting stanchions near the front door, were warned not to photograph Israeli troops positioned in windows of another building not 30 yards away, across an open courtyard, where a couple of stray cats prowled. 
But Israeli soldiers with telephoto lenses trained their sights on Secretary Powell's party, and they pantomimed the motion of clicking a camera shutter when they saw journalists take pictures of posters hung out of windows by a handful of international protesters who had joined Mr. Arafat under siege.
"Occupation is Violence and Terror," read one. "Passivity = Complicity," read another. At one point, a protester, Meta Golan, 30, a therapist born in Tel Aviv who described herself as the only Israeli staying in the compound, crawled out a window with a poster but was forced back inside by State Department security officers wielding submachine guns. The officers had replaced Palestinian guards at the door while Secretary Powell was inside.
Concern about Israeli snipers kept Mr. Arafat himself from even stepping into the doorway of the building, said an aide, Saeb Erekat. "You see the Israeli snipers all around," Mr. Erekat said. "We are not going to take that risk."
But a smaller pool of reporters allowed to see Mr. Arafat briefly inside at the beginning and end of the meeting reported that he looked drawn. Asked after the meeting if there was "hope for peace," Mr. Arafat kept his face fixed in an unrevealing smile.
Mr. Arafat has thrived on presenting himself as an embattled, selfless fighter for his people's national aspirations, and in the view of most Palestinian and many Israeli analysts, the Israeli siege has only enhanced his chosen image. He has been careful not to complain about his own privations, speaking instead about the suffering of Palestinians generally under the Israeli security closures and economic blockade.
Rashid Hilal, 40, who works for Palestinian radio and television and has been living in the compound, said the biggest problems inside were the lack of water and food. Relief organizations have left some supplies, but their access is limited. "Food is a little," he said. "We eat one meal, sometimes just a small cheese and bread, sometimes hummus, one small container of hummus or beans for 10 people."
A senior American official said Mr. Arafat had shared one treat with Secretary Powell: a chocolate cake left two days ago by Norwegian diplomats. Secretary Powell had a bite.
In the days before Mr. Arafat returned to Israel from exile, this compound was the center of the Israeli military administration in Ramallah, and included a jail where Palestinian prisoners were housed. Now, it amounts to Mr. Arafat's own jail.
But in the office where American reporters were held, a bulletin board offered reminders of higher hopes from an earlier time, with a sticker advertising planned celebrations of the new millennium on the West Bank. "Bethlehem 2000," it read. "Follow the Star."

HEADLINE: More Apply To Law School After Shootings On Its Campus 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: GRUNDY, Va., April 14 

 BODY:
Applications to the Appalachian School of Law have increased in the three months since a gunman killed the dean, a professor and a student on campus.
 After the shooting, said Paul Dull, a lawyer in Roanoke, Va., who graduated from the school and leads its alumni association, "one of my biggest fears was that it would have a negative connotation that could essentially ruin a young school." As of April 6, however, the school, in economically depressed central Appalachia, had received 587 applications for admission. At the same time a year ago, 387 people had applied. 
 "We've had applications come from Alaska, from Maine, from all four corners of the continental United States," said Lucius Ellsworth, the school's president. Mr. Ellsworth said the school expected a first-year class of 125 in the fall. That would give it an enrollment of about 300.
Officials say the attention that the shootings on Jan. 16 attracted is one reason for the increase in applications. The attention also publicized the school's mission, to train young lawyers in the Appalachian region.
Some applicants were surprised to learn a law school existed in Grundy, a tiny town in southwestern Virginia, a coal-mining area. They were also surprised to learn that the little law school, which won provisional accreditation last year from the American Bar Association, had attracted faculty members.
Anthony Sutin, a Harvard Law School graduate, left a high-ranking job with the Justice Department to teach law at the school, and he later became dean. He was killed in the Jan. 16 shooting, with Thomas Blackwell, a professor, and Angela Dales, a first-year student. Three other students were wounded.
A former student, Peter Odighizuwa, has been charged with murder in the shootings. The police said Mr. Odighizuwa was angry about flunking out of the school. He is being held without bail, awaiting a hearing on June 20.
School officials say another mission of the school is to improve conditions in the region. The school has drawn many of its students from the mountains of Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky and North Carolina.
The school requires students to spend 25 hours in community service each semester. In turn, community support for the school has grown stronger since the shooting, Mr. Ellsworth said.
After a memorial service at Grundy Baptist Church that followed the shooting, hundreds of people gathered to place flowers at the base of the school's stone sign.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: DIPLOMACY; 
European Union to Discuss How to Pressure Israel to Pull Back

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 14 

 BODY:
The European Union, losing patience with Israel's West Bank offensive, will consider on Monday ways to exert pressure on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to bring it to an end.
 But already officials are saying that the 15 foreign ministers are not likely to take punitive steps at their meeting in Luxembourg, and certainly not the trade sanctions that have been threatened in recent days. 
 Instead, conscious of the European Union's limited influence, they will support Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's peace mission as the only hope for an end to the violence, participants said. 
"I would like to dampen expectations that anything dramatic will come out of the meeting Monday," said one European Union official.
The European Parliament called last week on the union to suspend a six-year-old treaty with Israel under which Israel enjoys preferential trade terms with the bloc, its biggest trading partner.
The European Union's budget commissioner, Michaele Schreyer, said today that she opposed imposing sanctions on Israel, saying such a step would be "a bad signal."
In an interview with Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper, Ms. Schreyer said the union would continue to support the Palestinian Authority, but would do so "without weakening Israel."
"If the E.U. wants to contribute to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, it must react in a balanced manner," she said.
The Parliament's resolution was in some measure a bellwether of European public opinion.
Over 20,000 people demonstrated in Germany on Saturday to protest Israel's two-week offensive in Palestinian areas. Burying the Nazi past, Germans have long given unwavering support to Israel.
But the vote is not binding on governments, and of the member nations, only Belgium has openly suggested suspending the trade pact.
There has been slightly more support for an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council -- which oversees the agreement -- to give Israel a dressing-down over its operation.
But this option -- championed by the European Union's executive arm, the European Commission -- is also unlikely because of concern among Israel's closest European allies that it would jeopardize what little influence the bloc has in Middle East affairs.
"Contacts, pressure and dialogue are important right now," said one diplomat, who called proposals for punitive steps against Israel "unhelpful gesture politics."
Germany last week proposed an international "security presence" to guarantee any peace deal after a cease-fire and an Israeli withdrawal. 
Officials said that if the situation deteriorated, the European Union ministers could consider other steps, including delaying negotiations with Israel on trade in farm products and on plans to bolster Israel's participation in the European Union's scientific research programs.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: DIPLOMACY; 
No Cease-Fire Until Withdrawal, Arafat Tells Powell

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, April 14 

 BODY:
Meeting with a top American official for the first time since Israel declared him irrelevant late last year, Yasir Arafat told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell today that no cease-fire was possible until Israel ended its military operation in the West Bank and withdrew from the cities and towns it had recently occupied.
 The meeting itself was a victory for Mr. Arafat and a disappointment for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who has sought to isolate the Palestinian leader in his office in Ramallah, where Israeli soldiers warily watched Secretary Powell's arrival today from a mere 30 yards away. The visit by Secretary Powell in a heavily armed and armored motorcade gave outsiders a rare look inside the battered compound. Page A10. 
 A senior administration official said tonight that Secretary Powell had delivered a blunt message to Mr. Arafat, summing it up this way: "It's showtime. You're on a dangerous path and you need to make a change." 
"He took it in," the official said of Mr. Arafat. "We'll see."
Tonight Mr. Sharon met with Secretary Powell and proposed an international summit meeting on the Middle East along the lines of the Madrid conference sponsored in 1991 by the first President Bush. But Mr. Sharon insists that Mr. Arafat not take part in any such meeting.
After months of worsening violence, including Palestinian suicide attacks and Israeli reprisal raids, Mr. Sharon has rejected Mr. Arafat as a potential partner for peace and has urged his exile, hoping instead to cultivate a new generation of Palestinian leaders. 
Despite internal divisions over dealing with Mr. Arafat, the Bush administration continues to regard him as the only Palestinian with enough influence to strike a durable deal with Israel.
A senior American official said Secretary Powell was open to the idea of a summit meeting, viewing it as "part of a mix of ideas" that had promise. 
"I don't think it would be Madrid," the official added, suggesting that it would have narrower scope. The Madrid conference brought together all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict for the first time, and it established land-for-peace and self-determination as the bases for a broader settlement.
In his meeting with Mr. Sharon, his second since arriving in Israel on Thursday, Secretary Powell pressed President Bush's request for a full Israeli withdrawal, said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, who called the discussion "very good and thorough."
Mr. Boucher said Secretary Powell "stressed our serious concerns about the humanitarian situation" of the Palestinians, particularly on the West Bank in Jenin. There, in fierce fighting, Israeli forces have leveled parts of the refugee camp, leaving an unknown number of Palestinians dead and causing others to flee. 
Palestinian and American negotiators were to talk again on Monday, partly to discuss an economic reconstruction package for the ruined Palestinian civil administration.
Also on Monday, Secretary Powell plans to make a hastily arranged day trip to Lebanon and Syria to discuss tensions on Israel's northern border, where near-daily rocket and artillery fire from Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, has threatened to provoke a wider war.
After months of backing Mr. Arafat's diplomatic isolation, the Bush administration has altered course as it seeks to build support among Arab states for a possible strike on Iraq, which the administration accuses of developing weapons of mass destruction. Arab nations have told the Bush administration that it is more important to stop the bloodshed here.
Palestinian leaders said they were encouraged by Mr. Arafat's discussion with Secretary Powell today, noting that the Bush administration appeared to be willing now to discuss not merely security matters but substantive political differences between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Sharon has repeatedly refused to address such differences until security is assured, arguing that to do otherwise would be to reward terrorism.
"They believe that the security arrangements cannot stand without a political process, that's what he assured us," Yasir Abed Rabbo, the Palestinian minister of information, said of Secretary Powell. Mr. Abed Rabbo took part in today's meeting.
"The main thing is, we want to know how serious this administration is concerning the immediate withdrawal, which the president himself has asked for," Mr. Abed Rabbo said. "It's clear that Sharon intends to continue the war." He added, "We don't doubt the position of the administration, but we still doubt that there is enough pressure."
Secretary Powell called the three hours of intense talks with Mr. Arafat "useful and constructive" but offered no hint of progress toward a truce to end 18 months of violence.
"We exchanged a variety of ideas and discussed steps on how we can move forward," Secretary Powell said as he emerged from the Ramallah compound, where Mr. Arafat has been trapped since early December. For the last 17 days, he has been held in near isolation, with Israeli forces operating within his hearing.
Both Israeli and Palestinian officials said they expected Secretary Powell to meet again with Mr. Arafat, on Tuesday. But the senior American official said no meeting was set. "The secretary was very careful not to promise any more meetings," he said. "We'll make an assessment later."
Israeli officials continued to play down expectations for Secretary Powell's mission, saying Mr. Arafat was unlikely to agree to a cease-fire while he felt that international sympathy and diplomatic support was swinging toward the Palestinians and away from Israel. "He's in euphoria, so why should he give in to the Americans?" asked one Israeli official.
Though Israeli forces have pulled back from some Palestiniancontrolled villages, Mr. Sharon has rebuffed Mr. Bush's requests for a total withdrawal, calling the military mission essential for Israel's self-defense. 
The fighting continued today, though at a less intense pitch. Israeli forces occupy several major Palestinian cities and towns, including Ramallah, Jenin and Bethlehem. As the siege continued in Bethlehem outside the Church of the Nativity, where 200 gunmen have been holed up for almost two weeks, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian who the army said was armed.
The Bush administration has been seeking an end to the Israeli military operation and a crackdown by Mr. Arafat on Palestinian violence. So far, it has received commitments but little action on either front. Mr. Sharon says the military operation is necessary because Mr. Arafat will not act against Palestinian militants; Mr. Arafat says that he cannot do so while the Israeli operation continues.
Mr. Arafat has said he accepts a cease-fire plan brokered by the United States. 
But after the meeting with Secretary Powell this morning, Palestinian officials repeated that Mr. Arafat would move against violence only after Israel withdraws.
"Absolutely, we are fully committed to our obligations emanating from understandings and agreements here, including security obligations," said a Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat. But, referring to Israeli soldiers surrounding the compound, he added, "I'm sure the secretary saw Chairman Arafat's situation, and I believe that once the Israelis complete their withdrawal, we will, as Palestinians, carry out our obligations."
A senior State Department official said Mr. Arafat had begun the meeting with an hourlong monologue in Arabic, outlining Palestinian concerns about the recent Israeli occupation and raids. 
He focused on the standoff at the Church of the Nativity and the killings by Israeli soldiers in the Jenin refugee camp, which Palestinians have called a massacre. 
Israeli soldiers and top officials say the army took great care and put its own men at great risk in distinguishing between gunmen and civilians.
"The presentation from Chairman Arafat was organized, it was serious, he went through methodically his concerns," the official said. Secretary Powell responded with a 45-minute brief of his own, making the American case "that the bombing had to stop," the official said, adding: "The pattern of bombings is a barrier to moving forward. It makes everything more difficult to move forward."
The meeting with Secretary Powell, first set for Saturday but postponed after a Palestinian suicide bomber killed six people and wounded scores in Jerusalem on Friday, finally happened this morning only after Mr. Arafat issued a broad statement on Saturday condemning attacks on civilians. 
The meeting took place in an air of considerable drama.
Secretary Powell's party traveled from Jerusalem in two heavily armored convoys that passed through streets torn to pieces by tank treads and littered with the burned-out remnants of cars, garbage and other debris.

HEADLINE: States Are Set To Rest Case On Penalties For Microsoft 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
The states pursuing stiff antitrust sanctions against the Microsoft Corporation are preparing to rest their case today, clearing the way for what is expected to be a month of testimony by Microsoft witnesses who will urge a federal judge to apply a lighter touch.
 The coalition of state attorneys general say their proposal will open up competition in emerging technologies that may eventually replace the ubiquitous Windows operating system as the link for consumers to their computing machines. Microsoft and the Justice Department, which have reached a less restrictive settlement, say the states' plan would confuse consumers and bestow unfair advantages on the company's rivals. 
 But for all the predictions about the future from the technology executives, economists and lawyers testifying on both sides of the case, it increasingly appears that the judge's decision may rest on a question about the past. The question is inherently hypothetical: if Microsoft had not violated antitrust laws to maintain its Windows monopoly in the mid-1990's, would consumers have a choice in PC operating systems today? 
Microsoft's expert economist, Kevin Murphy of the University of Chicago, is expected to testify this week that the answer is no. Microsoft has long argued that the company's superior products and the missteps of its competitors, not Microsoft's illegal actions, enabled it to maintain a position of monopoly power.
If there was no measurable damage to competition, Microsoft argues, then legal precedent dictates the court should only narrowly limit the company's future business practices. Even the appeals court ruling, which held the company liable for repeatedly violating antitrust laws, said that it had "causal connection" between Microsoft's illegal conduct and its monopoly position "only through inference."
"The states have acknowledged that this is important, but they've essentially taken a pass on it," said Jim Desler, a Microsoft spokesman. "They didn't meet their burden."
The states acknowledge that their answer to the hypothetical question of operating system competitors can only be "maybe." But they argue that both the original federal district judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, and the appeals court found that the Netscape Navigator Web browser and Sun Microsystem's Java programming language posed genuine threats to Microsoft's monopoly.
Carl Shapiro, the states' expert economist, testified last week that the notion of "network effects," where software programs that first capture a dominant position are difficult to dislodge, indicates that the combination of Navigator and Java would have evolved into a potent competitor to Windows. To limit the restrictions on Microsoft just because that cannot be definitively proved, he said, would fail to undo the damage of the company's illegal acts.
"The initial disruptive influences of the Internet are past, the element of surprise has been lost, and Microsoft has bolstered its Windows monopoly by gaining control over the browser," Mr. Shapiro said in his written testimony. "Restoring competition must mean more than merely enjoining the prior illegal conduct."
Netscape's browser once held about 80 percent of the market. Today Netscape, which is now part of AOL Time Warner, has 7 percent, while Microsoft's Internet Explorer has more than 85 percent.
The states also argue that a dangerous signal is sent if a monopolist can crush nascent technologies without strong penalties that recognize how quickly the technology landscape -- and therefore the context of competition -- changes.
"Microsoft seems to be suggesting you have to be a full-blown platform threat in order to be a technology that deserves protection," said Tom Greene, a lawyer for the states. "If that's true, then as long as they throttle the baby in the basket it's no problem. Certainly it has enormous policy implications for future antitrust cases in this very important industry."
Microsoft plans to move to dismiss the case based on the states' failure to show they were injured by the company's actions. Federal District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington is likely to reserve judgment on the motion until the end of the trial. But Tom Greene, a lawyer for the states, said he expected Microsoft to press the point that without more proof of damage there is no justification for a broad remedy.
The states that are still pursuing the four-year-old antitrust case are California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Utah and West Virginia along with the District of Columbia. Nine other states joined the Justice Department and Microsoft in the proposed settlement.
Throughout the four weeks of testimony by the states' witnesses, Microsoft sought to discredit the states' proposals by suggesting that they were drawn up at the behest of its rivals in emerging markets like hand-held computing and Web services.
Now, the company's witnesses are expected to attack the states' specific proposals. They include allowing computer makers to remove Microsoft programs like the media player and Web browser from Windows, auctioning off the right to develop a version of its popular Office software to run on an alternate operating system and publishing information that would enable rivals to develop programs that work as well with Windows as Microsoft's own programs do.
The question facing Judge Kollar-Kotelly is not just hypothetical.
"This is a perfect example of a new-economy case where the market is continually changing as the case is proceeding," said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former Justice Department official. "It's unlike the old-economy breakup of oil companies or even the AT&T case, where the market moved but phone service was still phone service. You just have to make up case law as you go along."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
A publicity success, the futuristic Segway scooter may be celebrated for its engine.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
DEAN KAMEN'S motorized scooter, conceived as Ginger and christened Segway, has sparked the public imagination like few other inventions in recent memory. A New Yorker cover recently featured Osama bin Laden making a getaway on a Segway. Last week, the television character Niles rode one on "Frasier."
 But recently published patent applications bolster the tantalizing speculation that Mr. Kamen may indeed have something much bigger up his sleeve than the cute scooter, which looks something like a motorized push mower with wheels. 
 Such speculation has been brewing for more than a year now, fueled in part by remarks made by Robert Metcalfe, a buddy of Mr. Kamen's. Dr. Metcalfe is no slouch himself in the invention department; he created, and made a fortune from, the office network technology known as Ethernet.
Dr. Metcalfe has been quoted as saying that the real "It" -- the code name that a journalist, Steve Kemper, used when he sold a book proposal for an insider's account of Kamen's secret new device -- is an invention "bigger than pantyhose," "bigger than the Internet" and "almost as big as cold fusion would have been."
Therefore many people were disappointed when the ostensible unveiling of "It" amounted to no more than Diane Sawyer, of "Good Morning America," tooling around Bryant Park on what appeared to be a glorified scooter. Certainly the Segway seems less of a physics-defying concept than Mr. Kamen's iBot, a stair-climbing wheelchair, which he once used to climb a third of the way up the Eiffel Tower.
The importance of "It," however, may have as much to do with the scooter's future engine as with the scooter itself. Last month, the United States Patent Office published application No. 20020029567 -- with Mr. Kamen named as one of the inventors -- for the manufacturing of a Stirling engine, which can be powered by heat from any fuel and is virtually nonpolluting. Indeed, a profile of Mr. Kamen in the May issue of Vanity Fair says he has produced two small prototypes of such an engine, but offers few details.
Mr. Kamen's wealth and reputation were built on medical patents, but he has patented a wide range of inventions. These include -- somewhat improbably, given that Mr. Kamen, in his early 50's, is a lifelong bachelor -- a cradle that simulates the experience of the womb and a "catemenial container," essentially a disposable version of a 19th-century menstruation receptacle.
At least three Stirling engine patents have already been issued to one of Mr. Kamen's companies, New Power Concepts, which is based in Manchester, N.H. But the interesting thing about the most recent patent application (and it is only an application; the patent hasn't yet been granted), according to several people familiar with Stirling engines, is that it covers the manufacturing of the engine, not just the design.
"This patent was filed by a person who is going into production," said Brent H. Van Arsdell, president of American Stirling, an educational company that sells nonindustrial Stirling engines to physics professors and enthusiasts. "He's fairly confident of his design. This addresses the question of how can we build this economically and faster and reliably after we already have a prototype that costs us millions of dollars."
The Stirling engine is by no means a new concept. Robert Stirling, a minister in Edinburgh, Scotland, applied for a patent in September 1816 for his "economiser." Over the next two centuries many versions of engines inspired by the Stirling design have been built.
Kockums, a Swedish defense contractor, now produces a Stirling engine for submarines. And NASA is said to be developing Stirling engines for space exploration.
But so far no company has successfully produced a mass-market version, although Philips Electronics tried unsuccessfully about three decades ago to introduce a Stirling car engine.
Why would an inexpensive engine potentially be important? Stirling enthusiasts contend that it might easily provide power for people in emerging economies for water purification or even Internet access. In developed countries it might allow people to go off the electrical grid and even wean themselves from a dependency on foreign oil.
A second pending patent application from Mr. Kamen's company, No. 20010032452, suggests that his engine can run on fuels ranging from cow dung to nuclear material and everything in between, including propane, natural gas, methane, butane and petroleum.
A Stirling is essentially an external combustion engine -- as opposed to the familiar internal combustion engines that run everything from automobiles to large factories.
Maureen Toohey, a lawyer for Mr. Kamen, said his company was not yet manufacturing the engines. "We're still in development," she said. But she pointed out that the nonpolluting Stirling engines can be used to power a lot of things other than scooters. "One of the unique things about a Stirling engine is that it's an incredibly versatile platform that one can do many things with," she said.
One of the difficulties in making a Stirling is that its engine cylinder and heat exchangers need to be extremely resistant to high temperatures and thus are usually constructed of the super alloys used in jet engines. These alloys are extremely hard to use in the manufacturing process.
The Kamen engine appears to be not terribly different from other Stirling engines. However, its heat exchanger -- which has projecting "fins" that make it look like a riled porcupine ready to attack -- has been designed so that it can be cast rather than welded, a key efficiency.
"I can design all sorts of beautiful Stirling engines in my mind," said John Brisson, a professor of mechanical engineering at M.I.T. "The nub of the matter is can you build it so that it operates efficiently, and can you build it cheaply?"
Even if Mr. Kamen is able to produce a low-cost Stirling engine, Professor Brisson warns, the hurdles are many for any disruptive technology. "It would be so radically different that mechanics wouldn't know what to do with it," he said. "The infrastructure is totally different.

HEADLINE: Recent Good News for WorldCom May Only Mask Deeper Problems 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Things have been looking a bit brighter for WorldCom Inc. in recent weeks. The company won a major contract from the Pentagon. A federal judge in Mississippi dismissed claims that WorldCom defrauded investors. Even the company's announcement that it needed to cut costs by laying off 3,700 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, was not as drastic as analysts had predicted. 
 Yet investors have continued to flee from WorldCom, the nation's second-largest long-distance phone company and one of the most troubled giants in the hard-hit telecommunications sector. Last week, it briefly joined equipment makers like Lucent and Nortel Networks, whose shares traded in the realm of so-called penny stocks, below $5, before rallying to close on Friday at $5.01. 
 WorldCom is still in stronger financial shape than Qwest, another big communications company that, like WorldCom, is being investigated by federal regulators for accounting practices that may have violated securities laws. What Wall Street fears is that WorldCom's problems may run deeper than Qwest's -- and that the company's management, led by Bernard J. Ebbers, is ill equipped to deal with them. 
Critics say that Mr. Ebbers has failed to create a solid foundation for sustained growth from the broad portfolio of phone and data services he accumulated through a long string of acquisitions that culminated in the $37 billion stock deal for MCI Communications in 1998. And questions about WorldCom's accounting, as well as its $30 billion in debt, make it an unattractive merger partner for other large communications companies.
"They may have the best collection of assets out there among the major long-distance companies, but they also have the worst liabilities," said Scott C. Clelland, an analyst at the Precursor Group in Washington. 
Mr. Ebbers, now 60, was one of hundreds of entrepreneurs who plunged into the long-distance phone business in the mid-80's when the court-ordered breakup of AT&T gave them the chance to lease and resell chunks of long-distance capacity at deep discounts. Mr. Ebbers, who had run a small motel chain before entering the phone business, was quicker than most to realize that consolidating the many start-up phone companies could be highly profitable.
By the time WorldCom became a communications giant with the takeover of MCI in the fall of 1998, Mr. Ebbers had completed more than 60 acquisitions. He and a small team of loyal executives led by Scott D. Sullivan, the chief financial officer, were masters at cost cutting and aggressive accounting, which produced profits that dazzled Wall Street. WorldCom's stock climbed to a peak of more than $60 in March 1999. 
Through it all, Mr. Ebbers ran the company from a modest headquarters in tiny Clinton, Miss. He became known for gestures like taking visiting WorldCom executives to the company cafeteria and leaving it to them to pay for their lunch.
Former executives say the deal-making outstripped WorldCom's management skills. 
"WorldCom grew too fast," said Lance B. Boxer, who was chief information officer of MCI at the time of the takeover and one of the many senior executives who quickly left. "They didn't have the experience of operating at that scale."
Mr. Ebbers and other senior WorldCom officials declined to be interviewed for this article. 
Mr. Ebbers has his vigorous defenders. "I always saw Bernie grow into the role with each acquisition," said Steven Dobel, a former senior sales executive. 
When Mr. Dobel joined the company in 1992, it was called LDDS Communications and had $800 million in revenue and operating income of $118 million from reselling long-distance capacity. In 2000, the year Mr. Dobel retired, WorldCom reached its peak operating income of $8.15 billion and record revenue of $39.09 billion. It owned or controlled extensive long-distance, local and Internet networks in this country and overseas, as well as the SkyTel paging network and a variety of communications and data management products it sold to large customers. 
Mr. Ebbers's growth strategy hit a wall that same year when regulators rejected WorldCom's plans to grow even bigger and become a major force in wireless communications by acquiring Sprint in a stock swap valued at $130 billion. WorldCom was forced to stop changing shape long enough for investors to take a closer look at what Mr. Ebbers and Mr. Sullivan had built. The scrutiny occurred in the cold light of a slowing economy and increasing competition. With brief interruptions, WorldCom's stock price has been tumbling ever since.
No investor has been hit harder than Mr. Ebbers. Unlike Gary Winnick, the architect of the bankrupt Global Crossing, Mr. Ebbers did not profit from selling shares in his company before their price declined. In fact, he borrowed money to keep accumulating shares as his stock options matured. 
But any halo he might have earned by remaining faithful to the stock has been tarnished by the extraordinary steps WorldCom's board has taken to help him do so. The board has given Mr. Ebbers loans and loan guarantees that, as of February, were valued at nearly $375 million, arguing that forced sales of his holdings would harm all shareholders.
Mr. Ebbers has said he will repay loans by selling other assets, but he has never identified other sources of wealth large enough to cover his obligations. The loans have led to shareholder lawsuits and fueled longstanding doubts about whether the board is independent enough to function effectively. Restive institutional shareholders like the California Public Employees' Retirement System say they plan to vote against the board members on the compensation committee at the annual meeting on May 23. 
Mr. Ebbers jokingly acknowledged the board's unflinching loyalty in an interview last year with Fortune magazine, where he was quoted as saying, "I've often told my board I may have to fire myself for the sake of my stock." Now, according to Kenneth McGee, a vice president at Gartner, an information technology research firm, "there are 375 million reasons the board won't fire him."
If WorldCom emerges unscathed from the S.E.C. investigation, as the company asserts it will, it still faces widespread doubts about its chances for prosperity. WorldCom's most obvious business burden is its big stake in the land-line long-distance phone market. The company is vulnerable to regional phone giants like Verizon Communications and SBC Communications, which have been allowed by regulators to enter the long-distance business in parts of their home territories. In the meantime, the entire land-line business is shrinking as more callers switch to wireless phones, a sector in which WorldCom has little presence.
Even Jack B. Grubman, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst who has long been one of Mr. Ebbers's biggest boosters, projects no revenue growth in the first half of the year, less than 2 percent for the full year and just 3 percent for 2003. 
Critics of WorldCom acknowledge that market conditions play a major role in the company's troubles. But they argue that WorldCom's predicament is also the legacy of deal making run amok. 
When the deal to acquire MCI closed, Mr. Ebbers told investors, "We will soon be in full stride as one company." In fact, the marriage has been rocky. Much of MCI's senior management left quickly, flush with payouts from stock options. Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's chief executive, stayed on as chairman of the merged WorldCom, though he has little involvement with the company.
"They said they bought MCI to serve as the integrating agent," said Mr. McGee, whose practice includes consulting for many of WorldCom's largest customers. "The promises made were interesting, but didn't have the benefit of being possible." 
At a Merrill Lynch conference last month, Mr. Ebbers detailed recent progress in integrating billing systems and other operations. But many networking experts say WorldCom is still notable for the diversity and incompatibility of its networks and supporting technology.
The MCI integration process stumbled right from the beginning, according to executives involved in it. MCI officials had been working for almost a year on plans to merge with British Telecom when WorldCom arrived on the scene with its surprise bid late in 1997. By contrast, MCI managers heard little from WorldCom beyond matters related to winning shareholder and regulatory approvals.
"Nothing really got done with WorldCom until the closing," Mr. Boxer said. After the closing, in September 1998, most parts of the company continued to operate separately, including previously acquired subsidiaries like UUNet, the nation's leading provider of high-capacity Internet backbone networks. In some cases, the lack of coordination resulted in UUNet and other parts of WorldCom bidding against each other to sell Internet service to big customers, according to testimony in a recent lawsuit in Virginia.
When WorldCom, to cut costs, began managing commissions paid to the MCI's sales force in 1999 using the relatively simple software WorldCom had employed for its own, much smaller operations, the system was unable to handle MCI's national accounts, according to William Marcinko, a former MCI technology manager familiar with the operation. 
The software could not track which national-account representatives were falling short of sales goals, so WorldCom was forced to pay commissions as if everyone were meeting the targets -- even though such success rates are never achieved in the communications world, Mr. Marcinko said.
The impact the integration problems had on WorldCom's reported earnings and revenue appears to be a focus of the S.E.C. investigation, judging from the inquiry letter WorldCom received early in March. The class-action suits recently dismissed in Mississippi cite numerous instances where bungled integration may have contributed to double-billing and other practices that inflated earnings. Plaintiffs' lawyers say they plan to appeal the dismissal.
But whatever the courts and regulators say, WorldCom will still be left with the challenge of functioning as a cohesive company.
"Things have improved at the front end in that there is less conflict among the parts of the company marketing different services," said David Willis, vice president of global networking for the META Group in Stamford, Conn., "but many customers are painfully aware that WorldCom is not running a unified infrastructure. That would take massive investment in systems, but they are cutting back on capital spending."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: TERROR NETWORK; 
Spain Arrests Algerian Man Suspected as Qaeda Aide

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: MADRID, April 14 

 BODY:
Spanish authorities said today that they had arrested an Algerian associated with Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network. He is suspected of raising funds for the 1998 attacks on two American Embassies in Africa and helping finance terrorist sleeper cells in Europe.
 Interior Minister Mariano Rajoy called the arrest a "heavy blow" to Al Qaeda's financial organization. He said computers and documents seized at the home of the suspect, Ahmed Brahim, near Barcelona appeared to detail connections ranging across Europe and into Saudi Arabia. 
 "We have discovered a very important part of Al Qaeda's financial network," Mr. Rajoy told reporters in northern Spain.
The arrest was a result of a lengthy investigation involving Spanish, American, French and German authorities. It came just days after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell signed an agreement with Spain in a visit to Madrid that allows American intelligence agencies to take part in joint investigations of Al Qaeda.
An American official in Madrid said that continuing inquiries across Spain were important in the worldwide attempt to unravel Al Qaeda finances, to understand planning for the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and to foil future attacks.
"Spain is important to the ongoing investigation, and some of the people in custody here may be able to help put the puzzle together," the American official said.
American investigators have been working closely with authorities in Spain, France and Germany since the attacks, trying to unravel the shadowy Qaeda network that grew up in Europe in recent years.
While authorities believe much of the planning for the Sept. 11 attacks occurred in Hamburg, Germany, telephone records, financial transactions and arrests have uncovered loose connections to suspected terrorist cells also operating in France, Italy and Spain.
Though dozens of suspects were rounded up in the first weeks after Sept. 11, none of the cases have yet come to court. The number of arrests has dwindled in recent weeks as investigators struggle to piece together what most describe as a loosely connected network of Islamic militants.
Spain assumed prominence in the investigation in November when a Spanish investigative judge ordered the arrests of eight men suspected of helping to prepare for the Sept. 11 attacks. They are suspected of providing logistical and financial support to the hijackers, including committing crimes to raise money and forging identity documents.
The latest accusations in Spain fit the pattern. The police said that Mr. Brahim, 57, an unemployed Algerian engineer who lived in a Barcelona suburb, played a role in financing the 1998 attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and may have funneled money to Al Qaeda sleeper cells in Europe. The attacks killed 225 people.
Video released by the police showed Mr. Brahim, gray-haired and heavily bearded, being escorted out of his home in handcuffs on Saturday night by police officers whose faces were covered with hoods.
Though his name had not surfaced in public previously, Mr. Brahim's arrest dealt "a heavy blow to the financial apparatus" of Al Qaeda, Mr. Rajoy said. The interior minister described the suspect as "an important member of the network and a collaborator of Osama bin Laden's financial brain."
He was referring to Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a Sudanese who is awaiting trial in the United States for participation in the embassy bombings.
During a nine-hour search of Mr. Brahim's apartment, the police found computer equipment, bank accounts and different business documents, Mr. Rajoy said. 
Hooded agents removed boxes of confiscated material from the apartment. The police said Mr. Brahim's business activities included buying and selling recreational boats, as well as advertising and public relations. He also sent high-tech computer equipment to several countries, including Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Brahim is being held for questioning under antiterrorist legislation and was brought to Madrid today. Mr. Rajoy said the case would be brought to trial "as quickly as possible." The police were also questioning four people holding French nationality documents who were in Mr. Brahim's apartment at the time of his arrest. 
Mr. Brahim's Finnish wife, Pirjo, told reporters that her husband had lived in Spain for 15 years and that he had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. She said his real work was connected to Saudi Arabia and "things sacred to our prophet," a reference on which she did not elaborate.
The Spanish police are now holding 17 men suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda, including the eight detained in Madrid in November accused of direct involvement with the Sept. 11 attacks. In addition, an Algerian and a Moroccan-born Spaniard who reportedly escaped the Madrid operation were detained in January by the police in Barcelona.
The suspected ringleader of the plot, Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, is believed by the Spanish and American authorities to have been a major catch, with connections to the suspected hijackers from the Sept. 11 attacks and other Al Qaeda operatives throughout the world.
A Spanish judge, Baltazar Garzon, said in his report on the case that Mr. Yarkas had contacts with Mohamed Atta, the suspected leader of the hijackers, and three other suspected plotters who shared an apartment with Mr. Atta in Hamburg.
In addition, the judge said Mr. Yarkas traveled to Britain, Europe, Malaysia and elsewhere to meet with Al Qaeda leaders and recruit members for the organization. Spanish investigators also are trying to connect Mr. Yarkas and other members of his group with a visit to Spain last July by Mr. Atta.
It is unclear at this point where Mr. Brahim might fit into the puzzle. His name had not surfaced publicly before his arrest and the evidence behind the accusations against him has not been made public yet.

HEADLINE: Northrop Raises Its Bid for TRW by $758 Million 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
The Northrop Grumman Corporation raised its hostile offer for TRW Inc. by $758 million, to $6.7 billion in stock, last night in a last-ditch effort to pressure TRW to engage in talks.
 TRW, the satellite and missile contractor based in Cleveland, has twice spurned offers from Northrop, the big military contractor based in Los Angeles. Northrop first approached TRW in February with a friendly bid of $5.9 billion, but that offer turned hostile in March after TRW's board rejected the deal. 
 In two weeks, TRW's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the sweetened bid.
TRW, meanwhile, is continuing with its plan to spin off its automotive unit to increase TRW's value without having to be bought by Northrop. Northrop had similarly planned to spin off the automotive unit if it took control of the company.
The latest offer from Northrop -- $53 a share compared with $47 -- may compel TRW's board to come to the table. The offer represents a 13 percent premium over its original bid, but only a 2 percent premium over TRW's closing stock price on Friday of $51.97.
"We strongly encourage TRW shareholders to send a strong message to their board of directors in favor of inviting us to conduct due diligence," said Kent Kresa, Northrop Grumman's chairman and chief executive.
"If the TRW board continues to deny us access, this offer will not proceed," he added.
Mr. Kresa defended Northrop's decision to raise its offer after refusing to do so before by saying that the new bid reflected "improving economic conditions which drive TRW's end markets and continuing positive developments in the defense industry."
Northrop has been aggressively lobbying institutional investors in recent weeks to overturn TRW's defense measures. In particular, Northrop has met recently with Institutional Shareholder Services, the influential advisory firm that most recently played a role in Hewlett-Packard's bid for Compaq Computer by telling clients to vote in favor of a merger.
Institutional Shareholder Services is expected to make its recommendation on Wednesday.
TRW officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
Analysts and industry executives have said that Northrop, like its rivals Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is preparing for a time when more taxpayers' dollars are expected to be sent to military contractors in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.
The military industry contracted in the 1990's, laying off thousands of workers and closing factories, particularly in Southern California, which was once the center of the industry but is no longer, as many companies have moved away.

HEADLINE: UPRISING IN VENEZUELA: ECONOMICS; 
Nervous Markets Fear Surge in the Price of Oil

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices are expected to surge when trading begins today after the weekend lull, as oil markets confront the possibility of continuing political instability in Venezuela after the whiplash turn of events that brought President Hugo Chavez back to power.
 Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of imported crude oil and oil products to the United States, and the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, producing about 2.5 million barrels a day. Venezuelan supplies meet about 7 percent of United States needs. 
 After Mr. Chavez was ousted on Thursday evening, crude oil prices plummeted by 6 percent on Friday, to $23.47 a barrel, the steepest decline in five months, on the expectation that Venezuelan exports would return to normal. 
The Venezuelan industry had nearly ground to a halt after workers at the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, staged work stoppages and slowdowns, culminating in nationwide strikes and violent confrontations that hastened Mr. Chavez's departure.
Venezuelan industry officials said on Friday that they expected exports to return to normal early this week. 
With Mr. Chavez now back in the presidency, though, at least for the time being, questions about further strikes and disruptions loom. Any certainty about normalizing exports has been wiped away. 
"The question is whether the workers are willing to go back, with him back in office," said Thomas P. Bentz, senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. "Are operations coming back? I think we would retrace the losses in the market on Friday, and then some."
Oil analysts estimate that prices could bounce up by $1.50 to $3 a barrel. Such a jump could prove damaging to the nascent economic recovery in the United States if prices remain high over the coming months, which is far from certain.
The drop in prices last week was also stoked by comments from some oil officials who indicated that Venezuela would eventually abandon Mr. Chavez's policy of adhering to production quotas set for the country by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which it is a member. Over the last several years, Mr. Chavez's alignment with OPEC helped to reduce global supplies and to bolster prices.
The interim leadership late last week indicated that Venezuela would produce more oil and try to grab a greater market share, which sent prices tumbling. Now that appears unlikely as long as Mr. Chavez is in power.
For years, critics of Mr. Chavez had complained that he was ruining one of the world's best-run state oil companies by larding it with cronies, including some appointed to the board; hobbling its autonomy; and channeling away more money to the government budget, leaving little for the upkeep of the company itself.
Upon returning to office on Sunday, he moved quickly to show opponents at the oil company that he sought reconciliation by dismissing the board. 
"We have to see if Chavez gets it, if in a month he doesn't sack the board of directors again," said Judith Evans, president of JE Analytica, a New York consulting firm specializing in Latin America. "The thing is, Chavez's psychology has always been the wild card in the poker game of Venezuela."

HEADLINE: Senator Running on Family Values Has a Tough Race After Divorce 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 13 

 BODY:
Senator Tim Hutchinson has a problem.
 In 1996 when he first ran for the Senate, he styled himself as a conservative, family-values Republican, an ideological approach intended to appeal to this state's many Christian-right voters. The breakdown of the American family, he said, was a critical national issue. 
 Mr. Hutchinson won fairly comfortably, with 53 percent of the vote, the first Republican since Reconstruction to capture a Senate seat in heavily Democratic Arkansas. 
Now Mr. Hutchinson, a Southern Baptist minister, is seeking a second term, running against a popular Democrat, State Attorney General Mark Pryor.
Again, Mr. Hutchinson is identifying himself as a conservative, family-values Republican. The problem is that in 1999 Mr. Hutchinson, now 52, divorced his wife of 29 years, Donna, with whom he had three sons, and shortly afterward married a former member of his office staff, Randi Fredholm, now 39.
Many of Mr. Hutchinson's most committed supporters, the core of any strong campaign, were disturbed by his divorce and remarriage. 
His poll numbers have slipped as the issue has been raised anew during this election year, though he has publicly apologized to his supporters, telling them that he remains a totally committed family-values man who has been "humbled" and "left less smug about the shortcomings of others" by the breakup of his marriage.
At the same time, Mr. Pryor, 39, the son of former Senator David Pryor, one of Arkansas's most beloved Democratic icons, has seen his poll numbers improve, and the race is essentially too close to call.
As a result, it has become one of the half-dozen most closely watched races in this year's struggle for control of the Senate.
The Cook Political Report, a widely read nonpartisan publication that tracks Congressional elections, labels the race "very competitive." Another closely followed elections publication, The Rothenberg Political Report, also nonpartisan, calls it a tossup.
But Mr. Hutchinson is also facing an opponent in the Republican primary on May 21. He is State Representative Jim Bob Duggar, another conservative Southern Baptist. Mr. Duggar says he was "called by God" to run against Mr. Hutchinson.
Mr. Duggar, 36, the father of 13 children ("14, really, since my wife is pregnant and life begins at conception"), is not regarded as a serious threat to Mr. Hutchinson's renomination. But he is something of an embarrassment, given that very few other senators up for re-election this year have primary challengers. Further, Republicans who abandon Mr. Hutchinson for Mr. Duggar in May may not return to him in November, if they go to the polls at all.
At a Duggar rally a few nights ago, Rod Castle, an advertising sales representative who said he voted for Mr. Hutchinson in 1996, said he would vote for Mr. Duggar this year.
"Tim's lost my support," Mr. Castle said. "For a man to leave his wife and marry a staff member, there has to be underlying things in his character."
Senator Hutchinson was a vocal critic of his fellow Arkansan, President Bill Clinton, in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and, with his brother, Asa, then a Republican member of the House, strongly supported impeachment. When Mr. Hutchinson's divorce and relationship with Ms. Fredholm became news, Democrats called him a hypocrite, though he said his personal situation did not resemble Mr. Clinton's.
Both national parties have become involved in the Arkansas contest. President Bush and Vice President Cheney have held fund-raisers for Mr. Hutchinson. Top Democrats in Washington have promised Mr. Pryor money and workers.
Mr. Pryor and Mr. Hutchinson expect to spend as much as $10 million each by Election Day.
Mr. Pryor is a moderate. He opposes privatizing Social Security, is against new tax breaks for big corporations unless small businesses also get them and would not make abortion a litmus test for judicial appointments.
He contends that Mr. Hutchinson, who strongly supports most of the Bush administration's agenda, especially its opposition to abortion, is "way too conservative for Arkansas," a state that is geographically in the South but has a populist-progressive streak. When he speaks of Mr. Hutchinson's marital problems, Mr. Pryor says: "They are what they are. Let the voters decide."
Mr. Pryor and his wife, Jill, have two children. The Pryors' 10-year-old marriage is the first for each.
Mr. Hutchinson contends that Mr. Pryor is "out of Arkansas's political mainstream" and does not have the experience or stature to represent the state when the nation is "in a war with global terrorism and just beginning to recover from economic hard times."
Some top State Republican Party officials argue that "the only thing Mark Pryor has going is David Pryor." In fact, Mr. Pryor's campaign advertising includes plenty of images of his father. 
Since Mr. Pryor entered the race, he has seldom trailed Mr. Hutchinson by more than a few points in the polls and has been a couple of points ahead a few times. Still, analysts say the race is far from over.
"Ultimately, Hutchinson probably has a bit of an edge in this contest," said Art English, a political scientist at the Little Rock campus of the University of Arkansas. "But he also has that serious divorce problem. So a win is by no means out of reach for Pryor."

HEADLINE: UPRISING IN VENEZUELA: LATIN AMERICA; 
Fear of Loss Of Democracy Led Neighbors To Aid Return

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, April 14 

 BODY:
Venezuela's neighbors helped pave the way for Hugo Chavez's stunning return to power early today by refusing to accept the legitimacy of the coup that overthrew him and by threatening to impose sanctions, Latin American diplomats say. The efforts opened a breach between the United States and its democratic allies in the Western Hemisphere.
 Until this week, the United States had adopted a policy of restraint, apparently content to let Mr. Chavez collapse under his growing unpopularity. There were no obvious American fingerprints on the plot that unseated Mr. Chavez, unlike coups in Guatemala in 1954 or in Chile in 1973. But Latin American countries are now left with the impression that the Bush administration is selective in its support for democracy. 
 Mr. Chavez's supporters, on the other hand, took heart from an outpouring of criticism by other Latin American governments over the way he was deposed. The initial alarm around the region grew after the military-backed interim president, Pedro Carmona, dissolved Congress and talked of holding presidential elections only after a year had passed -- measures that appeared to contravene the existing Constitution.
"I have been and am a critic of many of the characteristics of the government of Hugo Chavez," said President Alejandro Toledo of Peru. But he added that "we are not defending the democratic characteristics of a particular government, we are defending the principle of the rule of law."
The United States refused to characterize the initial ouster of Mr. Chavez as a coup at all, arguing that he had brought his downfall upon himself. "The government suppressed what was a peaceful demonstration of the people," which "led very quickly to a combustible situation in which Chavez resigned," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said on Friday, before Mr. Chavez staged his comeback. 
Meeting in Washington this weekend, the Organization of American States approved a resolution condemning "the alteration of the constitutional order" in Venezuela and invoked a new "Democratic Charter" approved last fall. That measure is one of several recent regional initiatives that create mechanisms, including sanctions, to isolate and punish governments that take power through nondemocratic means.
After lobbying behind the scenes for softer language, the United States also voted for the measure. "It was necessary to act energetically and decisively in defense of democratic principles, with or without the support of the United States or lose credibility," one South American ambassador said today.
As Mr. Toledo's remarks indicate, Mr. Chavez's leftist populism and his tendency toward demagoguery seem to make most of Latin America's elected leaders uncomfortable. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been quoted as calling Mr. Chavez an "unconscious authoritarian," and both Colombia and Peru have persistently complained of his support for forces set on undermining their governments.
But the notion of permitting the armed forces of any Latin American country to resume their past role as ultimate arbiter, able to make and unmake elected presidents at will, is even more unpalatable. 
The strongest statements of condemnation of Mr. Chavez's ouster came from countries like Argentina, Paraguay and Peru, which have long histories of military interventions and dictatorships themselves.
President Eduardo Duhalde of Argentina said on Saturday that it was "not good news for the Americas when military coups once again overthrow governments elected by the people." 
The initial American stance on the recent events in Venezuela stand in marked contrast to the Clinton administration's position when a similar military uprising occurred in Ecuador in January 2000. After soldiers and Indians overthrew a pro-American president, Jamil Mahuad, State Department officials called the new junta and told its members that Ecuador would become a pariah state, deprived of all financial aid, unless power was handed over to the civilian vice president -- and it was. 
In Washington today, the Bush administration sought to backtrack slightly from its position without abandoning its criticisms of Mr. Chavez. On the NBC program "Meet the Press," Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said this was a "time for national reconciliation" in Venezuela and called on Mr. Chavez to "right his own ship."
"I hope," she added, "that Hugo Chavez takes the message that his people sent him, that his own policies are not working for the Venezuelan people, that he's dealing with them in a highhanded fashion."

HEADLINE: Nurse Deficit? Affluent Patients Hire Their Own 

BYLINE:  By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

 BODY:
Mary M. Baker's elderly mother is thinking of having back surgery, and Ms. Baker has already decided that when the time comes, her mother will not be lying in a hospital room all alone. "She's a retired nurse and she never complains," Ms. Baker said. "I'm definitely having someone in there with her."
 This is more than just a doting daughter talking: Ms. Baker is a nurse herself, and president and chief executive of Chicken Soup Plus, a nursing agency in Sacramento. When she hires a private nurse for her mother, she will be joining what she feels is an emerging trend: hospitalized patients employing nurses of their own rather than relying on the hospital nursing staff. 
 Private nurses have been available for hire in hospitals for decades, markers of affluence much like household servants. Now, though, they are working in a different world. Shortages of staff nurses plague hospitals across the country. Even in those that are fully staffed, surveys have repeatedly shown, nurses are taking care of more patients and sicker patients than ever before, with far less time to nurse each patient assigned to them. 
Headlines repeatedly broadcast hospitals' dangers, and patients generally know for themselves just how unpleasant a stay in one can be. Some researchers fear that worried patients and their families may begin to view private nurses less as a luxury than as a prudent and sensible precaution. 
But by hiring private nurses, they say, patients may simply be exchanging one set of problems for another, entrusting their care to nurses unfamiliar with a hospital and its routines and leaving themselves potentially vulnerable to mishap.
There is no centralized data on how many private duty nurses and nurse's aides, sometimes called "sitters," work in hospitals. Further, little consensus can be found among those in the business as to whether their services are increasingly in demand.
Deborah Yanicelli, manager of the Manhattan office of Access Nursing Services, an agency that supplies private nurses to hospitals, often ones known for attracting well-heeled patients, says her volume of requests has increased considerably, up by perhaps 15 percent over the last four months. 
"The reputation is that you're taking a risk in the hospital," she said. "Some people with means just want to make sure everything will be O.K."
In contrast, a representative of the nurse registry at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn., one of the wealthiest communities in the country, noted no increase in demand. Neither did Mark Baiada, president of Bayada Nurses, a large private nursing agency based in New Jersey and serving 11 states.
"That market isn't really growing like crazy," Mr. Baiada said, in contrast to the demand for home care nurses for recently discharged patients, which is soaring. "You're in the hospital for such a short time now that you're discharged before you can blink," he said.
Dr. Lorraine Mion, director of geriatric nursing at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, said the demand for private nurses at her hospital was no different than usual. "Still, it's an interesting question," Dr. Mion said. "You can certainly see it happening someday."
Economic considerations may be blurring the picture: private nurses are expensive. Those who can afford them may frequent affluent hospitals where the perceived need for them is still not great.
No insurance plans cover the cost, and hospitals will finance a private attendant only when a patient is at a high risk of life-threatening harm if left alone: an actively suicidal patient, for instance. Otherwise, the fee for a private nurse, which may run from $20 an hour for a practical nurse or aide to $75 an hour for an experienced registered nurse, must be paid by the patient or family.
The money buys the confidence that a patient will not have to wait for the basics of nursing care, like help with eating or navigation to the bathroom. Bedbound patients will be repositioned frequently to help them avoid developing bedsores, and postsurgery patients will be reminded to do their breathing exercises.
Private nurses supply extra pairs of hands to untangle intravenous lines and arrange pillows; they guard against falls and keep water pitchers full. They can clarify the purpose of new medications and review discharge instructions.
But even when private nurses are highly experienced registered nurses, they generally cannot dispense medication, administer transfusions or chemotherapy, or write notes that become a part of the hospital record. These activities are the legal responsibility of the staff nurses, and hospitals will not allow them to be delegated.
The result is that hospital and private nurses must collaborate in the patient's care -- an arrangement that may or may not work out.
Jane Laffend, a bank trust officer in Philadelphia, spends much of her workday coping with the medical needs of elderly clients. When her elderly aunt was taken to a New York emergency room with abdominal pain last winter, Ms. Laffend hired a private registered nurse for her without thinking twice.
"She was in the E.R. for three days waiting for a bed," Ms. Laffend said, "lying on a gurney with no pillow at first, no blanket, only two nurses for a roomful of critically ill patients. A terrible situation. Having that nurse for her was very beneficial. It meant she didn't have to wait for a bedpan, for anything."
But the bad side, Ms. Laffend said, was that once her aunt was convalescing in a regular ward, she developed no rapport at all with the floor staff nurses, who may ignore and even resent patients who hire outside help.
"The sense you get from them is that if you don't trust me, then all right, so much for you," Ms. Laffend said. "All in all, it was better for her psychologically to have someone there. If it was better over all, I don't know."
Nursing scholars agree that private nurses may smooth over rough spots in hospital care, but at a cost.
Dr. Claire Fagin, an emeritus professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, said: "In general they don't know the setting, they're not that sophisticated, they don't have a relationship with the hospital or the doctors. It's not a good scenario, but it may be better than being on your own."
Dr. Linda Aiken, a nurse who directs the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, said: "Our research suggests that the quality of care provided by nurses who are not part of the hospital staff is not as good. There are so many things they are unfamiliar with: the other members of the hospital staff, the doctors, location of equipment."
The best-known case of private nursing gone seriously awry was that of the pop artist Andy Warhol, who underwent routine gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital in February 1987 at age 58, and died early the next morning.
In 1991 Mr. Warhol's estate brought a wrongful-death lawsuit against the hospital, Mr. Warhol's doctors and the private duty nurse hired to stay with him overnight. 
The estate's lawyers painted a chilling picture of the nurse, reading at the artist's bedside all night, oblivious to the intravenous fluids set to run at far too high a rate that were filling her patient's lungs with fluid, killing him. A staff doctor called the room to ask how Mr. Warhol was doing, according to court testimony, but neither the doctor nor the staff nurses personally checked on him. 
The private nurse, although she had worked as a staff nurse at the hospital for many years before Mr. Warhol's death, was barred from working there again, and her New York license was subsequently revoked. The suit was settled out of court. 
Even when the outcome is not so dire, though, private nurses may not function as a patient's advocate in the way patients and their families may hope.
When Phyllis Barber's 92-year-old mother was hospitalized in Tucson for intestinal bleeding, Ms. Barber, in New York City, hired a nursing aide to stay with her overnight.
"It was a terrible experience," Ms. Barber said. Her mother was awakened in the middle of the night for a blood test, was disoriented from sedation, fought with the staff nurses and ultimately tried to call 911 from her bedside phone. A doctor finally canceled the blood test and calmed everyone down. 
And the aide? "She was just sitting there," Ms. Barber said, not getting involved, not helping at all. "Next time I'll get a private R.N.," she said. "It's very expensive, but it's worth it to have someone who can communicate with the nurses on the staff."
Nurses themselves suggest that in the long run, a patient's interests may be best served not by hiring private nurses, but if at all possible, working out a closer relationship with the hospital staff nurses instead.
When friends or family members ask Dr. Aiken of Penn how best to smooth a hospital stay, her first suggestion is that they research the hospitals and their nursing staffs, she said.
First, they should try to choose hospitals that have been designated "magnet" hospitals by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, a subsidiary of the American Nurses Association, Dr. Aiken said. Nursing services in these hospitals have adequate staffing and are configured to perform at their best, she said, and her research suggests patients fare far better in them than elsewhere.
The magnet program is barely 10 years old, however, and only 47 hospitals have been recognized nationwide. Failing that, Dr. Aiken suggests that prospective patients find out if they will have a primary nurse responsible for their care once they are admitted, then contact that nurse and interview her "just as they would a doctor."
"Hiring a nurse is something one should resort to only after exploring other options," Dr. Aiken said. "If patients and family are explicit about what's needed, staff nurses are pretty wonderful, accommodating people and will try to respond."
Dr. Mion of the Cleveland Clinic said that often there was no substitute for friends and relatives to reassure patients and represent their interests. "Private nurses may be more for the anxious person who needs immediate attention," Dr. Mion said.
For her own friends and family, her major recommendation is that a family member be around as much as possible, especially when an elderly patient is fresh from surgery, or newly transferred from intensive care. "It helps to have a familiar face," she said.

HEADLINE: Canada Is Expected to Increase Rates 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 15 

 BODY:
Breaking from its usual pattern of following the lead of the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates on Tuesday, for the first time in almost two years.
 A move by the bank to tighten credit would reflect a stronger rebound in the Canadian economy since the post-Sept. 11 slowdown than has been seen so far in the United States. While the recovery has created thousands of new jobs, it is also raising concern that inflation, all but indiscernible the last few years, may be springing back to life. 
 Most economists surveyed by major news agencies expect the Canadian central bank to raise its overnight lending rate by one-quarter point, to 2.25 percent. The overnight rate is the Canadian equivalent of the Federal Reserve's federal funds target rate, now at 1.75 percent, which sets the trend for various kinds of rates throughout the banking system. 
Policy makers at the Bank of Canada ordinarily review and set the overnight rate eight times a year; it was last raised in May 2000, and, beginning in January 2001, was reduced steadily from 5.75 to 2 percent. 
The Federal Reserve took no action at its last policy meeting, on March 19, when it said the risks were balanced between its goals of price stability and maintaining economic growth. Most economists do not expect the Fed to change the rate at its next meeting in early May either.
Developments in the United States normally play a driving role in determining Canadian interest rates, because 85 percent of Canada's exports go to the United States and because the American economy is 10 times the size of Canada's. The two economies have been growing even more closely integrated as trade between them has progressively been freed, first by a 1989 bilateral treaty and then by the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.
But the two economies do not always grow at the same speed, and Canada's economy is the more vigorous now. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Canada had 2 percent growth in real gross domestic product, compared with 1.7 percent in the United States, and the signs since then are that Canada has accelerated.
Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at the Bank of Montreal, said the Canadian economy "has probably felt less of a negative impact" from September's terror attacks. "There has been less concern in Canada that we'd have to deal with a terrorist attack here," he said.
According to Statistics Canada, 170,000 jobs were created in the first three months of 2002, and the number of hours worked surged at a 5.2 percent annual rate. By contrast, job growth in the United States has recently been weaker than expected.
The housing market in Canada has also roared ahead in recent months, powered by low mortgage rates and a mild winter. Housing starts in the first quarter were at their highest in almost 12 years.
Edward Carmichael, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Securities Canada in Toronto, estimates that Canada's gross domestic product expanded at a robust 5.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
"A few months ago no one expected a rate hike until late in 2002," Mr. Carmichael wrote in a report last Friday. "With clear signs of recovery in place, the Bank of Canada's focus now needs to turn to an orderly reduction in monetary stimulus over the year ahead."
Inflation is still below the official target of 2 percent, but it has been edging up steadily in recent months. The consumer price index was 1.6 percent higher in March than a year earlier; in December, the comparable figure was 0.7 percent.
Some economists also see higher interest rates as a way to restore a bit of strength, at least temporarily, to the weak Canadian dollar. The currency's value reached a record low of 61.70 United States cents on Jan. 21 and has not rebounded much since; it traded at 63.010 cents this afternoon.
The governor of the Bank of Canada, David Dodge, and the finance minister, Paul Martin, have said the currency's weakness does not accurately reflect the strengths of the Canadian economy, including -- in contrast to the United States -- a healthy trade and payments surplus. "Until now, they have not backed these words with action" to support the currency, Mr. Carmichael said.
Barry Wainstein, head of global foreign exchange and money markets at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said the expected rise in interest rates was already fully reflected in the currency markets.

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN GREGORY 

 BODY:
Most business travelers have heard about the outwardly healthy 28-year-old British woman who collapsed and died shortly after getting off a 20-hour flight from Australia to London two years ago. They also probably know she died of a blood clot that formed in her leg and traveled to her lung -- most likely a result of prolonged sitting in cramped quarters.
 Yet do most air travelers know the best way to avoid her fate is to stretch and walk around the cabin regularly to get the blood pumping? 
 That issue is about to get a very public hearing. In the last year, a flurry of lawsuits has been filed around the world, contending that failure on the part of air carriers to inform passengers adequately about the malady, known as deep vein thrombosis, or colloquially as economy-class syndrome, has resulted in needless injury and death. And last week in Britain, a parliamentary committee called for more research into the possible links between the ailment and air travel. 
Air carriers say they take sufficient precautions to warn passengers about deep vein thrombosis, or D.V.T., which they point out is rare. Even so, many business travelers and their advocates say airlines should do much more to reduce even the minor risk of contracting it.
"I can't think of one airline I've flown that does a good job in this," said Dell Coon, a Virginia investment broker who logs about 150,000 miles a year traveling the globe on business. "First of all, there's no general announcement about it before the flight, and there should be."
Tim Hammond, a lawyer in Melbourne, Australia, whose firm has filed nearly 350 lawsuits against British Airways, Qantas Airways and other carriers since July, says airlines need to do much more. The suits seek damages on behalf of passengers who died or suffered serious injury supposedly as a result of D.V.T. developed aboard flights of up to 20 hours or more.
Nearly 40 similar actions have been filed in New Zealand and Britain, and two others have been brought in federal courts in Alaska and Texas on behalf of business travelers who sustained paralyzing strokes during or after flights to London. Last week, a California woman sued Air France and Continental Airlines in Federal District Court in San Francisco over D.V.T., contending lack of legroom on a flight from Paris to San Francisco led to a near-fatal heart attack. 
The plaintiff in Texas, Shawn Blansett, said he knew nothing of the risks associated with the malady. "They never told us anything," he said in halting speech, a result of his partly removed cerebellum and lingering paralysis throughout his right side.
At issue, legal experts say, is both the technical question of whether an airline can be held liable for instances of D.T.V. aboard its aircraft and the broader question of whether airlines have done enough to minimize risks to passengers.
Airlines declined to discuss the suits against them. Air carriers in general, however, disavow any causal link between D.V.T. and flying, maintaining that prolonged sitting on a bus or train could just as easily cause the disorder. They are also vocal in their insistence that they do more than enough to make passengers aware of the condition, with measures like posting information on their Web sites and offering tips in in-flight magazines or on video programming on minimizing risks.
A British Airways spokeswoman, for example, said cabin crews routinely encouraged passengers to perform simple exercises in their seat to help blood circulation. The airline has also joined forces with a British medical school to query 1,000 frequent fliers on their awareness of the malady.
"I think we've done more than enough to properly inform the traveling public," said Michael Wascom, a spokesman with the Air Transport Association, a trade group in Washington that represents major United States airlines.
Whether the plaintiffs' lawyers have a good case is questionable. Mark Dombroff, an expert in aviation law and managing partner at the Dombroff & Gilmore law firm in Washington, is skeptical. For airlines to be held responsible, he said, lawyers would have to demonstrate that the onset of the disorder while airborne constitutes an "accident" under international law that governs air travel between countries.
In recent years, various studies have looked at whether air travel itself is a significant risk factor in D.V.T. Russell Rayman, executive director for the Aerospace Medical Association in Virginia, said most concluded that prolonged immobility, not the act of flying itself, was the primary contributing factor.
A few studies, however, found possible links to the flying environment itself. "I think everyone agrees it happens on flights," Dr. Rayman said. "The conflict is what causes it." In any case, airborne D.V.T. is rare, given the roughly 1.6 billion people who fly each year. Dr. Rayman estimates the number of victims at well below 1,000 a year, a figure he described as "vanishingly small."
Still, it remains a scary possibility for business travelers. Highly publicized cases, like the death of a 57-year-old British woman from D.V.T.-related pulmonary embolism after a six-hour Miami-to-London flight in February, only stoke their fears. And media accounts of other passengers reportedly stricken by it have multiplied recently.
Regardless of steps airlines are taking, lobbyists for travelers want them to do more. Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition in Radnor, Pa., agrees that fliers should educate themselves, but said cabin crews on flights longer than five hours should address the problem in preflight announcements.
"Is it too much to ask on those flights to point out what the risks and safeguards are?" Mr. Mitchell asked. "The airlines have known about the issue for years, and they have failed to really come straight out and let passengers know."
Mr. Coon, whose business takes him to distant destinations like Turkey and China, thinks airlines should feature a tutorial about the disorder on the TV monitors mounted above airport waiting areas. "If they spent three minutes of the precious time they give to CNN, they would reach about 80 percent of the flying public," he said.
But Gary Kincaid, who annually circles the globe leasing aircraft on behalf of New York-based C-S Aviation Services Inc., thinks such a move is superfluous. Mr. Kincaid says the airlines he flies already offer in-flight exercise videos aimed at reducing the risks of D.V.T. "The videos are there," he said. "And if people don't see them, they're just not paying attention."

PERSON: J. William Stanton 

HEADLINE: J. William Stanton of Ohio, Two-Decade Congressman, 78 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

 BODY:
J. William Stanton, a former Republican congressman from Ohio who went on to focus on development and international banking issues, died on Thursday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 78.
 The cause was complications from pulmonary fibrosis, his family said. Mr. Stanton lived in Madison, Ohio, but regularly spent the winter in Florida. 
 For nearly two decades, ending in 1983, when he retired, Representative Stanton was known for a friendly, relaxed manner that often stood in contrast to acerbic, increasingly partisan debates. He was a Republican in a heavily Democratic region northeast of Cleveland, and once remarked that his grandfather would turn in his grave to learn he had joined the Republican Party.
The son of a banker who ran a Ford dealership, Mr. Stanton began his career selling cars. He entered politics in 1955, as part of a bid to persuade Ford to locate a plant in nearby Mentor. Though that effort failed, Mr. Stanton gained recognition as a Lake County commissioner and became known as a friend of developers.
In 1964, while Democrats were swept into office around the country, Mr. Stanton won a House seat in the 11th District. With ample financial reserves, he won comfortably on a traditional Republican platform, which focused on free market principles and cutting government waste.
It was a theme Mr. Stanton emphasized throughout his career, especially as he rose to prominence as the ranking Republican on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He opposed the 1979 bailout of the Chrysler Corporation, arguing that it would set a bad precedent. He also opposed a $2 billion loan guarantee for New York City. 
He was a darling of business groups but also managed to win relatively high marks from organized labor, an important constituency in his blue-collar district.
In 1980, he stepped into a partisan fight over red-lining, or the practice by which banks denied mortgage loans in poor areas, and pressed through a compromise that temporarily maintained strict disclosure requirements.
Mr. Stanton began a second career after leaving the House. He spent a decade as counselor to the president of the World Bank. In that capacity, he traveled the world, investigating prospects for development projects. That work, he told associates, was the most exciting of his career.
He is survived by his wife of 36 years, Peggy Smeeton Stanton; their daughter, Kelly Marie Fordon; and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Inventories Decline At Businesses, a Hint Of Slow Recovery 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15 

 BODY:
Business inventories fell in February for a 13th month as sales declined, the Commerce Department reported today, suggesting that businesses would be slow to restock until the economic recovery gathers speed.
 "Businesses are clearly paring inventories at a much slower rate, but they aren't done," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Bank in New York. 
 A 0.1 percent drop in the supplies of unsold goods, reflecting declines at wholesalers and manufacturers, matched the decrease in January, the report said. Business sales fell 0.9 percent in February, the biggest drop in three months, after a 0.9 percent rise in January.
The rate of inventory reduction is slowing after a year in which companies reduced inventories by a record $61.7 billion. Manufacturers have already started increasing production as the economy revives.
Stockpiles fell at an annual rate of $27.9 billion in the three months ended in February -- the slowest pace of inventory-cutting since the three months ended in February 2000.
Supplies at manufacturers, which account for about 40 percent of the report, fell 0.4 percent in February after a 0.8 percent decrease the month before. Factory sales dropped 2.8 percent after rising 1.4 percent the previous month.
Wholesale inventories, which make up about one-fourth of all business inventories, fell 0.7 percent for the month after falling 0.5 percent in January. Sales at wholesalers increased 0.8 percent after rising 1.2 percent in January.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: KABUL; 
Brick by Brick, Afghans Recycle and Rebuild City

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, April 15 

 BODY:
With more rubble than just about any other city in the world, the people of this devastated capital are trying to make the best of all their debris. 
 They are recycling it. 
 "There is so much rubble here, why not use it again?" shrugged Wuria Karadaghy, the director of the rubble recycling program for the United Nations. "All these bricks and all these blown-up houses can be used to rebuild the city." 
Under the program, financed with a grant from the Japanese government, more than 1,200 Afghans are fanning out across the ruined metropolis, toppling broken buildings and carting off the remains. Bricks in good condition are providing the raw material to rebuild schools and other buildings. The rocks and dust left over are filling in the city's rutted roads. Even the scrap metal is melted and used again. 
In Kabul's Jada-e-Maiwand neighborhood, where the wreckage seems to stretch without end, the scene recalled an old epic movie: Legions of men, paid $2 a day, strung ropes around a five-story brick wall and pulled with all their strength. The wall swayed and creaked and then came crashing down. 
"Here it comes! Get out of the way!" a man shrieked as he dropped his rope and ran. The rest of the men scattered like ants, and the wall crashed to the earth. A dust cloud covered the scene and then lifted. 
The toppling of so many buildings here stands as a strange counterpoint to the destruction, thousands of miles away, of the World Trade Center, whose fall last September triggered the campaign that freed the Afghans from the war that wrecked their country.
The idea to make use of Kabul's most plentiful resource is not, in this violent era, a new one. Borrowing a page from the Germans in the aftermath of World War II, when they often reused bricks to rebuild their country, United Nations officials have set up rubble recycling programs in the former battlegrounds of Bosnia, Kosovo and West Africa. To the officials who run the program, paying people to gather the remains of blown-up buildings serves three purposes, all of them good: it clears the way for rebuilding, makes the rebuilding cheaper and puts people back to work. 
"When we got here, the Afghans thought we were going to rebuild their city for them, and put up aluminum and glass buildings," said Mr. Karadaghy, who has helped recycle rubble in Bosnia and Kosovo. "This makes them realize that they are going to have to do it themselves, and that it will be done in accordance with their traditions." 
Much of Kabul was destroyed during the early and mid-1990's, during the internecine bloodletting that followed the Soviet Union's withdrawal. For much of the 1990's, the armies of at least five warlords fought for control of the city, ruining the place as they tried to ruin each other. The conquest of Kabul by the Taliban in 1996 gave the city a brief reprieve, but that ended when forces loyal to Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance leader, regrouped and began to bombard the city with rockets. Today, officials estimate that as many as 60 percent of Kabul's buildings are damaged or destroyed. 
In Jada-e-Maiwand, on the southern corner of Kabul, there is not a single structure that is untouched by the fighting. In their very survival, the broken buildings seem to defy gravity. Brick walls, jagged and crumbling, list in the ruins. Slag heaps rise 20 feet. The blackened remains of the fires that consumed the beams and door frames mark every wall still intact enough hold them. The bodies, and anything else of value, were long ago picked off the pile and carted away. 
"There was so many rockets that you couldn't go outdoors for many days," said Temor Shah, one of the men pulling down buildings in the neighborhood. "The city was the front line." 
On this day, Mr. Shah and a group of about 10 other men roped and pulled down a half dozen walls, then sorted and stacked the good bricks while tossing aside the bad ones. Trucks would come later to cart the bricks and gravel away.
Though the program is just two weeks old, crews have already begun using the gravel to fill in marshes and patch up roads. For now, the bricks deemed suitable for reuse are being taken to a gathering site nearby. Those bricks taken from privately owned buildings are stacked and left for the owner. 
"One day, on this site, we will build a new city," Mr. Shah said. 
Even at this stage, the razing of the old Afghan buildings stands in contrast to the careful reclamation of the World Trade Center. While work crews at ground zero employ sophisticated cranes and cutting devices, here the men use only their muscle and pay little heed to the dangers of the job. As 10 men tugged on a rope to pull down a wall, another man scaled the wall to guide their efforts. He leaped from the structure just as it began to crash.
"Look out!" he yelled, as he hit the ground and scampered away. 
In the midafternoon, an old man wandered onto the pile, wearing a white beard and an olive turban and holding a cane. His name was Abdul Hakim, and he said he was 98. 
"I want you to give a job like this to my son," Mr. Hakim said, and the men around him laughed. "I'm serious about this." 
While few listened, Mr. Hakim told his story: He lived right over there, in the rubble itself, he said, and even during the heaviest bombardment of the middle 1990's, he never left. 
"Two thousand rockets in one day," he said.
Mr. Hakim only went out to wander the neighborhood every day in search of scraps of food. He carried with him a sheaf of papers, some of them wrinkled and old. One of the documents, which he waved persistently, was a letter from one government servant to another. Across the top, one official had written: "Please help him. He is a poor man."
"See?" Mr. Hakim demanded, holding out the document. "Won't you help me?"

HEADLINE: Assembly Revisits Rent Laws One Year Ahead of Schedule 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 15 

 BODY:
In December 1996, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, threatened to do away with rent regulation, dragging Republican lawmakers and Gov. George E. Pataki into the path of a merciless political backlash. Six months later, lawmakers agreed to preserve the rent laws until 2003, by which time the current governor's race would be safely over.
 But today, Democrats attempted to place rent regulation on the table a year early. 
 Reminding his listeners of the 1997 rent wars, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, proposed legislation to end landlords' ability to deregulate apartments that reach $2,000 in monthly rent and extend rent regulation laws to 2008. About 800,000 rent-stabilized apartments have been converted to market-rate apartments, and conversion is accelerating, he said. The Assembly passed the legislation later in the afternoon.
It was political bait: an issue of paramount concern to city dwellers, backed by tenants groups and labor leaders like Dennis Rivera of 1199/S.E.I.U., who has endorsed Governor Pataki and is credited with the ability to pull the governor to the left. 
But the Republican-led Senate is not likely to bite. "With the budget late and critical issues such as school aid and economic development yet to be resolved, it's unfortunate that the speaker appears more concerned with a deadline that is over a year away than the budget deadline that passed more than two weeks ago," Mr. Bruno said in a written statement released after Mr. Silver's news conference.
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said the governor's office was studying the issue. Both of the Democratic candidates for governor, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, support the Democratic measure.
In New York City 1.1 million apartments, or about 50 percent of the city's rental units, are regulated. Westchester, Nassau and Rockland Counties have between 70,000 and 80,000 rent-regulated units, said Michael McKee, associate director of New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, an advocacy group.
In 1997, the opportunity arose to phase out the rent regulation laws, which landlord groups say artificially suppress the housing market and discourage proper maintenance.
But Senator Bruno's declaration that he would end regulation triggered a fierce response. With Democratic print and television advertisements, and the use of Mr. Rivera's prodigious phone bank, the issue became a symbol of the governor's perceived insensitivity to city residents' needs. His poll ratings began to drop. And he forced the Senate to back down. Advocacy groups now hope he will do the same again.
But some housing advocates say that what appeared to be a victory for tenants was a boon for landlords, because the $2,000 rule, known as high-rent decontrol, was not struck down. Landlords also could increase rents by at least 20 percent each time an apartment became vacant. In addition, the law was changed so that tenants contesting their rent could go back only four years. 
"Landlords in the city are clearly taking advantage of these provisions, and they are hiking rental rates to a level that working families cannot afford," Mr. Silver said.
The Assembly measure would not repeal a provision that deregulates apartments if the rent reaches $2,000 and the occupants make more than $175,000 a year. 
The Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords group, has protested extending the law without a hearing or a study of its impact. The group also argues that the $2,000 provision de-regulates only expensive apartments and does not affect the low- and middle-income tenants whom rent regulations are intended to protect. Rents on market-rate apartments have gone down in response to the recent market slide, said Frank Ricci, the association's director of government affairs.
But supporters of rent stabilization like Mr. McKee argue that only the most expensive apartments respond to market fluctuations. And, Mr. McKee said, rent-stabilized apartments are still profitable.
According to the City Rent Guidelines Board, the percentage of income that landlords spent on operating costs has declined over the past 10 years. In figures for 1999, the most recent available, landlords spent about 60 percent of rent from stabilized apartments on operating costs. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a proposal by Albany Democrats to extend and revise the law governing New York City's rent regulations misstated the number of rent-stabilized apartments that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, estimated landlords have converted to market rate over the last decade. He said 80,000, not 800,000, although some housing experts cite even lower figures.

HEADLINE: A Barely Breathing Energy Bill 

 BODY:
For weeks, the Senate has been poised to vote on one of the most politically and emotionally charged issues to come before it in quite a while -- an amendment to the energy bill that would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. The vote could come this week. But Alaska's two Republican senators and main sponsors of the amendment, Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens, are now threatening not to bring it up until they have the 60 votes necessary to overcome an inevitable Democratic filibuster. That could be a long wait -- so long, in fact, that an exasperated majority leader, Tom Daschle, might decide to pull the larger energy bill from the floor altogether rather than tie up the Senate. 
 Pulling the bill might not be a bad idea. Though we are not prepared to abandon all hope that a decent energy measure can still be cobbled together, the Senate is testing everyone's patience. It has already rejected a modest effort to improve fuel economy standards for cars and S.U.V.'s, which would do far more to enhance the country's energy security than would drilling in the refuge or any of the other ecologically sensitive areas on which the Bush administration has cast a covetous eye. 
 The provisions the Senate seems ready to pass are mainly dubious. One of these, the brainchild of farm- and plains-state senators, is a so-called ethanol mandate that would triple the amount of ethanol used as a fuel additive. Senator Charles Schumer of New York, among others, has correctly called this a giveaway to the farm states (ethanol is derived from starches, mainly corn), a potential drain on the Highway Trust Fund and a threat to clean air. Another provision, sponsored by George Voinovich of Ohio, would expedite the building of new energy delivery systems -- oil and gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines -- but, environmentalists claim, at the cost of undermining the traditional review procedures required by the National Environmental Policy Act.
Some environmental groups would like to see the Arctic refuge issue come up for a vote just to get the Senate on record as opposing drilling there. But simply saying no to a demonstrably bad idea does not constitute creative lawmaking. The Senate has a long way to go before it produces an energy bill worthy of public support.

"THIS is a very important announcement," said a raspy voice on the loudspeaker. All of us in the airport departure lounge sat up straight and paid attention.
 "If you have to go to the bathroom, you must do so now," the voice ordered. "Once you are on board the airplane, no one may get up to use the bathroom. So do so now if necessary." 
 Dragging their carry-ons, several people scuttled away to find the facilities. Of the rest of us sitting there meekly awaiting further instructions, at least one of us was thinking, now I know how the kids in the back seat used to feel like when they were read the riot act at the onset of those family holidays.
This incident occurred just the other day, when I needed to make a day trip to Washington.The ticket, Newark International to Reagan National and back, a round trip of less than 300 miles, cost $488, which is the standard business fare when you don't book weeks in advance. 
You might recall me bragging in this space last week about how clever I was recently, scoring a $309 round-trip fare from Newark to San Francisco for a business trip. Now here I sat with a ridiculously expensive ticket for a 37-minute flight, listening to a lecture about using the bathroom because security doesn't allow passengers to get out of their seats on the short hop to Washington.
You might ask, why didn't I instead take the train, where I could stroll the aisle, use the bathroom, plug in my laptop, buy a sandwich, snooze in comfort -- for about half the airplane fare? Full disclosure: I forgot. In my haste to make arrangements for a last-minute trip, it just didn't occur to me to factor in the quite excellent alternative to flying afforded by Amtrak's Northeast corridor lines, which include the nation's finest train service, the high-speed Acela Express.
Aware that many business travelers do not routinely evaluate viable rail alternatives when booking trips, Amtrak will announce today an important arrangement with GetThere, a Sabre subsidiary that supplies customized Web booking engines for more than 800 big corporations, including half of the Fortune 200.
Starting this fall, corporate travelers using company online booking sites managed by GetThere will find Amtrak's reservations system fully integrated into the booking process along with airlines.
In a faint but still discernable echo of a rail boom that is competing strongly with intercity air transport in Europe, Amtrak has been racking up ridership gains on its regional lines as business travelers find reasonable alternatives to the high fares and chronic problems of airlines and airports.
Many business cities in Europe are within 300 miles of each other. In the United States, regional city pairs like those in the Northeast corridor approximate that kind of geography. 
During its first full year of operation in 2001, Amtrak's premier Acela Express service on the Boston-New York-Washington run failed to meet initial ridership projections. But it is now running 5 percent ahead of projections so far this year, and has emerged as a serious competitor to air travel on those routes.
In its alliance with the rapidly growing GetThere -- which says it nearly doubled its corporate travel bookings last year, to more than six million -- Amtrak will be integrated into the desktop booking environment to "become part of the universe" for business-travel decisions, said Alan Orchison, Amtrak's senior director for industry alliances and marketing. 
Someone booking a trip to, say, Washington, on a GetThere-sponsored portal would see a display of airline fares and schedules as well as rail alternatives for the same itinerary, said Karina Van Veen, an Amtrak spokeswoman. "The air shuttle will come up, but so will Amtrak," she said.
"The most important aspect of the technology is the way it provides the traveler with an integrated view of all the options directly on their screen," said Mark Orttung, the vice president for product marketing at GetThere. "It's all right there." 
Besides the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor, Amtrak is attracting more business travel on its routes between Los Angeles and San Diego; Chicago and Milwaukee; and Portland, Ore., and Seattle, Wash., Mr. Orchison said. With the Get-There alliance, he added, a traveler who needs to fly to Milwaukee with a connection through Chicago would immediately see the option of taking a train, rather than flying, from Chicago to Milwaukee. 
Amtrak, which is nevertheless struggling financially and has threatened to eliminate long-distance trains, its biggest money-losing service, recently entered into a code-sharing arrangement with Continental Airlines that enables passengers to use air-rail combinations more easily on certain routes along the Northeast Corridor.
Under that agreement, passengers making Continental reservations can simultaneously book any of the 17 Amtrak connections between the Newark airport, the Northeast Corridor and Philadelphia. This effectively links Amtrak customers from Philadelphia; Wilmington, Del.; Stamford, Conn.; and New Haven to Continental flights out of its Newark hub.
The GetThere alliance further increases that exposure. "We're on millions of corporate employee desktops, and they're really the buyers who own this marketplace," said Mr. Orttung of GetThere. "We're not biased one way or another" between air or rail, "but our main goal was to give them a good set of options," he said. 
For corporate travel managers, who need to have accurate data to maintain contracts and discount arrangements with various suppliers, the GetThere system will incorporate Amtrak bookings into both corporate and individual travel profiles. This is done through a feature that keeps a record of bookings from all sources as well as spending trends and even individual itineraries.
In all, GetThere is currently available on more than five million desktops. That number grew substantially last year, even before Sept. 11. A souring economy was part of the reason.
"The recession pushed more people online," Mr. Orttung said.
Corporate travel managers who have encouraged or in some cases mandated the use of online intranet booking systems like GetThere's often express amazement about the enthusiasm which some employees bring to the idea of making cheaper travel arrangements, once given the tools to do so in a way that makes sense to them individually.
As they become better accustomed to the greater individual choices available on intranet booking systems, those users have been forming networks inside and outside their companies. "They're organizing their own user groups to talk about their best practices" and to discuss better ideas for integrating all aspects of business travel -- transportation, accommodations and everything else they have to arrange on the road, he said.
The demand for melding Amtrak itineraries into the booking mix came from some of those networks, Mr. Orttung said. "This is one where our customers in the Northeast really wanted it," he added. "A group of our customers got together and said, 'Here's our top item: Amtrak.' "

HEADLINE: Insurers Say 2001 Brought First Overall Loss 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Car, home and business insurers -- battered by poor investment returns and claims from the World Trade Center attacks -- suffered their first annual overall loss last year, according to a report released yesterday by two industry groups.
 Property-casualty insurers, including State Farm, Allstate, the American International Group and Travelers Property Casualty, lost $7.9 billion over all in 2001, compared with a $20.6 billion profit in 2000. 
 It was the industry's first loss since figures first began being recorded almost a century ago, according to the Insurance Services Office and the National Association of Independent Insurers, which perform an annual calculation of insurers' results.
"The key forces that came together to form the 'perfect storm' of 2001 were recession, underpricing, catastrophe losses, medical cost inflation, Enron, abuse of the legal system and, of course, the Sept. 11 terrorist attack," said Bob Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute.
Insurers notched about $10 billion of losses related to Sept. 11, but that figure may balloon to $25 billion if a rush of liability claims are successful, the Insurance Services Office said. Over all, insurers worldwide are expected to pay $30 billion to $70 billion for Sept. 11 losses.
As usual, insurers made a loss on underwriting, paying $1.16 in claims and expenses on every $1 of premium received. That was worse than $1.10 the year before.
Insurers' bottom lines, however, were sunk as investment returns, which usually cover the loss on underwriting, did not do so last year.
Insurers had low returns on reliable investments as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, while they lost billions of dollars liquidating bad bets like venture capital and technology investments.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup; 
Justices Tackle Implications Of a Rule on Drug Sentences

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15 

 BODY:
It was time for the Supreme Court today to begin confronting the practical implications of the sharp new direction it took two years ago in criminal sentencing.
 In an appeal from the federal government, the justices heard an argument about what should happen now to drug defendants whose extra-long sentences were impermissibly based on a judge's rather than a jury's conclusion about the amount of drugs involved in their crimes. 
 A federal appeals court ruled last year that such sentences were subject to automatic reversal under the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey. That decision, issued in June 2000, held that any factors that increase a sentence above the ordinary maximum must be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Until the Apprendi decision, federal drug indictments did not ordinarily specify a quantity of drugs, leaving that finding to be made by the judge at sentencing. Federal drug laws impose a series of escalating sentences, depending on drug quantity. 
The government quickly changed its practice after the Apprendi ruling and now includes drug quantity in the indictment. But it has maintained that enhanced drug sentences should generally be regarded as valid if they were handed down before the ruling and the defendants did not object at the time.
At stake in the case argued today, United States v. Cotton, No. 01-687, is a relatively small number of cases, perhaps fewer than 100, in which major drug defendants whose cases were still open on appeal at the time of the Apprendi ruling had received more than the ordinary 20-year maximum sentence that applies to those found guilty of trafficking in "any detectable quantity" of narcotics.
The Cotton case involves seven defendants, leaders and participants in a major drug ring in Baltimore, five of whom received life sentences on the judge's finding that each was responsible for more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. The other two received 30 years. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., ruled that all must be resentenced to no more than 20 years.
Although the immediate impact of the Supreme Court's ruling may not be great, the implications of a decision that adopts the appeals court's reasoning could be broader. 
For example, it could affect sentences imposed under the Federal Death Penalty Act, under which the "aggravating circumstances" that make a defendant eligible for the death penalty are not charged in the indictment. Two weeks ago, in a case called Allen v. United States, No. 01-7310, the government asked the Supreme Court to defer action on a federal death row inmate's appeal until a decision in the Cotton case.
The Cotton case also raises interesting questions about the role of the grand jury. Timothy J. Sullivan, representing the defendants, maintained that errors in an indictment could never be overlooked without jeopardizing the grand jury's role in protecting the rule of law.
"The integrity of the courts would be impaired if the decision is that you can be indicted for one offense and convicted of another," Mr. Sullivan told the justices. 
Michael R. Dreeben, a deputy solicitor general arguing for the government, said that to the contrary, when evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that "any rational grand jury" would have produced a proper indictment if asked, an error in the indictment should be regarded as "harmless."
The Cotton case is one of three Apprendi sequels that the court is considering this spring. Next week, in Ring v. Arizona, No. 01-488, the court will consider whether the death penalty laws in nine states, affecting some 800 defendants, are constitutionally flawed in providing for the judge rather than the jury to issue a death sentence.
There were also these developments at the court today:

Busing for Integration
Without comment, the court refused to review a ruling by the Fourth Circuit last September that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District in North Carolina had effectively dismantled the vestiges of segregation and become "unitary." Under the ruling, race-based student assignments are to end for the next school year.
A group of black families brought the Supreme Court appeal, Belk v. Capacchione, No. 01-1122, arguing that the school district did not yet merit release from federal court supervision that began 32 years ago.
The long-running case produced a landmark decision of the civil rights era, Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, a 1971 decision in which the Supreme Court for the first time upheld busing as a remedy for school segregation.
At the same time today, the justices turned down an appeal by white plaintiffs who were seeking $1.5 million in lawyers' fees for having reopened this last phase of the case and achieved the ruling that the district was now officially desegregated. That appeal was Capacchione v. Belk, No. 01-1094.

Journalists' Rights
Also without comment, the court turned down an appeal by Vanessa Leggett, a freelance writer who spent 168 days in jail on a contempt of court charge for refusing to give a federal grand jury notes and tapes of interviews she conducted while investigating a sensational Houston murder case. Ms. Leggett was released from a federal detention center in Houston in January, when the grand jury's term expired.
She was appealing a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, that the First Amendment's protection for newsgathering activities did not give her a privilege to refuse to cooperate with the grand jury. Although there had been considerable dispute about Ms. Leggett's standing as a journalist, that question was not at issue in the case, Leggett v. United States, No. 01-983.
The government opposed the appeal on the ground that the case was now moot, the grand jury having finished its work by indicting the murder suspect, Robert Angleton. 
"The government has no intention (or reason) to reconvene the grand jury in connection with this case," the government told the justices.

Victoria's Trademark
In a trademark dispute between the Victoria's Secret lingerie stores and catalog and a store called Victor's Little Secret, in a strip mall in Elizabethtown, Ky., the court agreed to decide whether trademark infringement requires proof of actual economic injury.
Victoria's Secret, which sends 3.5 million catalogs to Kentucky residents every year, won a trademark infringement suit against the small shop, owned by Victor and Cathy Moseley. The lower federal courts disagree on whether a plaintiff in such a suit must demonstrate economic injury, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, held in this case was not necessary. The Kentucky shop's appeal is Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue Inc., No. 01-1015.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Forecast for This Year Grows More Pessimistic

BYLINE:  By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
The Zenith Optimedia Group in London, a leading forecaster of advertising spending, is turning more pessimistic about 2002.
 In a report released yesterday, Zenith Optimedia predicted that spending this year in the world's seven largest advertising markets would decline 1.9 percent from 2001, to $218.5 billion. 
 In December, Zenith Optimedia had estimated spending for the markets -- Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United States -- would decline 0.7 percent.
The revision came as Zenith readjusted its estimate of how much ad spending in those markets fell in 2001 compared with 2000. The revised estimate is a decline of 5.4 percent, to $222.8 billion; the previous estimate was a decline of 4.7 percent.
Zenith Optimedia, which is owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe, sees the start of an upturn in the fourth quarter and stronger growth in 2003. Still, the report said, there will be "at least another two years" beyond 2002 "when advertising growth will underperform" growth in gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Approves Allergan Drug for Fighting Wrinkles 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Botox, a wildly popular treatment for wrinkles, was approved yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration for cosmetic use to treat frown lines.
 The approval permits Allergan, the maker of Botox, to begin a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign aimed at doctors and consumers. Until now, because Botox had received regulatory approval as a treatment only for eye spasms and other neurological disorders, the drug's use as a cosmetic treatment has grown largely through word of mouth. 
 The agency's approval, which was expected, gives Allergan the ability to market the drug for cosmetic use and should help Allergan to increase Botox sales significantly over the next few years, analysts said. Allergan's stock, which had declined about 18 percent this year, gained $3.80 yesterday to close at $65.71. 
"There's a big portion of the country that doesn't know what Botox is," said Gregory B. Gilbert, an analyst for Merrill Lynch, noting the effectiveness of other advertising campaigns aimed at consumers. He is recommending the stock.
Botox, which is the commercial name for botulinum toxin A, the neurotoxin that causes botulism, will be injected directly into face muscles, paralyzing them and therefore eliminating wrinkles. The effects of the shots, which cost $300 to more than $1,000, last three to four months. While botulism can be fatal, the treatment is considered safe because it uses very diluted amounts of the toxin.
Botox shots and similar treatments are already the most popular cosmetic treatment in the United States, based on the number of procedures, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. It estimated that more than 1.6 million procedures were performed last year.
While some doctors have already been giving their patients shots of Botox to smooth their brows, the F.D.A. approval will increase demand for the treatment, Malcolm Paul, the society's president, said. As in the case of other drugs marketed directly to consumers, like Claritin or Prozac, "patients are going to ask for it," he predicted.
Allergan, which is based in Irvine, Calif., said it expected to spend $50 million over the rest of this year to promote the drug, which is expected to be used mainly by women ages 35 to 64. While the company would not discuss the specifics of its campaign, it said it planned to begin advertising on television and in print within a few months.
"We're going to see a big campaign by Allergan," Mr. Gilbert said. 
The Botox campaign is unlikely to be one of the largest for a prescription drug, but the amount Allergan expects to spend approaches the $86 million Pfizer spent all of last year to advertise Viagra, its drug to treat impotence, according to CMR in New York, a company owned by Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending. 
The F.D.A. approval also permits Allergan to brand its treatment as Botox Cosmetic, said Thomas DesChamps, an analyst with Mehta Partners, which owns Allergan shares and is recommending the stock. "It obviously adds to the strength of the franchise," he said.
Analysts say Allergan has the potential to double its existing sales of Botox, which reached $310 million last year and accounted for the bulk of the company's revenue.
Mr. Gilbert is even more optimistic, saying Botox could eventually become a $1 billion drug. While there are some competing wrinkle treatments, including Myobloc, made by Elan, the Irish drug maker, "there is room for two to three competitors," he said.
Allergan is also seeking regulatory approval for additional uses for Botox, including headaches and back spasms. The use of Botox to treat migraines "is gaining momentum in the scientific community," Mr. Gilbert said.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Style Conservative Runs as Outsider in France 

BYLINE:  By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 15 

 BODY:
In the presidential race in France, Alain Madelin is closest to being the American candidate. He opposes high taxes and government meddling and favors free markets, free trade and free enterprise.
 He could easily pass for a Republican in the United States, which explains why he is not expected to do well in the elections on Sunday. 
 Indeed, Mr. Madelin does nothing to cultivate comparisons with America. His ideas of less government worry many French voters, who fear what they see as an economic model that erodes social benefits and eliminates protectionism. 
"There's an anti-Americanism in France that means that as soon as you defend a market economy against a Keynesian economy, they accuse you of following the United States," Mr. Madelin, 56, a lawyer, said in an interview. "All I'm talking about is applying the basic rules of the economy. I believe in modern reforms so that France can live in our time." 
Seven or eight years ago, France seemed receptive to deregulation and privatization. Now, the mood is heading in the opposite direction.
President Chirac, for one, speaks of globalization only in terms of how it should be curbed. When Mr. Madelin cites the 35-hour workweek as absurd government intervention, he is attacking the one reform of the past five years that may carry the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, to the Elysee Palace.
Mr. Madelin harbors no illusion of winning this weekend. All polls indicate that the decisive second round of voting on May 5 will pit Mr. Chirac against Mr. Jospin. Like more than a dozen other marginal candidates, Mr. Madelin wants to use his campaign to promote his vision of France and, he hopes, stack up some bargaining chips for the future. 
The two leading presidential candidates are promising to defend -- not to change -- France. "The current campaign is particularly poor," Mr. Madelin said, "given that three-quarters of the French see no difference between Chirac and Jospin. The ideas on the table are tepid and timorous."
What Mr. Madelin clearly hopes is that, as Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin scramble to assemble a winning coalition for the vote on May 5, he will be able to persuade Mr. Chirac to incorporate some of his ideas. "
Businessmen like Mr. Madelin, although they are not rallying round him in droves -- at least for now. "He is certainly closest to our way of thinking," said Michel Tourbe, a restaurant owner. "He stands for the kind of freedom entrepreneurs like, but I won't vote for him because he doesn't have a chance."
Indeed, the latest polls give Mr. Madelin just 3.5 percent of likely votes in Sunday's first round. Even some leaders of his right-wing party, Liberal Democracy, are backing Mr. Chirac's re-election. 
"Chirac, Jospin and much of France's political class have grown up, studied and governed in a place dominated by the central role of the state," Mr. Madelin said. "They can't adapt. It's like asking a general to become an antiwar activist."
In May 1995, after the last presidential elections, he was appointed to the powerful post of minister of economy and finance. But, after three months, he proved too radical for the conservative prime minister, Alain Juppe, and he was fired. Less than two years later, parliamentary elections brought Mr. Jospin's Socialists to office. 
Mr. Madelin has always been something of an outsider. Unlike most of the ruling elite, he has a working-class background. While studying in Paris in the late 1960's, when many students were leftists, he joined an anti-Communist group called "Occident," or "West," that supported American intervention in Vietnam -- a position as unfashionable then as his missionary zeal for unfettered capitalism is today.

HEADLINE: Bush Pressing To Make Cut In Tax Rates Permanent 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, April 15 

 BODY:
President Bush stepped up pressure on Democrats in Congress today to support making the 10-year tax cut from last year permanent, declaring that the rate reductions he signed into law last June were "one of the reasons we're seeing encouraging signs in the economy."
 Surrounded by crates of Cheerios, Wheaties and Fruit Roll-Ups at a General Mills factory here, Mr. Bush celebrated the legislation on the day that many taxpayers filed returns that reflected the first installment of the tax cuts, which will phase in over several years but expire at the end of 2010. 
 Looking ahead to Thursday, when the House will take up a Republican bill to make the tax-cutting package permanent, Mr. Bush urged Congress to eliminate what he called "a quirk in the law" that would see income tax rates in 2011 go back to their 2000 levels and the federal tax on large estates be eliminated in 2010 and then spring back to life in 2011. 
"It's going to be hard to plan your future if you think all of a sudden these things get kicked in full time, and then go away," Mr. Bush said. "They need to make these tax cuts permanent."
Telegraphing the strategy that Republicans plan to use on the House floor this week and in the fall election campaign, Mr. Bush said failing to make the tax cuts permanent would be tantamount to a large tax increase. But he did not say how he would pay for the extension of the tax cuts, a step that would cost several hundred billion dollars a year starting in 2011, just as the government begins facing the cost of Social Security and Medicare benefits for the baby boom generation.
Mr. Bush's speech was the centerpiece of an effort by the administration and Congressional Republicans to use April 15 to stoke public opposition to what they consider high taxes and build support for further changes to the tax system.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, was host of a town-hall-style meeting in Washington at which he described April 15 as notorious and criticized "Uncle Sam's insatiable appetite for our money."
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill announced the first step in an administration plan to simplify the tax code, creating a single definition for what constitutes a qualifying child for the purpose of credits and deductions. The law now has five definitions.
"The tax code is an abomination," said Mr. O'Neill, whose department includes the Internal Revenue Service.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans had made the tax code increasingly complicated in recent years even as they promised more simplicity. Mr. Rangel said Mr. Bush's plan to make his tax cut permanent would mostly benefit the wealthy and was a backdoor way for Republicans to starve Social Security and Medicare.
In his speech here, Mr. Bush also waded again into the debate raging in the Senate over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, a proposal that he strongly favors. 
The president told the factory workers and their children that opponents of oil drilling in the refuge were spreading propaganda about the environmental damage that it might cause. He said threats by Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, to cut off oil exports for a month or more meant that "we'd better figure out" how to produce more oil domestically. 
The Senate plans to take up the Arctic drilling on Tuesday as part of a broader energy plan. But Republicans do not appear to have the 60 votes that they would need to end a Democratic filibuster on the provision, meaning that Democrats are quite likely to kill it. 
Mr. Bush repeated that he was determined to prevent Mr. Hussein from acquiring nuclear or biological weapons. The president's aides are clearly concerned that at a time of rising oil prices, any coming confrontation with Iraq could cause large price increases at the pump. 
Mr. Bush seemed undeterred. In recent days, his aides have suggested that even the violence in the Middle East would have little effect on his rough timetable for demanding full nuclear and biological inspections in Iraq and supporting insurgencies -- and perhaps direct military action -- to depose Mr. Hussein.
Mr. Bush also attended a fund-raiser for Representative Greg Ganske of Iowa, who is running for the Senate seat now held by Tom Harkin, among the Senate's most liberal Democrats.
Mr. Ganske has another conservative opponent in the primary, but the White House has taken the unusual step this year of giving early support to Republican candidates who it believes have the greatest chance of success in November. The event tonight, attended by 1,400 people who paid about $250 a plate, raised $500,000 in "hard money" for Mr. Ganske's campaign.
