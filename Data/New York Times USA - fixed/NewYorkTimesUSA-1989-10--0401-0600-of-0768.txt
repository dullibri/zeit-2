HEADLINE: A VOLATILE MARKET;
Tokyo Closes Higher, But Traders Still Wary

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Taking their cue from Monday's advance in New York, stock prices here moved up strongly today, recovering much of their losses from the previous session.
But trading remained extremely thin and nervous, as the unusual volatility of the past week left many institutions shaken.
The Nikkei average of 225 stocks closed at 34,996.08, for a gain of 527.39 points, or 1.53 percent, erasing much of Monday's decline of 647.33 points, or 1.8 percent.
The Nikkei picked up much of its gain shortly after the market opened, gaining 435.11 points in the first hour of trading. 
Still, market analysts said the big institutions remained on the sidelines, as the sharp swings here of the past week left many investors shellshocked and unwilling to commit themselves. Reflecting this, trading volume was declining throughout the morning, traders said.
 
Relief and Anxiety
The general attitude in Tokyo was one of relief that the New York stock market had recovered, but anxiety over the fact that the exchange in Tokyo had been so roiled by external events.
''Generally, the economic conditions and the fundamentals are good, and over time they will prevail,'' said Masahiro Dozen, deputy president of the Daiwa Securities Company, Japan's second largest brokerage house. ''But what is happening in New York and in the foreign exchange market is dominating the thinking at the moment.''
Toyoharu Tsutsui, head of equities at CS First Boston (Japan), said that in some ways the declines and the nervousness here were worse than was suggested by the Nikkei average, which concentrates on blue-chip shares. He pointed out that the so-called second section of smaller and often more speculative shares had fallen much further on Monday and rebounded more wildly today.
''The volatility has upset many investors,'' he said. ''I still don't think the institutions have gotten active.''
 
Strong Recoveries Elsewhere
Other Pacific Rim markets also showed strong recoveries today.
The Hong Kong stock market, which has been buffeted in recent months both by political developments in China as well as Wall Street's gyrations, rebounded smartly. The Hang Seng Index was up 92.74 points, or 3.6 percent, to 2,710.84 by midday.
''All in all, everyone is simply relieved,'' said Jim Loh, head of stock sales and trading in Hong Kong for CS First Boston (Hong Kong) Ltd. ''Things have stabilized after a lot of activity early in the morning.''
Like analysts elsewhere in the region, he lamented the fact that New York was really calling the tune in Hong Kong. ''If you want to know the real influence, you look at the U.S. of A.,'' he said. ''That will dictate what is happening in the short-term.''
In New Zealand, the first market to open, the Barclays stock index gained 117.70 points, or 5.7 percent, to end the day at 2,176.42 in active trading. In Australia, the All Ordinaries index, which had tumbled 141 points on Monday, was up 70.4 points, or 4.4 percent, to 1,671.3 by midday. In Taiwan, the market index gained 410.32 points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 10,100.52. And the Singapore Straits Times Index opened up 2.1 percent, or 27 points, at 1,312.04.
 
Stocks Fall in Europe
LONDON, Oct. 16 (Special to The New York Times) - Europe's stock exchanges were battered today as individual investors and small institutions sold heavily, ignoring the pleas of their governments to remain calm in the wake of Friday's market decline in New York.
But the declines - ranging from 3.2 percent in London to 6.9 percent in Paris and 12.8 percent in Frankfurt -would undoubtedly have been much worse had the American markets not rallied this morning, giving European investors heart and causing stocks on many markets to recoup some of their losses.
In London and other European markets, investment houses said most big institutional investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the day, and entered the market in significant numbers - as buyers -only in the afternoon.
 
Sharp Markdowns Made
With rumors flying around all morning that the Dow Jones industrial average might open 200 to 300 points below its close on Friday, market makers in many exchanges decided to play it safe and marked down stock prices sharply at the opening of trading, and buyers seemed absent much of the day.
In London, The Financial Times index of 100 leading stocks opened down 157.1 points, or 7 percent.
Prices were marked down so much in Paris, Milan and Amsterdam that the permitted limits on the stocks were exceeded from the start, and many stocks did not trade, either for a portion of the day or all day.
Perhaps the hardest hit today was the Frankfurt exchange. It was swamped by panic selling by small investors, which caused the Deutsche Aktien index of 30 leading stocks to fall by 203.56 points, or 12.8 percent, its largest one-day drop since World War II.
The Financial Times index, which plunged 250 points in the 1987 crash, today closed down by 70.5 points, or 3.2 percent, at 2,163.4.
The drop was still large - especially since the London market had already fallen 7.9 percent since Sept. 5, when it hit a post-crash peak of 2,426.

HEADLINE: Congressman Enters Connecticut Primary

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 16

 BODY:
United States Representative John G. Rowland entered the race for the 1990 Republican gubernatorial nomination today, attacking Gov. William A. O'Neill for the state's constantly changing budget picture and trying to clear up questions about his stance on abortion.
Unlike others who weigh the success of a fund-raising committee before making a formal announcement, Mr. Rowland, 32 years old, said that there was nothing to explore, that he was convinced people are ready for the first Republican governor in two decades. 
He said he was entering the race with ''no caveats, no hedging, no testing the waters.''
The three-term Congressman from Waterbury said that the 9-year-old O'Neill administration had been marked by economic chaos - a theme that another O'Neill challenger, United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison, a Democrat, has sounded.
''One political party has controlled this state far too long,'' Mr. Rowland said during his announcement in the Legislative Office Building, a block from the Capitol, where he served two terms as a state representative.
He said that he had the strongest record of budget reform and restraint among Connecticut's Congressional delegation.

HEADLINE: Rebels Reject Salvador Government Offer at Talks

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Salvadoran Government opened critical talks here today with guerrilla representatives by proposing an end to all hostilities in two days and the demobilization of the rebels in three months.
The proposal was immediately dismissed by the guerrillas, who said it was tantamount to a demand that they surrender.
Oscar Alfredo Santamaria, the Minister of Justice, declined to discuss details of the five-page peace plan, which had been expected. He said, ''We hope the proposal will be evaluated with the same seriousness in which it was made.'' 
But representatives of the guerrillas said the plan paved the road to the liquidation of their army.
''We maintain that it's a proposal for unconditional surrender,'' said Joaquin Villalobos, a senior rebel commander.
 
The Guerrillas' Conditions
The guerrillas, who have made several conciliatory proposal in recent months, insist on judicial and economic changes before they end the war, which so far has claimed 70,000 lives.
The Government plan seemed to open the door to negotiations on reductions in the size of the 57,000-man army, a rebel demand. The Government also offered to guarantee the safety of members of the rebel organization, the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front, and offered undefined measures to help the rebels establish a political party.
The new Government offer was the highlight of five hours of talks in the community house of a convent on the outskirts of San Jose. They are the first substantive negotiations since the outbreak of the civil war a decade ago.
The Government proposal followed a recent offer by the rebels to lay down their arms and join the political process in exchange for sweeping political changes and deep cuts in the armed forces, which have long ruled the country in a coalition with the oligarchy.
 
Both Sides Under Pressure
The quick rejection of the Government offer is a setback for the negotiations but is unlikely to prove fatal to the developing peace process, which has gained some momentum in recent weeks.
The meeting is considered a key test of the two sides' sincerity in seeking a negotiated solution to the war, because it includes the first substantive discusions. Previous talks, which had taken place intermittently, were largely limited to procedural questions and quickly collapsed.
Both the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the rebels say they expect the negotiations will take months to complete and have promised not to withdraw unilaterally. Both sides are under intense domestic and international pressure to negotiate and have begun competing politically for the mantle of peacemaker.
 
55 Arrested in Washington
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (AP) - The police arrested 55 protesters today after they blocked the entrance to a House office building, disrupted a House session and demonstrated at two Congressional offices to protest United States military aid to El Salvador.
About 200 demonstrators rallied outside the Capitol, then marched to the Rayburn House Office Building, where 44 of them were arrested as they blocked an entrance.
One protester got a bloody nose, a police spokesman said.
Two other groups of demonstrators disrupted the offices of Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and Representative Stephen Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn. Four protesters were arrested in each office, the spokesman said. Neither lawmaker was present.

HEADLINE: Taxes Short Of Forecast, Regan Says

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Revenues from New York State's major taxes were more than $200 million below projections for the first six months of the fiscal year, according to a report issued today. The report renewed debate over whether the state can afford a scheduled $400 million tax cut next year.
The most serious shortfalls were in business and real-estate taxes, which together accounted for almost two-thirds of the shortfall. Business-tax revenues for the first six months of the fiscal year, from April through September, fell more than 6 percent below the same period last year, noted the report, prepared by Comptroller Edward V. Regan. 
Budget Director Dall W. Forsythe said it was too early to say whether the state would be forced to take major steps to head off a deficit in the current $47 billion budget. He noted that because tax revenues fluctuated every year, it was not prudent to use midyear figures to predict where the revenues would wind up at the end of the fiscal year.
 
'Bad News in the Northeast Economy'
He said however that the numbers in the Comptroller's report mirrored ''bad news in the Northeast economy generally and bad news in the New York City economy, in particular.'' Another disturbing factor, Mr. Forsythe said, was a weak real-estate market downstate, which has led to sharp reductions in the capital-gains taxes paid on the sale of houses.
The spending so far, $15.4 billion, is in line with projections, as is the $7.75 billion from personal income taxes.
The problems indicated by the revenue data were nowhere near as severe as a year ago, when officials projected that overestimates of tax revenue had left the state facing a potential deficit of almost $2 billion, which was largely reduced through a combination of spending cuts and borrowing from reserve funds.
Moreover, the figures seemed to show that those fiscal problems might not be as daunting as those in New York City, where officials recently reported that business taxes were down 17 percent and that some real-estate taxes were down 25 percent compared with the same period last year.
Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, Gary Fryer, said the revenue figures bolstered Mr. Cuomo's case that there were ''formidable challenges ahead'' in developing next year's budget. The state is planning the third phase of a cut in the personal income tax, a move that could save taxpayers $400 million next year, although the Governor has suggested that a wise course might be to ''put it off'' and use the money to address the budget problems.
Still, leaders of the Republican-controlled State Senate have repeatedly said that the fiscal problems are manageable and that the tax cut is a promise that should be kept.
A spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee, Gerald McLaughlin, said that the Comptroller's report was being reviewed and that leading Senators would look at a more detailed report expected this month from the Budget Office. So far, he said, ''there's been no deviation from the plan'' for the tax cut.

HEADLINE: Cornel Wilde, 74, a Performer and Film Producer

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Cornel Wilde, an athletic actor who was expert in fencing and horsemanship but who won stardom with his portrayal of the tubercular composer Frederic Chopin in the 1945 film ''A Song to Remember'' died of leukemia yesterday in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, three days after his 74th birthday.
The tall (6 foot 1 inch), muscular and dashing actor was often cast in routine swashbucklers and action melodramas. He was able to stretch his talent, however, in such roles as a paroled convict in ''Road House'' (1948), an embattled parole officer in ''Shockproof'' (1949), a dedicated policeman in ''The Big Combo'' (1955), a daring aerialist in ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' (1952), an ambitious executive in ''Woman's World'' (1954) and a heroic emperor in ''Constantine and the Cross'' (1961).
In 1955, Mr. Wilde formed his own company, Theodora Productions, and began directing, producing and starring in modest-budget movies shot overseas. These included ''The Naked Prey'' (1966), in which he was relentlessly hunted through a jungle, and ''Beach Red'' (1967), a passionately pacifist work. Reviewing the latter film, Howard Thompson of The New York Times credited Mr. Wilde with having ''nimbly piloted . . . a graphic, unflinching and honest drama of men in combat'' with ''simple, unrestrained and stinging honesty, semidocumentary vigor'' and ''crisp economy.'' 
Other Wilde productions included ''Storm Fear,'' ''The Devil's Hairpin,'' ''Maracaibo,'' ''Sword of Lancelot,'' ''No Blade of Grass'' and ''Shark's Treasure.'' The films met with mixed success and were praised by reviewers for having bold aspirations; but some reviewers said several of them were naive, simplistic and brutal.
 
Traveled Widely in Europe
The actor and film maker was named Cornelius Louis Wilde at his birth on Oct. 13, 1915, in Manhattan. He spent much of his youth accompanying his father on business trips to Europe and became fluent in several languages. In New York he studied at Townsend Harris High School and City College while working as a Macy's toy salesman and commercial artist.
Mr. Wilde won a scholarship to the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University and was a leading member of the 1936 American Olympic fencing team, but he abandoned his ambitions to be a surgeon and a champion fencer to pursue an acting career. He gained his first major notice as Tybalt in the Laurence Olivier-Vivian Leigh production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' on Broadway in 1940.
That performance won him a Hollywood contract and the role of Chopin in ''A Song to Remember.'' The public flocked to buy recordings of works by the composer and to see the handsome actor who, in one vivid scene, coughed blood on the piano keys. The film also provided Merle Oberon (playing George Sand) with the celebrated advice to Chopin to ''discontinue that so-called Polonaise jumble you've been playing for days.''
The baroque script was criticized by most reviewers and prompted the critic James Agee to denounce the movie as ''infuriating and as funny a misrepresentation of an artist's life and work as I have ever seen.'' Criticism notwithstanding, Mr. Wilde was nominated for an Academy Award.
 
Played D'Artagnan in 1979
Mr. Wilde's other films included ''A Thousand and One Nights'' (as Aladdin, in 1945), ''Leave Her to Heaven'' (1945), ''The Bandit of Sherwood Forest'' (as Robin Hood's son, in 1946), ''Centennial Summer'' (1946), ''Forever Amber'' (1947), ''Omar Khayyam'' (in the title role, in 1957) and ''The Fifth Musketeer'' (as D'Artagnan, in 1979).
Reviewing his deepest preoccupations in 1986, Mr. Wilde remarked: ''I am very concerned about the environment and psychological health of this beautiful planet. Throughout my work is the idea, over and over, that we must all learn to respect one another.''
The leading actress in many of Mr. Wilde's independent productions was Jean Wallace, whom he married in 1951. They divorced in 1981. They had a son, Cornel Wallace Wilde, of Beverly Hills, Calif. The film maker also had a daughter, Wendy, of Berkeley, Calif., by his first wife, the actress Patricia Knight, whom he married in 1937 and was divorced from in 1951. He is also survived by two stepsons, Pascal Franchot Tone of Hamilton, Mass., and Thomas Jefferson Tone of Ottawa, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A VOLATILE MARKET;
Fresh Look Is Taken at the State of the Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The decline in the stock market Friday, the rebound today and the nervousness about what it all might mean led politicians, economists and business executives today to reappraise the state of the American economy and the Government's economic policies.
President Bush was asked about Friday's market drop at a picture-taking session this morning at the White House. ''I'm not worried,'' he responded. He went on to say that Administration officials were ''monitoring the situation'' closely. 
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that Mr. Bush believed that ''the economy remains strong'' and that ''the economic outlook continues to look good.''
 
Spending Cuts Put Into Effect
But Mr. Bush had no choice except to sign an order putting across-the-board spending cuts into effect at midnight, since his Administration and Congress failed to to meet a deadline for adopting a deficit reduction plan.
Among economists, the prevailing view is that neither the budget deadlock nor any other specific development in Washington precipitated the market break last Friday or the rebound today.
''People in Washington flatter themselves to think anybody on Wall Street gives a damn about what they do,'' said John H. Makin, director of fiscal policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
But many economists do say that the inability of the politicians to come to grips with the deficit and the apparent disagreement between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve over interest rates caused a general unease among investors.
For weeks now, the Fed and the Treasury have been at odds over interest rates. The Fed has kept them high to ward off inflation, while Administration people in the Treasury and elsewhere have urged lower rates to drive down the dollar.
 
'Underlying Fragility'
Robert H. Chandross, chief economist in the New York office of Lloyds Bank, said that the ''underlying fragility of the system'' was caused at least in part by high interest rates and that ''progress to reduce the deficit would take pressure off interest rates and improve the strength of the financial system.''
President Bush's spending-cut order was automatic under the budget law, but many Democrats in Congress blamed the President for failing to exert more leadership on the economy in general and the budget deficit in particular.
''The President seems unwilling to make the hard choices, or the easy ones for that matter, preferring to be carried along by the current of events,'' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, turned that criticism around. At a news conference, he maintained that the budget impasse was caused by Congressional Democrats who insist on attaching ''objectionable material'' like expansion of child-care benefits to the budget legislation.
The chief executives of the nation's largest companies, who met over the weekend in Hot Springs, Va., are mostly Republicans and have favorable feelings about Mr. Bush. But while they criticized Congress in interviews, they expressed disappointment with what they saw as the President's lack of forcefulness on the economy.
''On initiative, I'd give him a 'C,' '' said Howard P. Allen, chairman of the Southern California Edison Company. ''I don't think he has taken the initiative. He has not attacked the problem.''
Richard Rahn, chief economist at the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, attributed Friday's drop in the market directly to the Senate's decision to postpone a vote on cutting the capital gains tax. The statement was seen even by Mr. Rahn's friends as a political observation rather than economic analysis.
Except for the Federal Reserve, however, the Government has little power to affect the stock market day to day. ''Making soothing noises is about all they can do,'' said Charles L. Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who was chief of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration.
 
Fed Takes Action
As for the Fed, it pumped $2 billion into the banking system today by buying Treasury securities from banks. That increased the amount of money banks had available to make loans to brokers and securities dealers and presumably increased investor confidence.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave a scheduled speech on bank capital requirements to the American Bankers Association this morning just as the stock market was opening. He referred to the market only briefly at the outset.
 
'Watching Developments'
''We at the Federal Reserve are watching developments in financial markets rather closely,'' he said, adding that he was in close contact with Government regulators and central banks overseas. It would be extraordinary if he were not.
Some economists maintained that the decline in the stock market Friday could have the paradoxical effect of leading to an improvement in the economy, if it encouraged the Fed to lower interest rates.
''That would be a stimulus,'' Mr. Chandross said.
One of the rates most closely controlled by the Fed, the Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, fell slightly today, to 8.96 percent, from 8.93 percent Friday.

HEADLINE: A VOLATILE MARKET;
Airline Takeover Bill Clears a House Panel

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
A bill to forestall airline acquisitions moved ahead on Capitol Hill today, over the objections of the Bush Administration.
In objecting to the measure, the Administration in effect delivered a rebuff to Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who had testified that the legislation would make his department's reviews of airline takeovers more effective.
The Administration's objections were voiced in a letter from Deputy Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao, sent while Mr. Skinner was out of town. 
 
Department's Authority
''The Department of Transportation currently has sufficient statutory authority to act where an acquisition raises questions about an air carrier's fitness,'' she said in a letter to James, L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee.
She added: ''The Administration is reviewing the current merger and acquisition activity in the airline industry. In light of the significance of this issue, and the analysis under way within the Administration, we therefore object to proceeding with the House bill.''
The measure was approved today by the subcommittee, and the full panel will take it up later this week.
Last week, they said, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and top economic policy officials told Mr. Skinner that the Administration would oppose the proposed legislation.
 
Safety and Financial Concerns
The bill would require the Transportation Department to review any transaction in which an investor acquired more than 15 percent of an airline. The purchase could be blocked if the department determined that it would undermine safety, jeopardized the financial health of the airline or would lead to the sale of assets by the new management.
Under current law, the department can review the fitness of new owners to operate an airline but not before they take control.
Inspired by a wave of airline takeovers, the bill and a companion measure in the Senate, which has cleared the Commerce Committee, have picked up support in recent weeks, gaining endorsements from ranking members of both parties on committees with jurisdiction over the airlines.
 
Trump's Objections
Another objection to the proposed legislation came today from Donald J. Trump, the investor who recently bought the Eastern Airlines' shuttle and who today withdrew the bid for American Airlines that he made earlier this month.
In a letter to the legislators, Mr. Trump said: ''The attempts by AMR to have legislation rushed through the Congress cannot be in the interests of anyone but AMR executives. I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday.''
While the legislation, in its current draft, would apply to any takeover of an airline with annual revenues above $750 million, some of its clauses are written in ways that would especially complicate Mr. Trump's bid for AMR, which has lobbied for the measure.
Several committee members bitterly denounced Mr. Trump, rejecting his contention that their work might have contributed to the market collapse last week.

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFERS TO AID GORBACHEV'S PLAN TO REVAMP SYSTEM

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said last night that the United States was prepared to provide Moscow with advice and technical assistance to help it restructure the Soviet economy and society.
It was the Bush Administration's most open endorsement of the economic changes brought about by the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and it seemed to represent a new approach by an Administration that has been criticized for being too tepid in its response to Mr. Gorbachev.
Speaking before a nonpartisan foreign-policy association in Manhattan, Mr. Baker repeatedly emphasized that the Bush Administration recognized the ''historic opportunity'' now at hand to make a ''lasting improvement'' in Soviet-American relations. [Excerpts from the speech, page A14.] A New Enthusiasm Although Mr. Baker's speech lacked new initiatives beyond an offer to send American economic experts to Moscow, its tone and substance reflected an element of enthusiasm for joining with the Soviet Union in reshaping East-West relations. It stood in marked contrast to statements by other Administration officials, who seemed in recent months to express more fear than excitement for the extraordinary changes in the Eastern bloc. 
Only a month ago, in a widely quoted speech, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said that helping Mr. Gorbachev's reforms ''is not the task of American foreign policy, nor should it be that of our Western partners.'' He added, ''Our task, however, is to devise policies which will serve our interests whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds or fails.''
 
Promise of Perestroika
Administration officials were clearly hoping that the Baker speech would help silence critics in the Democratic Party who have said that the Bush team does not recognize the opportunities at hand. In the speech, Mr. Baker's most comprehensive talks on East-West relations since taking office, the Secretary declared that Mr. Gorbachev's success in restructuring the Soviet Union was itself a fundamental American interest.
''We want perestroika to succeed,'' Mr. Baker told the Foreign Policy Association, a nonpartisan organization that examines foreign affairs, during the speech at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
''We have reached this conclusion not because it is our business to reform Soviet society or to keep a particular Soviet leader in power - we can really do neither - but because perestroika promises Soviet actions more advantageous to our interests,'' he said.
''Our task is to search creatively for those points of mutual U.S.-Soviet advantage that may be possible. And many more may be possible because of perestroika.''
State Department officials made no effort to hide that the speech was intended to communicate how far Mr. Baker's views toward Moscow had evolved in the last nine months, and in particular since the end of the summer.
In that time, Poland's first non-Communist postwar Government took office, Hungary's Communist Party dissolved itself and recast itself as a socialist party, East Germany began to feel similar winds of change, and Mr. Baker himself engaged in an extensive round of talks with his Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in Wyoming.
A sign of how far the Administration is now ready to go in engaging Mr. Gorbachev was Mr. Baker's declaration that ''we are prepared to provide technical assistance in certain areas of Soviet economic reform.''
''The Soviets are entering uncharted waters, experimenting with markets, competitive enterprises and realistic pricing, all of which we take for granted,'' he said. ''The Soviet leadership is clearly interested in our ideas about their economic reforms, and we will continue our discussion on these issues.''
 
'Intellectual Help'
Administration officials said Mr. Baker's reference to technical assistance meant the type of ''intellectual help'' provided last week by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, who spent the week in Moscow meeting with top economic advisers and discussing the role of a central bank and a commercial banking system.
Another idea, said an Administration official, would be for the United States to provide a team of experts to help the Soviets develop a statistical base for their economy - anything from a consumer-price index to real production and consumption indexes - which are now lacking in the Soviet Union, making economic reform much more difficult to plan and chart.
There was virtually no emphasis in the Baker speech on the dangers of Mr. Gorbachev's loosening hold on Eastern Europe but rather a constant focus on the possibilities that have resulted from Mr. Gorbachev's program of perestroika, or political and economic restructuring.
There was also an indication that the Administration now thinks Mr. Gorbachev is sincere in his desire to engage in Western-style reforms and is not trying to win a ''breathing space'' so that the Soviet Union can do battle with capitalism down the road.
 
Call for Economic Reform
Mr. Baker said: ''Perestroika is a Soviet response to a rapidly changing world in which they see themselves increasingly hard-pressed to compete economically, technologically, politically and militarily. The very logic of perestroika requires that the Soviets solve their own problems in a comprehensive, organic way.
''Not only must the economic system be reformed but the political and legal systems, too. Perestroika is, therefore, different than earlier, failed attempts at reforming the state Lenin founded and Stalin built.''
Mr. Baker took note of what Administration officials say is a widening awareness, at least at the State Department, that Mr. Gorbachev is engaging in reforms so far-reaching that they will make many of his initiatives more difficult to reverse, no matter who might succeed him. Mr. Baker said ''the self-reliant and radical nature of domestic perestroika has become even more crucial as the reforms have encountered increasing difficulties.''
Mr. Baker said that in defense policy and arms control, and in certain regional conflicts like Afghanistan and Central America, the Soviets have not gone far enough to show the kind of new thinking that they have at home.
The transformation of ''tanks into tractors'' that Mr. Gorbachev spoke of has yet to materialize, he said. Nevertheless, Mr. Baker said: ''By acting realistically to engage Moscow in the search for mutual interests, we can seize the opportunities inherent in Gorbachev's revolution. By standing pat, we would gain nothing and lose this chance to revolutionize East-West relations.''
 
Future of Germany
In a brief section on East Germany, Mr. Baker appeared to indicate that while the United States continued to support a united Germany in theory, it would not tolerate neutrality for such a Germany.
''Normalization must occur on the basis of Western values and with the end result being a people integrated into the community of democratic European nations.''
At the same time, Mr. Baker cautioned Eastern Europeans and residents of the Soviet Baltic republics who are striving for greater freedom to recognize that this will have to be a gradual process, and to understand that neither they nor Mr. Gorbachev nor the United States will benefit from changes that could bring a crackdown from Moscow.
''We favor a process that gives these countries their right to self-determination and freedom,'' said Mr. Baker. ''No one - I repeat, no one - will benefit if the entire trend toward beneficial economic and political change is engulfed in violence. But all will benefit if the reforms succeed in Eastern Europe.''

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Morgan Posts a Loss; Other Banks Record Gains

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
As expected, J. P. Morgan & Company announced yesterday that it had reported a loss of $1.82 billion for the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Security Pacific Corporation yesterday reported a 10 percent increase in third-quarter profits; the NCNB Corporation's profits more than doubled, with half its profits coming from its Texas operations, and the First City Bancorporation of Texas reported a 22 percent increase in profits.
 
J.P. Morgan
J. P. Morgan said last month that it would report the third-quarter loss since it had added $2 billion to its reserve against third world loans. Increases in a bank's reserves for losses on its loans are subtracted from its earnings. The move brought Morgan's total reserves to $3 billion, which equals 100 percent of its portfolio of medium- and long-term debt to lesser developed countries and 68 percent of its total lending to third world countries. A year earlier, the reserves equaled 23 percent of total third world lending. 
In another sign that Morgan was trying to free its capital from loans tied to developing countries, the bank holding company also said that by the end of the quarter, it had sold $500 million of its loans, reducing its total exposure to $4 billion.
The loss for the quarter compares with a profit of $233.6 million, or $1.25 a share, for the 1988 period.
''It was a weak quarter,'' said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst for Oppenheimer & Company. ''Morgan's strategy may ultimately prove to be right. But over the near term, earnings are weak and the stock is vulnerable to be clipped a couple of points.''
Expenses in the quarter increased by $67 million, to $496 million, Mr. Kotowski said. ''That kind of increase coming in the face of weaker revenues is a bad combination,'' he said. The company attributed the increase to increased employee benefits and costs associated with its move to a new office in downtown Manhattan.
Other big banks, including Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover, and Chemical, have said their third-quarter results would be poor after moves to shore up their loss reserves from problems with third world debt.
Morgan's interest income for the quarter was $254 million, down from $347 million in the 1988 quarter.
It also said non-interest income had risen by $45 million, to $414 million. for the corresponding period last year. The increase reflected increased corporate finance fees and gains from the sale of investment securities.
Morgan's stock rose $1.50 to close at $44.125 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
NCNB
The NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., said earnings in the quarter more than doubled, to $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, compared with $58.9 million, or 69 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year.
The banking company's NCNB Texas unit contributed more than half of the net income, or $76.1 million. Overall profit within the Texas operation was $123.1 million, including $63.1 million in gains from sales of investment securities.
NCNB acquired the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's 51 percent stake in NCNB Texas in July, a year after the F.D.I.C. picked NCNB to manage and subsequently to buy the largest bank franchise in Texas, formerly held by the First Republicbank Corporation.
All the operations in Texas have been consolidated as part of NCNB's total financial results since it bought the F.D.I.C.'s stake last July. In a statement, NCNB's total assets increased to $60.8 billion in the third quarter, from $28.8 billion in the corresponding period last year.
In the quarter, nonperforming assets rose to $474.1 million, or 1.43 percent of total loans and leases. Most of the nonperforming assets, or $348.3 million, were in the company's Southeast banking unit, which operates principally in Florida. That figure for the Southeast unit rose by 51 percent, from $230.8 million, in the period a year earlier.
 
Security Pacific
Security Pacific said its third-quarter net income had increased 10.2 percent, to $185.1 million, or $1.55 a share, from $167.9 million, or $1.47 a share, in the comparable period last year.
Richard J. Flamson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of Security Pacific, attributed the increase to strong growth in the California consumer and residential real estate markets, continued strength in the bank company's Pacific Northwest operations and a strong showing in its financial services affiliates.
For the quarter, interest income increased 8 percent, to $727.9 million, and non-interest income declined 6 percent, to $457.1 million.
Security Pacific's stock fell 37.5 cents yesterday, to $44.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
First City
First City Bancorporation of Texas said its profits rose 22 percent in the third quarter, largely reflecting new loan business.
The Houston-based bank group said it had earned $28.8 million, or $1.19 a share, up from the $23.6 million, or 97 cents a share, for the comparable period a year earlier.
First City's asset base at Sept. 30 totaled $13.6 billion, up from $12.9 billion June 30 and $11.6 billion Sept. 6, 1988. Loans grew to $7.8 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4 percent from the previous quarter and 15 percent from the corresponding period one year ago.
In the third quarter, First City acquired the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's interest in the bank, allowing it to operate with more freedom and to extend its franchise with more flexiblity, the bank's chairman, A. Robert Abboud, said. After First City was shored up with Federal assistance of $970 million, Mr. Abboud's group bought the institution for $500 million raised privately in April 1988.
During the last year, the book value of First City's shares has increased 25 percent, to $28.55 from $22.89, the company said. For the year ended Sept. 30, the company's stock price has risen 50 percent, and closed at $36.50, off $1.50. in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: LEADER FALLS BACK IN BRAZILIAN RACE

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
One month before Brazilians vote for a new President, the race looks increasingly like a tossup.
As the Nov. 15 voting date approaches, a center-right front-runner is dropping steadily in the polls while a trade unionist with Marxist ties appears poised to move into second place.
The top two vote winners among the 22 candidates will confront each other in a runoff election on Dec. 17.
The rapidly changing political picture is taking place against a deteriorating economic backdrop. Brazil has suspended payments on its foreign debt, the largest in the developing world, and last month consumer prices rose 36 percent. 
A sudden surge in food prices last year contributed to the unexpected victory of a Marxist candidate for Mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city.
 
Jitters in the Market
In the presidential campaign, Brazil's first direct vote for President in 29 years, the fall of the right and the rise of the left have caused market jitters.
''Gold has taken off, the dollar has taken off - only Collor can give confidence to the market,'' said Helio Costa, a member of the Chamber of Deputies who is an adviser to Fernando Collor de Mello, the center-right candidate.
In the last five weeks, Mr. Collor, a 40-year-old Governor, has seen his lead drop from 45 percent voter support to about 30 percent in Brazil's Gallup polls.
Mr. Collor's decline has benefited a rightist challenger, Guilherme Afif Domingos, and the trade unionist, Luis Inacio da Silva of the Marxist-influenced Workers' Party.
The prospect of a victory by the Sao Paulo leftist, commonly known as Lula, drew an unusually sharp attack this month from Mario Amato, president of the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries, Brazil's most powerful business organization.
If Lula wins, ''everyone who can transfer his capital will flee,'' he warned. Although the leftist enjoys only a 12 percent approval rating in the polls, Mr. Amato predicted that his victory would prompt 800,000 business people to leave Brazil.
 
Capital Flight Grows
Because of general uncertainty over Brazil's political future, capital flight is believed to be running at twice last year's rate.
But one month before Brazilians are to vote, it is unclear who the top two candidates will be. Brazil's electorate of 82 million, the largest in the Western Hemisphere after the United States, is notoriously fickle.
''In Brazil, the electorate fluctuates enormously,'' said Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a Senator with the Brazilian Social Democracy Party. ''There is very little party allegiance. I think it will be decided between Nov. 1 and 15.''
Since early September, all candidates have had a chance to broadcast their views on a nightly program of 70 minutes of free political advertising. But according to the polls, 43 percent of voters are undecided and 65 percent have no party preference.
On paper, Brazil's most powerful party is the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which controls 22 of 23 state governorships. But in the polls the party's candidate, Ulysses Guimaraes, a 73-year-old member of the Chamber of Deputies, consistently receives only 4 percent of voter support.
 
Hobbled by Alliance
In a race where no candidate wants to be associated with the Government's record of 1,198 percent inflation in the last 12 months, Mr. Guimaraes is hobbled by his party's governing alliance with Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, as well as by his age.
Among today's top contenders, two other candidates, Paulo Salim Maluf, a former Governor of Sao Paulo state, and Leonel Brizola, a former Governor of Rio de Janeiro state, seem unable to break out of their regional strongholds.
Campaign positions are sharpening over an issue that concerns the United States - Brazil's $120 billion foreign debt. American banks are Brazil's largest creditors.
The fact that Brazil quietly suspended servicing the debt last month has done little to soften growing public intransigency about repaying foreign banks.
Mr. Collor, long a moderate on the debt issue, asserted at a news conference this month that ''the negotiation of Brazil's foreign debt has been conducted with the payment of bribes and has been shot through with illegalities and favors.'' Mr. Collor said that if elected he would cut Brazil's annual debt service and profit remittance payments to $7 billion, about half this year's level.
Mr. Collor advocated a two-prong strategy: withdrawing federal guarantees that the debt will be paid and forcing Brazilian businesses and states to individually renegotiate their debts with foreign bankers.
Virtually all other major candidates advocate suspending payments until the debts are renegotiated.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Out, Out, Brief Hope

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The Arab states have stamped out a faint, brief hope that they might take one small step toward real peace in the Middle East.
For a while, some Israelis and Westerners cherished the thought that maybe this year the Arabs would be wise enough and want peace enough to drop their annual ritual of trying to throw Israel out of the United Nations General Assembly.
It would cost the Arab states almost nothing and win considerable political profit.
At a time of negotiations about Israeli-Palestinian talks, it would get them an admiring press around the world. It would signal that they might at least be giving a little thought to solving the one basic problem lying behind the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which prevents peace in the Middle East and keeps the possibility of another war ever present. 
That problem is the refusal of every Arab state except Egypt to make peace with Israel. With arrogance and contempt, they demand that Israel turn over territory and weaken its security while surrounded by nations that consider themselves at war with Israel.
Anyway, that brief hope is dead. Sometime today, the Libyan delegate is scheduled to march to the rostrum and in the name of the Arab states demand again that Israel be kicked out as an outlaw country unfit to sit in the community of nations. Libya!
The move will fail. But the Arabs are not looking for a voting victory. Their objective is to continue the relentless effort to obliterate Israel as a nation worthy of respect in the world - part of a continuous and sophisticated campaign of psychological warfare.
The campaign is worth considering not only for what it tells us about the intentions of the Arab states but our own double standards.
Think: How many news stories have you read or heard on TV during the current session of the General Assembly about this annual ugliness and about the Arab decision to continue it for the seventh straight year?
A number of American columnists and editorial writers and members of Congress are demanding that Israel at once accept Egyptian or American or Palestinian suggestions about Israel's own election proposals. How many also have written to remind Arabs that peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians are hardly helped by a simultaneous Arab campaign to drive Israel out of the United Nations?
Like most Americans and Israelis I hope some way can be found to put Israel's plan into operation. But I think that with their very existence involved, the Israelis have the duty to use all the political mine-detectors they own.
It is strangely unfeeling for Americans to scream for the United States Government to harass, threaten and blackmail Israelis into acquiescence while remaining silent about the continuing Arab rejection of Israel.
But the sorrow is that the double standard about Israel and the Arabs is so ingrained now we hardly notice it anymore. The world reacts in anger about the killing of Palestinians on the West Bank - except when the Palestinians are being killed by Palestinian terrorists.
Hard conditions in an Israeli camp for Palestinian prisoners get continuing attention - correctly. But two years ago, when the Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurds, fellow Muslims and inhabitants of Iraq, the world hardly noticed. Thousands were killed, according to Kurdish leaders, and hundreds of thousands fled into exile. When the atrocity surfaced, the story lasted a day or two. Then most diplomats and journalists yawned and turned away.
Every deliberately obscure word Yasir Arafat mumbles about accepting Israel's existence is praised. But when he travels around the world inspiring the economic boycott of Israel, nobody pays much attention.
The double standard is not the fault of Israel's enemies. They do not hide the depth of their enmity against Israel. Four decades after Israel's creation, European publishers have to print special maps in school textbooks if they want to sell them in most Arab states. The maps obliterate the very name of Israel.
The fault lies in the rest of the world, particularly the West, where the truth can be known and said. But it is not, year after year it is not said.
Peace will come in the Middle East when the Arab states are ready to make peace, not before. To pretend otherwise is a sardonic joke.
It is not absolutely necessary to have a sense of humor to follow what is going on in the Middle East. But it does help, particularly if it is a taste for sick comedy.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Fall Sharply; Grains and Soybeans Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures fell sharply yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York, while precious metals gained and grains and soybeans rallied, and energy futures sagged.
Copper futures slumped to two-week lows, partly on stock market jitters and partly on a report that a settlement of the 14-week-old strike at Canada's Highland Valley copper mine was imminent. Officials of the mine, in British Columbia, announced a breakthrough in contract negotiations last week.
The copper market, particularly vulnerable to industrial demand, opened sharply lower on stock market jitters, then recovered along with stocks only to retreat in afternoon trading amid speculation about the Canadian strike situation.
On the bullish side, the London Metal Exchange said in a weekly report that stocks of copper registered for delivery against its futures contracts tumbled by 13,575 tons, to 89,300 last week.
Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 3.5 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December at $1.2745 a pound.
Precious-metals futures rallied on the Comex, partly reflecting investor nervousness about the stock market.
Precious metals are often perceived as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty.
Gold and silver made intraday highs before the stock market opened but they remained firm, despite stocks' recovery, on lingering doubts about the stock market, said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
Gold settled $3.90 to $4.10 higher, with October at $367.30 an ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to 2.5 cents higher, with December at $5.163 an ounce.
Grain and soybean futures prices rallied on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders, relieved by the stock market's recovery, reacted to news that China was bidding for 400,000 metric tons of American wheat and had purchased 150,000 metric tons of corn.

HEADLINE: This Year, Series 'Travel Day' Means An Easy Hop for Everyone Concerned

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
In less time than it takes most people to travel from home to the airport, the commissioner of baseball changed headquarters today on World Series travel day.
''It's a beautiful day,'' Fay Vincent said upon arriving at the Westin St. Francis Hotel on Powell Street in San Francisco after a 25-minute ride from the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Broadway in Oakland. ''There was no traffic on the bridge. Everyone tells me how lucky I am not to have to go from west to east. I consider it Irish good fortune.'' 
World Series travel day. It happens twice during baseball's championship gathering if the Series goes beyond five games. ''Travel day,'' though, often is a euphemism. The off days, while providing time for travel of great distance, insure that if the Series reaches the sixth and seventh games, television will have a second weekend of telecasts.
Unlike most years, the only traveling done by either of the teams today was by the Oakland Athletics, who took a 22-mile, 30-minute bus trip from the Oakland Coliseum to Candlestick Park for a late-afternoon workout.
Actually, most of the players exercised the option given them by Manager Tony La Russa and drove to Candlestick directly from their homes. Jose Canseco was not one of them.
 
'I Don't Want to Be Arrested'
The Athletics' slugger, as notorious for his driving exploits as he is known for his home-run achievements, drove to the Coliseum and tried to get one of his teammates to accompany him in his car to Candlestick.
''I don't want to be arrested,'' Dave Henderson said, playfully rejecting Canseco's offer.
A minute later, Walt Weiss walked into the clubhouse and Canseco said, ''Walt, do you want to drive up there?''
''To the Stick?'' the shortstop replied, then thought about it for a second and headed for the bus. Minutes later, resigned to driving alone or riding the bus, Canseco boarded the bus and it departed.
The Airporter bus, with Don Donaldson at the wheel, departed without fanfare and proceeded along Interstate 880 north to 980 east to 580 west to 80 west and finally onto the approach to the Bay Bridge. Fluttering in the wind from light poles on the left side of the approach were green and gold (Athletics) pennants; black and orange (Giants) pennants adorned the light poles on the right side.
As the bus crossed the bridge, Alcatraz Island was off to the right with the Golden Gate Bridge farther in the distance. The hills of San Francisco loomed at the other end. Reaching the end of the span, the bus headed for Route 101 south.
Ten minutes later, the bus reached Candlestick. A lone 6-year-old boy stood outside the parking lot and waved to the players.
Other players had already arrived, driving from home as if they were regular people driving to regular jobs.
Taking note of the simplicity of it all in this year's neighborhood World Series, Hank Greenwald, one of the Giants' television and radio announcers, had said the evening before at Oakland Coliseum: ''It's a strange feeling in a sense. You feel if you're in a World Series, you should get on a plane and go somewhere and stay in a hotel.''
Visitors, like the commissioner, are staying in hotels, although some are remaining in a hotel on one side of the Bay or the other. As baseball's top official and a diplomat, Vincent switched sites this morning.
 
A Geography Lesson
Accompanied by a friend from Washington, Vincent Burke, and a security aide, Phil Knecht, the commissioner made the short trip in a white Chevrolet Caprice. (''They're a sponsor of baseball,'' he explained.) ''My wife and Mrs. Burke rode in another car,'' Vincent related, sitting in the St. Francis lobby, casually dressed in brown sports jacket, tan slacks and open-collared white shirt. ''Our driver, a San Francisco detective who does security work for us here, gave us a local geography lesson on the way.''
When they reached the tollbooth -one has to pay to get into San Francisco; leaving is free - Knecht gave the driver, Ron Kramer, a dollar bill for the toll. ''Phil got a receipt,'' Vincent said, smiling.
Vincent's journey was made in a far less conspicuous manner than the Giants' trip to Oakland for the first two games. The players' buses received a police escort, with motorcycle and squad car lights flashing and sirens blaring when necessary. Members of the San Francisco police force and the California Highway Patrol provided the escort and were joined by Oakland police motorcycles halfway across the bridge.
 
'Cops Gave Them Away'
''Actually, if it wasn't for us, no one would have noticed anything,'' Ray Shine of the San Francisco police, one of the escorts, said after the Sunday trip. ''It was definitely the cops that gave them away. But even then I was waiting to see how many people were giving thumbs up or thumbs down and there weren't many.''
Dirk Smith, the Giants' travel director, said the players on the bus enjoyed the escort. ''They got a kick out of them pulling cars over so we could get through but people thinking they were getting tickets,'' he recalled.
Much is different about this World Series, including the vastly reduced expenses the teams have incurred.
The teams' expenses aren't quite as low as they were when the Yankees played the Giants (New York) or the Dodgers (Brooklyn) in the 1940's and 1950's. ''It was only a 15-cent ride on the subway from Brooklyn to Yankee Stadium,'' said Roger Craig, the Giants' manager, who pitched for the Dodgers in the 1955 and 1956 Series.
But saving more than $100,000 on a chartered airplane alone underscores the economic advantage this year. Smith said the Giants' charter to Chicago for the National League Championship Series cost $130,000 round trip, and he estimated that a round-trip charter to Toronto would have cost the club at least $160,000.
 
Saving on Hotel Costs
The other major savings is on hotels. Smith said that the Giants would have needed approximately 75 rooms at their Toronto hotel, at a cost of $99 Canadian a room. Translated into United States currency, a room would have cost about $76, for a total of $5,700 a day. If the Series had gone the full seven games, the Giants would have needed their rooms for six nights at a total of $34,000.
They are not saving that entire amount, though. Both the Giants and the Athletics offered players the opportunity to stay in hotels. The teams explained that in some cases the players' leases had run out. Smith said that 15 Giants were staying at hotels, and Morabito said six or seven Oakland players had accepted the team's offer.
Despite the convenience and the overall financial savings inherent in this World Series, an official of one of the teams made a surprising admission before the Series began.
''I'd rather be on the road,'' said the official, who didn't want to be identified even by his affiliation because he feared the other team might use his comment as psychological fodder. ''Everybody wants tickets for both parks. They couldn't do that if we were playing somewhere else.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Baker's Remarks on Soviet Union

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an address by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, delivered tonight before the Foreign Policy Association in New York, as provided by the Federal News Service:
We are in a time of rising promise. Relations with the Soviet Union have improved considerably since 1985, when Mikhail Gorbachev launched what he called perestroika, a total restructuring of Soviet society, including Soviet foreign and defense policy. And this administration has been building on what was achieved during the Reagan years so that improved American-Soviet relations will last.
We now have a historic opportunity with the Soviet Union. We have the chance to leave behind the postwar period with the ups and downs of the cold war. We can move beyond containment to make the change toward better superpower relations more secure and less reversible. Our task is to find enduring points of mutual advantage that serve the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union. 
 
Promise for the Future
As a consequence of the failure of their system, the Soviets, led by Mikhail Gorbachev, have begun the process of reform and rebuilding called perestroika. And it is this process, combined with our own achievements, that offers promise for the future. The President has said and I have said that we want perestroika, including the restructuring of Soviet-American relations, to succeed.
We have reached this conclusion not because it is our business to reform Soviet society or to keep a particular Soviet leader in power -we can really do neither - but because perestroika promises Soviet actions more advantageous to our interests. Our task is to search creatively for those points of mutual U.S.-Soviet advantage that may be possible, and many more may be possible because of perestroika. . . .
 
Regional Conflicts
President Gorbachev has repeatedly pointed to the links between domestic reform and the new thinking in foreign policy, saying just a few months ago that there exists an indissoluble link between the new foreign policy and perestroika in the country.
And that is where we come in. Fascinating as change in the Soviet Union may be, we are mainly affected by the way the Soviet Union approaches the rest of the world. Here, too, perestroika promises a radical reform. . . . Regional conflicts are likely to be more difficult to contain, more likely to engulf more countries, and more susceptible to escalation.
Neither the United States nor a Soviet Union in the midst of perestroika has an interest in being drawn into such conflicts. . . . This is an area where the Soviets can help themselves. And we have made it clear that we are ready and willing partners, partners who recognize that settling and defusing regional tensions can diminish the dangers we face. . . .
 
The Success of Glasnost
While our primary focus is on those points of mutual advantage that we can find in these three areas - Europe, regional conflicts, and arms control - we are also seeking a fourth area: the strengthening of glasnost and democratization.
Through our exchanges, we are actively encouraging the growth of pluralistic institutions and practices in the Soviet Union. We believe the emphasis on the rule of law in the writings of the reformers is a positive step. We are encouraging the Soviets to make permanent in their legal code and practice the protection of individual rights to which they subscribed in the Helsinki Accord. . . .
Finally, we have begun to explore a fifth area of potential mutual advantage. This last area relates to perestroika's internal aspects.
We are prepared to provide technical assistance in certain areas of Soviet economic reform. The Soviets are entering uncharted waters, experimenting with markets, competitive enterprises, and realistic pricing, all of which we take for granted.
In Wyoming, Minister Shevardnadze and I had extensive discussions on the kinds of steps that would facilitate price reform, a necessary step toward ruble convertibility. The Soviet leadership is clearly interested in our ideas about their economic reforms, and we will continue our discussions on these issues. . . .
We do neither of us any good if we relax our own standards in the name of helping reform. That's why we've told the Soviets to codify the changes we're seeing in their emigration practice so that we can waive Jackson-Vanik as we've promised.
That's why today we see discussions about Soviet membership in GATT or the other international financial institutions as premature.
That's also why our approach to trade, based on previous experience both with the U.S.S.R. and other countries, must be on a commercial basis. Mutually beneficial, non-strategic commercial exchanges are the best way to expand Soviet participation in the international economy. . . .
We want perestroika to succeed at home and abroad because we believe that it will bring about a less aggressive Soviet Union, restrained in the use of force and less hostile to democracy. A perestroika that resulted simply in a more efficient and more capable Soviet state would indeed be a more formidable and dangerous competitor. But I do not believe that perestroika can succeed without increasing measures of free markets, free speech and institutions more accountable to the people. . . .
That means a more democratic society, more respectful of human rights and legal norms which could provide a lasting foundation for more constructive, less dangerous Soviet behavior abroad; a society that produces not su?jects who are to be acted upon but citizens who participate in policy; and a society where citizens have a say in what their government does at home and abroad. . . .

HEADLINE: Sales Far Outpace Rise Of 0.3% in Inventories

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Business sales far outpaced inventory accumulation in August, the Commerce Department said today in a report that suggested unsold goods were not piling up and the economy was in fairly strong shape.
The department said inventories edged up by three-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $789.9 billion, while sales advanced a steep 3.1 percent, to $526.8 billion. The pace in inventories was down from a nine-tenths rise in July; sales rose from a nine-tenths decline. 
The combination of sales advancing far faster than the accumulation of goods on shelves and backlots is good news for the economy. If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs.
 
No Vulnerability Seen
''Basically, the inventories do not appear to show any signs of vulnerability,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Company of Chicago. ''I've been impressed by how managements have been keeping inventories from getting seriously out of hand.''
The Commerce Department's report showed a decrease in the ratio of inventories to sales to 1.50 in August, from 1.54 in July. That means it would take one and a half months to exhaust inventories at the August pace.
Manufacturers' inventories, which represent about 45 percent of the total, were up by only three-tenths of 1 percent, while wholesalers' backlogs actually dropped by one-tenth.
 
Automobile Rise a Factor
Retailers' inventories, however, rose by seven-tenths of 1 percent, which Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York attributed in large part to a 1.6 percent automobile rise. He described the slowing pace of inventory growth as a ''mini-inventory correction'' that began last year in manufacturing and has been working its way through the other sectors.
Manufacturers' sales, on the other hand, rose 5.6 percent, followed by wholesalers' sales, up 1.5 percent. Retailers' sales increased by seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Over all, both inventories and sales were 7.1 percent above those of August 1988.

HEADLINE: Qaddafi and Mubarak Seek to Heal Rift

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi drove across 120 miles of desert from Libya to meet President Hosni Mubarak today on his first visit to Egypt in 16 years. He sought to end a longstanding feud with Cairo that ranks among the longest in the Arab world.
The two leaders met in the Egyptian Mediterranean resort of Matruh, 300 miles northwest of Cairo, pursuing a rapprochement that started at an Arab summit conference in Morocco in May after years of open hostility that led to a brief war between them in 1977.
After almost three hours of talks, however, there was no immediate announcement that the two men, divided by Egypt's 1979 peace with Israel, had agreed a restoration of formal diplomatic ties. President Mubarak said, ''I did not open this issue today.'' 
He said he would travel to the Libyan town of Tobruk on Tuesday to continue discussions with Colonel Qaddafi, who flew back to Libya tonight in an Egyptian presidential jet.
 
Bases for Cooperation
''There are many fields and bases for cooperation between Egypt and Libya, especially in economic and trade matters,'' Mr. Mubarak told Egyptian reporters. ''There was a rift between us and Libya for a long time. But I believe there is mutual agreement and water is returning to its stream,'' the Egyptian leader said, using an Arab proverb signifying normalization.
Despite Egypt's re-entry into the public conclaves of Arab politics at the Morocco summit meeting after a decade of ostracism caused by the peace with Israel, Libya and Syria have remained the last two Arab countries without embassies in Cairo.
Colonel Qaddafi told Egyptian reporters he felt he was ''among my family and my brothers'' and, after his earlier efforts to pursue a merger between Egypt and Libya, seemed finally to acknowledge that the two were distinct entities.
Western diplomats said the site of the talks enabled Colonel Qaddafi to avoid visiting the only Arab capital to act as host for an Israeli embassy. And, by keeping the talks out of Cairo, President Mubarak avoided further affront to Washington, his principal diplomatic and economic supporter, which virulently opposes the Libyan leader as a sponsor of international terrorism.
Colonel Qaddafi last set foot on Egyptian soil shortly after the 1973 Middle East war. But his relationship with President Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat, soured over issues including Egypt's resistance to a merger with Libya, Colonel Qaddafi's criticism of the way Egypt fought the 1973 war and President Sadat's growing warmth toward the United States.
 
Border War in 1977
Relations worsened as President Sadat labeled Colonel Qaddafi a madman, and hostile propaganda poured from the two capitals, leading to a five-day border war in July 1977. Egypt had earlier accused Libya of being responsible for several bomb attacks in Cairo and elsewhere in 1975 and 1976.
The Camp David accords of 1978 and the peace treaty with Israel in 1979 prompted Libya to take a leading position in the ensuing Arab boycott of Egypt. In more recent years, however, the climate has shifted. Starting in November 1987, Arab countries have gradually restored ties with Egypt, Libya's populous neighbor. And Colonel Qaddafi, unnerved by an American bombing raid on his capital in 1986 and sensing ever-deeper isolation, has sought to project more conciliatory policies.
Western diplomats said Colonel Qaddafi and President Mubarak had some converging interests. The Libyan leader seeks warmer ties with Egypt as a way of gaining respectability both in the Arab world and the West. Egypt, for its part, sees a closer relationship with Colonel Qaddafi as a form of restraint and as a possible source of badly needed income from Egyptians returning to Libya to work.
After their meeting in Morocco in May, the two leaders reopened their border, closed after the 1977 war, and permitted the resumption of regular flights.

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
Making The Best Of Winter

BYLINE: By Steven Crist

 BODY:
What little humor surrounded closing day at Belmont Park yesterday was of the sort heard among men on their way to the gallows. It won't be so bad, the horseplayers wryly told one another: after just 29 weeks at Aqueduct, a mere 1,566 races, Belmont will be running again.
The opening of Aqueduct each fall is no more avoidable than the first freezing rain of winter, or paying your taxes, and just about as popular. The track that opens tomorrow is the one New Yorkers love to hate, but if they want to play horses here for more than 23 weeks a year, they have to make the best of it. 
Actually, Aqueduct is not half as bad as most horseplayers make it out to be, and it is getting better by the year. Its continuing transformation into the permanent home of New York winter racing has meant the installation of more creature comforts every season: more work stations where bettors can spread out their Racing Forms and set up shop for the day, more big-screen televisions for watching the races.
Aqueduct, where the dominant color scheme is an icy electric blue, increasingly seems like the nation's biggest off-track betting parlor, even though the races are being held right outside the insulated doors. From December through March, many patrons never catch a glimpse of horseflesh in the flesh all day long.
In a less imperfect world, none of this would be necessary. Racing in New York would shut down around Dec. 1, the horses would go to Florida, and New Yorkers would bet on world-class racing from Gulfstream and Hialeah at OTB parlors and mini-theaters at the track. Everyone would get a rest, a change of pace and scene, and the return of racing to New York in the spring would be enlivened by anticipation and a sense of season.
Don't bet on it. New York's politicians will never surrender the revenue they extract from 52 weeks a year of live racing. Also, the increasing number of cheap horses and statebreds that populate the New York stables would be unable to earn their keep without the New York winter's high-purse, low-quality version of the sport. The Phipps and Mellon horses pay their way by winning the toney races of summer, but most outfits make their nut in the colder seasons.
Racing at Aqueduct is better than no racing at all, but it also is not what it was just a few years ago. The Breeders' Cup has diminished the importance of major fall races almost everywhere, and nowhere more so than at Aqueduct.
The N.Y.R.A. Mile on Saturday might yield a starter or two for the Breeders' Cup Sprint, but no other race in New York for the rest of this year will attract a horse who is in contention for a divisional title.
Aqueduct's biggest fall races have been stripped of their importance. The Vosburgh has of necessity been moved to Belmont and turned into a prep for the Breeders' Cup. The Remsen and the Demoiselle, which once offered a last chance for a juvenile's championship bid, now are Grade II races that attract the late-bloomers who passed the Breeders' Cup. The Ladies' Handicap, the year's last Grade I race, might once have crowned a champion filly, but now draws only those who skip the Breeders' Cup Distaff.
As for the 42-day Belmont fall meeting that ended yesterday, business dipped, as many horses disappointed as delivered, and some new names topped the jockey and trainer standings.
Daily average attendance slipped 5 percent to 10,938, and the daily average on-track betting handle fell by 7 percent to $2,573,158. Track officials blamed a downturn in the local economy and the continuing erosion of live business by offtrack and intertrack betting.
Three horses lit up the races. Easy Goer's victories in the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold Cup made him look more and more like the horse of the decade. Bayakoa's front-running Ruffian Handicap victory over the best field of fillies assembled in years proved her the sport's reigning queen. And Yankee Affair, a 7-year-old Pennsylvania gelding, stirred memories of John Henry with his Man o' War and Turf Classic triumphs.
On the downside, the two best 3-year-old fillies of the last two seasons, Open Mind and Winning Colors, both suffered dispiriting losses. No older handicap males made an impression, and the 2-year-old racing faded badly after a promising start, as Summer Suqall and Red Ransom were forced to the sidelines with injuries.
The daily racing fare picked up a bit toward the end of the stands, as higher purses began drawing runners from the Meadowlands. No trainer did better at shipping in from there than Robert Klesaris, who won his first Belmont training title by sending out 14 winners. Among the jockeys, the veteran Jerry Bailey took his first New York title by winning 32 races.
So it's off to Aqueduct, where the game will go on, and on. Not to worry: just 204 days until the first daily-double of 1990 at Belmont.

HEADLINE: Talking Business with Callahan of Greiner Engineering;
Proposals to Fix Public Works

BYLINE: By Phillip H. Wiggins

 BODY:
A recent spate of water-main breaks in New York City has provided another sign of the widespread deterioration of the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges and airports. Postponing maintenance of the country's public works has produced problems that some experts believe could cost $3.3 trillion to solve. Frank T. Callahan is president and chief executive of Greiner Engineering Inc., an 81-year-old design services company in Irving, Tex., that specializes in transportation and other public works projects. He insists that infrastructure improvements are an investment in the economy and that they should be a priority of government and business.
 
Q. Isn't this a public policy issue for the Government to resolve? Why involve business? 
 
A. Clearly, responsibility for building and maintaining the nation's public works systems rests with the Government. However, the decaying condition of this infrastructure can acutely affect economic growth and development. Studies have demonstrated that a significant correlation exists between infrastructure investment and the health of the general economy. In Los Angeles, in 1988, costs of traffic congestion for both business and commuter travelers exceeded $500 million. And by 2005, traffic delays alone will cost the nation an estimated $50 billion a year in lost wages and wasted gasoline.
 
Q. Just how pervasive is this problem?
 
A. In a word, America's infrastructure is crumbling. Of the 2.1 million miles of paved roads, more than 60 percent require some degree of renovation and more than 40 percent of the bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. At the same time, the current number of highways, bridges and airports is inadequate to cope with the demand. As a result, traffic congestion regularly occurs on 70 percent of urban highways, and airport gridlock has reached epidemic proportions.
 
Q. Why were public works projects postponed to the point of creating this crisis?
 
A. Last year, a Congressionally mandated special commission, the National Council on Public Works Improvement, issued a report that succinctly answers that question: ''Of all public services, infrastructure may be the easiest to take for granted. When it functions best, it is noticed least.'' In fact, that is what happened. In seeking ways to trim expenditures from the budget, the Government reduced the annual increase in infrastructure spending from 4.5 percent in the 1961 to 1970 period to about eight-tenths of a percent between 1981 and 1987.
 
Q. Since fiscal retrenchment remains in force, where will the money come from?
 
A. Not only have budgetary constraints reduced funds available for public works projects, but the effort to shrink the deficit has prompted the Federal Government to withhold about $29 billion in user-paid revenues that are supposed to be reinvested in infrastructure projects like highway redevelopment. Releasing these revenues would be a good first step. However, the only conceivable way to really rebuild America's infrastructure is through a concerted program from all levels of government.
 
Q. What would such a multilevel government commitment involve?
 
A. There are any number of specific ideas being proposed and several bills are currently being debated in Congress. One recommendation calls for the creation of a Federal infrastructure bank to better manage the use of public works funds. Another proposal would make state and local governments responsible for the design and construction of all projects and limit the Federal role to co-financing the projects with the states and localities.
 
Q. Relieving urban traffic congestion would seem to require additional infrastructure building, not just repairing what exists. How can this be accomplished, given urban land-use restrictions and space limitations?
 
A. Our design engineering studies indicate many bottlenecks at interchanges between interstates and secondary traffic arteries. One promising solution is the ''urban interchange,'' a design configuration built within an existing right-of-way to improve traffic flow. In the case of airports, part of the solution requires improved air-traffic control, gate-capacity expansions and landing systems.

After 'Eleni,' Life of a Woman's Children in America

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

A Place for Us
By Nicholas Gage
419 pages. Houghton Mifflin Company.
$19.95.
In his critically acclaimed book ''Eleni'' (1983), Nicholas Gage gave us a chilling account of his mother's arrest, torture and execution by Communist guerrillas in the Greek civil war in 1948. Eleni Gatzoyiannis's brave defiance of the guerrillas - who were rounding up young people to send them to re-education camps in Eastern Europe - led to her own death, but she succeeded in winning her children the chance to begin a new life abroad. Mr. Gage, then 9 years old, and three of his sisters were sent to America the next year to live with their father, who had emigrated there many years earlier. It is their story that Mr. Gage now proposes to tell in ''A Place for Us.'' 
Whereas ''Eleni'' reverberated with the heightened drama of a Greek tragedy - the book concluded with Mr. Gage in the role of Orestes, tracking down his mother's murderers, in a quest for justice and revenge - ''A Place for Us'' tells a gentler if no less moving story. It is the familiar story of a young boy's coming of age, his passage through the assorted rites of childhood and adolescence, his discovery of sex, romance and vocation. At the same time, it is the story of an immigrant family struggling to reconcile the traditions of the Old World with the freedoms of the new, the ghosts of the past with the possibilities of the future.
When Mr. Gage and his sisters arrive at their father's home in Worcester, Mass., they experience a severe case of culture shock. After the impoverished conditions of their isolated village, after the deprivations of a refugee camp, the prospect of living in a house - a real house with linoleum floors, an indoor bathroom and a kitchen full of technological marvels - seems like an impossible dream. It's like living in a palace, ''good enough for a king.''
Yet at the same time, the young Mr. Gage realizes that he has profoundly ambivalent feelings toward the father he has just met. He reasons that his mother might still be alive if his father had not procrastinated about bringing them all to the States instead of continuing to live as a bachelor who mailed his paychecks home. If his father had really loved them, they might still be a unified family.
Added to these feelings of anger and resentment is the disappointment Mr. Gage and his sisters experience on learning that their father is not the successful businessman they imagined but an unemployed short-order cook with quickly mounting debts. After accompanying his father on a fruitless round of job interviews, Nick wonders how he will ever manage to support the family, how they will ever manage to survive in this expensive and confusing new country.
There are further difficulties ahead: because they do not speak English, Nick and his sister Fontini are placed in a class for retarded children; they are subjected to the usual playground taunts suffered by newcomers and outsiders; another sister, Olga, undergoes a disfiguring operation for a goiter. Yet gradually, the family's luck begins to change. Mr. Gage's father gets a job as a cook at a classy restaurant; the family learns that Glykeria - a fourth sister, who had been spirited away by the Communist guerrillas - has managed to escape; and Nick, who has become an ardent movie buff, discovers that his imitations of Bogart, Brando and Cagney have won him new popularity at school.
A brief flirtation with delinquency ends when he exchanges Cagney and Rocky Marciano as role models for Paul Muni. He begins to do well at school, determines to go on to college and settles on journalism as a career - a career that will eventually take him back to Athens as a bureau chief for The New York Times, a career that will give him the tools to investigate his mother's murder.
Given the strict customs governing the behavior of women in Greece, Mr. Gage's sisters have a considerably more difficult time adapting to life in America. Having been raised in a world of arranged marriages, a world in which girls are virtually enjoined from speaking to boys, they are perplexed, even dismayed, by a country in which teen-agers casually dance with each other and make out in cars. In due course, however, each one finds a husband and starts a family of her own.
Olga, strict and tradition-minded, marries a man her father has found for her in Greece: she accepts the choice as a fait accompli, and falls in love with him on sight. The strong-willed Kanta, who has become a modern career woman, returns to Greece to look for a mate, meets the nephew of a cousin's husband, and after warning him about the hardships of earning a living in America, pledges to marry him upon his arrival in the States. Glykeria falls in love with a poor young immigrant and decides -against her father's advice - to wait for him to earn enough money to support her. And the shy, melancholy Fontini marries a man from Philadelphia and moves there, where she is free ''at last of the stultifying atmosphere of Worcester and the overbearing presence of her siblings.''
Actually, life in the Gatzoyianni home rarely seems stultifying; rather it is portrayed as tumultuous, intense, passionate, ''like life in the Greek village, where extended families live next to each other: a mixture of grandparents and babies, newlyweds, aunts and uncles.''
Because the early family scenes in ''A Place for Us'' are so vividly written, some of the later portions of the book, dealing with the author's adventures in college and graduate school, feel pallid in comparison. Indeed it is Mr. Gage's affectionate but unsentimental portraits of his family (from his tyrannical and fiercely parsimonious grandfather to his spirited, bickering sisters) combined with his careful delineation of the spiritual geometry connecting one generation to the next that lend this volume the real-life power of a memoir, the emotional density of a novel.

'Some Girls' and Teen-Age Pregnancy

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
''Intercom,'' the soberly inclined PBS series, introduces us tonight to a few of the adolescents who give West Virginia one of the nation's highest rates of unplanned teen-age pregnancy. ''Some Girls,'' at 11:30 P.M. on Channel 13, treats its five subjects as individuals rather than as data, helping us to understand why they are likely to have babies before they have husbands.
Attention is focused on the Youth Health Service in Elkins, a town in the north-central part of the state, with its high unemployment and cultural remoteness. The agency tries to prevent teen-age pregnancies, but failing that, concentrates on making sure that the babies are born healthy and that their parents know how to care for them. 
We first meet 14-year-old Shannon, whose broken home and truancy make her a candidate for early pregnancy. Sympathetic counseling helps her to improve her grades and her feelings about herself (''Last year,'' she says, ''I thought I was the ugliest person in the whole school'') and to give her the confidence to say no to an importuning boyfriend.
''Low self-esteem,'' in the counselors' favored phrase, is common among adolescents who find they can become popular and even enjoy something resembling love if they are willing to say yes to sex. A 15-year-old named Michelle says, ''It was like, everybody's doing it, and I thought I've got to have sex or I'm going to be the oddball.'' Coming from a family of alcoholics, Michelle had her own bouts with alcohol and drugs. One drug she did not try was a birth control pill. When her boyfriend learned she was pregnant, he said so long, a not uncommon reaction. At Youth Health Services, she found help in getting off drugs and alcohol and in having her baby, but when we leave her, she is pregnant again.
Most teen-age mothers, we are told, have a second child before they are 20. So it is with Carla, a school dropout who cannot find a job. Asked, with no hint of pressure, whether she would consider an abortion, she says, ''That's murder.'' Carla's counselor reports that she is turning out to be a good mother: ''If nothing else, she has done this thing very well.''
For all their problems, the girls profiled here are a hopeful group; they have sought help and seem to be getting it from counselors who talk to them frankly about their predicaments without making them feel like felons. In a switch from most documentaries on such subjects, all the clients here are white and several of the counselors are black. The implicit and important message is that teen-age pregnancy has less to do with race than with the conditions of life.
The true subject of ''Some Girls,'' produced by Mark Samels, is Youth Health Services. We come to appreciate the compassionate yet straightforward approach of the counselors and their efforts to give these young women, with their troubled pasts and troubling futures, a feeling that they are not alone and that even if they cannot manage to avoid getting pregnant, they can, with a little help, still be good mothers.

HEADLINE: Governors Ignored Poverty's Role in Education

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I would give the education summit organized in Charlottesville, Va., by our political leadership (news story, Sept. 29) A for its achievements in schooling. But I'd give it a C or maybe a D- for its contribution to education.
Like the school reform movement in the United States, the President and governors operate on the assumptions that children and youth get their education in schools, and that fixing schools will fix young people. Nothing could be further from reality. The most significant educational institution in the lives of all of us, particularly in our early years, is the family. Without families that work well, kids show up in schools lacking the capacity to learn. Restructuring and otherwise adjusting schools to serve children who are delivered for repairs from neighborhoods and homes that have failed them is useful, but not sufficient. 
Poor parents love their kids as much as rich parents, maybe more because they experience deprivation early and long. But a family in poverty has a very hard time delivering a child to school with the same prospects as children from middle-class families, and Head Start is not an infallible safety net. More than any other source, poverty limits the lives of our young.
You go partway to recognizing this issue in ''Little Kids'' (editorial, Sept. 30) when you back Gov. Bill Clinton's call for ''a comprehensive development policy for children under 5.'' But both you and the Governor should think of more direct attacks on poverty among families with children.
Poverty gnaws at the capacity of families to be families. The high correlation of poverty with behavior we deplore among the young (drugs, dropping out, delinquency, irresponsible sex) is no coincidence.
We are busy designing programs to deal with each of these behaviors, but we are much less busy finding ways to address poverty. We treat the symptoms and ignore the disease -mainly because of the expense of dealing with it. It is interesting that most countries the United States competes with economically do more than we to provide decent lives for their poor.
Head Start and health and nutrition programs are valuable but insufficient. Poverty among our children is growing: one out of seven were poor in 1969, one out of five today, one out of four predicted for the year 2000.
The bipartisan report of Representative George Miller's Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families issued Oct. 2 underlines these issues, which the Children's Defense Fund has highlighted for years.
In the 1930's, our country responded to inhuman conditions among our older citizens with the Social Security Act, which moved toward decent lives for the aging. We now need equally generous thinking about decent lives for the young. New strategies are required for both preschoolers and teen-agers.
The Family Support Act, now coming into operation, offers hope on that front. Its success will depend on matching funds from states for linking welfare and educational endeavors, as well as on adequate Federal support. The least the governors could do is to call for the funds to make this new legislation work by creating an alliance between educators and human service providers, thus linking welfare and schooling to attack poverty.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economists Are Ready to Advise the Soviets

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
American officials said today that they were prepared to advise the Soviet Union on how to revive its stagnant economy by decontrolling prices, cutting Government subsidies, encouraging private enterprise and permitting the exchange of rubles for gold and foreign currencies.
Following up on an offer by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the officials said they were also encouraging private American economists to provide advice.
Mr. Baker said it was not appropriate for United States officials to ''offer detailed prescriptions to the Soviets.'' But an aide to Mr. Baker said Soviet leaders ''keep pressing'' for American advice on such questions as how to write a bankruptcy law, how to shut down unprofitable enterprises, how to set up a stock exchange, how to protect property rights, how to encourage private farming, how to reward employees for superior work and whether to tolerate more unemployment. 
The Soviets are receiving so much American advice that they could be confused by conflicting recommendations. ''Have you ever met two economists agreeing with each other?'' asked Valery P. Sorokin, the economic counselor at the Soviet Embassy here.
 
'Beware of Visiting Americans'
On a recent visit to Moscow, Marshall I. Goldman, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, warned the Soviets, ''Beware of visiting Americans giving you advice,'' because ''every American economist rides his own hobbyhorse.''
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was in Moscow last week, lecturing on the role of banks in a market economy, and Wayne D. Angell, another member of the board, visited the Soviet Union last month.
Martin S. Feldstein, a chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, was there in August. Georgy S. Markosov, a political counselor at the Soviet Embassy, said he spoke often to ''my very good friend'' Jude Wanniski, an apostle of supply-side economics who fortified President Ronald Reagan's commitment to that philosophy.
Increasingly, Western economists say the Soviets cannot muddle through with a gradual approach but must rapidly and abruptly make many changes. ''A cold-turkey strategy is the best approach,'' said Ed A. Hewett, an economist at the Brookings Institution who visited Moscow earlier this month.
American economists agree that the Soviet Union needs to give a bigger role to private enterprise and encourage the profit motive, but they disagree on the radical steps needed to move from a centralized socialist command economy toward a market economy. Most believe that the necessary steps will unleash fierce inflationary pressures once prices are decontrolled and government subsidies curtailed.
 
Making Currency Convertible
Mr. Wanniski and Mr. Angell contend that the Soviets should, as a first step, define the value of the ruble in terms of gold, so rubles could be freely bought and sold in exchange for gold or foreign currency. The ruble, they said, would then have a predictable value throughout the Soviet Union and in other countries. Soviet authorities have discussed making the ruble fully convertible for decades but have never taken practical steps toward that end.
At present, Mr. Wanniski said, ''the ruble has a different meaning on every street corner in the Soviet Union,'' and its value varies when people are buying food, shelter and other items because the Kremlin dictates prices with little regard for supply and demand.
Mr. Baker spoke favorably of a gold-convertible ruble when he testified before the Senate Finance Committee two weeks ago. ''The sizable Soviet gold stocks might be used to back the value of the ruble or Government bonds,'' he said. ''Since the Soviets are major gold producers, they could use future gold production to regulate the money supply.''
However, the new Soviet Finance Minister, Valentin S. Pavlov, said there were big risks in going immediately to a convertible ruble. ''This is a spectacular proposal,'' he said in an interview with a Soviet magazine. ''It is more suitable for teaching a novice how to swim: Push him out of a boat at a deep spot, and if he does not drown he will swim. In these cases I prefer to measure the depth and height of a jump and to prepare life-saving devices.''
Prof. Wassily Leontief of New York University, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1973, said that ''it's not very practical'' to make rubles convertible into gold. ''The number of rubles stashed away under mattresses is huge,'' he said. ''If you start to sell gold for rubles, everybody will want it. You won't have enough gold.'' Reliable Statistics Needed Officials at the Commerce Department and the Labor Department said they had begun discussions with Soviet officials about how to collect data and produce reliable statistics on gross national product, retail sales and consumer prices.
Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics; Robert P. Parker, associate director of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Barbara Boyle Torrey, chief of the Census Bureau's Center for International Research, all said they had had recent discussions with Soviet officials.
Mrs. Norwood said it would be difficult to create a consumer price index for the Soviet Union because many consumer goods were in short supply. Mr. Parker said Soviet estimates of gross national product were deficient by Western standards because they counted the value of goods but not of services.
Several American officials said Soviet statistics were biased because managers of Soviet enterprises reported production as conforming to Government targets even when it fell short. In addition, they said, Soviet statistics on imports, exports and foreign debt were flawed by uncertainty about the value of the ruble.
Soviet officials say they would permit some businesses to go bankrupt, but Mr. Hewett said, ''Until you change the Soviet price system, it is hard to know which enterprises should go bankrupt.'' An inefficient factory might look profitable because it is obtaining oil at artificially low prices, he said, and an efficient coal mine might look unprofitable if coal prices are kept low by Government decree.
The Soviet economy is plagued with shortages of consumer goods like soap, sugar, shoes and gasoline. Prof. Nikolai P. Shmelev, a Soviet economist, told American officials last month that Moscow must alleviate those shortages before it could carry out any American recommendations. ''Before you can have price reform, you have to figure out a way to increase the supply of consumer goods in the market,'' he said.
American officials say a rational system of prices would achieve that goal. If prices were set by the market rather than by Kremlin decrees, Mr. Baker said, they would ''signal the scarcity of goods and create incentives for production.''

HEADLINE: Help Who?

 BODY:
We are prepared to provide technical assistance in certain areas of Soviet economic reform. . . . We want perestroika to succeed. . . . Such words would have been unutterable in official Washington even a few months ago. Such thoughts would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. To Ronald Reagan, the Soviet Union was the evil empire. To Americans generally, the U.S.S.R. remained the implacable enemy. 
That Secretary of State James Baker can now say these words, out of American self-interest, signals a welcome, monumental moment in the history of the cold war and of the Bush Administration.
Probably not since World War II, when U.S. cargo ships carried lend-lease aid to Murmansk and Stalin was still old ''Uncle Joe,'' have American officials spoken so openly in support of a Soviet leader. And at no time since taking office has this Administration so clearly acknowledged the significance of Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to transform his economy and society.
In marked contrast to the dangers perceived by others in the Administration, Mr. Baker looks upon perestroika as a ''historic opportunity.'' He offers few specifics but his tone is reassuringly right.
The Administration's hesitancy till now has inspired puzzlement, even alarm. The White House seemed unable to comprehend the vast transformation in the Soviet Union, even conveying the impression that it wanted Mr. Gorbachev to fail. First the Administration spokesmen said Mr. Gorbachev wasn't serious; then that he wouldn't last; finally that his reforms posed risks to the U.S.
President Bush set the earlier tone in four speeches this spring. Instead of welcoming the changes in Moscow and reciprocating, he adopted a ''show-me'' stance. Saying it was time to move ''beyond containment'' to ''integration of the Soviet Union into the community of nations,'' Mr. Bush insisted the new relationship had to be ''earned.''
The deputy national security adviser, Robert Gates, wondered whether the Soviet changes were fundamental and irreversible. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted Mr. Gorbachev would fall. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger warned of ''the danger that change in the East will prove too destabilizing to be sustained'' and disparaged calls for ''measures to insure the success of Gorbachev's reforms.''
Now, in one strong speech, Mr. Baker has moved to reassure the Soviets that the Administration recognizes its own interest in their reforms and to enlist Americans to act on that recognition.
Mr. Baker's offer of technical assistance is modest, yet to be spelled out. Even so, there's nothing presumptuous about this help. The U.S. may not have an answer to the Communists' problem, how to move from a command economy to a demand economy. But it can share its abundant experience with markets.
Soviet and U.S. economists already exchange ideas, as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, did in Moscow last week. Economics departments and business schools are welcoming Soviet students and managers. Perhaps Washington can help with a new version of Fulbright (why not call them Kennan?) grants. The Jackson-Vanik amendment awaits repeal, to open trade.
But before the Administration finally starts doing the right thing, it's worth applauding Mr. Baker's willingness, finally, to say the right thing:
We want perestroika to succeed.

HEADLINE: Unnecessary, or Worse, for Airlines

 BODY:
Should the public worry about attempted airline takeovers, like Donald Trump's aborted bid for American Airlines? Such takeovers inevitably saddle new management with huge debt. That, in turn, raises fears that the company will go bankrupt or else skimp on safety.
Congress seems to think the fears are justified. A Senate committee bill would empower the Secretary of Transportation to block airline takeovers for reasons of safety. A House bill scheduled for committee vote today would also enable the secretary to block takeovers that sap an airline's competitive strength. Neither measure is necessary. The Senate bill might help calm fears about safety. But the House bill gives the secretary powers best left to the market. 
The gigantic debt involved in the attempted takeovers raises two concerns. First, airlines might reduce maintenance. But airline safety is tightly regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, which sets standards so high that minor reductions in maintenance do not threaten public safety.
Second, debt burdens could leave airlines vulnerable to economic recession. Unable to pay its creditors, an airline might declare bankruptcy or be forced to sell off some assets. But bankruptcy or asset sales do not make the planes, gates or air routes disappear. Another airline will fill in, causing only temporary disruption. Nor is new regulation needed. Deregulation has worked. Careful studies by Steven Morrison and Clifford Winston at the Brookings Institution show that deregulation has brought the public lower fares, increased safety, greater convenience - and even more competition. Only eight carriers dominate the industry nationwide. But on individual routes - where it matters - the average number of effective competitors has increased since 1978.
In the last two years, some gains have been lost. Competition has fallen; fares have risen. But the trend is too new to be worrisome.
Both bills would make a useful administrative change. The Transportation Secretary may now protect the public from an unfit carrier by revoking its certificate - but only after a takeover is complete. That's a Draconian process. The Senate and House bills require approval before an airline reorganizes. The constructive result would be negotiation instead of protracted battle.
The public wouldn't suffer from the Senate bill. The House bill, however, requires the secretary to determine whether a restructured airline would be competitive. This requirement substitutes administrative fiat for market discipline. The White House correctly opposes the bill, against the wishes of its Transportation Secretary. Such control invites abuse and a return to the regulatory stranglehold of yesteryear. AMRd(American Airlines)

HEADLINE: Capital Gains Cut Would Further Roil Markets;
I.R.A., but Different

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Much ado is expressed over the cost of the proposed reinstatement of the tax deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts. I suggest that the I.R.A. will not cost the Treasury a cent if a little creative thought is applied.
The first premise of my proposal is that, although tax revenues will decrease in the year of the I.R.A. contribution, those taxes materialize in the year of the I.R.A. withdrawal. Actually, taxes probably will be higher because the appreciation on the investment will also be taxable. Also, cynicism causes me to believe that tax rates will again creep up, as they always have, yielding even higher Treasury revenues. 
What I propose is that the Treasury not wait 20 years to ''book'' its tax revenues on I.R.A. contributions and withdrawals. Rather, funds should be transferred to the Treasury from Federal borrowings equal to the taxes that would have been paid. The source of the borrowed funds is simple: new I.R.A.'s will have to be invested in securities similar to Series E bonds.
Rather than losing these funds into the economy for 20 years, the Treasury will receive these funds now. If $100 billion were invested in I.R.A.'s, assuming a 28 percent tax rate, $28 billion would be ''booked'' as tax revenues. The Treasury's borrowing from foreign investors would decline by $100 billion because the I.R.A.'s have been invested in Treasury securities. The large I.R.A. inflow will finance the deficit to a greater extent from American sources than from the Japanese.
One problem relating to the old I.R.A. deduction was that it allowed liberal investment choices. Brokerage houses promoted real estate, equipment leasing, and oil and gas investments as safe places for I.R.A. dollars. Under my proposal, these funds will go to the safest haven for retirement moneys, investment in the United States Government.
The administrative cost of the I.R.A. program will also decline. Bonds would be purchased at commercial banks in the same manner as Series E bonds and would be registered in the investor's name. The I.R.A. bonds could not be traded on the securities markets; they could be redeemed only at a commercial bank. The bank would simply issue a Form 1040 at the time of redemption in case of early withdrawal. When an investor retires, the bonds could be exchanged for taxable annuities or cashed in and taxes paid in the year of redemption.
This idea seems so simple it risks the chance of getting discarded. Yet it accomplishes many positive goals: increased savings, increased funds available to the Treasury, reinstatement of a tax break to the lower income taxpayer and less dependency on foreign funds to finance our economy. And if Congress can be creative and allow the Treasury to ''book'' these tax revenues when invested in an I.R.A., tax revenues won't decrease as the Office of Management and Budget claims: arguments that tax brackets at retirement are lower can be dispelled by having a minimum tax on the withdrawal at retirement.
Individual Retirement Accounts are a good thing for the economy and especially for Americans in lower income brackets struggling to save for retirement. Congress should reinstate the I.R.A. and, if my proposal is emplaced, will reap greater benefits than now perceived.

HEADLINE: Face It, the Dollar Coin Seems Doomed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I disagree with your editorial ''Right Change for Small Change'' (Sept. 24). Abolish the penny, no; reduce production, yes. Since 1981 an average of one billion pennies have been minted monthly. At the end of last March just over 100 billion pennies were minted in 99 months. There is no need for this. The sensible solution is to cut back production by a third or to 1970 levels. 
Discontinue the half dollar? Why not? It hardly circulates except at gambling casinos. Most vending machines are not made to accept more than quarters, despite inflation. For more than a decade, less than 100 million half dollars have been minted yearly. None were struck in 1987. Half dollars belong with $2 bills.
If the Treasury and Congress took a history lesson on United States coinage, they would learn why minting a dollar coin is senseless. Since 1804 the silver dollar has never really circulated. Between 1840 and 1873 there was minimal production and acceptance. When the Bland-Allison Act was enacted in 1878 (followed by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1890), production skyrocketed only to see circulation almost nonexistent. Silver purchased under these two laws dried up in 1904 and production ceased until 1921. Then coinage resumed only to see history repeat itself. The last silver dollars were minted in 1935.
When the Eisenhower dollar began in 1971, hopes were that a dollar coin would revive itself. It was a lost cause. In 1973 the Federal Reserve faced the same situation it had with the half dollar. Except for the bicentennial coinage in 1976, production was minimal and the coin was a forgotten item. Hope that a smaller coin would succeed was behind the introduction of the Susan B. Anthony dollar, and everyone knows the rest of that story. In the last few years the mint has offered to sell Anthony dollars by the bag to reduce stockpiles.
It is true a coin will last longer than a piece of paper currency. But public acceptance cannot be ignored. In short, reduce penny production, abolish the half dollar and forget minting a dollar coin altogether.

HEADLINE: A Prosperity Agenda for the 90's

SERIES: TOMORROW'S NEW YORK: THE NEXT MAYOR - AN OCCASIONAL SERIES

BYLINE: By Roger C. Altman; Roger C. Altman is chairman of the Public Development Corporation of New York, a city agency.

 BODY:
The mayoral candidates make a lot of noise about fighting drugs and crime, but they have yet to tell us how to pay for it. With New York's economy deteriorating, we need a mayor who understands the connection between economic growth and social priorities.
New York needs a new strategy for economic development. Some of the key 1980's approaches are no longer effective. The central business district of Manhattan already is stretching city services - especially transportation, health and law enforcement - to the limit. It cannot continue as the main engine of growth. Nor can the financial services industries, whose boom is over. 
New York should revise its development agenda in three ways.
First, it should intensify its efforts outside Manhattan, where prospects are better now than at any time in the last 20 years. The securities processing, apparel and financial printing industries have taken a renewed interest in downtown Brooklyn, and this can be accelerated. The Long Island City-Hunters Point area is moving up fast, as is the Teleport-Charleston area of Staten Island.
City Hall should pick out five or six of these emerging commercial zones for further emphasis, marketing them aggressively to industry, nationally and internationally. Through tax, financing and energy incentives, the city should insure that operating costs in these zones are brought low enough to be competitive with the surrounding metropolitan region.
Second, to promote tourism, we need to rebuild the dilapidated waterfront. We have a coastline that is twice as large as that of Boston, Toronto, Philadelphia and Oakland combined. It is baffling that these cities successfully developed plans for their waterfronts while we failed. Look no further than the South Street Seaport to see the opportunity.
The next mayor must find common ground between developers and environmentalists. For instance, there is a role for commercial and residential development on Manhattan's West Side waterfront, but only to help pay for a three- or four-mile esplanade.
Third, further development of central Manhattan should proceed only with great care. Beyond the proposed 42d Street renewal, there are few Manhattan mega-projects that will improve the economy in the long run.
Central Manhattan's density is now becoming a deterrent to business. Thickening it could boomerang and drive out more jobs than new projects would generate. For example, if Donald Trump should fulfill his promise to erect the world's tallest building, or if the huge East River Landing project actually rose beside the South Street Seaport, New York could be a big loser.
So far, the candidates have mostly avoided these issues. Perhaps they can - but the city can't.

HEADLINE: Rise in Babies Hurt by Drugs Is Predicted

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
If current drug abuse patterns continue, 5 percent of all newborn babies in New York City could require admission to intensive-care wards by 1995, state health officials say.
The figure for nonwhite babies could approach 10 percent in that time.
The projections, based on neonatal intensive-care admissions data from 1983 to 1987, cover only those children admitted to neonatal wards. The total number of children born to drug-abusing mothers, officials said, is undoubtedly much higher in New York City. 
For the rest of the state, the New York State Department of Health projected that in 1995 fewer than 0.5 percent of an estimated total of 145,000 live births would be admitted to intensive-care units because of drug abuse. Officials said they did not know of any other states or cities that had made such projections.
 
Costly Care Provided
Neonatal intensive-care wards provide among the most costly, labor-intensive and advanced types of medical care. They are designed for the sickest newborns: those with extremely low birth weights or, as with many children of drug abusers, those who suffer seizures, severe respiratory problems, congenital infections and withdrawal symptoms.
''This is very much the tip of the iceberg,'' said Dr. Linda A. Randolph, director of the State Office of Public Health, referring to babies admitted to intensive-care wards. Because of drug abuse, particularly crack, she said, ''we are seeing dramatic increases in infant mortality, in congenital syphilis and in the number of AIDS-infected women who are giving birth.''
New York City Health Department officials recently estimated, based on interviews with mothers, that births to drug-abusing mothers had increased by about 3,000 percent in the last 10 years.
''Things might flatten out, but it hardly pays to argue about whether or not the projections are accurate,'' Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, the New York City Health Commissioner, said of the state study. ''We are already in a crisis in terms of our ability to provide neonatal intensive care.
''Society needs to deal with teen-age pregnancy, the crack epidemic, poverty and social justice. The implications are clear, but whether we are willing to attack this in a practical way is in question, and there are not a lot of hopeful signs.''
Robert D. Gumbs, executive director of the Health Systems Agency, a public planning group, said: ''In terms of occupancy rates, neonatal intensive-care wards in 1988 and 1989 throughout the city are running at approximately 108 percent. That is the highest occupancy rate of any area of the hospital industry, and the major reasons are substance abuse and AIDS.''
 
Rose by 20 Percent
In 1987, Mr. Gumbs said, ''we spent $300 million on approximately 15,000 discharges from neonatal intensive-care units citywide, and I know that rose by at least 20 percent last year.''
At many hospitals, neonatal intensive-care occupancy rates have soared well beyond manageable levels.
''Our nursery is chronically at 200 percent occupancy,'' said Dr. Sterling Williams, director of obstetrics at the Harlem Hospital Center. ''We have to resort to diversionary measures. If you're trying to man 17 patients with only one nurse, quality assurance become rather problematic.''
Between 1983 and 1987, according to the state report, there was a 37 percent average annual increase in drug-related admissions to neonatal intensive-care units in New York City. For whites, the average annual increase stood at 31 percent. For non-whites, admissions increased at a 39 percent annual rate on average.
 
'A Lifelong Handicap'
Beyond the extremely high cost of providing intensive care to newborns, public health experts said the rising numbers of drug-damaged children carried weighty consequences for other public services.
''If there is one phenomenon that sort of encapsulates all of the socio-economic and health-related problems we are having, it is the baby born to a substance-abusing - paticularly a crack-abusing - mother,'' said Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospital Fund, a New York City-based health-care research group and philanthropy.
''These kids become your border babies, and that is why the foster system is collapsing,'' Mr. Vladeck added. ''Even after they are out of the neonatal unit, they are likely to be heavy consumers of resources because of physical and developmental impairments, and these kids are going to be a problem for themselves and society for 40 or 50 years. This is going to be a lifelong handicap and potential cost in a great number of ways.''
Asked what could be done to address the crisis, Mr. Vladeck said: ''In terms of capacity versus the size of the problem, we are starting off way behind. We are beginning finally, however glacially, to move toward substantial expansion of drug treatment, but there absolutely has to be an emphasis on reproductive-age women.''
 
Women 'Hard to Reach'
Asked if the state and city were doing enough to face the crisis, Dr. Randolph, the state's director of public health, said: ''We are trying to increase the utilization of services on the part of the drug-addicted mother in areas like prenatal care. We know that many of these women have had late, or no, prenatal care.''
Many drug-abusing pregnant women, she added, are ''very hard to reach and are leery of coming into contact with the human services, probably out of fear of the potential for incarceration or taking chldren away from them.''
In response to complaints of a lack of programs aimed at drug abusers, Dr. Randolph allowed, ''We still do not have enough drug-treatment programs available, never mind for pregnant women.''
''We need more appropriate space -more neonatal intensive-care beds,'' said Dr. Joseph, the Health Commissioner. ''And as we get deeper into the cocaine epidemic, it will probably turn out that these kids need more intensive longer-term care than we thought. We don't have havens for mothers and babies to get well, so that means pressures will continue to grow.''

Cavazos Presses Parental Choice in Public Schools

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos came to a highly praised, innovative school district in East Harlem this week to press the Bush Administration's view that giving parents more say in choosing public schools would be a major step toward improving education.
But some of the remarks he heard from parents and local school officials Monday night and yesterday suggested that carrying out such plans, called ''parental choice'' or ''school choice,'' might be more complicated and run into more criticism than the Bush Administration thinks, particularly in poor urban neighborhoods.
For one thing, parental choice might demand more money from local, state and Federal governments than some advocates have acknowledged. Those who favor school choice, however, say it is a low-cost way to raise educational levels. 
 
One Parent Praises Results
''We've proved District 4 works,'' said Robert DeLeon, a parent whose two daughters attend one of the schools in the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood in upper Manhattan.
But Mr. DeLeon, speaking before an overflow audience Monday night in the auditorium of Intermediate School 117, asserted that the community's schools had improved ''most often not because of government support, but in spite of it.''
His statements, similar to those of several other speakers, drew heavy applause.
The speakers said that despite improvements in local schools and the plaudits they have won, they still were not getting enough money from either the Department of Education or the New York City Board of Education.
A school board spokesman said the board had supported and continued to support the district, which includes a total of 52 different kinds of schools in 20 school buildings.
Some advocates of parental choice who are closely involved with the East Harlem schools, however, said the neighborhood had largely been given the money available under Federal and local financing formulas.
 
Struggling to Save Jobs
On Monday night, several parents referred to the Education Department's rejection of the district's application for a $1.4 million Federal grant to support schools with specialized curriculums, called magnet schools. The local district board said it is now struggling to save 30 teaching and staff positions.
''The irony is that we're celebrating choice at a time when we're in a crisis in this district,'' said Ray Rivera, who has two children in the district's schools. ''Instead of increased support, we're getting less support.''
Mr. Cavazos, in remarks at the end of the session, said ''the funding issue will continue to be a major, major discussion.''
Mr. Cavazos has called parental choice the ''cornerstone'' of the Bush Adminstration's educational policy, and President Bush has called choice ''the single most promising idea'' in education today.
School choice supporters say that if parents could more freely choose schools for their children, the competition would compel schools to improve and drive bad schools ''out of business.''
 
Open Enrollment in Some States
Minnesota, Arkansas, Iowa and Nebraska already have in place statewide ''open enrollment'' plans giving parents wide discretion in choosing schools. Scores of cities around the country have for years offered magnet and alternative schools that extend options beyond neighborhood schools.
Mr. Cavazos, noting that more than 600,000 students drop out of public schools each year, said Monday night that the nation ''must find ways to address its education deficit.''
He said that the department's regional meetings on school choice rightfully began in East Harlem because it ''is one of the finest examples of how choice can improve the quality of education.''
In the early 1970's the district of 15,000 pupils ranked last in reading and mathematics scores among the city's 32 school districts.
Since then under a program that emphasizes parental involvement, a wide choice of curriculums geared to special academic situations, and staff innovation, the district's performance has risen to 16th place.
Despite their criticisms about a lack of money, the East Harlem parents and school officials unanimously praised parental choice as a way to improve schools.
 
Opposition in New Jersey
In contrast to the praise of parental choice in East Harlem, several parents with children in the Newark, N.J., schools voiced concern that the Administration's support of parental choice could hurt continued financing of programs for poor children.
Some lawmakers and educators have also questioned the Bush Administration's support for choice.
Representative Augustus Hawkins, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, said last month that he was concerned that the five regional meetings ''may be offering only one point of view on educational choice.''
Several education groups have also voiced concern about the Administration's advocacy of parental choice.
Critics have said that such a program may produce sharply negative results in some school districts, like increasing racial and economic segregation in schools.
That criticism prompted department officials to say that advocates of other school reform strategies are welcome at the meetings.
 
'Encouraged' by Comments
Ted Sanders, Under Secretary of Education, said yesterday that Federal officials were ''encouraged'' by the comments they had heard.
''We want debate among those who believe in choice and those who are skeptical of it,'' he said in a break between workshops. ''We're not looking for a single definition of choice. East Harlem is proof that there's strength in having a variety of approaches.''
Intermediate School 117, which was once a school of 2,000 students, now has different academies of about 200 students on each of its four floors. All have a basic academic course of study, but offer enhanced programs in different areas.
Mr. Cavazos's two-day visit to the school was the first of five regional meetings on parental choice planned by the administration. The other scheduled meetings are in Minneapolis-St. Paul on Oct. 23-24; Charlotte, N.C., Nov. 13-14; Denver, Nov. 16-17, and Richmond, Calif., Nov. 28-29.

2-Year College Viewed As Vital to Life in City

BYLINE: By LEE A. DANIELS

 BODY:
Urban community colleges have the potential to improve the quality of life substantially in cities and spread equality of opportunity among their residents, but they need more government money and greater coordination of effort, a new report says.
The report, by the nation's leading association of community colleges, asserts that amid the pressing social and economic problems of many inner -city neighborhoods, these two-year institutions have become ''the best hope for a generation of Americans that has virtually no other opportunity for education, training, and in some cases, economic and social survival.''
The study, ''Who Cares About the Inner City: The Community College Response to Urban America,'' maintains that improving those opportunities is crucial. It urges the Federal Government to consider creating a ''National Urban Extension Act'' to provide job-training and academic preparation for high school students. 
Dale Parnell, president of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, which produced the document, said that an urban extension act would encourage greater cooperation between city governments and community colleges.
 
A National Focus
Officials from the Federal Departments of Housing and Urban Development and Education said that while it was too early for the Bush Administration to commit itself to such a measure they do want to increase Federal support to the colleges.
''Who Cares About the Inner City,'' released Friday at a Washington news conference, is the latest example of an increasing national focus on the role of community colleges.
K. Patricia Cross, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on community colleges, said these institutions have gotten ''short shrift from the general public in terms of both their achievements and their needs.''
That has particularly hurt urban community colleges, said Ronald Temple, chairman of the committee that produced the report.
Copies may be obtained by writing to the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges, Suite 410, One Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. 20036-1176.
 
Not Winning the Battle
The document listed numerous programs that community colleges in the Bronx, Los Angeles and Miami have begun in response to community needs. But Dr. Temple said, ''We don't think we're winning the battle at all.''
Dr. Temple, president of Wayne County Community College, in Detroit, said urban colleges needed more resources to meet more costs than suburban and rural community colleges. He said these included the need to provide various kinds of financial aid, counseling, and tutorial services to students and the need to spend more money on security for the campus.
Roscoe C. Brown Jr., a committee member, said the committee has yet to complete its proposal for a new cooperative education act. But, he said, committee members envision it as the focus of a broad initiative attacking the urban crisis and drawing money from Federal departments like Education, Agriculture, Labor and Health and Human Services.
 
Why Visibility Is Rising
The nation's 1,211 community, technical and junior colleges enroll more than 5 million of the nation's 12.6 million college students. And, according to the community and junior college association, another 5 million adults annually take noncredit courses.
Recently, Dr. Cross and other education experts, brought together by the Institute for Research on Higher Education at the University of Pennsylvania, cited that figure as a major reason that community colleges are gaining more visibility.
Another reason is that most black and Hispanic college students attend community colleges. That has caused great concern among educators at both two-year and four-year colleges, since relatively few community college students go on to four-year institutions.
 
Charges Made in Book
One issue surrounding community colis whether community they have neglected their academic offerings in favor of vocational and technical courses.
That charge is made in a recent book (''The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational Opportunity in America, 1900-1985'', Oxford University Press, 1989) by Jerome Karabel and Steven Brint, sociologists at the University of California at Berkeley and at Yale University, respectively.
''We're trying to get the doors opened and have the community colleges' situation examined in ways it hasn't been before,'' Mr. Parnell said.
But despite the problems and uncertainties, Robert Zemsky, the institute's director and a professor of education at Penn, said community colleges were not undergoing a crisis. He said he sees this as a time of innovation and opportunity.

HEADLINE: A $27 Million Loan by Sotheby's Helped Alan Bond to Buy 'Irises'

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
When Vincent van Gogh's ''Irises'' was sold at auction for $53.9 million in 1987 at Sotheby's in New York, it became the world's most expensive painting. Now, nearly two years later and on the eve of a new auction season, ''Irises'' has become the center of a controversy over how works of art are promoted and sold in today's marketplace.
A major element of concern is a recent confirmation by Sotheby's that it lent the buyer of the painting, the Australian financier Alan Bond, about half of the purchase price - approximately $27 million. Sotheby's also stirred disquiet when it said it was still in control of ''Irises'' and was storing the painting in an undisclosed place until Mr. Bond finishes repaying the remainder of the purchase price.
When the magnitude of the loan was disclosed earlier this month by Michael Cross, the managing director of Dallhold Investment Ltd., a privately held company owned by Mr. Bond in Perth, Australia, some art dealers and other art specialists were highly critical. They questioned the size of the loan, its timing and the fact that the painting is not directly in the hands of its purchaser but in a secret place under Sotheby's control. 
 
An Artificial Bench Mark
What troubles critics of the transaction is that the extraordinary price paid for ''Irises,'' less than one month after the Wall Street crash on Oct. 19, 1987, fueled an atmosphere of euphoria in the art market. The price became the bench mark most often cited as proof that art was a commodity that had weathered the economic crisis.
''Every painting sold since then has been measured against it,'' said Alan E. Salz, the director of fine arts at the New York gallery of Didier Aaron, a Paris dealer. ''Maybe that wasn't a real price.''
David Tunick, a New York art dealer, agreed. ''Now there is this suspicion that it was a manipulated sale,'' he said. ''At a time when the art market has become so monetized, when people have begun to think of art as a legitimate form of investment, to see that all thrown into a specious gray area - I don't like it.''
''It's exactly like buying on margin,'' Richard L. Feigen, a New York art dealer, said. ''The problem is, there are regulations in the securities market that are not in the art market. By extending credit you are further inflating prices, which are rapidly getting out of control.''
 
'It Is the Ethic of Our Time'
But other dealers said they were not surprised when they learned ''Irises'' was sold with the kind of financing most often used in buying buildings or corporations.
''I'm not shocked,'' said Eugene V. Thaw, a New York dealer and former president of the Art Dealers Association of America. ''It is not a conservative thing to do to lend money on art. It is the ethic of our time that is encouraging living out on the edge of credit.''
Jeffrey Deitch, a New York art dealer who formerly was a vice president of Citibank in its Art Advisory Service, said, referring to Mr. Bond, ''A man of that worth can support a loan of that size.''
Mr. Deitch said financing art purchases is not new. ''At Citibank for nine years I saw many cases where people used leverage to buy works of art.''
David Bathurst, a London dealer who is the former head of Christie's, defended Sotheby's financing, saying the practice is hardly new. In a letter published on Oct. 9 in London in The Evening Standard, he wrote: ''Critics of auction house loans say they are a way of artificially pumping up prices. This is no more true than saying building societies pump up house prices when they grant mortgages.''
 
Traditional Financing Aids
Although art dealers traditionally have extended credit to clients, allowing buyers to pay for their purchases over weeks, months and, less frequently, a year or more, most do not charge interest, though they may give a discount for paying cash.
Mr. Bond's communications, brewing and real-estate empire has suffered financial setbacks recently, but Sotheby's says he has made all his payments on time. Mitchell Zuckerman, the president of Sotheby's Financial Services Inc., a subsidiary of Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of the auction house, said the unpaid balance is now ''significantly less than half of the purchase price.''
Diana D. Brooks, the president of Sotheby's Inc., the North American subsidiary of Sotheby's Holdings, denied an assertion made in the British press that Sotheby's had plans to foreclose on the van Gogh and was trying to sell it anew.
Mr. Cross, in a telephone interview from London, said: ''Mr. Bond has met all the payments due and will continue to do so. He is not in default.'' Mr. Cross said the amount still to be paid was between 10 percent and 25 percent of the purchase price. This amounts to about $13.5 million at most.
If that is the case - Sotheby's has not confirmed the figure - Mr. Bond's loan could be greatly reduced or repaid when another work he owns, Manet's ''Walk,'' is auctioned at Sotheby's on Nov. 15. ''If it sells, he will use the proceeds to reduce or completely repay the debt,'' Mr. Cross said.
 
Estimates for the Manet
Sotheby's presale estimate on the Manet from 1880 is between $10 million and $14 million - well above the $3.96 million Mr. Bond paid for it in 1983 at Christie's New York at a sale of paintings owned by the financier Paul Mellon.
Mrs. Brooks, who is a former banker at Citibank, negotiated the loan on ''Irises.'' Neither she nor Mr. Cross would disclose the interest charged on the loan to Mr. Bond. Mrs. Brooks said Sotheby's aims at 3 percentage points above the prime rate, but will sometimes charge lower or higher rates.
Mrs. Brooks and Mr. Cross disagreed on who initiated the financing talks. Mr. Cross, who went to work for Mr. Bond in May 1988, said he understood Sotheby's had suggested it. Mrs. Brooks said Mr. Bond's agent went to Sotheby's in New York two or three days before the sale ''to discuss the availability of credit terms.''
The first negotiations were conducted by Mr. Bond's representative, Neville Keating, a London dealer, who declined comment on these talks. Mrs. Brooks said he went to Sotheby's and met with David J. Nash, head of fine art sales, and asked what financing would be available.
 
Doing Business by Fax
Mr. Bond's agents handled all the presale discussions and signed an agreement in which, Mrs. Brooks said, Sotheby's stated the maximum amount it would finance. Mrs. Brooks said her first contact with Mr. Bond about the loan was a fax he sent several days after the sale, confirming the terms he had accepted. Two or three weeks after the sale, Mrs. Brooks flew to London and negotiated the actual loan. ''We reached agreement in principle,'' she said. The loan was signed later, on Dec. 7, 1987.
Mrs. Brooks said the seller of ''Irises,'' John Whitney Payson, had agreed to allow Sotheby's to offer financing under the condition that ''Sotheby's was willing to take the credit risk on whoever was involved.'' Mr. Payson was to be paid in full over six months, whether the buyer paid or not. All payments were made on time, Mr. Payson said: half was paid in December 1987 and the rest by May 1988.
Last December, Mr. Zuckerman said, after the loan was renegotiated for another year, Mr. Bond finally took possession of ''Irises.'' Then, three days before Christmas, he called a press conference in his penthouse office in Perth where the painting hung, to announce he was the mystery buyer.
The yearlong delay, Mr. Cross said, was because Mr. Bond's new office was under construction until then. ''Now it's a fortress on the top of the building,'' he said.
''Irises'' remained in Mr. Bond's office from last December through June, when it traveled to museums in five Australian cities. In mid-September, Sotheby's placed the painting in storage.
 
Differences Over Access
''We have unlimited access to it,'' Mr. Cross said. ''But we cannot move it without Sotheby's consent.'' He cited security problems at Mr. Bond's office as the reason why the painting was put into storage.
''Unlimited goes too far,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. ''They have the right to inspect the painting. If they wanted to change the location of the painting our consent would be required.''
Financing of art purchases, a phenomenon of the 1980's, is not done by major banks.
''We lend against art that collectors already own,'' said Kevin V. Buchanan, a Citibank vice president in its Art Advisory Sevice. ''If they have already bought an artwork, we will give a loan on it as collateral. But we will not give a 'mortgage' on artworks that they wish to buy.'' Chase Manhattan makes similar loans.
Christie's, the London-based auction house and Sotheby's major rival, says it does not make loans to buyers, but assists clients who wish to seek financing elsewhere. In addition, the availability of financing arranged through a seller is announced for the first time in a Christie's catalogue for the Nov. 7 sale of contemporary art from the Robert B. Mayer collection.
 
Extended Terms at Christie's
Christopher Burge, the president of Christie's in the United States, said the largest Christie's sale on which there was extended terms was Monet's ''Seashore at Trouville,'' which was auctioned a year ago in New York for $10.78 million. In that sale the consignor agreed to delayed payment of ''less than 90 days,'' Mr. Burge said.
Christopher M. Davidge, the managing director of Christie's International, said Christie's viewed its role as an agent, not as a banker. ''Some time ago we suggested to the Office of Fair Trading in London and the Department of Consumer Affairs in New York that they should look into this matter of financing,'' he said. ''Neither seemed very interested and we were somewhat surprised.''
''We have reviewed the selling of 'Irises' to Mr. Bond by Sotheby's and find no violations of the auction house rules and regulations,'' said Gary Walker, the public affairs director of the Consumer Affairs Department.
Mrs. Brooks said she has arranged financing for clients since shortly after she joined Sotheby's in 1979. In 1988, Sotheby's broadened its financing of art purchases in a formal program, operated by Sotheby's Financial Services.
Mrs. Brooks said that one other potential bidder on ''Irises'' asked in advance of the sale for financing. ''But he never got into the bidding,'' she said.
Asked whether Sotheby's has attempted to sell ''Irises'' since Mr. Bond bought it, Mrs. Brooks said: ''We have been approached by dealers, lawyers, bankers and others asking if 'Irises' is for sale. Technically it is not for sale. If they are interested in making an offer, we tell them we will put them in touch with Mr. Bond's representatives.''

HEADLINE: UAL's Share Price Drops $24.875, to $198

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Stock in the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, fell another $24.875 yesterday, to $198, as speculators and option traders sold their shares, uncertainty continued about the financing for a buyout of the airline and the machinists' union renewed its efforts to block such a deal.
An avalanche of 2.82 million shares of UAL stock, 13 percent of the total outstanding, changed hands as some professional takeover speculators sold shares frantically to cut their losses and repay debts while other arbitragers bought heavily in hopes that the nation's second-largest carrier may yet be sold. UAL was the fourth-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.
UAL stock had closed last Thursday at $285.25, and the many arbitragers who together hold nearly a third of UAL's 21.6 million outstanding shares have watched the value of their stakes drop by about $500 million in three trading days. 
Marvin Davis, the wealthy California investor, last night withdrew his $300-a-share offer for UAL. He said, however, that he was still interested in acquiring the company.
Citibank officially confirmed yesterday that it had received enough expressions of interest from other banks to finance a proposed buyout of the airline by its pilots and management together with British Airways.
But terms of the proposed financing were not disclosed, and it was not certain whether the package would be acceptable either to UAL's board or to the parties trying to buy UAL.
The buyout group, organized as the Airline Acquisition Corporation, announced on Friday that its inability to attract financing was preventing it from completing its $300-a-share bid, worth a total of $6.75 billion. The announcement was widely viewed as the cause of a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday.
The master executive council of the United pilots' union was scheduled to begin a regularly scheduled quarterly meeting at 5 P.M. yesterday, said a union official who asked not to be identified. The meeting's agenda called for the union's financial advisers to begin the meeting with a presentation on the proposed takeover, he said.
 
No Formal Agreement
Although Japanese news agencies have been predicting a $250-a-share cash bid, the pilots have not even discussed whether that is a reasonable price, nor has any formal agreement been reached, the union official said.
American bank officials said Citibank had not been promoting the deal widely in this country and voiced skepticism that the money could be raised quickly. Citibank's reported moves to increase the fees and interest rates on the lending have not addressed the questions of whether UAL has enough assets to insure continued debt payments during an economic downturn, one top United States banker said.
But news agencies in Japan have reported growing optimism that large Japanese banks may participate in the lending.
Traders said the stock fell yesterday partly because investors were worried that the machinists' renewed opposition to a buyout of their employer might make the bid's financing more difficult to obtain.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers yesterday called on the UAL board to resign and asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate a takeover bid by United's pilots and management, together with British Airways P.L.C.
The union sent a letter to the S.E.C., requesting an investigation of whether the buyout group had been in contact with Mr. Davis, who started the current battle for control of United with a bid on Aug. 7. The machinists' group sent a letter to Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman and chief executive of UAL, demanding his resignation and those of the other directors on the ground that the company's leadership had ''betrayed the trust and confidence'' of United employees.
Mr. Davis, UAL and the S.E.C. declined to comment on the machinists' letter. Mr. Wolf issued a statement in which he refered to the machinist group's call for resignations as ''divisive and uncalled for.''
Mr. Wolf said work continued ''toward a revised proposal for majority employee ownership.''
John F. Peterpaul, the general vice president of the machinists' association who signed both letters, said the union was suspicious of how the proposed buyout by the Airline Acquisition Corporation was put together. ''We see something here that we don't like the looks of, and we're asking Government agencies to investigate,'' he said in an interview.
In addition, a person close to the machinists said the union would send a letter later this week to the Internal Revenue Service requesting another investigation. The letter will criticize the Airline Acquisition Corporation's plan for employees to hold only common stock while British Airways would hold preferred stock, a claim on company assets that would take precedence over common stock in any bankruptcy, the person said.
Mr. Peterpaul declined to comment on the union's plans.
But a partner of a major New York law firm with extensive experience in corporate takeovers said that not one of the union's actions was likely to carry much legal weight, although they may scare some bankers.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends With Drop Of 18.65

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
After a turbulent morning that saw share prices briefly plunge, the stock market closed yesterday with moderate losses.
Early in the day, trading was halted in shares of the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, which is the stock that touched off the market's 190-point tumble on Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 30 points, then gained it all back in a 20-minute period shortly after 11 A.M. At its low, the market was down more than 60 points.
Share prices were lower all day, reflecting in part a disappointing report on the United States trade balance. That also sent bond prices down and interest rates up, further depressing stock traders. 
 
Declines Outpace Advances
The Dow ended the day down 18.65 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 2,638.73. Declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2, with 931 issues down in price and 658 higher.
On Friday, the Dow plunged by 190.58 points, reviving memories of the 1987 crash, which took place two years ago tomorrow. But the market rose by 88.12 points on Monday.
''For the time being, I think we've seen the worst,'' said Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
Volume on the Big Board came to 224.1 million shares, a figure higher than normal but down sharply from the 416.3 million shares traded on Monday. That turnover was the largest since the week of the 1987 crash.
 
Prices Higher in Tokyo
Share price movements in the United States have rippled through the world this week, with markets in Asia and Europe falling on Monday, in response to the heavy American selling late Friday, and rising yesterday following the United States gains on Monday. In late morning trading today in Tokyo, share prices rose despite yesterday's decline in the United States. An hour before the close of morning trading, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks was up 118.14 points, to 35,114.22.
As the New York Stock Exchange prepared to begin trading yesterday, John J. Phelan Jr., its chairman, said in an interview that the expectation from reports on orders coming into the system was that the opening would be ''basically flat.'' But the trade figure, released an hour before the market opened, provoked more selling than had been expected. The report said the trade deficit in August was $10.8 billion as imports rose to a record $41.2 billion and exports slipped. The deficit was greater than expected and the highest since December.
The relatively moderate decline at the final bell in many ways belied the frenetic morning activity. The early mood of the market was fragile with the Dow off 30 points at one moment, off 60 the next, and then down only 30 again.
UAL plunged 24 7/8, to 198, amid speculation that Japanese banks might be unwilling to help finance the proposed management-pilot buyout of UAL despite a plan by Citicorp, the lead banker, to sweeten the terms being offered to the banks. The temporary trading halt in UAL was caused by an imbalance of sell orders, evidently brought on by margin calls - which require shareowners who bought stock with borrowed money to come up with more cash or sell their shares - and by rumors that some speculators who owned the stock were being forced to liquidate their positions. UAL has fallen 81 3/4 points, or 29 percent, over the last two days.
 
Smaller Companies Down
While shares in large companies have gyrated this week, stocks of smaller companies have moved down consistently. The American Stock Exchange's market value index dropped 1.25, to 375.16, for its fifth consecutive decline. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index slipped by 1.05, to 459.93.
There was general relief on Monday when the Dow rallied after Friday's steep drop following the announcement of problems in financing the proposed UAL buyout at $300 a share, and much of that enthusiasm survived yesterday's decline.
Mr. Grennan, of Shearson Lehman, said that while a certain amount of nervousness and apprehension existed among investors, especially small ones, there also was confidence that the Federal Reserve would step in and prevent an extremely serious disruption in the market. On Saturday, a top official of the Fed said that the nation's central bank would meet any sudden demands for money that might result from the market's steep drop the day before.
 
Rally Predicted
A money manager, James Kalil Sr., president of Compu-Val Investments Inc. of Wilmington, Del., said he thought a rally would come soon.
''The latest sharp and short stock market declines appear to be replacing the traditional, prolonged bear market,'' he added. ''I'm optimistic that when this latest series of dramatic sharp downward swings ends, they will be followed by a sustained rise which will ultimately challange previous highs.''
But some analysts thought that the relief was not completely justified. ''There are too many Pollyannas around,'' said Harry Laubscher, an analyst at Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day. ''There should be more pessimism.''
The Dow Jones transportation average plunged 49.96 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,254.27, with the decline in UAL accounting for almost three-quarters of the fall.
 
Airline Problems Cited
William M. Lefevre, investment strategist at Advest Inc., said that some of the market's problems were tied to traders being forced to raise cash to cover losses from UAL and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, which also fell after Donald J. Trump withdrew a takeover offer. Yesterday, AMR dropped another 3 1/4 points, to 73 1/4, after sliding 22 1/8 points on Monday.
''The tendency is to sell better-quality stocks and keep the lesser-quality issues,'' he said. ''It's apparent that the bulk of the problem we are experiencing now continues to come from speculation in a few large airline companies.'' He added that ''after you've had a whack like Friday and then a recovery, the market usually tries to test its previous low.''
Broader indexes than the Dow also retreated widely, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 1.69 points, to 341.16, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index 0.87 point lower at 188.89.
Procter & Gamble climbed 3 3/8, to 127. Analysts said they expected the company to show strong results in its first fiscal quarter in the range of $2.71 to $2.79 a share, up from $2.36 a share a year earlier.
Among other major stocks, I.B.M. dropped 3/4, to 102 1/4; A.T.&T. slipped 3/4, to 42 1/4; Bristol-Myers was off 1/2, to 51 3/8; General Electric was unchanged at 56 1/2, and Upjohn rose 1 1/2, to 39.
Chase Manhattan fell 1/8, to 40, after trading as low as 39 1/2. Late Monday, the bank announced that a new issue of 14 million shares was being priced at 40 1/8.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widened by Import Surge

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit grew sharply in August, to $10.8 billion, as imports surged to a record and exports showed a small decline, the Commerce Department reported today.
This was the biggest deficit since December, and considerably higher than analysts had expected. But for various reasons it was not clear how serious a deterioration in trade the figures represented or what they said about the state of the economy.
Private economists tended to avoid expressions of alarm and generally accepted the view of Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, a leading Administration voice on trade. 
''While the trade deficit number for August was disappointing after two very good months,'' he said in a written statement, ''we believe that monthly data are subject to wide fluctuations and must be used cautiously.'' He added that the deficit was still about 7 percent lower this year than for the first eight months of 1988 despite a slowing in export growth.
The report sent the dollar down initially and appeared to contribute to a drop in stock prices. But the dollar rebounded as traders began to focus on the stock market. And there, after early declines seesawing between 30 and 60 points, the Dow Jones industrial average revived to end with an 18.65-point drop.
Various economists studying the latest trade data, which are published with a greater lag than most other indicators, cited reasons for their relative equanimity despite a $2.6 billion one-month jump in the deficit.
''People shouldn't be overly alarmed,'' said Frank McCormick, a senior economist at the Bank of America who prefers looking at the figures over a somewhat longer period. He pointed out that the deficit for the latest three months now averaged $9 billion, which was under the $9.3 billion average for the March-May period and the $9.7 billion for December through February.
At the Philadelphia-based CoreStates Financial Corporation, Ben K. Han, an economist, said his first reaction was to assume that the dollar's 1989 strength was beginning to take its toll - causing imports to climb and further dampening exports - but he added on reflection that there was little in the data to demonstrate this.
Instead, Mr. Han said, he found himself wondering about the adequacy of the Commerce Department's seasonal adjustment process because this was the third straight very large August rise. He also noted that swings in trade with Britain and Canada by themselves accounted for half the total deficit rise. In that light, he added, the result ''doesn't look like that bad a number.''
 
Upward Revision for July
Without adjusting for seasonal variation, the August deficit climbed by $844 million, or about 8 percent. With the adjustment, the increase was about 31 percent even after an upward revision in the July deficit, to $8.2 billion, from the $7.6 billion initially reported.
Economists did, however, agree that the report provided further evidence that the export surge that helped drive the industrial sector for two years had probably ended. The August level was actually slightly lower than the level of exports in April. ''The export boom is over,'' said Kevin Logan, chief economist in New York for the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Reflecting the continued weakness in the economy's manufacturing sector, the Federal Reserve reported today that industrial production slipped by one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the first drop in six months, and the operating rate of factories, mines and utilities also fell, by two-tenths of a percentage point, to 83.6 percent.
Mr. Logan and others also took little comfort in the fact that much of the import rise was in capital goods, items used to make other goods and that thereby expand the nation's own long-term productive capacity. Many of these capital imports, Mr. Logan said, were electronics and other goods used in the service sector of the economy. The broader question than whether the imports represent investment or consumption, he added, should be ''why doesn't the United States produce its own capital goods?''
 
Imports Soar by 6.4 Percent
Today's report showed that imports soared by 6.4 percent, to a new high of $41.18 billion, as exports edged down by two-tenths of 1 percent, to $30.41 billion.
Capital goods imports rose by $1.3 billion, vehicles and parts increased by $600 million and foods and beverages were up by $200 million. Among exports, the biggest changes were a $500 million decline in industrial supplies and materials, a $300 million drop in capital goods and $400 million increases for vehicles and parts and the category of ''other'' merchandise.
The nation's deficit with Japan was practically unchanged in August, at $3.98 billion, despite a 2.4 percent decline in imports of Japanese cars. However, the deficit widened significantly with all four of the newly industrialized areas of the Far East -Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore - with the aggregate deficit at $2.71 billion, up 23 percent from July's $2.20 billion.
The deficit with Western Europe eased by $133 million, but this included a huge, unexplained deterioration in the trade account with Britain - to a $100 million deficit from a July surplus of $579 million.
 
Deficit With Canada Jumps
The deficit with Canada, the biggest American trading partner, soared to $1.16 billion from $471 million, partly reflecting the resumption in August of automobile production in both countries, analysts suggested.
Imported oil cost the United States the same $4.3 billion that it spent in July, as a 17-million-barrel rise in consumption was offset by a 98-cent decline in the average price, the Commerce Department also reported.
Exports of manufactured goods climbed by $600 million, to $22.6 billion, in August while imports of manufactured goods rose $1.5 billion, to $32.8 billion.
On a three-month seasonally adjusted moving average, the August deficit reading was $9.01 billion, up from $8.78 billion in July and the highest level since May's $9.28 billion.

HEADLINE: Dow's Next Step? Up or Down;
Forecasts as High as 3,100

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
With a single question hanging on the lips of every investor - What now? - the inevitable parade of analysts and economists rushing forth with answers has begun.
For those with a rosier outlook, three days of hectic, up-and-down trading have not altered their basic conviction: that the market will keep climbing.
Many of their arguments are rooted in the belief that interest rates are falling in the long run. Lower rates traditionally chase some investors out of fixed-income securities and into stocks. 
Lower rates also help the stock market by making it easier for companies to borrow money. The more their ''cost of capital'' drops, the more able they are to undertake investments that raise corporate profits.
 
Short-Term Doubts
The bulls, many of whom work for Wall Street's best-known brokerage houses, acknowledge that their forecasts will probably not be borne out in the short term, and they look beyond Friday's upheaval, and even beyond the disappointing earnings that many prestigious companies like I.B.M. reported for the third quarter.
''People are borrowing less,'' said Charles I. Clough Jr. chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. The total level of domestic debt, including households, corporations and government, he said, is running at about $9.7 trillion, 8 percent higher than last year, but a far cry from the 14 to 16 percent growth rates of the mid-1980's.
''We're sort of unwinding the great postwar credit boom,'' he said. ''The U.S. now has the lowest rates of growth of both money and credit in the last 20 years. The U.S. is moving from a borrowing and spending economy into a savings economy, and that's why interest rates are dropping.''
The flurry of disappointing profits is partly symptomatic of that shift, he said, and is one reason why Merrill is advising its customers to be half invested in long-term bonds and half in stocks. ''There are large chunks of this economy that have been built up to service this consumer spending boom, and as it unwinds many sectors will see earnings weakness,'' he said. ''But the long-term backdrop here is quite positive.''
Low interest rates also convince Elaine Garzarelli, the director of sector analysis for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., that the Dow could end up between 2,850 and 3,100 within six months to a year - 8 to 18 percent above yesterday's close. And she thinks it highly unlikely that the Dow will fall below 2,350, given the current levels of corporate dividends and earnings.
 
Seeing a Buying Opportunity
Her index of 13 key indicators, which was negative before the 1987 crash and turned positive in February 1988, now suggests that the market is flirting with historic lows, and thus presents a buying opportunity.
After the 1987 crash had shaken investor confidence, the market bottomed out on Dec. 4, 1987, at a price that implied that investors were virtually assured of getting at least 4.1 percent of their capital back in annual dividends. When the dividend yield gets that rich, investors typically scoop up stocks.
For the market to have a similarly attractive yield given current dividend levels, it would need to fall only about 10 percent, to 2,350, before investors would rush in.
''If we did go down another 10 percent, it would be so rock-bottom cheap, it'd be as cheap as the bottom after the crash,'' Mr. Garzarelli said.
 
Recession Argument Dismissed
One of the bears' best arguments, that a sweeping recession is imminent, does not concern her.
Even if there is a recession next year and it depresses earnings, she does not see the market going below 2,350.
''I'm trying to make the case you really don't have much downside from here,'' she said.
Martin T. Sosnoff, chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital, which manages about $2 billion in institutional money, does not share the bears' jitters either.
''The bears' case is that the economy picks up steam in the next three to six months, the Federal Reserve panics and interest rates go up into double digits,'' he said. ''We create a recession with huge credit losses in the banking system and stocks sell at a low valuation of earnings. Foreigners don't come into our market, and takeovers don't come back because banks are loaded up with high-risk paper.''
 
Expectation of a 3,000 Dow
Personally, he thinks the Dow could reach 3,000 by the end of 1990, so long as interest rates remain under 8 percent, and corporate earnings over all hold up at their current levels.
Robert S. Salomon Jr., director of equity research at Salomon Brothers Inc., which thinks the market will rise at least 15 percent over the next six to nine months, argued that the dip in reported profits was being misunderstood.
''Corporate profits for the things that you can buy and sell in the public marketplace are rising,'' he said. The Government's aggregate statistics, he contends, are distorted by the avalanche of insolvent savings and loans and by leveraged buyouts that convert profitable companies into unprofitable ones largely for tax purposes.
 
A Slightly Less Bullish View
Only slightly less bullish than the others, Monte Gordon, the director of research for the Dreyfus Corporation, which manages $48 billion in assets, thinks fundamentals are strong enough for the Dow to end 1989 somewhere between 2,500 and 2,900.
''The U.S. economy is resilient and the recession will be shallow and short-lived,'' he said.
He takes the flurry of bad earnings surprises as further evidence that United States companies are taking long-term steps to improve their competitiveness.
''I.B.M. is having problems, no question, but it's also looking to reduce its staff by another 1,000 people, and General Motors is looking to close plants,'' he said. ''So I think the U.S. companies are still working to make themselves more competitive and efficient.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Morning Line On the Next Nobel

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
TRYGVE who? It is a safe bet that most economists under age 50 barely recognized the name of the latest winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, announced last week in Sweden. Trygve Haavelmo's critical contributions to the infant discipline of econometrics in the 1940's are now ancient history.
But economists are a gossipy, competitive lot. And it is an even safer bet that this year's unanticipated trip down memory lane will not inhibit speculation on who will win next year's prize - or more interesting, who deserves to win it. Here is the morning line, unscientifically culled from a dozen phone chats with economists who, sensibly, prefer to remain nameless. 
The handful of older economists whom everyone accepts as Nobel-class - Robert Samuelson, Milton Friedman, Kenneth Arrow, James Tobin, Robert Solow - already have their prizes. But among the generation still in its productive prime, a few others are almost guaranteed a moment in the Stockholm sun.
First on most lists is Gary Becker, the great intellectual empire builder from the University of Chicago, who dared use economics to explain everything from decisions to have children, to discriminate by race and even to break the law.
Another in this category is Robert Lucas (also from Chicago), who has led the effort to rescue classical macroeconomics from the debacle of the 1930's Depression. Yet another is Joseph Stiglitz, the versatile theorist from Stanford. He has ripped gaping wounds in the soft underbelly of economics, the presumption that free markets are more efficient than the alternatives.
Since prizes may only be awarded to the living, it would be understandable if the Royal Swedish Academy gave priority to grayer eminences. Three stand out:
* Ronald Coase, an 80-year-old emeritus professor at Chicago, is remembered for one idea. But what an idea: The ''Coase Theorem'' subtly but profoundly changed the way economists view property rights, and in the process spawned a whole school of conservative jurisprudence that is rocking the foundations of the common law.
* Richard Musgrave, an 80-year-old emeritus at Harvard, is often dismissed as the man who wrote a good textbook in the 1950's covering the economics of taxation. Those with historical perspective remember that Mr. Musgrave invented much of what went into the book - and most public finance textbooks since.
* Edmond Malinvaud, the fine French theorist, is not quite old enough (67) or (in the eyes of some) sufficiently original to rate inclusion as an eminence grise. But he wrote a widely admired textbook in econometrics. And he is the most distinguished European economist who has yet to win a Nobel - a significant fact to the notoriously Eurocentric Nobel committee.
David Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, has been informally polling economists for the last seven years on who is most likely to win the prize. Mr. Malinvaud, along with Mr. Becker, is consistently at the top of the list.
A third group consists of the safe choices, prolific economists at the top of their specialties. A non-exhaustive - repeat non-exhaustive - list would include Jagdish Bhagwati (Columbia), Peter Diamond (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Martin Feldstein (Harvard), Robert Hall (Hoover Institution), Dale Jorgensen (Harvard), Edwin Phelps (Columbia).
However it is the dark horse category that is the most fun, the economists who have done something special but whose awards would be sure to arouse controversy.
A short list might include Albert Hirschman at Princeton's School of Advanced Studies, who has ventured deep into sociology, anthropology and philosophy to explain economic phenomena; Robert Fogel at the University of Chicago, who takes no prisoners in his war on the conventional wisdoms of economic history; Mancur Olson, the Maryland economist who used new ''public choice'' models of group behavior to explain why mature industrial economies lose their productive edge; Robert Mundell at Columbia, who turned traditional macroeconomic theory on its head to accommodate the realities of wide-open trade and capital movement; Martin Weitzman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose brilliant blend of classical and Marxist economics offers a way to eliminate chronic unemployment in market economies without generating inflation.
Have a better idea who will win? Perhaps you could make a little money on it. David Romer's straw poll is actually a pool. If a long shot like Trygve Haavalmo were to win next year, a strategically place dollar bet might return 40 or 50.

Control Data's New Computer

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The Control Data Corporation today announced a new high-end mainframe computer, the Cyber 2000, which it said had twice the power of its current top model, the Cyber 990.
The Minneapolis-based company also introduced a new disk system for its entire Cyber mainframe line and said it had a joint development agreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif. 
Control Data calls the Cyber 2000 a ''supermainframe'' because it has characteristics of both a supercomputer and a mainframe. The new machine is air-cooled and has the fastest processors in the mainframe class, Control said.
In the agreement with MIPS, the two companies will work together to develop a new computer based on RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, which speeds computing by limiting the tasks the processor must perform. A manufacturer of microprocessors and computers, MIPS has emerged as the leading contender to Sun Microsystems Inc. and its Sparc chip as the new standard for RISC-based computers.
Control Data's stock slipped 12.5 cents a share today, to $18, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: Eastern Air Is Rebuilding At Fast Pace

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Top executives of Eastern Airlines said yesterday that because a substantial number of striking workers were returning, they expected the airline to emerge from bankruptcy by early next year at 85 to 90 percent of its former size.
Eastern had previously said it expected to become a smaller airline, perhaps 65 percent of its former size.
At a news briefing yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Frank A. Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, which owns Eastern, and Phil J. Bakes, president of Eastern, said the airline's reorganization was proceeding more quickly than they had anticipated. 
Mr. Bakes conceded that many risks were associated with the rebuilding, that Eastern was still hurt by heavy losses and that the expense of reorganizing under the bankruptcy code was offsetting some improvements in revenue in recent months.
The carrier is struggling to get its unsecured creditors to agree to support its plan for reorganization. Both executives said they planned to file a revised plan soon in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
Eastern needs the approval of its creditors and of the court to emerge from bankruptcy.
E. A. Orr, a spokesman for the pilots' union at Eastern, responded that much of the rebuilding had been done at low fares and that historically airlines that used low fares to rebuild had fared poorly.
''Unless the operational figures can be combined with a successful financial operation, then the reorganization is still in great jeopardy,'' he said. 2,500 Pilots Seen on Strike Mr. Orr estimated that about 2,500 of Eastern's pilots remained on strike, while about 20 percent had either crossed picket lines or shown a willingness to go back to work.
In April, a month after the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, its management projected that it would emerge at about two-thirds of its former size. The airline was struck by the machinists' union on March 4, and the pilots' and flight attendants' unions have been honoring the picket lines.
Mr. Bakes said at the news briefing that the return of striking workers had ''allowed us to solidify the rebuilding plan somewhat quicker.''
 
Unsecured Creditors Meet
Members of the unsecured creditors' committee met yesterday and were poring over a report by their financial adviser, Goldman, Sachs & Company, on Eastern's attempts to rebuild.
Mr. Bakes said that although he had not seen the report, he understood that Goldman had pointed out the many risks involved in attempting to rebuild in an industry that he called ''a risky business'' to begin with.
Several analysts who attended the briefing said they were impressed with the pace and success of the rebuilding effort.
''They're reorganizing much faster than expected,'' said Kevin Murphy, airline analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. ''The question is, are they going to make money with it?''
He said that although the carrier had been able to get its operating costs down, it was still faced with heavy interest costs on its huge debt and was vulnerable if a recession made it more difficult to charge fares high enough to make money.
 
Eastern's Cash Position
Raymond E. Neidl, analyst for Dillon, Read & Company, said that he agreed with Mr. Bakes and Mr. Lorenzo that the carrier could begin to make money by next year, but that its cash position was still thin for a carrier its size.

Executive Search Finds A New Chief for Zemex

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The Zemex Corporation, a producer of industrial minerals, metal powders and tin, said yesterday that Gerard E. Wood had been named its new president and chief executive.
Mr. Wood, 51, succeeds Harry A. Durney, who is retiring at age 65 and will become a consultant to Zemex and remain a director. Mr. Durney has led Zemex, once known as the Pacific Tin Consolidated Company, since 1976. 
Zemex, based in New York, has its roots in the Yukon gold rush in Canada earlier in the century. The company was founded 70 years ago as the Yukon Gold Company and owned by Guggenheim family interests. The company is still connected with the Guggenheims; its chairman, Peter Lawson-Johnston, is the grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim and head of the foundation, which operates the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.
But the company's majority owner today is Denison Mines Ltd., Toronto, which owns a 50.1 percent stake. Zemex produces clay, sand and feldspar for industrial uses, along with high purity silica sands used in semiconductor applications.
Mr. Wood, who was found through an executive search, had been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc., a Canadian mining concern, since 1985. Of Zemex, he said, ''I intend to make it more profitable and expand it in the future.''
A graduate of Leeds University in England, Mr. Wood was a mining engineer for the Iron Ore Company of Canada, the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company and the Cerro Metal Products Company before becoming an investment analyst in Toronto with the firm of H.M. Chisholm. After five years there, he became senior mineral economist for the Government of Canada before joining Steep Rock.
He and his wife, Jacqueline, who have moved to New York, have three daughters.

Industrial Output Shows First Drop in Six Months

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Industrial production slipped by one-tenth of 1 percent in September, the first drop in six months, the Federal Reserve said today in a report that reflected continued weakness in the economy's manufacturing sector.
But Michael Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington forecasting firm, said that ''while the economy is not strong, there's no sign of a downturn.''
The Fed said last month's decline in output was the first since a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent last February. It followed a revised rise of three-tenths in August and an unchanged rate in July. 83.6 Percent Operating Rate In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities also fell in September, by two-tenths of a percentage point, to 83.6 percent. This also reflected the decline in the production rate. 
Indications of the slip in industrial production were contained in a Labor Department report earlier this month that said manufacturers reported a September loss of 103,000 jobs, including 33,000 at auto plants. It was the biggest drop since November 1982, at the end of the last recession.
''The most significant declines occurred in the output of trucks, basic metals and construction supplies,'' the Fed said today. ''The decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies.''
The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the Fed's tight-money policies as the central bank tries to contain inflation by slowing the economy without tipping it into a recession.
 
Easing of Credit Urged
William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the United States Chamber of Commerce, called on the Fed to ease further its grip on credit. ''Falling industrial production in September was accompanied by indications that business investment stopped growing,'' he said. ''With inflation coming down, it is incumbent on the Fed to reduce interest rates to encourage investment.''
Regarding the report on the industrial operating rate, analysts generally consider a rate of 85 percent or above an indication of inflationary pressures because the closer American industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases.
Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods fell by two-tenths of 1 percent in September after a three-tenths rise the month before.
''The decrease in manufacturing output mainly reflected widespread weakness in durables,'' which fell by five-tenths of 1 percent, the Fed said. Production of nondurable goods edged up by one-tenth.
 
Oil and Mining Output Up
Output at mines and oil wells increased by nine-tenths of 1 percent, while production at utilities rose by 1.2 percent.
The Fed said its industrial production index in September stood at 142.3 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent in August.
In its factory use report, the Fed said the operating rate at manufacturing plants fell from 84.1 percent in August to 83.7 percent in September. It peaked at 84.7 percent in January. The rate at factories producing durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last more than three years - fell by six-tenths of a percentage point, to 82.1 percent. The rate at factories producting nondurable goods fell by two-tenths, to 86 percent.

HEADLINE: South Korea Offers Plans To Ease U.S. Trade Surplus

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea told President Bush today that his nation would take significant steps to curb its trade surplus with the United States by the mid-1990's.
The measures would provide the United States with access to South Korean markets equivalent to that it receives from other leading industrial countries.
The pledge, which entails cutting tariffs in half and sharply reducing nontariff barriers - like the requirement that importers to South Korea have Government licenses - was made at a White House meeting of the two leaders. 
American officials, while welcoming steps South Korea has taken to increase American imports, are looking for speedier progress in the future.
 
More Study Required
The officials said the pledge -which would open markets in South Korea to a degree equivalent to that of the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of industrial countries - requires more study before any comment could be made. ''We just noted it,'' a State Department official said.
Differences over timing of the new access were highlighted in remarks the two leaders made as they adjourned for lunch, according to Richard Solomon, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and Pacific Affairs, who briefed reporters later.
''President Roh said that if an apple is picked before it is ripe, it is tough and sour. But if you wait, it is nice and sweet,'' Mr. Solomon said.
''President Bush,'' Mr. Solomon added, ''noted that you don't want the ripening to take so long that you're too old to enjoy the fruit.''
 
Many Protectionist Barriers
As a newly industrializing country, South Korea has retained a large number of trade barriers to protect its infant industries and large farm population from import competition.
President Roh, a former four-star general who came to power after elections in 1987, is under strong domestic political pressure not to yield too much too quickly to the United States.
For example, farmers have demonstrated against American efforts to sell more beef to South Korea; snakes have been freed in Seoul theaters that show American movies, and the residence in Seoul of the American Ambassador, Donald P. Gregg, was broken into last Friday by South Korean students who said they opposed American trade pressure.
Ravaged by war three decades ago, South Korea has not only prospered economically since then, but grown into the seventh-largest trading partner of the United States.
 
Substantial Results
Responses to market-opening pressures by the United States have already yielded substantial results in terms of reducing the American trade deficit with South Korea. Having topped $10 billion a year in the mid-1980's, the trade deficit with South Korea has fallen 35 percent so far this year and for the full year is projected by South Korean officials at around $5 billion.
In a report on trade results for August, the United States Commerce Department said today that the deficit with all four of the newly industrialized countries of the Far East -Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore - was $2.71 billion for the month, up 23 percent from July's $2.20 billion.

HEADLINE: MCI Profit Jumps 58.7%; GTE's Net Also Rises

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The MCI Communications Corporation and the GTE Corporation reported sharply higher third-quarter earnings yesterday. Another telephone company, the Southwestern Bell Corporation, said its profits had fallen, mainly because of one-time factors.
MCI, the second-largest provider of long-distance services, after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said its third-quarter earnings were $165 million, up 58.7 percent from $104 million. Revenues were $1.67 billion, up 23 percent from $1.36 billion for the comparable quarter last year. Earnings per share rose to 62 cents, from 38 cents. 
The company said it was the seventh consecutive quarter in which it set records for operating revenue, earnings and earnings per share.
Despite the sharp increase in earnings, MCI stock fell $2.625 a share yesterday, to $42.375, apparently because its profits merely met analysts' expectations. In previous quarters, MCI has exceeded projections.
The company said its residential business grew faster than service to businesses during the quarter, largely because of its new Prime Time calling plan and expansion of operator and pay phone services.
MCI, based in Washington, also said it had won several large contracts in the period, including service for Congress and Montgomery Ward & Company.
''It was a good quarter,'' said Edward M. Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. ''It wasn't a blow-them-away quarter.'' MCI's stock had been trading very strongly last week, he said.
''They were at expectations, as opposed to ahead of expectations, which they have historically been,'' said Jack B. Grubman of Paine Webber Inc. He added, ''I wouldn't exactly call 60 percent earnings growth shabby, but revenue and earnings growth is slowing as they become a bigger company.''
''To some degree, we're splitting hairs,'' Mr. Grubman said. ''They had a 60 percent gain in earnings and good business momentum. They're going to have very good double-digit growth over the next several years, in terms of revenues and earnings.''
 
GTE
GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., reported third-quarter net income of $367.6 million, up 17.6 percent from $312.7 million. Sales rose to $4.35 billion, from $4 billion, an increase of 8.8 percent. Per-share earnings were $1.06, up from 91 cents.
The company attributed the increase in revenues to telephone operations, including an increase in long-distance calls, which originate and terminate in local-exchange networks that it owns. The company said the number of access lines in service was up 5 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts said a corporate revamping earlier this year had resulted in higher productivity.
Mr. Grubman of Paine Webber called GTE's quarterly results ''pretty awesome.'' He also noted that the company had nearly doubled the number of cellular phone subscribers, boding well for future revenues.
 
Southwestern Bell
Southwestern Bell said third-quarter earnings were down 8.7 percent, to $295.3 million, from $323.3 million in the third quarter of last year. Revenues also declined slightly, to $2.21 billion, from $2.23 billion.
Earnings per share were 98 cents, down 9.3 percent from $1.08 a year earlier.
The company, based in St. Louis, said the decline was expected. Southwestern Bell had received a tax refund last year, inflating its earnings then. This year, among other factors, it shifted production of several Yellow Pages directories from the third quarter to the fourth.
Income for the first nine months was $795.6 million, up 5.4 percent from the comparable period of 1988, the company said, and revenues were $6.4 billion, up 2.2 percent. ''The outlook for the rest of the year remains positive,'' Zane E. Barnes, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The company said the economy in its service region - Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas - was strongly improving, with 308,000 telephone lines added in the current year, compared with 22,000 in all of 1987.

The dollar recovered from an early loss yesterday and finished mixed in United States trading after falling against most major currencies in trading in Europe following the news of a bigger-than-expected United States trade deficit.
Gold prices edged higher in New York after a mixed showing overseas. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $366.40 an ounce, up 60 cents from Monday's late bid. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose 10 cents an ounce, to $367.40. 
The dollar dropped early in the day on news that the United States trade deficit widened in August to $10.8 billion when many traders were expecting a deficit of about $9.5 billion.
 
Effect of Rising Deficit
A rising deficit suggests the dollar is too expensive, making American goods less competitive in foreign markets and making foreign goods cheaper in the United States.
But Graham Broyd, vice president in the foreign exchange department at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said the dollar bounced back fairly quickly as traders focused for another day on price movements in the United States stock market.
The dollar fell as the Dow Jones industrial average dipped about 60 points early in the day, but then the currency recovered to finish above the closing levels reached earlier in Europe as the Dow retraced lost ground. The Dow finished with a loss of almost 19 points.
One reason for the interaction between the two markets is that the Federal Reserve may encourage lower interest rates if the stock market were to come anywhere near Friday's 190.58-point decline in the Dow. Falling interest rates would make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
 
Dollar Up in Tokyo
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 142.25 Japanese yen, from 140.75 yen at Monday's close. Later in London, it edged up further to 142.35 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 142.70 yen, from 141.80 yen on Monday.
The dollar weakened against the British pound. In London, the British pound rose to $1.5835, from $1.5820 late Monday. Later in New York, the pound edged up to $1.57575, from $1.5750 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.8672 West German marks, down from 1.8680; 1.6365 Swiss francs, up from 1.6340; 6.3475 French francs, down from 6.3480; 1,400.375 Italian lire, up from 1,374.50, and 1.17555 Canadian dollars, down from 1,17675.
Silver for current delivery slipped 0.2 cent, to $5.102 a troy ounce, on New York's Comex. In London, silver rose to a late bid of $5.12, from $5.11 late Monday.

Treasury Notes and Bonds Drop

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds dipped in moderately active trading yesterday, as dealers ignored a bigger-than-expected increase in the nation's trade deficit and focused instead on movements in stock prices and the dollar.
The dollar's resilience in the face of the $10.77 billion trade deficit for August helped to limit price declines of short-term Treasury note issues. So too did a slightly weaker stock market, which fell by 18.65 points, to 2,638.73.
At the same time, however, the offering of $4 billion worth of securities by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which included $2 billion of 30-year bonds, had an adverse effect on longer-term Treasury notes and bonds, sectors that recorded the largest price declines yesterday. 
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 101 3/32, down 17/ 32, to yield 8.02 percent.
Among secondary Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 29/32 in late trading, down 1/4 of a point, to yield 8.01 percent. And the 8 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 29/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.86 percent.
 
Bill Rates Spurt
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose sharply yesterday, even though the overnight Federal funds rate, an important barometer for short-term rates, remained soft.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.50 percent, up 15 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 11 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.51 percent. And one-year bill rates were offered late in the day at 7.35 percent, up 2 basis points.
The Fed funds rate, which analysts suspect may have been pushed lower by the Fed on Monday, traded in a narrow range of 8 11/16 percent to 8 5/8 percent yesterday. Money market economists are fairly sure that the Fed has pushed the closely watched funds rate down to a range of 8 7/8 percent to 8 5/8 percent, and perhaps as low as 8 1/2 percent.
The next resting place for the funds rate depends largely on what happens in the stock market this week, analysts said. In addition, yesterday's merchandise trade numbers, which showed little growth in exports and a big rise in imports, could also buttress arguments among Fed governors that the 8 1/2 percent rate is justified.
 
Cut in Prime Expected
''The economy is very fragile,'' said Sung Won Sohn, a senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. ''And the bad trade number may force Mr. Greenspan to look at interest rates again.''
''I think Fed funds will settle in the 8.5 percent range in the next week or so,'' he said. ''And as soon as the banking community has confirmed that the Fed has moved the funds rate to that level, the prime lending rate will be cut by half a point, to 10 percent.''
Demand for the T.V.A. securities priced yesterday was so strong that the size of the offering was increased by $1 billion, including a $500 million rise in 30-year bonds.
Another test of the market's appetite for highly regarded long-term paper will begin today, as the Resolution Funding Corporation, the Government entity established to finance the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry, is expected to announce details of an auction of securities.
Officials of the corporation said last week that the auction, which will take place next week, will consist of $4 billion to $6 billion of securities with maturities of more than 20 years.
 
First Sale to Public
The auction will be the first sale to the public of the corporation's securities. Last summer Congress authorized total borrowing of $50 billion to pay for the savings and loan cleanup. The first $20 billion was borrowed by the Treasury Department in the third quarter.
The corporation is expected to continue its auctions on a quarterly basis until its remaining $30 billion in authority is exhausted.
Aside from the overall size of the offering, speculation about the announcement has centered on whether a 40-year bond would be included in the auction.
Following today's announcement, the corporation's issues will trade on a when-issued basis just like Treasury issues. Dealers said the securities are likely to trade at a premium of 15 to 20 basis points over comparable Treasury coupons.
Elsewhere, continued volatility in the stock market and the market for Treasury securities caused trading in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds to slow markedly yesterday.
Dealers said that prices of most issues fell by 1/8 of a point to 1/4 of a point.
''With the markets getting whipsawed, a lot of accounts are a little nervous,'' a corporate bond trader said.
Trading was equally sluggish in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds. Market participants said prices of most issues fell by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point.

$4 Billion T.V.A. Offering Meets With Strong Demand

 BODY:
In its first public offering since 1974, the Tennessee Valley Authority priced a $4 billion offering of notes and bonds yesterday through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
Demand for the securities was so strong that the size of the offering was increased by $1 billion.
The offering is part of an overall plan to refinance $6.7 billion worth of outstanding issues borrowed at higher interest rates from the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury Department, earlier in this decade. 
The T.V.A., which used to offer its securities to the public on a regular basis, has borrowed exclusively from the Federal Financing Bank since 1974. A refusal by the Financing Bank to refinance the high-cost debt pursuaded the T.V.A. to tap the public market.
''It's not every day you save your company $75 million a year in interest payments,'' William F. Malec, T.V.A.'s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview from Knoxville, Tenn., where the agency is based. ''We are pleased as punch.'' The offering consisted of $1 billion worth of 5-year notes, $1 billion of 10-year notes and $2 billion of 30-year bonds that are noncallable for five years.
The 8.25 percent five-year notes were priced at $99.672, to yield 8.33 percent, which is 43 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the prevailing yield on 8 1/4 percent 5-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The 8 3/8 percent 10-year notes were priced at $99.672, to yield 8.33 percent, or 43 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
And the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds were priced at $96.808, to yield 9.06 percent, 1.05 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's bellwether 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
Underwriters at First Boston said that as of late yesterday the 5-year and 10-year securities were completely sold out, and that only ''tag ends'' of the 30-year bonds remained unspoken for.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Study Finds High Turnover in Child Care Workers

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
People who care for children in day care centers are leaving their jobs in growing numbers and the turnover is hurting the children's development, according to a study released yesterday.
The study, by the Child Care Employee Project, found that turnover at child care centers had nearly tripled in the last decade -from 15 percent a year in 1977 to 41 percent in 1988. In the same period, the number of centers reporting no turnover fell from 40 percent to 7 percent.
''What the study says is that staff are the key to good child care, and we're having a hard time keeping good child care staff because the pay is just too low,'' said Marcy Whitebook, executive director of the Child Care Employee Project, a nonprofit group based in Oakland, Calif. The project's goal is to improve salaries and training of day care teachers and aides and to raise state and Federal child care standards. 
The study was based on classroom observation and testing at 227 child care centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Phoenix and Seattle metropolitan areas. The centers served more than 16,000 families and had more than 3,000 employees.
 
Lag Is Linked to Turnover
The study found that the persistent turnover had measurably hurt the children at the centers.
''Children attending lower-quality centers with more teacher turnover were less competent in language and social development,'' Ms. Whitebook said. ''We always thought that high turnover would have bad effects, but this is the first time we've actually been able to show that link.''
Specifically, the study found that children at centers with a high turnover of staff members were less engaged in social activities with their peers and scored worse on vocabulary tests than children at centers with a lower turnover.
Besides Ms. Whitebook, the principal investigators in the study were Carolee Howes, associate professor of education at the University of California at Los Angeles, and Deborah Phillips, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Virginia.
 
Pay Factor in Turnover
According to the study, released at a news conference in Washington, turnover is directly related to pay and working conditions. Center teachers earning $4 an hour or less left their jobs at twice the rate of those who earned more than $6 an hour.
''There's all this talk now about how important the early years are and how important education is,'' Ms Whitebook said, ''but as a society we are going to have to put our money where our mouth is. We have to value child care teachers more, and there is some movement in that direction in a few states and in some of the child care legislation that is before Congress.''
The House approved a $22.7 billion child care package early this month, and lawmakers are working out differences between the House version and one passed earlier this year by the Senate. The legislation could give states Federal money that could be used to raise salaries of day care employees.
The pay for child care teachers in the study was highest at nonprofit centers that were not church-sponsored and had an average hourly wage of $6.40. It was lowest at profit-making day care chains, where the average hourly wage was $4.10. Annual turnover at nonprofit centers was 30 percent, as against 74 percent at the chains. #27% Drop in Earnings Despite gains in overall formal education and experience, child care teachers were paid even less last year than in 1977, the study said. The teachers' earnings, adjusted to allow for inflation, have fallen by 27 percent since 1977. Assistants' earnings have fallen by 20 percent.
The average hourly wage for child care teachers in 1988 was $5.35, providing an annual income of $9,363. The Federal poverty threshold for a family of three, the average family size in the sample, was $9,431 a year in 1988.
The study found that in 1988, 22 percent of the child care workers surveyed had at least a bachelor's degree, and 44 percent had some college education.
On average, child care workers with some college education and those with a bachelor's degree or more earned less than half as much as comparably educated women in the work force, the study said, and less than a third as much as comparably educated men.

HEADLINE: Freed Rebels Talk of Decades in Pretoria's Prisons

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOWETO, South Africa, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Walter Sisulu and two of his freed colleagues from the outlawed African National Congress talked today about their 26 years in prison and how their captors had tried at first to break them with hard labor, midnight searches, informers and humiliation.
Mr. Sisulu, who is now 77 years old, Ahmed Kathrada, 60, and Elias Motsoaledi, 65, were among eight political prisoners released unconditionally by the Government on Sunday. They had been sentenced with their comrade, Nelson Mandela, to life imprisonment in June 1964 for conspiring to commit sabotage and overthrow the Government and sent to Robben Island, South Africa's equivalent of Alcatraz, and then to Pollsmoor Prison on the mainland in 1982.
As they related their experiences to a group of American and French reporters in a small hall of Holy Cross Anglican Church near Mr. Sisulu's home, several hundred chanting schoolchildren gathered outside in hope of glimpsing Soweto's newest heroes. 
 
Discreet Talks With Government
Mr. Sisulu disclosed that the authorities started talking discreetly to Mr. Mandela before he was transferred from Robben Island to Pollsmoor in 1982, and that discussions grew more serious after he was moved to a prison farm outside Cape Town last December after recovering from a near-fatal bout of tuberculosis. Mr. Sisulu did not give any details.
But he denied speculation that Mr. Mandela was remaining in prison as part of a deal worked out with the Government that would lead to eventual negotiations. Mr. Sisulu said Mr. Mandela ''would have gladly gotten out with us'' but had put the release of his comrades first.
Mr. Sisulu said negotiations are impossible until Mr. Mandela is freed.
Mr. Sisulu described Robben Island and Pollsmoor as providing the best kind of political education. And the men said they had learned that pressure, whether from inside prison or abroad, was the way to force an end to apartheid. As a result, they said the struggle ''in all its aspects'' - an allusion to guerrilla attacks - and economic sanctions against South Africa should be intensified.
 
Pressure Called Effective
''It really confirmed our belief that the South African authorities do not suddenly undergo a change of heart,'' Mr. Kathrada said. Every concession the Government has made ''has been under some pressure or another.''
Mr. Kathrada said his group had been prepared psychologically for prison because they expected to be arrested at some stage. But when they were deposited on Robben Island, which lies in chilly, shark-infested Atlantic waters off Cape Town, he contended that their captors wanted to break them. ''From the security police to the prison authorities, they tried to instill into our minds that we would be forgotten in a few years' time,'' Mr. Kathrada said. ''They did everything to crush our morale.''
For the first six months, he said, Mr. Mandela and the other prisoners were put to work breaking stones with hammers. Then they were sent to work in the prison's lime quarry, performing hard labor that Mr. Kathrada said lasted more than a decade.
At one point before conditions improved, Mr. Kathrada said, Mr. Mandela and Mr. Sisulu were put on a meager ration of rice gruel as punishment for allegedly not working hard enough.
Mr. Kathrada, who is of Indian descent, said that initially he and the mixed-race convicts were issued long trousers, but black convicts like Mr. Mandela and Mr. Sisulu had to wear shorts, however cold the weather, and were not given socks.
After the day's labor, Mr. Sisulu said, the convicts had to strip naked outside and wash down with cold seawater, even in winter.
Mr. Kathrada vividly recalled one night - he said the date was May 28, 1971 - when the warders, ''many of them very drunk,'' descended on their cells to rouse the convicts, stripped them and forced them against the wall for a particularly rough search in which he said Govan Mbeki, a prisoner released in 1987, nearly suffered a heart attack. But Mr. Kathrada said they were spared physical brutality that was inflicted on less prominent prisoners.
The men insisted that the intended humiliation only stiffened their defiance. ''Because we were so close to the oppressor, it helped to keep us united,'' Mr. Kathrada said. They went on hunger strikes to force concessions. The former prisoners also credited the International Red Cross and Helen Suzman, a liberal white legislator who focused attention in Parliament on the plight of political prisoners, with having improved conditions.
Such pressure, they said, gradually improved their lives in prison. In 1980, after 16 years on Robben Island, they were allowed to read newspapers. They were later permitted radios, although not short-wave receivers for foreign broadcasts, and television and videocasette recorders in 1986.
They tried to keep up with events outside by talking to new prisoners, reading smuggled letters and ''begging, stealing and bribing'' for information. ''Political prisoners give top priority to keeping themselves informed,'' Mr. Kathrada said, but they sometimes went without news for several months.
He said they did not learn about the uprising touched off by Soweto schoolchildren in June 1976 until August. Mr. Motsoaledi said he was upset to learn that two of his children's playmates died in the violence.
 
No Moments of Despair
Mr. Sisulu said he never felt despair in his prison years, ''but there were moments when I felt very much in high spirits.'' He said he was ''inspired'' by events like the 1976 Soweto rebellion and the formation of the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the United Democratic Front, which form the core of the anti-apartheid movement and have links to the African National Congress in exile.
''It was not easy, but we did communicate with the A.N.C.,'' Mr. Sisulu said. His group briefed prisoners who were being freed, to pass along messages to the movement's leadership in exile in Lusaka, Zambia. He said they used a second channel that he could not divulge. And he said they conducted extensive political indoctrination of other prisoners on behalf of the Congress.
The released prisoners sounded occasionally nostalgic for the old camaraderie that bound them together for the last quarter century. ''In prison, the best comes out and the worst comes out as well, because of the deprivation and suffering,'' Mr. Kathrada said. He joked about having to live with Mr. Sisulu's taste for pop music in their last three and a half years as cellmates.
Mr. Sisulu said the ''enriching experience'' of confinement had matured them all. ''There has been never a greater university for political education than there was in prison.''

HEADLINE: Salvador's Armed Forces Accused By a Medical Team From the U.S.

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Costa Rica, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The Salvadoran military has conducted a nationwide campaign of killings, harassment and torture against doctors and health-care workers and attacked guerrilla field hospitals in violation of the Geneva convention, a team of American medical specialists says.
''The arbitrary refusal to allow the delivery of medical services, medicines and other essential goods imperils the health of many Salvadorans,'' wrote the team of seven investigators, whose report was published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine. The team visited El Salvador for a week in June. 
The team concluded that the persecution of medical personnel was part of a campaign to obstruct religious and relief workers in order to undermine support for the guerrillas, whose nine-year-old war against the Government is sustained by a well-organized network of sympathizers.
 
Many Without Health Care
Although the report includes several outdated statistics, it amounts to an indictment of the Government's human rights record and its health-care system. It notes that the Ministry of Health provides little or no health care to the vast majority of people in El Salvador, which has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the hemisphere.
The report found that the Government has actively obstructed medical education and that health care in El Salvador is likely to continue to ''deteriorate disastrously.''
Army commanders could not be reached for comment on the report. In the past, army officials have often accused medical personnel and relief agencies of being little more than rebel fronts but have always denied harassing or obstructing them.
The investigators said they had not found ''any instance of systematic or intentional disruption of health care'' by the rebels despite what they said was a determined effort to document such abuses. But the team noted other types of insurgent human-rights violations and said the rebels' campaign of economic sabotage had frequently prevented Salvadorans from receiving necessary medical care.
 
Hospitals Reported Attacked
The team, consisting of five doctors, a lawyer and a Congressional staff aide, said the Salvadoran Army had attacked several rebel field hospitals and routinely denied doctors and health workers access to battle areas, in violation of the 1949 Geneva convention. The convention calls for the protection of medical personnel and gives the wounded and the sick the right to medical care.
The team found that health-care workers faced long delays in obtaining passes required to visit rural areas. The workers are also routinely turned back at army roadblocks and are rarely allowed to take more than a few doses of medicine into those areas, the report says. In addition, the investigators reported military interference with public health campaigns.
In one case, army troops confiscated vaccines, detained medical personnel and canceled a Government-approved, Roman Catholic Church-sponsored campaign to inoculate 1,000 children in the northern province of Chalatenango, a rebel stronghold, the investigators said.

After extending the meeting for a day, the two sides did little more than agree to meet again next month in Venezuela. That is a small but clear step in building confidence between the two sides after nearly a decade of war that has spared few families and created much bitterness.
''It's no great achievement, but it strengthens the peace process,'' Oscar Santamaria, the Justice Minister and spokesman for the Government delegation, said in summing up the agreement. 
Shafik Handal, one of the most senior guerrilla commanders, said, ''It's not something spectacular, but it's a step on the path to a political solution.''
The two sides essentially agreed to disagree. They used about a third of the two-page final communique to list their differences on such fundamental issues as how to define the end of the war, which has claimed 70,000 lives, many of them civilians killed by death squads linked to the Government and the armed forces. The movement at the session was barely the minimum necessary to keep the peace process from falling apart. It was an obvious disappointment to several members of the rebel delegation, who until this afternoon had hoped the communique would include an agreement to prevent human rights abuses and lessen the war's effects on civilians.
''It might appear unspectacular,'' said Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the senior mediator and the auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, ''but we consider it very important for the process of peace.''
The discussion, the first substantive talks in the war, started as tactical maneuvering for political advantage in an election year, then gathered momentum, forcing the two sides to compete for the mantle of peacemaker.
Peace is the only issue that commands a political majority in El Salvador. Despite more than $4 billion in United States aid, the standard of living has plunged dramatically for the vast majority of Salvadorans. Their income has dropped by a third during the decade of war.
The society, which was once terrorized by death squads, has for the first time in this century transferred power from one elected civilian to another. But it remains sharply polarized and repression, although less violent, remains pervasive.
In the first two days of talks, both sides offered proposals that appeared to be more attempts to score propaganda points than serious efforts to find peace.
The Government proposed that all fighting stop today and that the guerrilla army be demobilized in January. But it offered almost no concessions to the rebels and did not address the social and economic issues that led the guerrillas to take up arms.
 
Rebels Offer Plan
The rebels countered with a plan for ''the self-purification and professionalization of the armed forces.''
It was a thinly veiled effort to divide the army and provoke an intemperate response from extremists within the armed forces, which have long ruled the country in a coalition with the oligarchy.
Rebel leaders, in a well-organized press blitz, accused the Government of ''inflexibility'' and threatened to break off negotiations. The Government accused the guerrillas of blocking progress by introducing dozens of obviously unacceptable proposals.
The rebels said the impasse was broken by the approaching end of the discussions and a talk from President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica. He said he called the Salvadoran President, Alfredo Cristiani, and asked him to instruct his delegation to continue the negotiations for a third day. Mr. Cristiani agreed.
''They have to continue to talk,'' President Arias said Tuesday night before meeting with both delegations. ''I know that after 10 years of war it's very difficult to reach peace in a few hours. It's a slow, difficult, complex process.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Drug Strategy Is Attacked at House Hearing

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Administration officials defended their anti-drug strategy for Latin America today before Congressional critics who complained that it was ill conceived and too heavily weighted toward military over economic aid for cocaine-producing countries.
Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who headed a House Government Operations Committee hearing on the strategy, asserted that a ''phony economic plan'' would not encourage Latin American farmers to substitute other crops for the coca leaf.
Another committee member, Representative Al McCandless, Republican of California, accused the Administration of deceiving the public by using American military advisers in field operations in Latin America, but denying it. ''I would suggest that this thing is going to blow up in your face, in our face,'' Mr. McCandless warned the Administration officials, ''when one of these days one of our military people may be killed in a laboratory raid or something.'' 
He said, for example, that the Border Patrol had helped the military in Peru set up roadblocks, an action that he said was ''certainly a field operation.''
But Richard Brown, a deputy assistant secretary for inter-American security at the Pentagon, replied that the Border Patrol was ''not a part of the active military.''
''It is not our intention to deceive the American public,'' Mr. Brown said.
 
Program Is Defended
He and other officials defended President Bush's drug program as this country's most ambitious effort to combat cocaine in the Andean nations of Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. But they conceded that the effort was complicated by diplomatic, economic and military considerations.
''This is a difficult area,'' said John P. Walters, chief of staff in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ''There are going to be missteps. There are going to be problems.''
Alixe Glen, a Presidential spokeswoman, said today that representatives from the White House and the three Andean nations would meet on Nov. 20 to work out details of a meeting on drugs that President Bush has agreed to attend.
Mr. Bush last week accepted an invitation from the leaders of the three countries to meet with them, probably within 90 days. No site has been decided upon for the meeting, Ms. Glen said, although some White House aides earlier suggested Jamaica, Barbados or Venezuela.
The drug package announced by Mr. Bush last month calls for $261 million in aid in fiscal 1990 for the Andean countries, which produce virtually all of the cocaine sold in the United States, and a total of more than $2 billion through fiscal 1994. In the first year, the money would go to military aid, but beginning in fiscal 1991 funds would also go for economic assistance.
 
Noncombat Roles
The plan calls for the American military to serve in noncombat roles, with responsibilities like training law enforcement officials on how to go about apprehending drug traffickers and destroying drug-producing laboratories. But lawmakers derided the program today, saying increased military aid must be accompanied immediately by greater economic aid.
Even with a stepped-up military presence in the region, Mr. Conyers said, coca growers will not turn to other crops unless the United States can help ''match them at the market'' with alternatives.
''We cannot give them a couple of boxes of Cracker Jacks and then say we're going to blow your brains out if you don't do better,'' he asserted. ''They're not going to buy into a phony economic plan.''
Administration officials did suggest that they were frustrated at times and were still trying to figure out exact amounts of economic aid to funnel to the three countries and how best to go about it.
''The economics of dope defy logic,'' said Terrence M. Burke, acting deputy administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. ''And that's why it's hard to grapple with.''

HEADLINE: President Soft-Pedals Flag Measure

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
After advancing a constitutional amendment as the only certain way to protect the American flag from desecration, President Bush has held back from an all-out effort to save the proposal in the Senate, Congressional and Administration officials said today.
As the Senate moves toward a vote on the amendment Thursday amid signs of eroding support, the proposal seems to have fallen victim to changing political tides, White House priorities and the California earthquake.
Mr. Bush has made a point of continuing his own public support for the amendment, making it the initial focus of a White House news conference Friday and repeating his backing in an Oval Office meeting today with Congressional Republican leaders. Further, his Congressional liaison staff has continued to lobby on the issue. 
 
No Personal Calls
But Mr. Bush has not made personal calls to Congress on the issue since his news conference, and John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, has focused on other issues, Administration officials said.
When two conservative Republican Senators, Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire and John C. Danforth of Missouri, decided to drop their sponsorship of the amendment, they did so without consultation with the White House or any telephone calls afterward, officials said.
''Nobody seems to be muscling people very much,'' said Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Republican whip. ''It's being done,'' he said with a wry smile, ''but in a kind of undefinable way, kind of calmly persistent.''
 
In a Difficult Position
The fight over the flag amendment puts Mr. Bush in a difficult position, putting the President between his ideological side and his political side, as a Republican strategist described it. Having said he thought that the issue was important enough to amend the Bill of Rights, Mr. Bush cannot appear to be dropping it in the face of other political pressures.
''Some things are just not politically expedient,'' the strategist said. ''Bush really holds these beliefs in his heart and expresses them in public, but this guy is picking and choosing his fights carefully, and this just doesn't really seem like one to go to the mat on.''
The fight over the flag amendment has reached a turning point at a bad time for the White House, pitting what Democrats have called an exercise in symbolic politics against pressing legislative issues like the budget deficit and Medicaid financing of abortion. The California earthquake further strained the White House.
 
Bush Cares Very Much
''It's a zero-sum game,'' one Administration official said. ''Bush still cares very much about the flag, but the more time we spend on it, the less time there is for these other things.''
Charles Black, a Republican consultant who works closely with the White House, said, ''The flag is still a critical issue as our national symbol, but with the economic train wreck that is in progress, I'm sure the White House hasn't been able to put it at the top of the list.''
Critics of the proposed amendment say it would curb freedom of speech as guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. The White House says a constitutional amendment is the only sure way to ban desecration of the flag. Administration officials contend that new Federal legislation banning flag desecration that was passed by Congress has the same weaknesses as a Texas statute ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court earlier this year.
But some Republicans said today that passage of the anti-desecration statute had taken some of the pressure off Mr. Bush, who took a middle ground by saying he did not like the measure but would allow it to become law without his signature.
 
Wise Not to Press Issue
''The President took the initial correct position and the White House is wise in seeing their issue through,'' said Roger Stone, a Republican consultant. ''But they are also wise in not pressing it, because if you look at the top two or three issues that help form the Bush governing coalition, the flag amendment is just not one of them.''
Another leading Republican strategist, Eddie Mahe, said, ''While the flag may be a gut cultural issue, nobody, including the White House, could suggest that it is of the same level of importance as the budget, or dealing with the earthquake, or even probably the Clean Air Act.''
The new law makes the issue worthless as a campaign brickbat unless the new law is overturned, Mr. Mahe argued.
''At this point, debating the value of a constitutional amendment over a law is kind of like debating the difference between 12 inches and a foot,'' he said.
On Tuesday, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters he thought that he and other opponents would have far more than the 34 votes needed to kill the amendment in the Senate. It needs the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, two-thirds of the House and 38 state legislatures.
Senator George S. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said today that support for the amendment was ebbing. ''It seeks to force Americans to choose between the flag and the Constitution, when no such choice is necessary,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Number of Nation's Poor Remains at 32 Million for a Second Year

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans living below the official poverty level remained at nearly 32 million people for a second straight year in 1988 even though average individual income reached an all-time high of $13,120, figures released today by the Federal Census Bureau showed.
The number of poor people and the poverty rate last year of 13.1 percent remain well above the levels of a decade ago, when the poverty rate was 11.4 percent and 24.5 million people fell below the Federal poverty guidelines, the figures also showed.
The increasing prosperity of high wage earners and the statistically insignificant gains made by middle- and lower-income Americans widened the gap between the nation's richest and poorest Americans to an all-time level, according to an analysis by Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a private research organization.
''There is economic research that pretty conclusively shows that the trend toward growing inequality of household income is paralleled by a growing inequality in the distribution of wages,'' Mr. Greenstein said. He added that the trend began in the late 1960's and accelerated in the late 1970's and early 1980's. 
 
Demographic Changes Reflected
Other economists said the growing gap in income also reflected demographic changes, in particular the influx of women into the work force over the past 15 years and the resulting number of two-income families and the decline in family size with the related increase in unmarried wage earners.
Census data showed, for instance, that the number of family households, usually composed of parents and children, represented 80 percent of all American households in 1970, but declined to 71 percent of all households last year. The figures also showed a sharp increase in the number of nonfamily households, in which unrelated individuals live together or people live alone. The data showed that the incomes of these nontraditional households have been rising at a much faster rate than the incomes of family households.
Family households had a median income of $32,491 in 1988, an increase of 6.9 percent from the $30,382 in 1980. The income of nonfamily households increased by nearly 18.9 percent in that period, from $13,576 to $16,148.
 
Figures on Poverty Rates
The census figures also showed the poverty rate decreasing slightly for whites, blacks and people of Hispanic background. The rate fell from 10.4 percent in 1987 to 10.1 percent in 1988 for whites; from 32.6 percent in 1987 to 31.6 percent last year for blacks, and from 28.1 percent to 26.8 percent for people of Hispanic background. But Census officials cautioned that none of these decreases could be considered a real decline, since the changes were not great enough to compensate for possible statistical errors in data from the survey of 58,000 households nationwide.
The average poverty level for a family of four in 1988, the Census report found, was $12,091, up from $11,611 in 1987.
 
Women at Head of Poor Families
Among the other conclusions in the Census Bureau report were these:
* About 53 percent of all poor families, or 3.6 million of the nearly 6.9 million poor families, are headed by women.
* More than half of the nation's poor were either children under 18 (39.5 percent) or people over 65 (10.9 percent.)
* For the first time since 1982, the average income of American men declined, down 1.3 percent to $26,660.
* The median earnings of women remained constant at $17,610, and over all, women's earnings remained two-thirds that of men, unchanged since 1987 but up from 62 percent in 1982. In addition to presenting the current figures on poverty and income nationwide, the Census Bureau included alternative calculations that would effectively lower the poverty threshold and reduce by about 3.5 million the number of people officially considered poor.
The published calculations immediately provoked criticism from Capitol Hill because such a recalculation could mean that millions of the poor and near-poor would be ineligible for programs like food stamps, free or reduced-price school lunches and Medicaid.
In a letter sent on Tuesday to the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, by the chairmen of the Congressional budget committees, Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, and Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, said, ''Before any decision to change current eligibility cutoffs, we believe you should undertake a much more comprehensive evaluation of the adequacy of currently defined povery levels.''

HEADLINE: East Germany: What Hasn't Changed

 BODY:
Erich Honecker, the builder of the Berlin Wall, was ousted as East Germany's boss after it became obvious he symbolized an intolerable status quo in a country clamoring for change. But the wall still stands; so does the suffocating political and economic system it is meant to protect.
There are a few rays of hope - very few. The regime no longer reflexively brands those who demonstrate for basic freedoms as ''hooligans.'' And there are peeps of dissent to be heard in the party press and in the appearance of fledgling political parties. But the fall of Mr. Honecker does not mean that East Germany will proceed along the path of reform charted by the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary. 
For the moment, all it signifies is that an ailing, 77-year-old hard-liner tainted with failure is to be replaced by his 52-year-old protege, Egon Krenz. Unpromisingly, Mr. Krenz has been chiefly concerned with internal security. During a trip to Beijing, he expressed approval for the massacre of students in Tiananmen Square.
Washington and Bonn are thus wise to mute their response until it's clearer which way Mr. Krenz proposes to move. the East German regime has shown no sign of abandoning its fundamentalist Marxism. The regime insists its rusty ideology has given East Germany the highest living standards in the Soviet bloc and an education system that has yielded a sizable elite of engineers, doctors and scientists.
But these successes owe less to Lenin than to the work ethic. Self-destructively, the system that trains engineers won't let them think for themselves about politics. That, as much as economics, explains the embarrassing exodus of nearly 50,000 young East Germans - who have been able to observe on West German television that workers work less under capitalism, and earn more.
Nor is there any sign that East Germany's new leaders are yet willing to tolerate serious scrutiny and dissent. Unlike Hungary, no reform faction has been permitted within the German party, and unlike Poland, no independent political or trade union challenge has been allowed to evolve outside it. Autocracy untempered by dissent has been East Germany's lot since the Nazi takeover in 1933.
Curiously, even sadly, Mr. Honecker liked to think of himself as something of a liberal Communist. He was - but only by comparison with the troglodytes he replaced. He did relax travel restrictions, so that more than a million East Germans were able to visit the West in 1988; nearly all returned. He stopped jamming West German television, and tried in other ways to relax totalitarian controls.
But he could go no further, and ignored the admonition of a visitor named Gorbachev, who remarked on Oct. 7 that ''We have to see and react to the times; otherwise life will punish us.'' Erich Honecker has paid the price, and the message for his successor is written on his wall.

HEADLINE: When Businesses and Schools Join Hands, Everybody Benefits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Companies Step In Where the Schools Fail'' (news story, Sept. 26) says that ''perhaps the most far-reaching effort to create a partnership between business and schools is Boston's.''
Although it has attracted less attention than the Boston Compact, New York State has also made major strides in the area of establishing partnerships between the schools and the business community. The Governor's School and Business Alliance (SABA), organized by Mario M. Cuomo in 1986, has as its fundamental goal the improvement of high school graduation rates and the employability skills of our young people.
SABA focuses on communities with high ''at risk'' student populations and forms alliances of businesses, labor unions, community groups and schools to help students develop the skills needed to pursue post-secondary education and careers. Business and labor assist in curriculum development to meet local industry needs. They offer internships, mentors, part-time or full-time work, exposure to career choices in special industry-related institutes and management assistance to school systems.
There are currently 17 local school and business alliances involving more than 25 cities across New York State. SABA's programs have benefited more than 27,000 students; more than 14,000 businesses, 250 community organizations and 130 schools and school districts participate.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Goodbye to Glasnost

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On the night of Oct. 1, in the kitchen of the Hotel Leningrad, cooks and waiters and other workers assembled around a television set and watched, transfixed, as the American Jim Lehrer interviewed Boris Yeltsin for 23 minutes in English, with Russian dubbed in.
What a moment: there was the leading Russian gadfly being questioned on PBS in the U.S. by a skilled and bold interviewer, with the tape rebroadcast in full before tens of millions in the Soviet Union.
Soviet citizens, unaccustomed to the sight of fearless questioning and fairly frank answering, nodded enthusiastically as Yeltsin directly criticized Mikhail Gorbachev, who is not nearly as popular at home as abroad. Yeltsin warned that the Soviet President, by temporizing, was running out of time, and could not long put off a ''revolution from below.'' 
Criticism was being directed - in the most dramatic and forceful public way - not solely at dead or discredited leaders or the ''old thinking,'' but at the man presently at the top.
I was stunned; this appeared to be a whole new stage of glasnost. A Leningrad University student was less impressed: ''You can criticize everything now,'' she said, ''but you can't change anything.''
Still, the use of the Yeltsin PBS tape on television in the Soviet Union seemed a breakthrough. It refuted the contention, so often put forward in this space, that the vaunted glasnost permitted only criticism that served the Gorbachev interest - and that he would crack down on speech that opposed his interest.
Not so fast; the test was soon flunked. Gorbachev henchmen in the Supreme Soviet and in the lapdog press orchestrated a campaign to destroy Yeltsin's reputation, rehashing the charges of drunkenness while in the U.S. and publicizing a midnight spree after his return.
Too many of Yeltsin's supporters like their vodka for this smearing to destroy their hero. Although his political base is Moscow, the reach of television has extended the Yeltsin popularity to other cities; with the rumpled charm of Arik Sharon and the thematic savvy of Jesse Jackson, he appeals to populist resentment.
If the Soviet Union were a democracy, Yeltsin would probably beat Gorbachev in a free election. When a Moscow editor published a poll last week that made this plain, Gorbachev railed at the press generally and told the editor to quit. Farewell, free speech.
According to an elected official who has seen him recently, ''Gorbachev is upset, unstable, unlike himself of a year ago.'' How does this manifest itself? ''He shouts at his friends as well as his enemies, openly, in meetings.''
Is he cracking up or will he crack down? If his past is prelude, the man who replaced the collective leadership with his own cult of personality will harden and darken his persona, clinging to his position as the Soviet Union's first un-Communist President.
The man likeliest to come after the Good Gorbachev will neither be the flaky Yeltsin nor the grim Ligachev, but the Bad Gorbachev: out of patience, out of sorts, but not out of power. Then we would see what Andrei Sakharov feared: a leader with too much authority abandoning the promises that put him in place.
Consider the great mistake that is at the root of his testiness today:
To reorganize the decaying system, Gorbachev had to destroy the Communist Party and replace it with a government hierarchy under his personal control.
To retain power during this transition, Gorbachev had to rely on the Red Army; accordingly, while promising the West arms reduction, he has increased the Soviet military budget in each of his five years.
But that was a Faustian bargain; the immediate cause of the decay of the system was the huge chunk of the gross national product devoted to arms; because Soviet production continues to decline, the percentage spent on arms is getting higher.
Because this price of retaining power through Red Army backing is so crushing, the economy decays faster and class differentiation becomes more vivid. Soon the threatened party apparat will appeal to the underfed and over-50 to topple the new hierarchy.
My guess is that Gorbachev and the K.G.B. will make a deal with the younger Communists, squelch the radicals and dissidents and separatists, and betray the Red Army leaders - forming a new power coalition to muster out millions, put bread on the table and reassert social control.
The high-water mark of freedom of speech in the Soviet Union may turn out to be the night they let the tape be shown of Yeltsin challenging the benevolent dictator.

For Messinger, Making Friends With Old Foes

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger was running for higher office well before she decided on the particular office - the Manhattan borough presidency, as it turned out - but she does not seem to be waiting for the election to begin her new line of work.
She has, after all, raised nearly all the money she is allowed under the city's public campaign finance law, far more than a candidate who is virtually assured of election would seem to need. So Ms. Messinger has begun a series of mostly breakfast meetings that, while they may not take place at the Regency, are evidence of some of the major shifts in power that are occurring with this election. They also reveal how some of the newly empowered and some of the entrenched are adjusting. 
As a member of the City Council for almost 12 years, Ms. Messinger has represented Manhattan's West Side, where the political ideology is liberal and small is usually beautiful. But she is meeting these days not only with the community groups that have been in her core constituency but also with real-estate developers and business executives, among others. ''The more institutional players,'' she says, ''in economic sectors that I haven't particularly dealt with.''
The purpose is to give them ''the sense that I'm really open to this kind of dialogue,'' she added the other day, after a breakfast with members of the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation.
The breakfasts are an outgrowth of more than 350 ''house parties'' Ms. Messinger has been holding in living rooms since July 1987. They helped her learn to hone her answers, broaden her political base and raise lots of money a little at a time. She does no fund raising in her morning meetings -though those who attend may end up on her mailing list - but she does ask people to help her set up other meetings, so that one breakfast begets another.
At the 14th Street association, she spoke of how the borough president's job would change under the new charter plan, with powers to propose budget items replacing the powers to dispose of the budget that the borough presidents now have on the constitutionally defective Board of Estimate. But her message was also laced with concern about the local economy. The people who do business here, she said, deserve ''a better partnership with the city.''
And she told a recent gathering of real-estate appraisers - over lunch, not breakfast -that ''we need to think about the needs of businesses and what government can do.''
Yes, she said, she knew she had a reputation for questioning the tax abatements and incentives offered to businesses by the Koch administration, but she also told the appraisers that ''businesses have to know that the government of this city is not going to tax them out of profitability.''
''I'm learning a huge amount,'' Ms. Messinger said of the meetings, though she also said they have not changed her politics. Or, for that matter, her proposal, which usually comes up, to arbitrate large rent increases faced by small businesses, a form of commercial rent control that some say would discourage investment in the city.
Still, those who have followed her on the Council know her to be a shrewd budget watcher. And if she has not been considered a friend of developers, she maintains that she was never really their foe.
''My role on the West Side, I think necessarily and appropriately, was to talk about a better fit between the resources the city was investing and what developers wanted to do, because there are serious negative economic consequences for developers and for communities to overdevelopment that has no connection to the physical or social infrastructure,'' she said. ''That then got characterized as being opposed to the projects. I wasn't opposed to the projects. I was opposed to the project as presented and mostly as responded to by the city.''
In any event, a few weeks ago, when Mayor Edward I. Koch and several ranking members of his administration met with officials linked to a lawsuit challenging the Columbus Center project and threatening to make the city's already considerable budget problems worse by $250 million, Ms. Messinger was not only in the Mayor's office but on his side, trying to insure that a project she had opposed in its original and much larger form would finally be built.
Robert Esnard, the Deputy Mayor for Policy and Physical Development, who has found himself pitted against Ms. Messinger in the past, says she now has ''a boroughwide perspective.''
''She's looking at a bigger picture, as she will have to as a borough president,'' he added.
Ms. Messinger offers another explanation. ''People are getting a broader impression of me,'' she says.

HEADLINE: HEALTH;
New Measure Finds Growing Hardship for Youth

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
The well-being of children in America has declined dramatically since 1970, according to an index that measures aspects of ''social health'' like infant mortality and drug abuse.
Particularly devastating to the nation's youth have been sharp increases in the numbers of children and teen-agers who are abused, who live in poverty and who commit suicide, the index found.
A separate index measured the social health of the nation as a whole and also showed a sharp decline since 1970.
The latest year for which full figures are available, 1987, ''was the worst year for children in two decades,'' said Marc Miringoff, director of the Fordham Institute for Innovaion in Social Policy and author of the study. The institute, in Tarrytown, is a social policy research center that is part of Fordham University. 
 
Six Critical Problem Areas
The Index of Social Health of Children and Youth, which Dr. Miringoff prepared for the first time this year, compares data for the years back to 1970. It is a composite measure based on figures from what he described as six critical problem areas: infant mortality, child abuse, children living in poverty, teen-age suicide, teen-age drug abuse and high school dropouts.
''The results are particularly discouraging because of the long-term impact on children's lives,'' Dr. Miringoff added. ''These problems are likely to plague society for many years to come.''
The index combines national statistics, most gathered by the Federal Government, for each of the six problems into a single number on a scale from zero to 100. In 1970 the index for children's social health stood at 68; by 1987 it had plummeted to 37. The highest point was reached in 1973, when the index was at 72.
Experts on social policy say the Fordham index is unusual in combining major indicators of children's well-being into a single summary figure, which can be tracked from year to year.
 
Child Abuse Has Soared
As the index declined, the biggest factor was child abuse. By 1987 the reported incidence of abuse was three times that of 1970. Rates of child abuse have worsened steadily each year.
In part, the increase in child abuse rates can be attributed to improvements in reporting, Dr. Miringoff said. But most of those improvements occurred by the early 1980's. ''Child abuse has continually worsened since that time as well, at a troubling pace,'' he said.
Teen-age suicides are another major source of the downturn in the social health index, with the rate of suicide among teen-agers doubling since 1970. ''In 1987, more teen-agers committed suicide than in any other year,'' Dr. Miringoff said.
A key measure, in Dr. Miringoff's view, is the number of children who live below the Federal poverty line, since poverty underlies other problems in health, education and housing. Since 1970, the number of such children has risen by 25 percent.
''One in five of our children now live in poverty,'' said Dr. Miringoff. ''The latest year for which we have data, 1987, was a particularly discouraging one for poverty among children. Since 1970 the only other time the rates were so high was in the recession of 1982-83. But the recent rise in employment rates and prosperity among upper-income families has not helped the lot of the nation's poorest children.''
 
Improvements Cut Off
Two measures that had been improving in recent years, infant mortality and high school dropouts, both took turns for the worse in 1987. While the rate of high school dropouts had been improving for the previous 10 years, in 1987 it worsened slightly.
Despite the publicity that drug abuse has received in recent years, the rate for drug abuse among teen-agers is one of the few bright spots in the data. ''Drug abuse leveled off in the late 1970's, after a sharp increase,'' Dr. Miringoff said. ''While the figures had been dropping during the early 1980's, they leveled off from '85 to '87.''
While this is the first year the Fordham Institute has published an index on children's social health, for the last several years it has published similar figures for the nation as a whole. For the second year in a row, the figures for the social health of the nation were at the lowest level since 1970, according to Dr. Miringoff's report. The index was at 35 in 1987, down from a high of 72 in 1976. It reached 35 once before, in 1982, in an economic recession.

HEADLINE: Tapestries Depict Life In Chile

BYLINE: By RUTH ROBINSON

 BODY:
ISLA NEGRA, a village on the central Chilean coast, is known on two counts: as the home of the poet and Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda and for the striking tapestries made by its women. The work of the Bordadoras de Isla Negra (Embroiderers of Isla Negra), executed in brilliantly colored wool yarns on sackcloth, has achieved international recognition.
Like the poet, the embroiderers, who are wives of fishermen and farmers, take their inspiration from the thundering waters of the Pacific Ocean and the peaceful countryside. 
In the 1960's a group of women, under the guidance of Leonor Sobrino, a longtime resident, started to embroider as a way of augmenting their income during the winter, when there is little economic activity. Their scenes of rural life by the sea are skillfully stitched in rows of chain stitch that completely cover the cloth, resulting in a painterly effect. There is no clear antecedent in Chilean crafts for their work.
''Aside from the income, it has given them a sense of identity,'' said Eduardo S. Vera, a physicist in New York and a son of Leonor Sobrino.
Some 50 embroiderers each produce an average of one tapestry a year. It takes at least four months to complete a work, and often family duties intrude.
Since the first exhibition 20 years ago at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago, Chile, the embroiderers have been moving in elevated circles. Mar'ia Luisa Alvarez, for example, was included in a show of contemporary still life in 1974 at the Renaissance Society of the University of Chicago, along with artists like Claes Oldenburg, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. Her tapestry of a rabbit shot by her husband amid fruits is typical of the genre, which depicts something from the everyday life of the artist.
Isla Negra tapestries have been presented to heads of state as gifts, and there have been commissions from organizations like the Ford Foundation. Mr. Neruda, an enthusiastic supporter, organized exhibitions in Paris when he was Chile's Ambassador to France.
Mr. Vera's collection includes typical subjects: a fruit stand by Antonieta Munoz, a wheat-threshing celebration by Elena Perez Catalan and a fanciful portrayal of Christopher Columbus crabbing by Francisca Llanca. Atypical is a ski scene by Elsa Araya Castilla. The naive work shows a disregard for the rules of perspective and proportion. A butterfly is larger than the villagers nearby; a threshing scene is depicted within a circle as though seen from above.
The embroiderers have formed a cooperative that supplies the yarn, available upon occasion in as many as 900 different tones, and controls the quality. An authentic Isla Negra embroidery can be identified by the trademark I.N., the initials of the embroiderer and the stamp ''Bordadoras de Isla Negra.''
At the cooperative in Isla Negra, the tapestries sell for around $150; $100 a month is an average worker's salary in Chile. Ninety per cent of the price goes to the artist, the remainder to the cooperative for the purchase of supplies.
The Isla Negra Foundation, established in 1981 to support the group, and to document and preserve the work, is collaborating with the American University in Washington and the University of Chile in Santiago on a half-hour documentary of the women's work. The long-term goal is for a small museum to house the foundation's collection. Further information on the foundation may be obtained from Mr. Vera at 329 West 88th Street, New York, N.Y. 10024.

HEADLINE: Cabaret Convention Ponders a Disturbing Future

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Is there a place for cabaret in today's age of mass entertainment? That is the question being pondered this week on the stage of Town Hall, where a Cabaret Convention is holding a series of discussions and gala concerts that will continue through Sunday.
The convention, which brings together performers and nightclub owners from New York along with representatives from the San Francisco Bay area and from London, was organized with $50,000 from the Mabel Mercer Foundation. Established in 1985, a year after the death of Miss Mercer, the legendary chanteuse whose music epitomized the cabaret spirit, the foundation was created specifically to promote the field of cabaret and to keep alive the memory of the singer, who was a close friend of its founder and executive director, Donald Smith.
The events began on Tuesday with the first of three afternoon panel discussions on the Town Hall stage. Flanked by banners portraying the convention logo - a G clef in a martini glass - a group of performers, club owners and journalists addressed everything from the shaky economics of cabaret to the indifference of television talent coordinators, from singers they perceive as cabaret-oriented to the negative connotations surrounding the very term cabaret. 
 
'A Bad Image in People's Minds'
''The word cabaret conjures up a bad image in people's minds,'' said Erv Raible, the owner of the Greenwich Village club Eighty-Eight's. ''The press is always portraying cabaret as a dying art form. And nobody wants to go see something that they think is about to die.''
Although New York City still has an active nightclub life, the struggle elsewhere to keep cabaret afloat is not being won, representatives from the San Francisco area and London said. Barbara Bladen, a critic for The San Mateo (Calif.) Times, cited the decline in alcohol consumption in the Bay Area as a reason for the decline in nightclub attendance. And Gerald Nachman, a critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, cited a lack of professional show business institutions in the Bay Area as a reason for cabaret's being what he called ''the worst-marketed art form.''
''San Francisco, a city that takes pride in its cultural sophistication, has no full-time cabaret,'' he said. ''The audience pool is down to a puddle.''
 
Conditions in London: Grim
The situation is just as bleak in London, said Robert Cushman, a London producer of radio specials that focus on American popular song and American cabaret performers. He pointed to the 1930's and the heyday of Noel Coward as the peak era for cabaret entertainment in England and said that today London doesn't have a single cabaret.
''I think it will always be economically and sociologically a very fragile form,'' Mr. Cushman added. He went on to suggest that cabaret was the kind of rarefied art form that is normally supported by government subsidy.
It was generally acknowleged by the panel that except for a handful of performers like Bobby Short and Michael Feinstein, most cabaret artists, even those near the top of the field, have a hard time of it economically.
''It's hard to make a living, to pay the rent, the groceries and insurance policies, but if you really love it it's your life,'' said Julie Wilson, who is playing an extended engagement at the Cafe Carlyle.
''Today, people are so hung up on the boob tube,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''When they come in, they treat you like a television and forget that you're a living, breathing creature who needs stimuli. This is the only business that can give you the personal touch.''
 
Brightness Amid the Gloom
The opening day of the convention was not without its upbeat moments. Several panelists pointed to the popularity of one-man shows on Broadway by Mandy Patinkin and Mr. Feinstein as demonstrating the existence of a potentially huge audience for cabaret-style entertainment. The problem, they acknowledged, is getting that audience to go to clubs.
With Mr. Feinstein, Mary Cleere Haran, Karen Mason and Bart Howard among the dozen acts performing at Town Hall on Tuesday evening, the talent overflowed at the first of the convention's four gala concerts. The galas, the last two of which are tonight at 6 o'clock and Sunday at 4 P.M., feature a cross-section of the best cabaret singers from New York and San Francisco, each performing two or three songs, for a bargain ticket price of $5.
Along with the Cabaret Comes to Carnegie concerts at Weill Recital Hall, which are also produced by Mr. Smith, and which opened last night with Elisabeth Welch, these shows are bringing a greater concentration of cabaret talent to New York's stages than the city has seen in many years.

HEADLINE: Housing Construction Fell 5.2% in September

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Housing construction, buffeted by rising mortgage rates, fell for a second consecutive month in September, declining to the weakest pace in seven years.
The Commerce Department said today that construction of new homes and apartments dropped 5.2 percent after a 6.2 percent August decline. The August figure is a revision from a 5 percent drop reported last month. 
September's figure put the seasonally adjusted annual rate of home construction at 1.26 million units, the slowest pace since October 1982.
Many analysts attributed the September decline to builders' concerns about high levels of unsold homes and worries that rising mortgage rates during the month might further crimp new-home sales. Because much of the decline occurred in the South, some analysts suggested that Hurricane Hugo affected construction in that area.
 
A Call for Lower Rates
David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said the weakness in housing demonstrated the urgent need for the Federal Reserve to push down interest rates to keep the economy from toppling into a recession.
Many analysts said they saw signs that the central bank had begun a series of small credit-easing moves. They noted that a closely watched indicator of Federal Reserve intentions, the overnight Federal funds rate, has dropped about a quarter of a percentage point, to 8 3/4 percent, since last Friday's stock market plunge.
The Federal Reserve pumped an estimated $1.5 billion into the banking system today, the third consecutive daily cash infusion since Friday's market turmoil.
While the Federal Reserve's efforts were aimed at reassuring skittish financial markets about plentiful reserves for emergency loans, analysts said the Fed was likely to keep interest rates at lower levels because of the weak housing construction and other signs of a slowing economy.
 
A Dip in Mortgage Rates
Fixed-rate mortgages, which climbed as high as 10.22 percent in early September, have fallen slightly in October and now stand at 9.95 percent, according to a weekly survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
So far this year housing construction is running 6.2 percent below a year ago, with downturns posted in six of the last nine months.
For September, construction of single-family homes fell by 2.1 percent, to an annual rate of 971,000 units, the second consecutive month that the rate has been below one million. Construction of multifamily units was down 14.1 percent, to an annual rate of 292,000 units.
In a disturbing sign for the future, permits for new units dropped as well in September, falling 2.4 percent, to 1.30 million units.

Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher predicted today that the United States and Mexico would eventually negotiate a free trade agreement similar to one that went into effect with Canada on Jan. 1, and said the two countries had already discussed the subject informally.
''We should not try to push them too fast, too hard, but they are interested, extremely interested, in moving toward this - they want to take it a step at a time,'' Mr. Mosbacher, once a Texas oilman, told the Senate Banking Committee.
To be sure, the subject of broader agreements with the United States is still a politically sensitive one in Mexico, which has a long history of distrust of its northern neighbor. 
A free trade agreement could be a hard sell in the United States as well because of American labor and business sensitivity over competition arising from cheap Mexican labor.
 
Seminal 1987 Accord
Earlier this month Mexico and the United States signed less far-reaching agreements intended to enlarge mutual trade and investment, broadening a seminal 1987 accord providing for talks on trade disputes.
The Canadian free trade arrangement, which took more than two years to conclude, calls for elimination of tariff barriers by the year 2000, along with reduced barriers to trade in financial and other services and greater investment freedom.
Mexico is the third-largest trading partner of the United States, after Canada and Japan.
Today's statement by Mr. Mosbacher marks the first time the Bush Administration has openly acknowledged that it holds out similar prospects in its relations with Mexico.
The talks about a hemispheric economic union, in which goods would move freely without tariff barriers, have been spurred by the policies of greater openness in trade and investment by Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid.
 
'Serious Possibilities'
''A few years back a free trade zone with Mexico was discussed only by romantics, but now it really has serious possibilities,'' said one American business representative, William T. Archey, the international vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The minister for economic affairs at the Mexican Embassy here, Manuel Suarez-Mier, said that ''at this stage'' his Government was ''not prepared to undertake any bilateral free trade negotiations with anyone.''
''We still are trying to catch our breath after the fullest and deepest opening that any country has accomplished in history,'' he said.
Before the de la Madrid administration, Mexico had pursued policies of economic and trade nationalism. The first sign of the shift came in August 1986, when it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free trade charter, to which nearly 100 other nations subscribe.
 
Debt Crisis Hearings
Mr. Mosbacher's comments were made during a Senate hearing on the impact of the Latin American debt crisis on American trade. The hearings included testimony on the effect on United States businesses of Latin America's import curb, intended to husband the debtor countries' money so they will be able pay interest on loans.
''In one country after another major projects have been postponed or canceled because the Government did not have the money to pay for them,'' said Fred R. Jones, vice president and treasurer of Combustion Engineering Inc.
Largely because of the contraction in its Latin business, this big capital equipment supplier had to cut overall employment from 47,000 to 30,000, Mr. Jones told the lawmakers.

HEADLINE: British Unit Challenges Deloitte's Merger Plan

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Deloitte Haskins & Sells's British affiliate, which had previously rejected the accounting firm's proposed merger with Touche Ross, said yesterday that it would sue ''to prevent the unauthorized use'' of the Deloitte name worldwide.
Deloitte's British roots go back to 1845, and its name is well known throughout the world. It received priority when the British firm of Deloitte & Company joined the American firm of Haskins & Sells in 1978. 
The architects of the Deloitte-Touche merger had agreed to call their worldwide firm Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu. Tohmatsu is Touche's Japanese affiliate. The merger has been ratified by partners of the firms in some countries, including the United States and Japan, but the deal has not been completed.
The threatened lawsuit is viewed by some as a setback for completion of the deal. Completion is not expected before Dec. 1; the original date had been Nov. 1.
Earlier this month, Deloitte's British affiliate decided to join Coopers & Lybrand, rather than the Deloitte-Touche combination. The affiliate said yesterday that it had begun legal proceedings against Deloitte's American firm and Touche's British affiliate.
Deloitte's affiliates in the Netherlands and the Channel Islands have also decided to join Coopers. The British and Dutch affiliates, Deloitte's second and third largest, contributed more than $500 million in revenues last year, which would be 14 percent of the $3.8 billion combined worldwide revenues of Deloitte and Touche.
''If the goal of most of these mergers is to have no more than 10 percent fallout, as they all say when they get into them, then you might consider this a not-so-successful merger,'' said Thomas LaFreniere, editor of the International Accounting Bulletin.
John Bullock, a senior partner of Deloitte's British firm, said in a statement, ''This course of action was very much a last resort.'' He cited his firm's inability to obtain assurances from either defendent as to how they might use the name.
In a statement, Deloitte said it had not been served with, nor had it seen any, papers filed by its British arm. But based on the affiliate's public comments, ''We believe their action to be without merit,'' Deloitte said.
Touche Ross officials in the United States did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
A senior Deloitte partner in the United States said he doubted that the litigation would undermine the merger in those countries where it had been approved.
Others like Michael J. Wolff, however, were less sure. A former Touche partner who now heads strategic marketing at Richard A. Eisner & Company, a large regional accounting firm, Mr. Wolff said that the defections were especially troubling since both firms pursued the merger largely to pool resources for the economic unification of Europe.
Without the British and Dutch affiliaties, he said, it would seem the merger would bring ''more grief than opportunities.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Steady; Trading Slow

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed yesterday in slow trading, despite a report that showed housing starts were at their lowest level in more than five years.
Although the report was weaker than economists had expected, the market response was positive, and prices moved higher.
But those gains soon eroded, as dealers pondered the potential implications for the credit markets of the California earthquake and braced themselves for a coming rush of new securities.
 
Two Auctions Scheduled
Yesterday the Treasury said it would sell $10 billion worth of two-year notes on Tuesday. Separately, the Resolution Funding Corporation announced it would auction $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds on Oct. 25. 
The Resolution Trust sale comes on the heels of Wednesday's $2 billion sale of bonds by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Underwriters said 5 to 10 percent of those bonds remain unsold, but market participants said the issue was struggling yesterday.
''There is plenty of supply in the long end,'' one government bond trader said. ''The short end of the maturity curve is trading O.K., but long rates might have to back up a little from here to get these bonds sold.'' 30-Year Bond at 101 By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 101, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.03 percent.
Prices of shorter-term Treasury note issues were only marginally better. In late trading, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 29/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.01 percent. And the 8 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 1/4, up 1/32, to yield 7.93 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed. By late in the day three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.49 percent, down a basis point, or a hundredth of a point. Six-month bills were unchanged, at a discount rate of 7.51 percent.
Early in the session, worries abounded about the earthquake. Traders speculated that in order to honor earthquake-related claims, insurance companies would be big sellers of Treasury securities. And market participants were on the lookout for any problems in the California financial system, since the ability of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to conduct normal operations was unknown.
 
Worries Prove Unfounded
Yesterday at least, the worries proved unfounded.
''There was some selling of long securities early in the day,'' one government bond trader said. ''But then we started getting reports that the amount of damage is around $1 billion. That is a large number, but a $1 billion loss does not produce a lasting change in the securities market.''
Francis H. Schott, senior vice president and chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, said: ''In the case of the property and casualty companies, most of the risk has already been spread to insurance companies worldwide. I don't think the earthquake per se would make anyone change their investment policy.''
 
Fed Bank Functioning Normally
Donna Drake, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles branch of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said that while the volume of transactions flowing through the San Francisco office was somewhat lower than normal, the bank was functioning normally.
''Operationally, the Fed is up and running,'' she said. ''There have been no problems at all. The bank has its own emergency backup power, and when the power went off the backup kicked right in.''
The overnight Federal funds rate, which might have moved erratically if a disruption in the bank's check-processing capabilities had been impaired, traded in a narrow range of 8 3/4 to 8 5/8 percent yesterday.
Participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market said that prices of outstanding California securities dipped by anywhere from three-eighths of a point to three-quarters of a point, depending on the issuer.
 
California Moves Dismissed
''Those moves aren't really indiciative of anything,'' one municipal bond trader said, ''because there is not a lot of California paper around. The $450 million issue that the State sold last week got gobbled up. It's not like somebody came in and sold a $100 million portfolio of bonds.''
Prices of most secondary municipal issues fell by about a quarter of a point in quiet trading, dealers said.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland priced a $50 million offering of 8 percent debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The debentures, which mature Oct. 15, 2029, carry a ''put,'' or price guarantee, to investors on Oct. 15, 1996. The debentures were priced at $99.68, to yield 8.06 percent, 8 basis points above the prevailing yield on seven-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Move Seen on Oil Stockpile

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The Bush Administration will stop buying Mexican oil for the United States emergency stockpile early next year, ending an eight-year supply link aimed in part at aiding the debt-ridden Mexican economy, people close to the situation said today.
The Administration and the Mexican state oil company, Pemex, agreed that an existing supply contract expiring on Nov. 30 would not be renewed, said an Energy Department staff member who asked not to be identified. 
Additional Mexican oil will be purchased for three months beyond the contract's expiration to satisfy a minimum volume requirement, he said. The arrangement is to be announced next month, according to an internal Energy Department memorandum.
Starting in December, the Energy Department will meet its stockpile needs by soliciting bids for short-term supply deals with domestic and foreign suppliers - the usual practice before the Mexican contracts started in 1981.
In August 1982, at the height of Mexico's foreign debt crisis, the Reagan Administration agreed to pay Mexico $1 billion in advance for oil to be put in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The decision to end contract purchases from Mexico is in part the result of a growing constraint on Mexico's ability to produce enough high-quality Isthmus crude to meet both export and domestic demand, the person at the Energy Department said.
The reserve, started in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo, is intended to give the United States enough emergency supplies to weather any future disruption of oil imports.

HEADLINE: Resolution Funding in $4.5 Billion Bond Sale

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Resolution Funding Corporation, established by Congress last summer to finance the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry, announced yesterday that it would auction $4.5 billion worth of 30-year bonds to the public next Wednesday.
The offering is the first of what are expected to be quarterly sales of bonds until the corporation's $50 billion in borrowing authority is exhausted. The first $20 billion was borrowed by the Treasury Department in the third quarter. 
Although Congress has authorized $50 billion for the bailout, experts in and out of Government have said that to solve the savings and loan problem Resolution Funding will ultimately sell far larger amounts of bonds.
William L. Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, voiced those sentiments when he testified before Congress on the savings and loan bailout package earlier this month.
 
Good Reception Expected
Credit market participants, who earlier in the week speculated that the offering might include some 40-year bonds, said that the offering held no surprises and that the issue should sell well.
''The auction will go well, even if the dealers won't make as much money as they would on a negotiated deal,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting concern. ''When all is said and done, I expect that the issue will sell at a premium over 30-year Treasury bonds of about 25 basis points.'' A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.22 percent.
Unlike Treasury securities, the corporation's bonds are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. But in effect the securities do carry a de facto guarantee.
 
Backed by Zero-Coupon Bonds
Before issuing its bonds, the corporation will purchase zero-coupon Treasury securities directly from the Treasury. The principal amount at the maturity of the zero-coupon securities will equal the principal amount of Resolution Funding obligations.
''The lack of a guarantee is purely a legal formalism,'' said Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates. ''In effect, there is a separate guarantee from the Treasury on the principal repayment and interest coupons.''
To explain the different format and to drum up interest in the securities abroad, representatives from the corporation held meetings last week in London and Tokyo with potential investors.
A similar session was held in New York on Friday, a gathering that Mr. Crandall said was hastily prepared.
''At the last minute, they put together a very hurried meeting for New York dealers,'' he said. ''It wasn't very smart of them to do that.''

HEADLINE: Times Co. Profit Bolstered By Special Gain in Quarter

 BODY:
The New York Times Company yesterday reported third-quarter earnings of $210.8 million, or $2.68 a share, compared with $26.7 million, or 33 cents a share, in the comparable period last year. Revenues came to $415.3 million, up 6.4 percent from $390.5 million a year ago.
The results for this year's third quarter included an after-tax gain of $193.3 million, or $2.46 a share, from the sale of the Times Company's cable television system and another $1.1 million in discontinued operations. Excluding that gain, earnings from continuing operations dropped for the quarter by 34.9 percent, to $16.4 million, or 21 cents a share, from $25.2 million, or 31 cents a share. 
Times Company executives attributed the decline in earnings from continuing operations to expenses from the acquisition of three magazines, lower earnings from the forest products group and a decline in advertising linage at The New York Times. These problems are expected to continue to hurt earnings in the near future, the company said.
''While the fundamentals of our business are strong, there are several factors which will cause the company's earnings from continuing operations to be down both this year and in 1990,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the company's chairman and chief executive.
 
'Softness in Advertising'
Mr. Sulzberger said that a continued ''softness in advertising'' brought on by the weakness of the New York region's economy would most likely continue to reduce earnings. Advertising linage at The Times for the third quarter declined by 8.7 percent, to 23.6 million lines.
The acquisition of three magazines - McCall's, Golf World and Sailing World - reduced earnings by about 7 cents a share in the latest quarter. The write-offs of certain assets acquired with the magazines are expected to reduce earnings by about 9 cents a share in the fourth quarter and 24 cents a share in 1990.
Mr. Sulzberger said earnings had also been affected by an oversupply of newsprint, which has depressed its price, and a strong Canadian dollar, which lowered the value of the company's newsprint interests held in its forest products group.
The Times's new printing plant in Edison, N.J., is expected to begin operating in 1990. Mr. Sulzberger said that move would involve heavy start-up and depreciation costs. He added that the Edison operation should ultimately result in increased revenues and labor savings, but that those benefits would not be realized ''until after a break-in period.''
 
Newspaper Group Gains
In the newspaper group, which consists of The Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in The International Herald Tribune, operating profits for the quarter increased to $34.9 million from $34.5 million. The company attributed the gain to a strong performance by the regional newspapers, lower newsprint costs and budget tightening.
The circulation of The Times for the six months ended Sept. 30 reached a record high of 1,068,000 copies on weekdays, up 2.8 percent, and 1,628,100 copies on Sundays, up 1.7 percent. Sunday circulation for the regional papers in that period was up 3.7 percent, to 833,500, while weekday circulation rose 3.9 percent, to 853,600.
The magazine group, which consists of 17 publications, reported an operating loss of $4.5 million for the quarter, in contrast to an operating profit of $2.5 million in the 1988 quarter. Excluding the costs related to the acquisitions of the three magazines, the group's operating profit would have advanced over the results in the 1988 quarter, the company said.
Operating profits in the broadcasting and information services group increased to $2.6 million in the quarter, from $2.5 million a year ago. A factor in the increase was higher local advertising revenue at the company's television stations.
Equity in earnings in the forest products group dropped 58.7 percent, to $2.6 million from $6.3 million.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Weaker in U.S. While Gold Prices Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended weaker yesterday against key foreign currencies after a mixed performance overseas.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $368.70 an ounce, up $1.30 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $367.70 an ounce, also $1.30 higher. 
Currency dealers said the dollar sank in overnight trading on news of the earthquake in California, but it regained some ground on the strength of the stock market.
Robert Ryan, senior currency trader for the Bank of New York, said an unconfirmed report that the Federal Reserve moved to buy dollars early in trading also helped support the dollar. However, most dealers dismissed those rumors.
Traders said the market was awaiting today's release of Consumer Price Index figures for September, hoping they would shed more light on the direction of the economy and inflation.
 
Dollar Declines in Japan
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 142.10 Japanese yen, from 142.25 yen Tuesday. It traded at 141.40 yen in London and New York, compared with 142.70 in New York Tuesday. The dollar was lower against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.5880 in London, up from $1.5835 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound was worth $1.5922, up from $1.57575.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.8485 West German marks, down from 1.8672; 1.6243 Swiss francs, down from 1.6365; 6.2810 French francs, down from 6.3475; 1.17335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17555, and 1,362.00 Italian lire, down from 1,400.00.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex silver bullion for current delivery closed at $5.105 an ounce, higher than Tuesday's bid of $5.102. Silver fell in London to $5.11 an ounce from $5.12.

HEADLINE: A Body for Better Men to Beat On

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER

 BODY:
Dave Jaco sometimes works on short notice.
That's not unusual for that species of fighter used for building the records of rising young attractions. In the boxing business, they are known simply as opponents.
Jaco, a heavyweight who lives in Sarasota, Fla., is an opponent. 
At the age of 34, he has no illusions of competing for a world title.
In January 1986, when Jaco fought a hot young contender named Mike Tyson, it was, as it so often is, a last-minute call that summoned him to the ring. At the time, Jaco was in Atlanta, earning $50 a day, plus meal money, as a sparring partner for Tim Witherspoon, who was training for a World Boxing Association heavyweight title fight against Tony Tubbs.
 
Vicious Reputation
''Tyson had just made the cover of Sports Illustrated,'' Jaco recalled. ''Kid Dynamite, they called him. And because of the reputation he was getting as a vicious puncher, the promoter was having a hard time finding a guy to fight him. Nobody wanted to get in the same ring with Tyson. They offered me $5,000 to fight Tyson. Five grand sounded like a lot. Back then I was always behind on child support for my twin boys, Adam and Aaron. I took the fight. I didn't care. I'd been in tough fights a lot of times before.''
The bout, fought in Albany, ended quickly.
''I got decked three times in the first round,'' Jaco said. ''The third time I went down, the bell ending the round rang. I went back to my corner, talking to myself: 'What are you doing? The guy is knocking the stuffing out of you.'
''That's when the referee told me the fight was over. Three knockdowns ends a fight. At that point, I thought I'd been down only twice. 'No,' my corner man said. 'You were down three times.' That tells you about Mike Tyson's punch.''
Since Tyson knocked him out, Jaco has been stopped often. Tony Tucker, Johnny Duplooy, Mike Evans, Gary Mason, George Foreman, Alex Stewart and, most recently, Tommy Morrison, all beat Jaco by knockout. #37-Second Bout For the fight against Morrison, Jaco was contacted 48 hours before the match after Morrison's original opponent, Danny Sutton, canceled. For a $2,000 purse, Jaco trekked from Sarasota by car and, when the car broke down, by plane, to Jacksonville, Fla., a trip that quickly seemed not worth the bother.
Jaco lasted 37 seconds of the first round against Morrison, who knocked him out with a powerful left hook. After the 6-foot-6-inch, 201-pound Jaco was counted out, he crawled two paces to his corner on his knees before his second could get to him and help him to his stool.
Jaco holds a 1985 victory over Tyson's next opponent, Donovan (Razor) Ruddock: it is Ruddock's only defeat. But even Jaco, whose record is 21-17 (18 knockouts), acknowledges that lately he has been merely a body for better men to beat on.
''But even though I'm a common opponent,'' Jaco said, ''I don't go in there thinking I'm a loser. Promoters know I don't go down with a phantom punch. Every time Tyson knocked me down, I got up.''
Jaco's boxing odyssey began relatively late. He was 24 years old when he was laid off from his $300-a-week job as a pipefitter at Interlake Steel in Toledo, Ohio, in 1979.
''It came at a bad time,'' Jaco said. ''I felt kind of, like, lost. I was hurt from a divorce and the fact that my wife got custody of the boys. I had no job, just $180 a week unemployment.''
 
Discovered a Knack
When a friend who was an amateur fighter suggested Jaco join him for a workout, Jaco discovered he had a knack for the sport. It led to his competing in Tough Man contests in Pontiac, Mich., and Toledo (he won the Ohio event), and that in turn nudged him to a pro boxing career in 1981. Although he had no amateur fights, Jaco won his first 12 bouts as a pro.
''I was 25 years old and still unemployed,'' Jaco said. ''At that time, boxing was a kind of dare. As I won my first 12 fights, I developed a bit of a following, 30 or 40 fans who'd travel to where I fought.''
Jaco's first loss, a first-round knockout in June 1983, was to Carl (the Truth) Williams for a purse of $3,000. Other losses followed, too regularly to suit Jaco. But when he got custody of the twins, he kept fighting for money he could add to the $350 weekly paycheck he draws as a delivery driver for a Sarasota appliance company. The $10,000 he earned for fighting Foreman, and getting knocked out in one round, in December, was his best payday as a professional.
''When I started out, I figured maybe one day I'd become a contender,'' Jaco said. ''These days, I give it my best. But I'm always rusty. My timing is off. I have a fulltime job. I just can't devote myself like you have to.''
 
Trips to Emergency Rooms
Through boxing, Jaco has traveled the world: Dusseldorf, West Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Windsor, England. And he's also been to the emergency room of more than a few hosptials.
''I've had 65 stitches, a broken cheekbone, a fractured nose, a fractured bone in my eye and fractured ribs,'' Jaco said.
The toll of hard times has him talking lately of ending his fight career.
''It's too easy to get hurt,'' Jaco said. ''With my boys to raise - they're 12 years old now - I'm figuring to fight one more time this year, on the live card to the Leonard-Duran closed-circuit show here in Sarasota, and then retire so I can concentrate on them.
''I want to make sure they grow up right. The world is so corrupt. And things happen. Like their friends know I'm a fighter, so the boys are expected to be that way. I have to tell them: 'You don't make friends being mean.' Just because your dad is on TV, and gets beat up, doesn't make you any meaner.''

HEADLINE: A BROAD PROGRAM OF AID TO POLAND IS VOTED BY HOUSE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly today to set up a major new program to support democracy, private enterprise and the development of a free-market economy in Poland.
The legislation would establish a similar but smaller program for Hungary.
The bill, which was strongly supported by both Democrats and Republicans, would permit the spending of up to $837.5 million in aid to Warsaw and Budapest over the next three years.
 
The President Acquiesces
President Bush acquiesced in the bill while expressing reservations about its cost. He has proposed a much more modest program of aid totaling $455.5 million. 
The bill was approved by a vote of 345 to 47. It was supported by 217 Democrats and 128 Republicans, and opposed by 13 Democrats and 34 Republicans.
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the chief deputy whip for House Democrats, declared: ''We have poured trillions into a nuclear and conventional arms race with the Soviet Union. We can surely afford millions to support the fragile experiments in democracy in Eastern Europe.''
The size of the majority supporting the bill reflected in part the effectiveness of lobbying by Polish-American groups in and around big cities like Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York. Mr. Bonior's paternal grandfather came to the United States from Poland, and as a child Mr. Bonior learned to speak Polish as well as English. His Congressional district, in the suburbs of Detroit, includes many Americans of Polish ancestry.
 
Excitement Over Recent Change
House members argued that the United States had an extraordinary chance to promote democracy in Poland and Hungary and that the opportunity might be lost if Congress did not move swiftly to provide more aid than Mr. Bush had requested.
The debate was marked by excitement over the changes taking place in Poland and in Hungary, where the Communist Party has adopted a platform calling for free markets and free elections.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, said Congress was writing a new foreign policy for the ''post-Marxist era.'' Representative Donald E. Lukens, Republican of Ohio, declared: ''Socialism as an economic theory is dead. Long live the free market.''
In September, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a bill to provide up to $1.25 billion in aid to Poland and Hungary over three years. It appears likely that some version of the legislation will become law, with the precise amount of aid to be decided through negotiations between the House and the Senate.
 
Dispute Over Shipping
The only issue that provoked bitter debate in the House today was a proposal to waive a Federal law under which 75 percent of American food aid must be carried in American-flag ships. Supporters of the waiver said the cargo preference provision would increase the cost of shipping and thereby reduce the value of food that could be delivered to Poland.
The bill earmarks $125 million for food aid to Poland this year. Representative Tom Tauke, Republican of Iowa, estimated that 30 percent of that money would be spent for shipping and transportation of surplus commodities.
Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, offered an amendment to reduce the cargo preference requirement so that only 50 percent of the food aid for Poland would have to be carried in American-flag ships. The House rejected her proposal by a vote of 228 to 170.
More than 85 percent of the aid in the House bill would go to Poland, where a Solidarity-led Government took office in September. Poland's population of 38 million is more than three times that of Hungary.
The bill would provide $200 million to foster private enterprise, including small businesses and farms, in Poland and Hungary; $200 million in loan guarantees and insurance to finance the export of American goods and services to Poland, and another $200 million to promote long-term economic growth and stability in Poland.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said Monday that the United States was prepared to provide Moscow with advice and technical assistance to help restructure the Soviet economy and society. But in debate on the House bill today, Democrats said the Administration seemed grudging in its response to changes in Eastern Europe.
Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, said the Administration's actions ''fall short'' of its oratorical commitment to democracy in Poland and Hungary. Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the Administration ''sat idly by'' when Poles were trying to replace their Communist rulers.
In an official statement of Administration policy, the White House said that ''President Bush has taken the lead in supporting reform in Poland and Hungary and has worked with Congress to insure that comprehensive legislation is enacted on an urgent basis.'' But it said, ''The Administration has reservations about the excessive funding levels contained in this legislation and also has various constitutional concerns.'' The Administration did not specify its constitutional concerns.
 
Help for Private Businesses
The House bill calls for the creation of a Polish-American enterprise fund and a Hungarian-American enterprise fund to channel Federal money to private businesses in Eastern Europe. Of the funds provided by this section, $160 million is for Poland and $40 million for Hungary.
The bill would also permit the United States Environmental Protection Agency to spend up to $10 million to reduce pollution of the air and water in Poland. In addition, the bill would provide $30 million to help Poland modify its boilers, furnaces and industrial equipment to reduce pollution from the burning of coal.
The bill also encourages educational and cultural exchanges, providing up to $10 million in scholarships for Poles and Hungarians to study in the United States. It would also provide $5.5 million for Polish-American cooperation in science and technology, with $2.5 million for similar projects between Hungary and the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Yield on Philippine Bases

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
American officials are prepared to negotiate an entirely new military bases agreement with the Philippine Government that will acknowledge increasing Philippine concerns about sovereignty, Western diplomats say.
The agreement is expected to include joint-use arrangements like those common for American military bases in NATO countries and Japan.
The Americans ''are prepared to discuss a relationship that is more fundamentally equal'' and puts both country's armed forces ''side by side,'' a diplomat said, so long as American operational flexibility remains.
 
Plan to Share Clark Air Base
Technically, the bases are already jointly operated, with Filipino and American base commanders. But Philippine military activity at the bases is negligible. As an example of the change proposed by the Americans, the diplomat said, a second runway being built at Clark Air Base and scheduled to be finished in early 1991 would allow the Americans to invite the Philippine Air Force to move its main installations to Clark. 
''These are the last two major bases that haven't moved to joint use,'' the diplomat said. ''This is the last basing agreement to be updated.'' For Filipinos sensitive to sovereignty, this, too, seems an insult.
The two major bases are Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station, among America's largest overseas installations, and there are four smaller ones, including a spot devoted to rest and recreation. Subic Bay has been a Navy base since 1904, and Clark became a permanent military base in 1903.
Clark is the only major American tactical air base in Southeast Asia, but it would be more easily and cheaply replicated than Subic, which can support combat operations of several carrier battle groups and logistics for naval operations throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans.
 
U.S. Looking for a New Agreement
Negotiations to extend American access to the bases are the hardy perennials of Philippine diplomacy. Almost as soon as an agreement is signed, the Manila Government begins prodding Washington to renegotiate.
Rather than fight with the Filipinos over when the current base agreement expires, the Americans will seek to have a new agreement in place beforehand. Manila says the expiration date is Sept. 16, 1991, according to the 1987 Philippine Constitution; Washington says it is 12 months later, citing the agreement text, which specifies a year's notice before abrogation.
President Corazon C. Aquino, who will visit Washington next month, has agreed that talks will begin this December in Manila. While her advisers say she favors a continued American military presence, her active support for any new agreement - regarded as crucial by the Americans -will depend on its terms, political as well as financial.
Base-related American aid is now $481 million a year, and Washington has pledged a further $200 million a year as its contribution to an assistance plan involving other aid donors like Japan. Philippine officials say they will ask for an increase when the negotiations begin in December but have not settled on a figure.
 
Surging Anti-Base Sentiment
But anti-base sentiment is growing, especially among city dwellers and the elite - most dramatically expressed by a Senate resolution that calls for the removal of the bases in 1991 signed by 12 of 23 senators.
Even the ground for the debate has shifted considerably, American officials say. Previous base talks - there have been a long series since the original, much-modified agreement of 1947, when the United States granted the Philippines its independence - have concentrated on rights, jurisdiction, perquisites and money, with extension a given. But today the boundaries of the debate range from immediate removal of the bases in 1991 to the negotiation of a final extension, to allow a sensible and economically efficient phaseout.
Senator Rene V. Saguisag, an Aquino backer who thinks that the bases are outdated and that the American presence here maintains Filipino immaturity, says: ''The debate has shifted from Stars and Stripes forever to 5 or at the most 10 years. We're talking of outright termination or of a limited extension only.''
While Washington wants a 15- or even a 20-year ''transition,'' many Filipinos who are pro-base think five years is long enough. Even the pro-American right wing and the Philippine military favor a final extension of 5 or 10 years.
Fidel V. Ramos, the Defense Minister and a potential presidential candidate, says he wants the bases out by 1998, the 100th anniversary of the Philippines' fall from Spanish to American control.
 
Balancing Force in Region
The other countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, while formally committed to making the region a zone of neutrality and thus unhappy about the military presence of a foreign power, nonetheless regard the Americans as a relatively benign balancing force, keeping the Russians, the Chinese as well as the Japanese in bounds.
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore has been explicit about the need to keep the Americans in the region, and has tried to help the prospect along by offering to have American military bases in Singapore. But Singapore can offer nothing that begins to replace the Philippines bases, and no other Asean country is likely to.
Faced with complaints about limited sovereignty from Filipinos, American officials tend to respond with paeans to the two countries' long relationship and with a recitation of economic benefits: the bases are the country's second-largest employer after the national Government, providing jobs for nearly 80,000 Filipinos; they contribute over $1 billion a year to the economy, contribute 4 to 5 percent of the gross national product and effectively represent the country's eighth-largest trading partner.
Subic and Clark have also spawned strips of cheap restaurants, bars and brothels, and while American officials rarely mention these indirect economic benefits, some Filipinos consider them important, however degrading.
 
'Slaying the Father Image'
But the economic arguments are regarded as less important to many Filipinos than the issue of nationalism and sovereignty, a feeling that seems to cut across the political spectrum.
Senator Saguisag, a leftist who was Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, says: ''So long as we depend on Uncle Sam, we'll never lose our political adolescence. We can't be one-tenth colonialized and nine-tenths free.''
Mrs. Aquino's Foreign Minister, Raul S. Manglapus, a longtime nationalist, says Manila ''must slay the father image'' to grow up.
Leticia Ramos-Shahani, a former United Nations diplomat and chairwoman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, worries about economic disruption and thus favors a final phaseout of five years. But she can be caustic about the United States, saying that Americans rarely take Filipinos seriously and patronize them.
''America's only colony is the weakest economic performer in Asia,'' she said. ''The economic foundation you helped to establish in Taiwan, South Korea and other places was not done here. It's an indictment and the United States has to deal with that.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Look to Policy on East Germany as Next Big Challenge

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is reviewing American policy toward East Germany, seeking a balance of encouraging democratization there without also fostering a pell-mell movement toward reunification of Germany that would threaten both Moscow and America's NATO allies.
The replacement of Erich Honecker as head of the Communist Party and growing internal pressures for change in East Germany have strengthened the perception among Administration officials that the way they respond to developments between East and West Germany could become their next major foreign policy challenge. It is not one that everyone welcomes.
''With Poland and Hungary we can encourage reform and self-expression without feeling it is in any way inconsistent with American interests,'' a senior policy maker said. 
''But when you support the same things for East Germany you are knowingly accelerating a process which would make the ultimate reunification of Germany more possible. The more similar East Germany is to West Germany the more easy it will be for the two to fuse. The more different they are, the more difficult it will be. Which do we really want?'' For several decades the United States had a very simple policy toward East Germany: The Berlin wall should be removed and East and West Germany should be peacefully reunited. But Washington assumed this was unattainable -and preferred it that way.
''The situation we have had with the Germanys for 45 years has been unnatural but stable,'' said Herbert S. Okun, a former United States Ambassador to East Germany. ''Now that we are moving toward a situation that is more natural the question is how do we preserve the stability.''
 
Three-Dimensional Policy
A range of senior officials said the Administration is evolving a policy on East Germany that has three basic dimensions. On one level, the Administration has decided that it both can and should continue to encourage gradual change in East Germany.
It should do this, officials say, because only an East German government based on more free market and democratic foundations can prevent a popular explosion. Such an explosion, these officials fear, would almost certainly provoke a domestic crackdown or Soviet intervention.
Administration officials believe they can afford to encourage change in East Germany because they consider the prospects for reunification remote at this time.
The Administration is operating on the unstated assumption that the Soviet Union will not allow a merger of East Germany into West Germany, given the fact that it serves as the strategic anchor of the Warsaw Pact.
 
Conditions on Reunification
But Administration officials say they would be foolish simply to assume that German reunification is impossible, which brings up the second dimension of East Germany policy: For the first time, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has begun to talk publicly about the conditions under which Washington would be ready to see German reunification.
Mr. Baker uses the word German ''reconciliation'' instead of ''reunification,'' partly to avoid European anxieties and to convey the message that such a merger must be voluntary and take place on Western terms.
A secondary motive in Washington's support for integration of the European Community in 1992, a senior Administration official said, ''is to insure that West Germany has a strong anchor in laws, commerce and values in the West so that if and when it is drawn east it does so on the basis of being fully integrated into the Western economic and political union.''
This underscores the third dimension of American policy: work closely with Bonn. West Germany is the only NATO member with the economic and political resources, and the penetration of East German society, to promote the kind of evolutionary change in East Germany that would prevent a political collapse, or a popular explosion.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Is Quayle Out of Tune On U.S. Soviet Policy?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle went to California this week. Because he was there when the earthquake struck, he had a golden opportunity to generate some favorable publicity for a change, to show himself capable of reacting to events quickly and effectively.
Instead he managed to generate further controversy.
Speaking with reporters in San Francisco on Tuesday, Mr. Quayle dismissively referred to Mikhail S. Gorbachev as General Secretary and not as President of the Soviet Union. And he condemned the idea that the United States might help with the Soviets' attempts at political and social reforms. 
''Let them reform themselves,'' he commented.
''The United States does not pin our hopes on one man,'' the Vice President said in a speech in Los Angeles the same day. ''The Soviet Union remains our potential adversary.''
All of which might sound normal enough coming from a conservative Republican from Indiana. Except that he is now the Vice President in an Administration whose policy toward Moscow is considerably more accommodating, and except that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in a speech in New York the night before that was widely advertised as a restatement of basic United States policy, had said Washington was ready to dispatch experts to the Soviet Union with advice and technical assistance on overhauling the Soviet economy.
Perhaps Mr. Quayle hadn't got the message from the Baker speech, or perhaps he had got it, didn't like it and decided to challenge it.
If either of those hypotheses is true, it shows a disarray in the Administration that goes considerably beyond recent conflicts involving the environment and a program that provides expanded medical benefits for the elderly.
American policy toward the Soviet Union is, after all, the linchpin of American foreign policy in general; most people would say it is not a fit subject for an open argument between two senior officials, both of whom supposedly speak in the name of President Bush.
The Washington Times, one of the few Eastern newspapers to pay much attention to Mr. Quayle's remarks, quoted an aide as saying Mr. Quayle was playing ''the bad cop'' against Mr. Baker's ''good cop,'' and said his comments constituted a direct rebuttal to the Secretary of State's speech in New York.
But there is another possibility. Mr. Quayle was chosen by Mr. Bush as his running mate primarily to reassure the conservative wing of the Republican Party, which has always suspected Mr. Bush of being a closet moderate. Perhaps Mr. Quayle's statements were intended by the White House as further reassurance that Mr. Bush is ''reliable'' whatever Mr. Baker might have to say.
If that is the case, it opens the Administration to charges of cynically playing penny-ante politics in a highly sensitive policy area.
David Beckwith, Mr. Quayle's press secretary, failed to return telephone calls seeking clarification of the Vice President's motiviation.
After the earthquake Tuesday evening, Mr. Quayle returned to Northern California, where he inspected the damage from a helicopter, visited the hard-hit Marina district near the Golden Gate Bridge and then met with officials in Alameda County, east of San Francisco, to discuss the need for Federal assistance. Mayor Art Agnos of San Francisco, a Democrat, said he planned to meet the Vice President later.
But Mr. Quayle never showed up for their conference, prompting Mr. Agnos to issue this criticism: ''I understand he was in the Marina and in the shelters and then left. If he did so without visiting the Mayor, I have real questions about what he was doing here. It may have been just a publicity stunt.''
By today the Vice President was back in Washington to meet with Mr. Bush. Asked about the Mayor's comment, he replied, ''I think that's very unfortunate to take that kind of shot at a very difficult time. I was there to help people. We're going to make sure we do the best that we can to help the people in San Francisco.''
The White House defended Mr. Quayle, asserting that Mr. Agnos had declined an invitation to join a group of small-city mayors meeting with the Vice President. But it also announced that Mayor Agnos was one of the officials who would accompany Mr. Bush on his visit on Friday.

HEADLINE: THE CALIFORNIA QUAKE: COMMERCE;
Businesses in Bay Area Hope for a Quick Return To Life Almost as Usual

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 19

 BODY:
It was business almost as usual today in the Bay Area as the banks opened for business, the hotels began restocking food and the computer chip producers operated at full speed.
To be sure, some problems remained. Many office buildings in San Francisco were still shut, awaiting the full restoration of power. Lines for gasoline formed at some service stations. 
But less than 48 hours after Northern California was shaken by a strong earthquake, economists and company spokesmen said they were optimistic that the long-range impact on private businesses would not be large.
They acknowledged that the closing of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge will make their employees' commutes more difficult. But they said they do not anticipate problems with either receiving materials or shipping products out of the area. They also noted that with the exception of Santa Cruz, near the epicenter of the quake, and the Marina district in San Francisco, the greatest physical damage was to public property.
 
'Snap Back Quickly'
''We were sort of comforted when we sat down and added things up,'' said Frank McCormick, vice president and senior economist for the Bank of America. ''So much of the area survived so well that the damage is relatively limited,'' he said. ''I expect the economy to snap back quickly.''
Mr. McCormick said the reconstruction of the Bay Bridge and the collapsed section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland will be ''a boon to private companies contracted to do the work.''
''There will probably actually be an increase in hiring in the Bay Area and an increase in wage income,'' he said, although he added that this will be offset by the loss in private wealth caused by damage to homes and small businesses.
The contrast in mood with a day earlier was marked. On Wednesday the lines of ashen-faced tourists awaiting airport buses outside darkened hotels seemed to bode ill for the city's tourism. But today tourist industry officials said they were confident that business levels would return to normal fairly quickly.
 
Some Cancellations at Hotels
''There was a mass exodus yesterday,'' said S. Dale Hess, vice president of public affairs for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''We've got a lot of cancellations in the hotels,'' he said. But while three or four conventions have been canceled, at least one is still on, and the hotels are all up and running again, he said.
''We're going to have our ups and downs between now and the end of the year,'' Mr. Hess said. ''Some people are jittery and will use the quake as an excuse to do something different.''
''But then it will fade,'' he added. ''In the long run this doesn't affect our ability to be a major tourist attraction.''
He said the Gray Line's bus tours of the city would resume Friday. The Red and White Fleet's Bay Cruise service continues, he said, although with reduced frequency because some of its boats have been pressed into service as ferries between San Francisco and Oakland. The cable cars are operational but not running because traffic signals remain out along their routes. The San Francisco Symphony will perform as scheduled Friday night, although tonight's performance was canceled.
The high-technology Silicon Valley, to the south of San Francisco, emerged relatively unscathed, even though it was closer to the center of the quake.
The major semiconductor fabrication plants were all running by Wednesday, having shut down for only one or two shifts immediately after the quake hit. The three leading computer chip companies all said they anticipated no problems in receiving materials or shipping finished products.
 
'We Were Lucky'
''We were lucky in that Silicon Valley's buildings are really new, the vast majority less than 15 years old and many newer than that,'' said John Greenagel, a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices in Sunnyvale. ''They're built not only to earthquake codes, but also to avoid vibration altogether,'' he said. ''They're more like bomb shelters.''
In fact, the fabrication plants fared better than office structures. Barbara Krause, a spokeswoman for Apple Computer, said the company was able to take orders and build and ship products and parts as usual. But she said some administrative buildings suffered structural damage, either from the quake itself or from sprinkler systems activated by the quake.
Nor did the quake cause any serious shutdowns in computer systems. Wells Fargo & Company said its computers, in downtown San Francisco, were up by 1 A.M. on Wednesday morning. About 92 percent of Wells Fargo's automatic teller machines were operating today. The only ones still down are in hard-hit areas, like Santa Cruz and the financial district of San Francisco.
The Bank of America, a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corporation, said all but 10 of its branches are open, and all systems are up and working. About 1,250 of the bank's 1,500 California automatic tellers are working.
Ron Supinski, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that cash remained available after the quake, but that banks had difficulty getting armed carriers Wednesday because of a lack of drivers. ''We get a sense of urgency from banks who want to have enough money for weekend openings,'' he said. ''But we get no sense of a critical situation in the supply of currency. Most of these banks have their own cash vaults.''
And although motorists in some areas experienced lines at gas stations, the Chevron Corporation said shortages were limited to areas where closed or damaged roads have caused limited access. The company's refinery, across the bay from San Francisco in Richmond, and its pipelines throughout the Bay Area are operating at normal capacity.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Builder's Plan Cuts Down Payments

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
One factor holding back home ownership in New York City, as in other parts of the country, is the difficulty many would-be buyers have in amassing enough savings for a down payment.
Now Martin Berman, a Staten Island developer and a principal in B&B Builders, has found a way around the problem by borrowing a technique from the big commercial real estate deal makers in New York City: He is offering land leases.
By offering to sell a house alone, and rent the land under the house to the buyer, he hopes to lower the down payment to a level more people can afford.
''The down payment is the biggest problem we have in the first-home market,'' said Mr. Berman, whose development, called Estates at Oakwood, is at Clark Avenue and Amber Street in the Richmond/Oakwood section of Staten Island. 
''We have two-income couples walking through the door that have earnings of $75,000,'' he said, ''but they haven't been able to accumulate a down payment. They've been paying very steep rents in the city and money has been flying out the door for them.''
Instead of selling house and land together for $150,000, Mr. Berman is offering three-bedroom town houses for $90,000 plus an annual land rent of 6.5 percent of the $60,000 price of the land, or $325 a month.
There is a $12,000 difference between the $30,000 down payment needed for a $150,000 house-with-land deal and the $18,000 needed for a $90,000 deal on the house alone. That $12,000 is an important sum for a couple living in one of the most expensive, and therefore most savings-resistant, cities in the country.
Mr. Berman is offering his houses for spring occupancy. Those who lease the land have an option to buy it at any time. The price of the land will be adjusted annually according to the Consumer Price Index, which is generally used to indicate the nation's rate of inflation.
Since land in the city has generally risen in value faster than the rate of inflation, that sounds like a good deal, even though the rent payments on the land are not deductible from taxable income as mortgage payments are.
''I don't have any desire to collect rents on land for 40 years,'' he said. ''We're builders and we want to sell houses, so I assume that the majority of our customers who lease the land will eventually opt to purchase it.''
The builder agreed that the tax logic, for once thing, would certainly encourage a home buyer to acquire the land as soon as possible.
A 10.5 percent, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $120,000 on the full price for land and house would cost $1,098 a month, of which about 95 percent, or $12,500 on an annual basis, would be deductible from taxable income in the first years of the mortgage. If the buyer was in the 28 percent bracket, the net monthly cost of carrying the house would be $800.40 after taxes.
For a $78,000 mortgage on the house alone, the monthly payments would be $713 for the loan plus $325 for the land rent. If 95 percent of the $8,556 in annual mortgage costs were deductible as interest, then the net after-tax monthly cost would be $488, plus the land rent, or $813 - more, under this tax scenario, than the cost of the house and the land together. Nevertheless, the deal would make sense for a buyer who could not make the larger down payment.
Estates at Oakwood is a nearly completed development of some 500 one- and two-family houses and town-house rows put up by several builders on former cemetery land - never used for burials, the developers hasten to add. The tract is flanked by the United Hebrew Cemetery to the north and Valhalla Burial Park, also known as Oceanview Cemetery, to the south.
The houses, which have garages, are of traditional colonial design, with clapboard siding and peaked roofs with dormers.
Mr. Berman's three town-house designs follow the clapboard approach, but with brick facing on the ground floor surrounding the entrance and the garage. In the model dwellings completed, the second-floor living rooms have small balconies overlooking the street.
Much of the tract is heavily wooded, and it has been left undeveloped under guidelines of the South Richmond Special Zoning District. The use of dead ends and loop streets adds to the project's rural look.
But dollars-and-cents reality, more than appearance, drives the housing market in today's real estate economy, Mr. Berman said.
''It is no surprise and no secret that we are experiencing a soft market right now,'' he said. ''This land-lease idea is something that we thought about for a number of years, but it was not necessary in the past.''

HEADLINE: We Already Know the Folly of Decriminalized Drugs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It seems to me that the spate of pro-legalization articles that have appeared recently in The Times are founded on a misconception, namely that drug use has not already been decriminalized. Drug use underwent a de facto decriminalization in America some 20 years ago. From the Hollywood celebrity publicly snorting coke at a party to the teen-ager smoking marijuana in front of his high school, Americans have ceased to worry about criminal penalties for drug use. It is the failure of decriminalization that we are living with now. 
Prohibitions against drug use are not founded in some abstract and hypocritical morality, as is often implied. Advocates of legalization seem curiously unable to distinguish gradations in human behavior. The argument that it is impermissible to outlaw drugs because people are legally ''addicted'' to coffee or aspirin is the ludicrous extension of a feeble train of thought. Teen-agers are not prostituting themselves in Times Square to buy another bottle of aspirin, nor are men and women destroying their families for the sake of another cup of coffee. It is not merely the sale and distribution of drugs that is destroying lives. It is the effects of the drugs themselves and the things that people do under their influence that are the real hazards to the lives and happiness of millions of our citizens.
I suggest we try actually enforcing penalties for drug use and see if that has any effect before we give up and turn our society into a drug bazaar. Or possibly we should simply admit what A. M. Rosenthal perceptively argued in his column of Sept. 26, that the lives currently being destroyed by drugs are not lives most Americans consider important. Mr. Rosenthal's analogy of drug use to slavery was a particularly apt one. Slavery was defended by many citizens as being an economic necessity, while abolitionists were ridiculed as moralizing meddlers or naive idealists.
However, even if charity and morality do not compel us to abolish this new form of slavery, prudence should, for we must remember that throughout history the well-off have never succeeded in finding a refuge remote enough to protect them from the results of the injustices they have inflicted upon the poor. Our society is creating a class of slaves who have been stripped by drugs of pity, hope, love, kindness and even fear, and I think that their retribution will eventually fall on all of us.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Waiting for the Big One

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
''The big one'' has not yet hit the San Francisco Bay Area, the experts tell us, or southern California. That's small comfort to the thousands bereaved or devastated by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake, but it's a clear warning even to those Americans who live nowhere near the San Andreas Fault.
It's a warning for all of us because an earthquake can happen anywhere and is always unexpected by the public - maybe it'll happen next year, or even next month, but not now. In areas not considered earthquake-prone, moreover, citizens are less likely to be prepared and are thus the more vulnerable. 
But there's a practical lesson in the Bay Area disaster, too, particularly in the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway. We need not wait helplessly for the big one; earthquake damage can be reduced significantly by adequate preparation.
More than 60 years ago, Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel survived the great Tokyo earthquake, because of a pioneer design that made the structure more flexible than was then customary. This week, skyscrapers in San Francisco merely swayed because they were built, with the San Andreas Fault in mind, on the same flexibility principle.
The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 40 miles from San Francisco, reported no damage, owing to an external steel reinforcement system built after an earthquake nine years ago. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory at Palo Alto also escaped damage, having been built to move in one piece under earthquake pressure, rather than breaking apart.
Some older, perhaps stronger but more rigid buildings collapsed. The Nimitz Freeway, for example, was described by Paul Goldberger of The New York Times as ''nearly prehistoric by today's standards.'' It was built between 1949 and 1954, before earthquake resistance became part of structural design.
Any number of older highways, bridges and public works throughout the nation, like the Nimitz Freeway, are structurally deficient or worn out. Such weaknesses have been amply demonstrated in the collapse of bridges on the New York Thruway, on an Interstate Highway in Connecticut and elsewhere.
Aging infrastructure is a problem in itself - witness the water main breaks that plague New York and other older cities. An earthquake shaking such an unprepared city would cause unimaginable damage to gas mains, sewage systems, underground power and communications lines, ancient bridges and roadways.
Even without natural disasters to accelerate the problem, ''America's infrastructure is crumbling,'' the engineer Frank T. Callahan said in a recent interview with The Times. As president of a design company in Texas, he estimated that more than 40 percent of the nation's bridges are structurally deficient, or obsolete, and that 60 percent of its 2.1 million miles of paved roads require renovation.
A major reason is postponement of maintenance to save money. The Federal Government, for shameful example, has refused to spend an accumulated $29 billion in user fees for highways and other projects, in order to make the budget deficit appear smaller. Growth in its overall maintenance expenditures has been sharply reduced since the 1960's, though the infrastructure to be maintained is older and more extensive now than then.
Mr. Callahan believes that eventually it will cost about $3.3 trillion to solve the infrastructure problems caused by inadequate maintenance spending - a penny-wise but pound-foolish policy, whether or not another earthquake ever shakes a major American city.
That's in addition, of course, to the new and improved facilities - urban services, airports, highways and (I would add) rail lines - that a growing and mobile population inevitably will demand. Nothing is more vital to Americans now or in the future than the redemption, maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure that makes a modern nation-state possible.
It's idle to ask where the money to pay for a vast building and repair program can be found. It's available, of course, in the enormous wealth of America, if only President, Congress, the states - and the public - will decide to spend it that way.
Deficit spending? Yes, but with demonstrable payoff - in jobs, rising purchasing power, decreases in unemployment costs and perhaps in crime, new enterprises, improved technology, the adequacy of the infrastructure and the resulting economic gains, enhanced tax revenues - not to mention earthquake resistance.
I'd call that investment, of the kind that in the Interstate Highway System changed the nation and its economy forever.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Speaking Blasphemy

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The issue is not perestroika. The issue is not Mikhail Gorbachev.
The issue is how to move above and beyond Soviet Communism, crippled but still struggling to survive, to a free life for all who suffered for so long and still suffer today. The issue is zavtra - tomorrow. 
But through his own brilliance and the mental flabbiness of the West, Mr. Gorbachev has been able to hide those real issues. It is one of his greatest triumphs - and is taking place right now - in the West, while Western leaders and intellectuals cheer, yawn, fawn or stare, uncomprehending.
He has managed to set the agenda, define the issues, proclaim the goal and limit the participants in what should be one of the great political discussions of the 20th century.
''We want perestroika to succeed,'' says Secretary of State James Baker.
He is strewn with petals. At last he seems to be following the path of righteousness as laid out by Mr. Gorbachev and trodden by so many American journalists, academics and politicians, who feel that to stray from it is unpatriotic and blasphemous.
What is perestroika that we should worship it?
Perestroika is not a religion. It is not even a plan. It is a hope - the frantic hope of the Gorbachev Politburo that ways can be found to prevent total economic collapse while making sure the system of state socialism and Communist Party paramountcy survives.
But to hope to put breath into the Communist system, Mr. Gorbachev needs help from the West. He needs to spread Western technological knowledge within the information desert that Communism made of the Soviet Union.
Even more he needs the acquiescence of a people who detest the Communist system for giving them nothing but a bare existence after 70 years of hardship and sacrifice under tyranny.
He and his Politburo opened windows to new thoughts and allowed political and intellectual freedoms greater than anybody had thought possible in the Soviet Union. This permitted the peoples of captive Eastern Europe to strike out for their own freedoms.
For this Mr. Gorbachev has been important to the world. But now this is a key issue: Shall the West commit itself to the Gorbachev tomorrow as long as it envisions the preservation of Communism - a system in which a party and a few men will always control the levers of real power?
To decide that the United States is committed to perestroika, as Mr. Gorbachev defines it, is to decide that the preservation of the Communist system is also the American goal.
That is an obscene thought. Even so, it will not work. Western help would be pouring water into the sand, as Andrei Sakharov put it. The system is too sick, the people's opposition to it too strong.
One argument for strong Western support of Mr. Gorbachev is that something fearful might follow him. That may turn out to be the Gorbachev we are already glimpsing - preventing strikes, calling out the troops, furiously denouncing press criticism.
But yes, it is likely that inside the Soviet system there are far more dangerous men, men who would try to replace Mr. Gorbachev with a return to Stalinism. Certainly, which is exactly why we should listen to the voices of those in the Soviet Union who want neither Stalinism nor Gorbachevism.
They feel in any Communist system there is always the danger of the ''good'' dictator being replaced by the evil dictator - or suddenly turning into one himself. They do not want Communism to be put on an international respirator. They want it to die, so they can breathe free.
The West acts as if these people do not exist - the tens of thousands who spent decades in political jails for speaking of freedom and the men and women in small groups now trying to coalesce into the Democratic Alliance.
Washington and American foundations should be searching out these people, helping them get an audience at home, inviting them to the United States. Americans should have a chance to hear from Soviet citizens who do not think it their duty to save Communism through some kind of reform. Then maybe we won't think that either, Mr. Baker.
The United States certainly should not try to tear down Mr. Gorbachev. If rebellion is mounted against the Communist system he wants to preserve, it will be by his countrymen, not us.
But surely we have one duty - not to ally ourselves against those who have other dreams of how to get from today to tomorrow, and what zavtra should be.

HEADLINE: Plan Would Reassign Power on Land Use

SERIES: CITY CHARTER: THE VOTER'S TURN - FOURTH OF SIX ARTICLES

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Since land is to New York City what oil is to Houston, it is not surprising that changes in the regulation of land use proposed by the Charter Revision Commission have divided planners, developers, environmentalists and many others.
The commission has proposed a system for governing the use of public and private land that mirrors the outline of the current system but with the City Council generally substituting for the Board of Estimate as the final arbiter.
There are some differences, though, and opponents say they represent major flaws in the charter plan. The commission and its supporters contend that the proposal would improve the way the city oversees the use of its most precious resource. 
Most land-use and zoning initiatives currently go through a public review known as ULURP, an awkward acronym for Uniform Land-Use Review Procedure. Community boards first take an advisory vote on most proposals, after which the initiatives go to the Planning Commission. Then the Board of Estimate takes final action, approving, disapproving or modifying the proposals. The Planning Commission has seven members, all appointed by the mayor. The Board of Estimate includes the three citywide officials - the mayor, Council president and comptroller - and the five borough presidents.
 
New Commission
The charter commission has proposed abolishing the board and giving most of its major zoning and land-use powers to the Council. The plan also calls for the creation of a new 13-member planning commission, with seven members appointed by the mayor, one by the Council president and one by each borough president.
Under the proposal, many zoning and land-use matters would be reviewed by the planning commission and would then go automatically to the Council for final action. These would include zoning changes, urban-renewal plans and the sale of some city-owned residential property.
Other matters, particularly the selection of sites for incinerators, shelters for the homeless and other municipal projects, would be reviewed by the planning commission and then would go to the Council only under limited circumstances. If the affected borough president and community board objected to the planning commission's decision, they could appeal it to the Council. The Council could also decide on its own, by a majority vote, to review a planning commission decision.
The new charter would also require the planning commission to devise rules to assure that neighborhoods receive their fair share of city projects, both desired ones like playgrounds and libraries and unwanted ones like jails and drug-rehabilitation centers.
Each year, the mayor would provide a new citywide ''statement of needs'' that would list all proposed city projects and indicate in which boroughs they would be placed.
Borough presidents could then propose specific sites for the projects slated for their boroughs. If the mayor later chose a different site, his proposal would require approval by 9 of the 13 members of the new planning commission, two more than an ordinary majority.
The goal is to foster compromise and avoid the passionate, divisive debates that have accompanied proposals for AIDS centers, shelters, incinerators and other municipal uses in recent years.
Proponents of the revised charter contend that it strikes a fine balance. The Council would resolve major or controversial land-use decisions, but it would not be overwhelmed by thousands of less significant matters that the much smaller Board of Estimate now resolves.
''The Council has to be policy oriented or solving political controversy,'' said Eric Lane, the charter commission's executive director. ''If you would give the Council all these decisions, they would either pay no attention to each item, or there would be log rolling all over the place.''
 
Questions of Democracy
The land-use proposals are being opposed passionately by people divided into two camps. One faction contends that it is not democratic enough because too many matters would be decided solely by the planning commission, an appointed body.
The other asserts that the plan would be too democratic. Too many elected officials, or their representatives on the planning commission, would get to rule on zoning and land use, they say, making it difficult to get disputed projects approved.
Critics in the first group think all land-use matters should go to the Council for final action. ''That's the critical issue,'' said Marcy Benstock of the Clean Air Campaign.
Ms. Benstock and other environmentalists contend that the mayor, with seven appointees, would dominate the new planning commission. They also argue that the City Council would not often take jurisdiction over difficult land-use issues if it could avoid doing so.
 
Loss of Perspective
''You're giving one person, the mayor, control over all the real estate in the city,'' Ms. Benstock said.
Other opponents, including some planners and developers, say the proposal would give the Council too much power over land use, encouraging parochialism. They say a large political body like the Council would find itself unable to approve the municipal projects that answer citywide needs but are opposed by neighborhoods.
''The concern is that it's going to be impossible to get anything done,'' said Willa Appel, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council.
''What has happened essentially is that the citywide perspective in land use has been pretty much eliminated,'' said Ms. Appel, who contrasted the proposed charter with the current government structure, in which the mayor appoints the entire Planning Commission, and the three citywide officials have a 6-to-5 voting majority on the Board of Estimate. (Each citywide official has two votes, and the borough presidents have one each.) 'Localized and Parochial'
''We don't want to be critical of the Council, but by its nature it is a different body,'' Ms. Appel said. ''Members represent their local constituencies, and their concerns are by nature going to be more localized and parochial. For a city to function, you've got to be able to site facilities that people don't want, and that includes low-income housing and jails and sanitation facilities.''
Mr. Lane, the commission's executive director, said major or controversial proposals would be decided by the Council, and less politically charged matters would be resolved by the planning commission, whose membership would be more diverse.
''We have democratized the planning commission a certain amount without politicizing it entirely,'' he said.
Mr. Lane said he believed the Council would be able to withstand local pressures and would decide where to place undesired projects. ''We have faith in the democratic process,'' he said. ''We think the Council will want to make the city work.''

HEADLINE: A.T.&T.'s Income Rises 19%; 'Baby Bell' Profits Are Mixed

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Reflecting the continued strong growth in long-distance calling, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company yesterday reported a 19 percent increase in its third-quarter earnings.
But four of the regional ''Baby Bell'' telephone companies reported mixed results for the third quarter.
Net income fell 14.8 percent at the Nynex Corporation, 8.9 percent at U S West Inc. and 12.6 percent at the Pacific Telesis Group. Still, it rose 6.5 percent at the Bell Atlantic Corporation. 
A.T.&T., the nation's largest long-distance company, said it had earned $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $587 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose about 1 percent, to $8.9 billion from $8.8 billion.
Analysts said A.T.&T.'s increase in earnings was in line with their estimates and reflected the high growth and operating margins of the $50 billion long-distance telephone industry. A.T.&T.'s two main competititors, the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, have also reported substantially higher earnings for the third quarter.
A.T.&T.'s shares gained 87.5 cents yesterday to close at $43.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. The analysts predicted that A.T.&T. would earn about 65 cents a share in the fourth quarter, $2.50 a share for 1989 and $3.05 for 1990.
A.T.&T. said sales of long-distance services had risen 6.4 percent and calling volume had risen 5 percent in the third quarter, mainly because of an increase in business and international calling. The company said revenue growth from pay telephones, operator services and residential customers slowed in the quarter because of increasing competition from other companies. But it said higher revenues from installation, maintenance and finance services had contributed to the quarter's increase.
A.T.&T.'s product sales fell 3.6 percent in the quarter, mainly reflecting low demand for network-switching equipment, price competition and strikes at some regional Bell companies, A.T.&T. said.
The company also said price cuts on some telecommunications products had reduced profit margins. A.T.&T.'s operating margin was 13 percent in the quarter, compared with 11 percent in the 1988 quarter. Operating income rose 18 percent as a result of an increase in service revenues and a decrease in the cost of service. Expenses as a percentage of revenue held constant at about 35 percent, A.T.&T. said.
''While these earnings are strong, they are also a mixed bag,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. ''It is very rare these days that a blue-chip stock would have earnings up 18 percent. That is due mainly to the strong growth in long-distance, which we expect to continue. But when you look at their products sales, it's a different, disturbing, horrible story.''
A.T.&T. also announced yesterday that it would offer a sweetened pension plan to encourage early retirements. It said the plan would double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with pension payments. Managers who retire before Dec. 30 will receive an additional 15 percent on their monthly pension for up to five years or until they reach age 65.
 
Nynex
Nynex, which serves New York and New England, said its net income fell to $288.7 million, or $1.47 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $338.9 million, or $1.72 a share, in the 1988 period. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $3.31 billion, from $3.18 billion.
Nynex attributed the earnings decline to ''significantly higher Federal and state taxes and higher interest costs.'' It said its expenses had risen $119 million because of costs associated with acquisitions and growth in its nonregulated operations.
Also, Nynex said, a strike by 60,000 employees had reduced installations of telephone service.
''Our net income is not where we would want it to be at this point,'' said William C. Ferguson, Nynex's chairman. ''This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone. A continued softness in the New York City area economy and intensifying competition, particularly in the private-line market, have had an impact on earnings.''
Nynex's shares gained $1.625 to close at $81.125.
 
U S West
U S West, which provides local service to states in the Rocky Mountain region, said its profits fell to $258.1 million, or $1.39 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $283.2 million, or $1.55 a share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue fell 4.3 percent, to $2.32 billion from $2.43 billion.
Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive, said the 1989 third-quarter results were not fully comparable with last year's results because of a one-time charge resulting from a rate settlement in Minnesota.
U S West's shares gained 75 cents to close at $71.25.
 
Bell Atlantic
Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said its earnings had risen to $363.2 million, or $1.82 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $341 million, or $1.72 a share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue rose 5.6 percent, to $2.9 billion, from $2.8 billion a year earlier.
Raymond W. Smith, chairman and chief executive, attributed the earnings increase to strong growth in business access lines and telephone use. Mr. Smith said improvements at Bell Atlantic's unregulated businesses, like cellular mobile telephones, financial services and real estate, had added to the growth.
Bell Atlantic's shares gained $1.50 to close at $100.625.
 
Pacific Telesis
Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, said that its third-quarter earnings fell to $278 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $318 million, or 75 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue slipped slightly to $2.37 billion from $2.38 billion.
Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive, said the company's cellular phone unit had experienced sharp growth and contributed $16 million to the third-quarter profits, compared with $5 million in the 1988 quarter.
Pacific Telesis's shares gained 87.5 cents to close at $45.50.

HEADLINE: Pretoria and Banks In $8 Billion Debt Pact

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 19

 BODY:
In what the Government described as one of its most significant achievements this year, South Africa and foreign banks have reached an agreement to defer repayment of a large part of the country's debt.
Bankers said the action was inevitable, but some of South Africa's critics reacted with surprise and outrage.
The governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Chris Stals, disclosed today that $8 billion in Western bank loans due next June would be refinanced.
 
Credibility Restored
The announcement suggested that South Africa had restored its credibility among bankers, and it appeared timed to coincide with the Commonwealth summit meeting in Malaysia, at which sanctions against Pretoria are being discussed.
At the Commonwealth meeting, Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia proposed a plan today to intensify financial pressure on South Africa, calling for banks to impose tougher conditions on day-to-day trading loans, limiting the term of the loans to 90 days. He also called for the International Monetary Fund to explore a supportive financial package for Pretoria dependent on structural political reform. 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said financial inducements could help persuade Pretoria to make needed changes.
At the same meeting, Canadian officials suggested that the Commonwealth hold off on new sanctions for six months to encourage Pretoria to release Nelson Mandela, the black political leader, lift a four-year-old state of emergency and pass legislation to dismantle apartheid.
Anti-apartheid leaders had hoped that the outstanding loans would make the Government of the white minority vulnerable to economic pressure from the West. Critics of South Africa have been urging Western bankers to call in the loans, seeking to precipitate a reprise of the financial crisis that developed in 1985 when banks demanded that up to $14 billion be repaid.
In response to the debt announcement, Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu said today that while he needed expert advice to study the full implications, he thought that the banks had colluded with the Government to help it escape pressure.
''I deplore the collaboration of the banks with the evil system prevailing in South Africa,'' Archbishop Tutu said. ''They give capitalism a bad name and as they close off peaceful avenues for bringing about fundamental change in South Africa, they increase the prospects of violence.''
In Washington, Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the subcommittee on Africa, said in an interview: ''I'm very disappointed with response of the banking community. This action represents an enormous boost for the defenders of apartheid. At the time that pressure is being mounted to bring about negotiations, this action is taken that substantially reduces that pressure.''
In a series of meetings with the bankers in Western Europe and the United States over the last two months, Mr. Stals and other officials negotiated what is effectively a three-and-a-half-year extension of the loans that are due in June 1990. The officials were believed to have cited President F. W. de Klerk's recent promises of political change to persuade the bankers that punitive measures were unnecessary.
Finance Minister Barend J. du Plessis called the refinancing by Mr. Stals and his team ''one of the most important events in South Africa this year, especially as far as the economy is concerned.''
Under the agreement, South Africa will repay $1.5 billion to lender banks over three and a half years from June 1990 to December 1993. This amounts to 20.5 percent of the $8 billion in the ''net'' of loans affected by a freeze of South Africa's debt liability. The net refers to a freeze on loans that could not automatically be rolled over because of Western economic sanctions.
Repayment of the remaining $6.5 billion will not have to be negotiated until 1994. South Africa reportedly owes an additional $12 billion in loans not directly affected by the freezes. Of that amount, at least half is estimated to have been converted from short-term credits to longer-term obligations.
 
Longer Deferment Than Expected
One economist here said he was surprised that the Government managed to get a 42-month extension, since the expectation was that the banks would grant no more than a year.
According to information from the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations, made available by the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, South Africa owes $21 billion over all, of which $14.5 billion is commercial bank debt.
The two United States banks that were on the committee that negotiated the deal with South Africa are the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation and J. P. Morgan & Company. A spokesman for Citicorp said it was not on the committee. Citibank is not part of the new $8 billion rescheduling agreement. That is because in 1987, during the last rescheduling, Citibank converted its short-term credits to 10-year loans.
The chairman of the committee is National Westminster Bank. Other European banks on the committee are: Barclays, Standard Chartered, Credit Lyonnais, Banque Indosuez, Dresdner Bank, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, the Swiss Bank and United Bank of Switzerland.
In his statement today, Mr. du Plessis stressed that the phased repayment of the $1.5 billion in loans maturing next June would still be painful.
''All South Africans must realize that the country faces tough times in the next four years in which we have to repay $8 billion in foreign debt,'' Mr. du Plessis said. ''It is an unnatural state of affairs having to export such a large amount of capital to repay debts,'' he said, referring to the nation's total liability.
''The only way South Africa could deal with the issue is to follow very strict monetary and fiscal policies in an attempt to maximize growth within these restrictive parameters,'' the Finance Minister said.
He did not say what these policies would be, but they seemed likely to include further curbs on Government and consumer spending and new surcharges on imports. South Africa's inflation rate exceeds 15 percent and its prime rate for loans rose earlier this week to 21 percent. Its economic problems are not caused exclusively by Western sanctions but reflect outside factors like the drop in the world price of gold, an important export. So far, South Africa has managed to repay its debts, in good part because it continues to run a trade surplus with the rest of the world.
 
First Payments Modest
The new arrangement is structured so that the first installments of the $1.5 billion to be repaid will be relatively modest, because $2 billion more in foreign loans outside the net will be due in the first six months of 1990. Mr. Stals said this repayment would increase total debt liability next year by only $100 million.
The subsequent installments will double to 3 percent of the total principal every six months as the pressure of other loans declines, with a last installment of 1.5 percent due in December 1993.
South Africa has an additional $7 billion to $9 billion in loans maturing outside the net during the agreement, according to Nallie Bosman, the managing director of the United Bank here. Mr. Bosman was quoted by the South African Press Association as estimating that about $2.5 billion a year would have to be repaid in this period.
Mr. Stals did not disclose the rate of interest South Africa would pay on the maturing loans after their extension, but he and Mr. du Plessis said nothing to indicate that it would be substantially higher.
 
Strain on the Country
The refusal of some Western banks to renew their loans to South Africa in 1985 imposed severe strains on the country's balance of payments. The South African rand fell sharply against the dollar. The Government declared a four-month moratorium on debt repayment and the stock and foreign exchanges had to close for four days. The crisis precipitated a capital outflow amounting to $11 billion over the next four years.
With this lesson, South African officials have tried to diminish the country's vulnerability. Mr. du Plessis told Parliament in May that South Africa had reduced its total foreign debt in real terms from $24 billion in September 1985 to $18.5 billion at the end of 1988.
''I am relieved we no longer face a crisis in June 1990, but this does not mean there is less pressure on the balance of payments,'' Mr. Stals said tonight. ''We will meet our new commitments as we did the previous ones - with difficulty.''

HEADLINE: Dow Rises By 39.55 in Wide Gain

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices moved up sharply yesterday as traders reacted to encouraging inflation news and to indications that the Federal Reserve might be willing to allow interest rates to fall further.
On the second anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.55 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,683.20, and encouraged some traders to believe the market was ready to make a prolonged recovery. For a few minutes after 3 P.M., the Dow was up more than 60 points, above 2,700.
The bellwether indicator had plunged more than 190 points on Friday before bouncing back 88 points on Monday. On Tuesday, it lost only about 18 points and gained almost 5 points Wednesday. 
 
Volume Advances
Volume on the Big Board rose to 198.1 million shares, from 166.9 million shares on Wednesday.
While the increase in the Dow was less than half that on Monday, yesterday's rise was far more broadly based, with 1,235 shares advancing on the New York Stock Exchange and 355 falling.
The strength extended to secondary issues. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index gained 4.74 points, to 382.81. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52, to 470.80.
Traders said that when the Federal Reserve Bank executed four-day matched sales yesterday, and thereby drained reserves from the banking system, the Federal funds rate remained at 8.75 percent instead of rising. They said the market immediately interpreted this as a signal that the central bank was tolerating a further decline of credit beyond the easing it extended when the stock market fell.
 
C.P.I. Lower Than Expected
The Department of Labor reported that the Consumer Price Index for September was up two-tenths of 1 percent, less than the expected four-tenths of 1 percent. At the same time, inflation-adjusted earnings rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
''The lower-than-expected C.P.I., aided by a strong bond market and program trading activity, pushed the market to new post-Friday-the-13th recovery highs,'' said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Management of Princeton, N.J.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.37, to 347.13, while the Big Board composite index added 2.85, to 192.17.
''The C.P.I. was better than expected, which gives some hope that the Fed will ease its monetary policy,'' said Harold A. Mackinney, head of the investment policy committee at the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ''There are $350 billion in money market funds, and with interest rates declining, money is looking for a permanent home.''
He said that currently the stock market, as measured by the Dow, was selling at only 11 times earnings. ''This is a modest multiple with the inflation rate only about 4.5 percent,'' he added.
In apparent dividend-capture plays, Puget Sound Power and Light was the most active issue, unchanged at 21 3/8, on a volume of nearly 4.2 million shares.
Dow components with strong gains included Philip Morris, up 1 1/8, to 44 1/2, and A.T.&T., up 7/8, to 43 3/8.
The Dow Jones transportation average dropped 15.64 points, to 1,263.51, as U.A.L., parent of United Airlines, fell 1 5/8, to 190 1/8, while A.M.R., holding company for American Airlines, slipped 5/8, to 73 3/8. Both airline shares fell rapidly early in the week after takeover bids evaporated.
But some other takeover stocks that had suffered showed signs of revival. Walt Disney, the subject of speculation but no bid, jumped 4 points, to 124 1/8, while Holiday, which is restructuring, gained 1 7/8, to 73.
Mr. Barbanel said that ''technology stocks had a particulary good day.'' I.B.M. rose 2 3/8, to 104 1/8, on the announcement of a $1 billion stock buyback plan, while Compaq gained 4 5/8, to 111 1/8, on the news that it was introducing new products.
''The market acted superbly today, benefiting from the low C.P.I. numbers and the feeling that the Federal Reserve will find it easier to loosen credit,'' said Edward P. Nicoski, a technical analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. ''The I.B.M. share repurchase also helped.''
Mr. Nicoski said that there also was a strong belief on the exchange floor that option expirations today would have a positive impact on the market.
In over-the-counter-trading, Valley National, Arizona's largest bank-holding company, plummeted 5 3/4, to 18 1/2. The company said it was suspending its quarterly dividend after taking a write-off to reflect the declining value of its real estate portfolio.

HEADLINE: Prices Rose Modestly Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GRAND ISLAND, Neb., Oct. 19

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in September, cutting the nation's inflation rate so far this year to the same 4.4 percent posted for 1988, the Labor Department reported today.
Scrutiny of the monthly price data discloses wide regional and local variations, and here in the prairie country, for example, inflation in the last year, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is just 3.2 percent. That is more than a full percentage point below the national average.
Last Friday's report of sharply higher producer prices may have contributed to that day's plunge in the stock market. But today's report was somewhat better than expected, and securities markets rallied, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending the day up 39.55 points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,683.20. 
The Government also said today that Social Security payments, which are adjusted for inflation, would rise by 4.7 percent in January, the largest annual cost-of-living increase in seven and a half years. [Page D5.] The Government uses national statistics like the Consumer Price Index to calculate such cost-of-living adjustments, and all recipients nationwide receive the same increase.
But for individuals, their own experience may tell them things are substantially better or worse than what they see on television or read in national publications.
Here in Grand Island, for example, price increases are far below the 5.6 percent inflation rate faced by residents of cities in the Northeast with populations between 50,000 and 500,000.
To be sure, Robert A. Morris, the president of the Overland National Bank here, complains of high property taxes, partly the result of low population. And Vickie Purdy, who works at the Casual Corner apparel chain, says that reasonably priced fresh fish can be unobtainable. But Grand Island residents also know that the cost of housing here bears little relationship to that in big urban centers.
 
Houses Below $50,000
Coad Miller, a salesman for Home Real Estate, said the average price of a house here is less than $50,000. He also said it was easy to find homes that make good investments, with rents exceeding mortgage interest, taxes and insurance.
Housing costs have climbed a scant 1.9 percent during the last 12 months in the Government's sample of small Midwest cities, which covers Fort Dodge, Iowa, and Kennett and Mexico, Mo., in addition to Grand Island. That compares with a 3.7 percent increase for the nation at large.
As for food, you can buy hamburger at the local Econofoods for $1.39 a pound, but Grand Island's advantage over the rest of the nation is rather narrow. But a ticket to a movie at the Conestoga Mall is only $4.25, and inflation in entertainment costs has been 1.3 percent in the last 12 months, compared with 5.4 percent nationally.
Transportation costs have risen at exactly the 3.6 percent national rate. Gasoline prices within a few miles of Interstate 80 are the same as in other regions, and local car dealers keep their prices in line with those in Lincoln and Omaha.
 
Competing With Bigger Cities
Wes Westerby, who manages Cornhusker Toyota, said some of his expenses, like his real estate costs, were low, but he passes those savings along to his customers because, with the ease of travel in the Midwest, they can go elsewhere to shop.
''You've got to compete with the bigger cities,'' he said.
Grand Island is also an example of how extraneous occurrences can affect local inflation rates. Mr. Morris, the banker, said that after a tornado devastated this city of 38,000 in June 1980 there was a rebuilding boom and inflation in the early 1980's did not fall as rapidly here as it did elsewhere.
Today's national figures showed September price movements little changed in most categories, with housing, which accounts for 42 percent of the Consumer Price Index, up by one-tenth of 1 percent, the lowest rise since April.
Nearly two-thirds of last month's inflation was in the price of clothing, reflecting the introduction of fall and winter lines.
 
Vegetable Prices Drop
Food was up two-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month. The smallest increase this year for cereal and bakery products and a sharp drop in fresh vegetable prices helped offset a 1.4 percent jump in dairy products, the biggest since May 1980.
Transportation costs fell five-tenths of 1 percent, the fourth decline in a row, on a 2.2 percent drop in gasoline prices, lower automobile finance charges and lower prices for both new and used cars.
A 1.7 percent leap in apparel prices, following three straight declines, and a hefty eight-tenths of 1 percent rise in medical costs had a limited effect on the index because the weight of each element in the index is only about 6 percent.
Medical care, however, has now climbed at a 9.2 percent rate during the last three months and 8 percent during the last year.
 
Comparison With Past
The index covering urban consumers now stands at 125. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in the base period of 1982-84 now costs $12.50.
Before rounding, the index rose 0.1606426 last month, which translates into an annual inflation rate of 1.9 percent.
The index covering all urban wage earners and clerical workers also rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, bringing the 12-month increase to 4.3 percent.
For Grand Island and the three other small Midwest cities in the survey, the September increase was six-tenths of 1 percent, but a Labor Department official said this was not significant because the series is not adjusted for seasonal variations.

HEADLINE: Japan Banks Turn Cautious on Lending for U.S. Buyouts

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Japanese banking officials have become extremely cautious about making loans for American leveraged buyouts.
Even before British Airways announced that it would not participate, for now, in attempts to buy the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, officials at several major Japanese banks said they were taking a deliberate approach on whether to help finance any new UAL proposal.
After last week's collapse of a proposed $6.75 billion buyout of UAL, the investment group, which included the pilots' union and management of UAL, has been trying to organize another bid at a lower price. A number of banks, including American and Japanese institutions, had balked at the first deal because the interest rates and fees were too low. 
''In principle, if we see a good deal we'll participate on a case-by-case basis,'' said Kirk Yamaguchi, deputy head of the Bank of Tokyo's overseas corporate finance department. ''But to a certain degree it is true that we have become more reluctant. We're being more cautious.''
Mr. Yamaguchi added that his bank, which agreed to lend several hundred million dollars for the first buyout effort, was now sitting on the fence.
Yoh Kurosawa, deputy president of the influential Industrial Bank of Japan, said: ''We are a little fed up with these kinds of deals. We've been more cautious about LBO's in general because we just don't want to build up too heavy an exposure.''
Senior officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan deny putting pressure on the banks to slow their lending to American leveraged buyouts, but they have spoken approvingly in the last few days of the new sense of prudence.
''Banks must carefully weigh risks involved in each case,'' said Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, at a press briefing. ''Although each bank has the right to make a loan or not, I expect them to fully understand this point and to refrain from extending excessive loans.''
Several banks and Government officials emphasized that this sort of lending had not stopped. For instance, in the recent buyout of NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, Japanese banks provided nearly 40 percent of the $3.35 billion in bank loans.
The officials and bankers cite a number of reasons for the sudden caution. For one, the banks have seen their loans in this area jump from close to nothing to billions of dollars in the span of a few years. Also, there have been several well-publicized cases recently in which companies that were bought out have had trouble meeting their financial obligations.
To be sure, the Japanese banks are not alone, and they bristle at criticism that they caused the UAL deal or any other transaction to come apart.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
BankAmerica Profit Rises by 33.7%

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Continuing its comeback, the BankAmerica Corporation, one of the nation's largest banks, said yesterday that third-quarter net income rose 33.7 percent, to $254 million, or $1.16 a share, from $190 million, or 97 cents a share, in the corresponding 1988 period.
A. W. Clausen, the bank's chairman, said the big jump in profits was primarily a result of a ''strong performance in the fundamental area of our business, particularly consumer and residential mortgage loans.''
Mr. Clausen had been chairman of BankAmerica through most of the 1970's until 1981, when he left to head the World Bank. Upon his return as chairman in 1986, the San Francisco-based bank was faltering, hurt by delinquencies on mortgage and third world loans, particularly to Brazil, a major borrower. 
 
Cost-Cutting Cited
Analysts attributed the third-quarter rebound in earnings to such things as cost-cutting, new managers hired by Mr. Clausen, and more careful lending. ''The results have been quite impressive,'' said Thomas Brown, first vice president of the Paine Webber Group.
Brazil helped the process. For the third quarter, the bank collected interest income on Brazilian loans of $5 million compared with no payments from Brazil in the 1988 quarter. Nevertheless, Brazilian interest payments that came due but were not paid totaled $70 million for the quarter.
Partly for this reason, BankAmerica increased its provision for credit losses to $170 million, from $110 million in the 1988 quarter. ''There have been rumblings that the Brazilian economy could be in an upward trend, and that sends a hopeful message,'' said Gary F. Hovis, a bank analyst for Argus Research Corporation.
Non-interest income in the third quarter was $462 million, up from $400 million in last year's third quarter. Some $42 million of the $62 million increase came from fees and commissions. At the same time, noninterest expense rose to only $921 million in the quarter compared with $890 million in last year's third quarter.
The various factors, along with increased capital and reserve levels, combined to produce ''strong rates of return of more than 1 percent on average total assets and more than 22 percent on average common equity,'' the bank said.

HEADLINE: Inflation Outpaces Pay

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Workers' earnings rose 3.5 percent in the year ended Sept. 30, failing to keep pace with the rate of inflation in the same period, the Labor Department said today.
With consumer inflation running at a 4.3 percent rate for the 12 months ended in September, real earnings actually fell by eight-tenths of a percent, the department said. 
Real earnings have been falling nearly unchecked since March 1987, mainly because of a shorter average workweek.
As measured in 1977 dollars, average weekly earnings for industrial and service employees fell to $166.83 in September from $168.10 a year ago.
Real earnings fell in many industries in the last year, including construction, manufacturing, transportation, and wholesale and retail trade. These were offset by rising wages in finance, insurance and service industries.
Economists said earnings have been falling because of a gradual shift in the economy to service-sector jobs, where wages are lower on average than in manufacturing and where the workweek is shorter.
In September, average weekly earnings rose by five-tenths of a percent from the prior month, slightly more than the two-tenths of a percent rate of inflation reported by the department earlier today.
Before taking inflation into account, weekly earnings averaged $338.67 in September, compared with $335.04 in August and $327.12 in September 1988, the department said.

HEADLINE: Social Security Payments To Increase 4.7% Next Year

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The nation's 38.9 million recipients of Social Security payments will receive a 4.7 percent increase in January, the largest annual cost-of-living adjustment in seven and a half years.
The adjustment will increase the average benefit check by $25, to $566 a month, the Social Security Administration said today.
For someone who retires at age 65 in 1990, the maximum monthly benefit will be $975, up from $899 this year. 
 
Reflection of Inflation
The raise, announced after the Labor Department released its consumer price report for September, reflects the inflation rate for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of 1988 through the corresponding period this year.
The increase will show up in checks delivered Jan. 3, representing benefits earned for December.
The Government also announced that the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax will rise next year to $50,400 from $48,000.
Only about 10.4 million of the 130 million workers subject to the payroll tax had earnings that exceeded the wage base this year, the Social Security Administration said.
All workers and employers, however, face higher payroll taxes next year, since the tax rate rises from 7.51 percent to 7.65 percent, an increase that was approved by Congress in 1977.
The two changes - a higher wage base and a higher tax rate - mean the maximum tax on employees will rise $250.80, to $3,855.60, in 1990. Employers match their workers' contributions.
 
Higher Rate for Self-Employed
Tax rates for the self-employed rise from 13.02 percent this year to 15.30 percent in 1990, when half of the taxes can be deducted as a business expense. The wage base is the same as for other workers.
Next year's increase in benefits will be the biggest since a 7.4 percent raise in July 1982, when high inflation rates produced bigger cost-of-living adjustments. Benefits rose 4 percent in 1989.
The Social Security Administration gave these examples of how the benefit increase will affect average monthly benefits:
* Elderly couple, both getting benefits: up $43, to $966.
* Widowed mother and two children: up $53, to $1,173.
* Elderly widow living alone: up $24, to $522.
* Disabled worker, spouse and children: up $44, to $975.
* All disabled workers: up $24, to $555.
Of the 38.9 million people receiving monthly Social Security benefits, 62 percent are retired workers, 7 percent are disabled workers and 31 percent are spouses or children of retired, disabled or deceased workers.

Assets of the nation's 473 money market mutual funds surged by $6.07 billion in the latest week to a record $356.1 billion, reflecting investors' moving out of stocks and into more stable investments after the stock market plunge last Friday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.
It was the biggest rise in assets since the week of another large decline in stock prices, Jan. 13, 1988, when assets rose by $7.62 billion. 
The latest influx came as fund assets were already at a record total of $350.03 billion set the previous week. The institute originally reported that figure as $349.37 billion but revised it upward.
Jacob Dreyer, chief economist and senior vice president of the Washington-based mutual fund trade group, attributed the latest rise to investors' seeking safe havens for their money after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190 points last Friday.
The biggest weekly rise in fund assets, $9.64 billion, came in the week ended Oct. 21, 1987, when the stock market collapsed. The Dow average fell a record 508 points on the Monday of that week.
The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 235 general purpose funds rose $2.53 billion, to $116.56 billion.

HEADLINE: Bankers Say Refinancing Is Needed to Avert Defaults

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Bankers affiliated with the South Africa debt agreement said yesterday that the main reason the nation's creditors agreed to refinance $8 billion was that the loans were coming due on July 1 and would have to be rescheduled sooner or later.
They said they had negotiated the most onerous repayment terms they could get without forcing the South African Government to default on their loans.
If that had occurred, bankers pointed out, the South African Government would have simply kept the money it had borrowed - an outcome, they said, that would serve neither the anti-apartheid groups nor the banks' purpose. 
''The banks feel they have negotiated as about a tough a deal as they can,'' said one British banker who would speak only if he was not identified. ''As far as the banks' economists are concerned, it is just about tough as it could be without causing South Africa to say, 'We can't sustain those payments.' ''
 
Some Groups Not Impressed
But some anti-apartheid groups were not impressed. ''This was a relatively sweet deal for South Africa,'' said Donna Katzin, director of the South Africa program at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York. The agreement was reached, Ms. Katzin said, after only brief negotiations, and eight months before any agreement actually needed to be signed.
Ms. Katzin said by agreeing to the rescheduling now, the banks have undermined the Bush Administration, which had given South Africa until February to put executive changes into effect, and until June to implement parliamentary changes.
''The banks could have waited, but they didn't,'' Ms. Katzin said.
John J. Simone, an executive vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said he thought that the agreement was in keeping with the aspirations of the anti-apartheid groups. ''We negotiated to get them to pay the largest amount in the shortest period of time,'' he said.
When the South African representatives first contacted the banks with their restructuring proposal, they reportedly offered to pay about $1 billion over a period of about five years. The banks final agreement calls for them to receive $1.5 billion over three-and-a-half years.
 
Questions on Rates Charged
Though bankers would not give any details on the interest rate that South Africa received, bankers said it was unchanged from the previous agreement.
''The rates are relatively high,'' said the British banker. ''They are penalty rates of interest.'' When banks have renegotiated the terms of loans to Latin American countries, by contrast, they often reduce the interest rates they charge.
''I think there's a false perception of what power the banks have,'' said Mr. Simone. ''We're getting a better deal from South Africa than from almost any other developing country.''
Although the banks have been under constant pressure from anti-apartheid groups and some British Commonwealth ministers, there was apparently no pressure exerted by the governments of the leading industrialized countries.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Generally Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved generally higher yesterday, buoyed by a better-than-expected report on inflation and by purchases of as much as $2 billion worth of 30-year bonds by a large Japanese investor.
A report showing that consumer prices rose by an unexpectedly modest two-tenths of a percent last month helped to push bond prices higher early in the session, as did a release disclosing that initial unemployment claims rose sharply.
But traders said the bulk of the market's move took place on the heels of two separate $1 billion bids for bonds. While such buying is not unusual, market participants said these purchases were different because they were so openly displayed. Generally big blocs are bought more discreetly, they said. 
 
Support for Market Seen
''This guy has been on the screen with his bids since 10 or 11 o'clock this morning,'' said Neil Dubrow, a vice president at Voute, Coats, Stuart & O'Grady, a bond trading firm in Greenwich, Conn. ''Even though the inflation report looked good, the bond market would have gone down quite a bit had it not been for this buyer.''
Market participants said it was rumored that the buyer was Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., a Japanese brokerage house. The firm was believed to be buying the bonds for the Daichi Kangyo Bank, the world's largest commercial bank.
Eishi Wakabayashi, an executive vice president at Nippon Kangyo, confirmed that the firm had bought ''substantial amounts'' of bonds, but declined to comment on who the customer was.
Aside from the big purchase, the session was highlighted by a signal from the Federal Reserve Board that its worries about the possibility of another big stock decline have abated.
 
Surprise Move by Fed
Yesterday the Fed surprised credit market participants by draining reserves from the banking system at a time when the Federal funds rate was trading at around 8 3/4 percent. In the days immediately after last Friday's huge slide in the equity markets the Fed's actions suggested that the central bank was adding reserves to the system.
''The Fed's operation suggests they are comfortable with an 8 3/4 percent funds rate,'' said Darwin L. Beck, a money market economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''It is a signal saying that the stock market problem is over, and things are back to normal.''
The Fed's action had an adverse effect on short-term bills and Treasury note issues.
By late yesterday, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.54 percent, up five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.55 percent.
In the secondary Treasury note market, the 8 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 29/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.86 percent.
Intermediate and longer-term issues were buoyed by the inflation report and the Japanese purchases.
In late trading, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 101 7/8, up 26/32, to yield 7.95 percent. And the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, up 14/32, to yield 7.94 percent.
 
Little Effect on Auction
The Fed's open market activities had little effect on yesterday's auction of $9.75 billion worth of one-year Treasury bills.
The new bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.35 percent, down from an average rate of 7.61 percent at last month's sale. It is the lowest rate on a new one-year Treasury bill since the June 30, 1988, auction, when the bills sold at an average rate of 7.04 percent.
Although yesterday's price moves may have been distorted by the big Japanese purchase, analysts said that the consumer price figures and other recent economic data were providing a positive underpinning for the bond market.
''The good news is building, and we are approaching another down move in yields,'' said Edward J. Hyman Jr., vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell. ''Starting with the current quarter, we are moving into a period where we will have virtually no growth.'' Mr. Hyman said he expected the economy to stay in that very slow to no-growth mode for the next year.
Elsewhere, prices of secondary investment-grade corporate bonds moved higher along with Treasury issues. Dealers said prices of most issues rose by about half a point.
 
Dillard Issue
Dillard Department Stores was among the companies offering new debt yesterday, with an issue of $50 million of 9.5 percent debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The debentures, which mature Oct. 15, 2001, were priced at par, or $100. The 9.5 percent coupon was 1.53 percentage points over the yield on the 8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard & Poor's.
Prices of secondary tax-exempt municipal bond issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point yesterday, despite the offering of $150 million of high-grade issues on a bid-wanted basis.
The seller of the bonds was rumored to be a large New England bank seeking to help clean up a problem real estate portfolio.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Oct. 9. The most basic measure, M-1, fell by $3.3 billion.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Mixed Results Despite Data on U.S. Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies yesterday at the end of an uneventful session.
Gold prices eased in the United States after posting scattered gains and losses overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.10 an ounce, down $1.60 from Wednesday.
Currency dealers in financial centers around the world temporarily sold dollars after the Commerce Department reported that the Consumer Price Index went up a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in September. But the unexpectedly small inflation rate had little lasting effect on currency trading.
Speculation about the chances for lower interest rates circulated in the markets and tended to temper any urge to buy dollars, dealers said. The low inflation reading could give the Federal Reserve Board greater leeway to ease monetary tightness, leading to lower interest rates.
''There was no real direction in the market,'' said Siobhan Lackey, an assistant on the foreign exchange desk of Bank Julius Baer & Company. ''There wasn't that wild of a reaction to the inflation news.''
By the end of New York's trading day, the dollar was quoted at 142 yen, up from 141.40 yen late Wednesday. And a pound fetched $1.5975, vs. $1.5922 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.8500 West German marks, up from 1.8485; 1.6205 Swiss francs, down from 1.6243; 6.27895 French francs, down from 6.2810; 1.17405 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17335, and 1,360.95 Italian lire, down from 1,362.00.
On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery closed at $5.08 an ounce, down from Wednesday's settlement of $5.105.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Net Tumbles 43.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Oct. 19

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc.'s third-quarter earnings tumbled 43.2 percent because of a sales slump that has forced the company to place about 325 employees on indefinite layoff, the company said today.
Plants in East Peoria, Mossville and Mapleton, Ill. will be affected by the layoffs announced today, but Caterpillar, a leading manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, did not announce how many workers at each plant would be idled. 
Caterpillar also said a plant in York, Pa., will shut down operations involving about 175 workers for a total of four weeks in November and December.
 
The layoffs are necessary
''to keep production in line with demand,'' the company said in a statement.
Caterpillar attributed its sales decline in part to higher interest rates, which led to reduced construction activity and discouraged purchases of replacement equipment, particularly in the housing sector.
Caterpillar said it earned $108 million, or $1.07 a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $190 million, or $1.87 a share, for the corresponding period a year ago.
Revenue fell 5.4 percent, to $2.64 billion from $2.79 billion, as equipment sales declined 5.8 percent, to $2.58 billion from $2.74 billion.
The company said its earnings also reflected an $11 million provision for bad debts on Latin American receivables.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Debate Begins on Reducing Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
House and Senate budget negotiators today began what promises to be a slow process: reconciling major differences in their plans for reducing the fiscal year 1990 budget deficit and repealing $16.1 billion in automatic spending cuts that took effect on Monday.
The automatic cuts, which the law required after Congress failed to meet an Oct. 16 deadline for having a deficit-reduction plan in place, imposed across-the-board reductions in a wide array of domestic and military programs. Today's session was devoted to speechmaking, because the 10 subconference groups that have jurisdiction over various portions of the deficit reduction plans will probably not meet to begin their work until Tuesday.
While the budget negotiators fenced, two senior Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee outlined the latest version of a proposal to lower the capital gains tax they hope to attach to a bill raising the ceiling on the national debt. 
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, said their plan had the backing of the Administration and the support of more than half of the Senate.
 
Boren Abandons His Plan
Senator David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat who had been planning to introduce a more generous capital gains tax cut plan, said he had abandoned that idea and would support the Packwood-Roth proposal, although he will not sign on as a co-sponsor. Mr. Boren and Mr. Packwood said that capital gains tax cut supporters in the Senate remained two to five votes short of the 60 votes that would be needed to overcome a filibuster by opponents of a gains cut.
The plan would reduce capital gains taxes for corporations as well as individuals, providing larger tax breaks the longer assets were held. It would also allow individuals to set aside $2,000 a year in an individual retirement account and to make tax-free withdrawals at the time of retirement.
The lower capital gains tax rates for individuals would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1, 1989. If individuals chose not to take the reduced capital gains rate, they would have the option of lowering their capital gains tax by excluding the portion of their profit solely attributable to inflation.
Individuals who held their assets at least one year could exclude up to 5 percent of their profits from tax, while those who held their assets at least seven years could exclude 35 percent, lowering their capital gains tax rate to 18.2 percent. Corporations that held their assets for at least three years would pay a capital gains rate of 33 percent, while those holding assets at least 15 years would pay a gains rate of 29 percent.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Offers an Agenda

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Declaring that his party had been ''dealing with the thread and not the fabric'' of the economy, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, outlined today ''a new Democratic agenda for investment and economic growth.''
In a speech at the National Press Club, Mr. Gephardt seemed to be offering a yardstick against which the party's economic positions could be measured in the years ahead. 
He stressed that the party should promote investment, honor work, focus on the long term, encourage fairness and check concentrations of economic power - and he acknowledged in the question period after the speech that his colleagues might disagree over whether particular legislative measures fit the framework.
Mr. Gephardt gently suggested higher taxes on the wealthy and less spending by the military, but he was more emphatic about where he wanted to spend money and on the need to reduce the budget deficit.
He said he and other leaders would offer concrete proposals to fill in the outline next year.
The Missouri Congressman said his speech grew out of the turbulence last week on Wall Street and the Democratic leadership's loss last month of the House vote cutting capital gains taxes.

HEADLINE: After 20 Years, Philippine Insurgency Falters

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
After 20 years, the largest indigenous Communist insurgency in Southeast Asia has stalled because of factionalism, purges, declining campus recruitment and the capture of some important leaders, diplomats and Philippine officials say.
''It's much too early to say the Government is winning,'' said a senior Western diplomat. ''But the insurgency has stopped growing. It's more containable now, though it still can strike almost anywhere in the country.'' 
The diplomats say the Government's gains are undeniable and encouraging. But they quickly add that the Philippine military and Government are not so much winning the war, as the insurgents are losing it by default, failing to adjust their program and practices to changing circumstances.
 
Factionalism and Infiltration
Political experts say the emergence of a popular President, Corazon C. Aquino, as the result of a revolution, however bourgeois, did much to thwart the Communist Party, its New People's Army and associated front organizations. Internal divisions between the old-line Maoists, who favor political action, and the so-called Sandinistas, who favor militancy and armed struggle, are said to have become much sharper.
Factionalism and infiltration by the Government have led to purges and the killing of cadres, whose shallow graves have been used as propaganda by the Government. With the capture of a number of Maoist leaders, Government officials say the balance seems to favor the militants.
Army officers are optimistic, saying they will defeat the insurgency by 1992. Gen. Roman Gavino, deputy chief of intelligence, told diplomats at a briefing this month that 8 members of the Communist Party's Central Committee and 34 regional leaders have been killed or captured this year.
 
Major Rebel Strongholds
He asserted that rebel casualties in the 23,000-member New People's Army are up over 40 percent and that guerrilla attacks are down 11 percent, while Government-initiated operations are up 16 percent. Military figures on the insurgency, however, have often in the past been found to be incomplete or misleading.
Even Western diplomats sympathetic to the army point out that the insurgents maintain major strongholds in such significant areas as the highly populated Panay and Negros islands; the Bicol region, and Cagayan Valley, where they retain the initiative against the military. In addition, the rebels retain significant if somewhat reduced strength in the country's second largest island, Mindanao, and in Bataan, a province near Manila.
The rebels have also shown that they can strike almost at will in urban areas, and they have announced their intention to attack United States Government employees and other Americans connected with the Philippine anti-insurgency campaign. Just last month, two American employees of a United States military base were killed by gunmen later identified by the Philippine Government as Communist guerrillas. On the same day, a member of President Aquino's guard was slain by rebels near the presidential palace.
In April, Col. James N. Rowe was slain by rebels in an ambush in suburban Manila. Colonel Rowe was the commander of the ground forces division of the Joint United States Advisory Group, which administers American military aid to the Philippines.
 
An Army With a Spotty Record
Out in the countryside, where the war is mostly fought, the performance of the Philippine Army is considered spotty, with an officer corps of uneven quality and probity, still politicized and divided over loyalties to personalities. Some young officers also remain restless, and despite the failure of the last coup attempt in August 1987, they still gather to listen to its leader, former Col. Gregorio B. Honasan, who has escaped recapture even though he has been seen speaking to business groups in Makati, an affluent Manila suburb. But most diplomats regard prospects for another coup as remote.
More important, the continuing failure of the civil administration to work well in tandem with the military and to provide needed social services and aid to citizens whose lives have been disrupted by the war, is undermining the Government's strategy of political, civil and economic development.
A major military operation this May in Negros forced the evacuation of 35,000 civilians who were poorly cared for by unprepared civilian authorities. At least 50 children died from measles, diarrhea and pneumonia, and the domestic criticism was harsh. The army said it considered the Negros operation a model, but it has not tried a similar operation since.
 
Gains From a 'Dirty War'
Some of the Government's gains have come from army practices associated with a ''dirty war,'' a code phrase for intensive surveillance, harassment and assassination of civilians. Leftist organizations that the Government and army regard as Communist fronts have been intimidated or disrupted, and some of their members reportedly kidnapped or killed.
Officials say these deeds are done by right-wing extremists or the private armies of landlords and have nothing to do with the Government or the army. But Philippine church and human rights groups as well as world organizations like Amnesty International have strongly criticized the Government and the army for human rights abuses. Philippine officials say it is the insurgents who are producing the mass graves.
In the longer run, the officials acknowledge, any lasting victory over the insurgency will be based on economics, not troop movements or political convictions. ''In this war, it is not really the hearts and minds that are important. It's the stomach,'' said Rafael Ileto, national security adviser to President Aquino and a former Defense Minister. ''The economy has to feed people three times a day. The military can't do it.''
 
Low Rate of Growth
The Aquino Government has tried to stabilize the economy. This will be the third consecutive year of over five-percent growth in the gross national product.
But this rate of growth is the lowest in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and half that of Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. In addition, the Philippines retains a feudal structure in much of the countryside that most of the rest of the region has long discarded. New wealth in the big cities, like Manila and Cebu, is simply not trickling down to the peasantry on the sugar estates, and old patterns of poverty, inequality, landlessness, joblessness, injustice and corruption offer fertile ground for the guerrillas.
In addition, the annual population growth rate is between 2.5 and 3 percent, meaning that economic growth of even 5 to 6 percent a year is substantially eroded. Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani, an Aquino supporter, thinks the need for better population control is the central problem for the country's future. Other politicians and diplomats say that Mrs. Aquino, a devout Roman Catholic, will not associate herself with the issue.
''The Government isn't losing the war, but to win it requires a radical overhaul of social programs, a crackdown on corruption and a transfer of some money to the countryside,'' a Western diplomat said.
Another diplomat said: ''The economy is better, but it's still sick. With this birth rate, the poor will grow and grow, and there's very little sign of money filtering down, as in Thailand. If the economy keeps on this way, the insurgency will come back with a vengeance in five years or so.''

HEADLINE: Reagan Urges Japan to Look Past Its Success

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Former President Ronald Reagan began a nine-day visit today by offering a gentle nudge to Japan to open its markets to more imports and take greater responsibility for foreign assistance to the poor countries of the world.
''Japan has responsibility for more than its own success,'' Mr. Reagan said at an arrival ceremony at Haneda Airport. ''Japan must anticipate and respond to the challenges and demands from the other countries of the world.'' 
He suggested that Japan emulate the American example of achieving both economic and military strength ''while at the same time being a major aid donor, championing free trade and supporting mutual security relationships.''
''So, too,'' Mr. Reagan added, ''can Japan maintain its own impressive success and still open markets and take on other global responsibilities.''
 
A Sympathetic Audience
The Japanese are expected to listen carefully to the former President, whom they continue to respect. Many see him as a symbol of a time when American-Japanese relations were less contentious than they have been in recent months.
The former President's arrival marked one of his few public appearances in recent weeks, and it was immediately noticed that his hair, which had been shaved off for brain surgery he underwent last summer, was growing back gray.
For many years, Mr. Reagan fended off comments about his dark head of hair, denying that it was dyed. In fact, his hair has long been flecked with gray, and a staff member said it was growing back with the same amount of gray that it has had in recent years.
Mr. Reagan and his wife, Nancy, are here as guests of the Fujisankei Communications Group, which is spending $6 million to $8 million on the couple's visit. That sum includes a payment of roughly $2 million to the Reagans themselves.
Although the size of the payment has raised some eyebrows, the visit is generally being portrayed positively in the Japanese press.
The former President was accompanied by a longtime friend and colleague who helped negotiate the trip, Charles Z. Wick, the former director of the United States Information Agency.
After arriving this afternoon on a chartered jet with spouses and dependents of United States military personnel stationed in Japan, Mr. Reagan left immediately for a mountain resort, Hakone, where he plans to rest for the weekend at the guest house of the family that owns the Fujisankei group.
He is to attend a special ''friendship concert'' in Yokohama on Sunday and to meet with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Emperor Akihito on Monday and Tuesday. After the two days of official meetings, he will take part in a round of activities for the benefit of the company sponsoring his visit.

HEADLINE: Bush Urged to Take Lead on Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Pressure is increasing on the Bush Administration to show more leadership in helping Poland and Hungary shed their Communist economic systems.
''History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities which emerge from these reforms for the whole of Europe,'' the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, told an East-West security conference here yesterday, as the United States Senate passed an $837.3 million aid package for Hungary and Poland that was almost twice as much as President Bush had requested.
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher told Mr. Genscher and the others assembled here later, ''We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed.'' Then he added, in effect, that those countries and the Soviet Union were on their own. 
The West should maintain its security controls on exports of technology to the East European countries, he said, and should not engage in a reckless round of lending or subsidized investments there.
 
'Marshall Plan or Martial Law'
''My advice to them is, 'Take the plunge! The water is fine,' '' he said, meaning to sound positive. Instead, what many of the assembled officials and scholars from the Atlantic to the Urals understood was something more like ''Sink or swim.''
''Our dilemma now is Marshall Plan or martial law,'' said Dariusz K. Rosati, director of foreign trade research in Warsaw, today, saying that the new non-Communist Government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki risked losing all popular support within three months if it took the harsh measures needed to control a soaring inflation rate, which Mr. Rosati estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 percent annually.
''This Government deserves support,'' said Karol Szyndzielorz, a Polish journalist, but he described Mr. Mosbacher's words as ''a show of impotence, a pretext for doing nothing.''
President Bush has encouraged European leaders to take the initiative in helping East European nations, and the economic summit meeting of industrial democracies last July asked the European Community's executive commission to coordinate Western economic aid to Hungary and Poland.
 
Association Is Recommended
Last month the commission recommended a $660-million package for this year and next, which will be discussed by a meeting of the 24 participating donor countries in Brussels in November. A senior NATO diplomat said that eventually the United States would have to take the lead.
Some Western Europeans, like Mr. Genscher, would like to create a framework for associating Poland and Hungary with the economic institutions of the European Community. ''I didn't hear an operative plan to do that,'' a former senior West German diplomat said after his speech yesterday.
A West German banker, sitting in an office high above Frankfurt this afternoon, mused that what Poland needed first of all was detailed, expert advice on how to restore the value of its currency. ''But then you need goods you can buy with it,'' he added.
Poland has asked for a $1 billion stabilization fund, to which the Bush Administration has contributed $200 million, and Mr. Mosbacher encouraged all the Western countries to contribute.

HEADLINE: Life Isn't Always a Cabaret

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
It was only two weeks before the Oct. 3 opening night of his cabaret act at the Ballroom in Manhattan that Jeff Harnar left his job as a singing waiter in Mrs. J's Sacred Cow, a restaurant on the Upper West Side.
''I needed to rehearse,'' the 30-year-old singer explained the other day, recalling the anxieties of bringing ''Carried Away: Jeff Harnar Sings Comden and Green'' to the smart nightclub in Chelsea.
The fact that Mr. Harnar, a critically praised singer, has had to work as a singing waiter illustrates the marginal economics of life in today's cabaret. After its three-week run ends Sunday there is no certainty that Mr. Harnar will not soon have to go back to being a singing waiter despite the rave reviews and the excited audiences. Although he is considering taking his act to San Francisco and Los Angeles, there are no firm plans. And beyond those possible West Coast dates, the future is cloudy. 
''I don't know what is going to happen after next week,'' Mr. Harnar said. ''I may have to go back to waiting tables. I have to have a faith that if I continue to keep putting out good work that the phone will ring.''
In ''Carried Away,'' Mr. Harnar and his accompanist, Alex Rybeck, string bits and pieces of more than two dozen songs with lyrics by the veteran team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green into zany medleys that illustrate the notion of being carried away with love, show business and the general buzz of city life.
 
Love and Small Change
Were this the early 1960's, Mr. Harnar might well be singing on a Broadway stage instead of in a club. Vocally, his baritone recalls the young Larry Kert, while his boyish enthusiasm evokes Robert Morse in musicals like ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' and ''Take Me Along.''
But because there so few new musicals nowadays, Mr. Harnar, who grew up in a lot of places, including California and Chicago, dreaming and planning for a career in musical comedy, has had no choice as a performer other than to forge a shaky niche in the insular cabaret world. It's a world where performers do it mostly for love and small change and from which there are no easy stepping stones to the next level of show business success.
Mr. Harnar first won favorable notice two years ago when he gave a series of performances at the Greenwich Village club Eighty Eight's. Last March, he was voted best male performer by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets, an organization made up of performers, club owners and cabaret critics. ''Carried Away,'' which also originated at Eighty Eight's, moved to the more glamorous Ballroom after Margaret Whiting, a friend of Greg Dawson, who manages the Ballroom, recommended he catch Mr. Harnar's act.
''I came to New York in 1979 hoping to be on Broadway,'' Mr. Harnar recalled the other day. ''The first cast album I ever bought was 'How to Succeed in Business.' I wanted to play the Robert Morse part. That was the Broadway I thought I would find. I had transferred from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where they had a wonderful theater program, to N.Y.U.''
 
'I Sang Too Old'
Mr. Harnar quickly discovered that the musical comedy world was smaller and less welcoming than he had imagined. And after two years of responding to scores of casting calls, he became discouraged.
''I was told that I sang too old for someone so young and that there were no juveniles who were baritones - they were all tenors,'' he said. ''I finally decided there was nothing for me to do here. Phyllis McGuire hired me to be the houseboy and major domo in her five-story townhouse. It was right when the McGuire Sisters were beginning their comeback. And I watched them going through the same dynamics trying to re-establish their careers that I was going through as a newcomer. But during the two years I worked for her, I got bitten by the bug again. I decided that if there wasn't going to be a Broadway vehicle, I would do my own thing, and I began creating a persona for Jeff Harnar, the cabaret singer.''
Mr. Harnar teamed up with Mr. Rybeck, a young pianist and aspiring theater composer who has been his accompanist ever since, and in 1983 they put together an act that played in two clubs, both of which no longer exist. Discouraged from a lack of response, Mr. Harnar waited three more years before he went back to performing. In 1987, he and Mr. Rybeck created a second act that opened at Mr. Sam's, another defunct cabaret, on the Upper East Side, took it to Don't Tell Mama in the theater district, and went from there to Eighty Eight's. Though the act won favorable notice, Mr. Harnar's friends commented that it seemed a bit too introspective and laden with ballads.
Heeding their advice, he came up with the idea for an upbeat show of Comden and Green songs. He got the idea from looking at the jacket of an album called ''A Party With Comden and Green,'' a recording of the autobiographical show of their own material that the team first performed in the 1950's and revived on Broadway in 1977. Through the Broadway producer Barry Brown, who was both a supporter of Mr. Harnar and a friend of the lyricists, Miss Comden and Mr. Green were approached for their permission.
 
'I Was Heartbroken'
''Their first reaction was to discourage the project,'' Mr. Harnar said. ''Since they are also performers, they thought I wanted to do their club act. It felt to them that I was stepping on their toes. I was heartbroken.''
The team agreed, however, to accept a telephone call from Mr. Harnar to let him plead his case.
''Where their show is a historical look at how they wrote all the material, mine was an evening with Jeff Harnar in which I used their patter songs in totally different contexts,'' he said. ''They listened to me for 15 minutes as I went through pages and pages of notes. I knew the tide was turning when Adolph Green asked what were some of the ideas I had for the material, and I told him I wanted to do 'Never Never Land,' from 'Peter Pan,' as a doo-wop number with my two invisible brothers.''
Miss Comden and Mr. Green gave their blessing.
''After the show opened, their first take on it was that they were shocked to see so many of the songs used out of context,'' Mr. Harnar said. ''But after a weekend had passed, they told me, 'It's a lovely evening. We don't want you to change a thing about it.' ''
In spite of the uncertainties of his business, Mr. Harnar has already begun work on his next cabaret act, offering only a hint at the content. ''I'm in love with the 50's musical,'' he said. ''To me, the post-World War era was a very creative time when America really tried to be happy.''

HEADLINE: Changing the Color of Money Won't Stop Corruption

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Donald T. Regan suggests America's drug problem can be cured simply by changing the color of money (Op-Ed, Sept. 18). But that idea was tried before and failed dismally.
Our last currency conversion took place during the spring of 1970. The reasons for changing the color of currency then were the same reasons Mr. Regan suggests for doing it now. However, changing the color of American Military Payment Certificates failed back in crime- , drug- and corruption-infested South Vietnam in 1970 because the American high command didn't appreciate that the major element in the ''evil triad'' paralyzing our war effort was neither crime nor drugs, but corruption. 
Used as cash by the American military, the payment certificates replaced the greenback for two reasons: so as not to disrupt the South Vietnamese economy by flooding it with highly valuated American greenbacks, and to prevent the North Vietnamese and the last Vietcong remnants from obtaining an internationally accepted currency to purchase more advanced weapons, support and medical equipment.
But as senior military command and intelligence officers became aware that South Vietnamese drug lords, black marketeers, commodity brokers and enemy arms merchants possessed more payment certificates than American military personnel, a secret plan was hatched to change the color of the certificates abruptly and render impotent the entire ''evil triad'' pyramid: from the politicians and generals at the top who sold stores of spent brass bullet casings back to the U.S. Government, to the street urchins and barrack maids at the bottom who sold marijuana, cocaine, hashish and heroin on our military bases.
Planning for the conversion was kept from military personnel below the rank of division commander. Or so it was intended. As American G.I.'s awoke in the morning and received surprise orders to report to hastily built currency exchanges to replace their color-canceled M.P.C. bills, millions more of the new bills were already in the hands of South Vietnamese brothels than in American currency exchanges. Those of us who worked as liaison with the South Vietnamese Army discovered the night before that many of the lower-ranking Vietnamese soldiers, fronting for their generals or civilian merchants, possessed huge, hand-sized rolls of freshly printed M.P.C.
Was the conversion a failure? The true goal, it seemed, was not to eradicate the evil triad completely but to replace the uncooperative cartels that had become too wealthy and powerful for the American and South Vietnamese high command to negotiate with, with new cartels that promised to work more closely with our war effort. At that late stage in the war, corruption was an accepted basis for a growing, or at least surviving, South Vietnamese economy.
The new cartels, amply supplied with the brightly colored payment certificates, helped American officials buy back tons of black-market PX goods and military and medical equipment, thereby reducing the supplies that would otherwise have ended up in the hands of the enemy, who were caching tons of M.P.C.-purchased munitions along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border to prepare for invasion. Many of the supplies American officials failed to reclaim during the weeks following the M.P.C. conversion were recaptured during the Cambodian offensive.
Was the conversion a success? No. Drug use among G.I.'s continued to soar during the two remaining years of American military involvement. Munitions continued to flow into North Vietnamese caches across the border. And American law enforcement and intelligence morale sank to deeper depths.
Corruption among both South Vietnamese and American profiteers seemed a more potent enemy than the American high command had anticipated. Corruption here at home would spell failure in changing the color of American money.

HEADLINE: Redefining Comptroller, Council Head

SERIES: City Charter: The Voters' Turn -- Fifth of six articles.

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
While the broad outlines of a new municipal government were the central concern of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, the panel also proposed dozens of small but significant changes in city government.
The nearly 400 pages of the proposed charter, which will go to the voters in a referendum on Election Day, Nov. 7, are filled with new committees, boards and reporting requirements that the commission believes would improve the responsiveness and fairness of municipal government.
Critics say many of these additions would be expensive and unnecessary, adding to the size of the bureaucracy and slowing down government rather than speeding it up. The commission contends that many of the proposed changes would save money in the long run and would make the government more efficient. 
 
A Municipal Watchdog
One consequence of the panel's most significant proposal - to abolish the Board of Estimate - was the need to redefine the roles of the board's eight members: the mayor, the Council president, the comptroller and the five borough presidents.
The Council president and comptroller currently derive much of their power from their seats on the board. The commission decided that the two officials should have their executive roles strengthened and clarified, since the board's demise would put an end to their legislative authority.
Under the commission's plan, the Council president would function as a municipal watchdog, attempting to resolve complaints from citizens and overseeing several areas: the compliance of city agencies with the new charter, the response of city agencies to requests for information from the public and the agencies' handling of complaints about city services.
The Council president would also appoint one member of a new 13-member City Planning Commission and would head a new commission on public information. In addition, the president would monitor the overall delivery of city services and could recommend legislation to the Council to correct broad problems in municipal services.
The Council president would continue to be first in the line of succession should the mayor die or become disabled. Despite the title, the Council president is primarily a figurehead in the Council. Like the vice president in the United States Senate, the Council president presides over the Council and casts a vote in case of a tie, but the Council is run by the majority leader.
Some members of the charter commission contended that the office of Council president should be eliminated, because it would have little purpose without a seat on the Board of Estimate. They said the Council president's proposed new roles would conflict with the Council members' own oversight responsibilities.
But a majority of the commission decided that the city needed alternative voices because it is so dominated by one political party, the Democrats. The commission chairman, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., said it was important to retain the position because the city needed ''a person independent of the mayor with a citywide constituency who will worry about service delivery.''
 
Role of the Comptroller
There was less debate about the proposed role of the comptroller, who would have a clear mandate as the city's chief auditor and fiscal monitor to review the performance of city agencies and city contractors. The comptroller would also report annually on the mayor's revenue estimates and proposed budgets and on the state of the city's economy.
Under the new charter, the comptroller would also have the power to halt temporarily the awarding of a city contract that he believed to be corrupt. The mayor would have to respond in writing to the comptroller's objection, and the mayor would be required to make the final decision on whether to grant the contract.
The comptroller would name two of five members to a board that would set policy on city contracts, and would sit on a committee that would award franchises like commuter bus lines.
The franchise committee would also include four representatives of the mayor and one borough president. The votes of five of the six members would be needed to award a franchise.
 
Independent Budget Office
The charter plan offers many other new boards and committees. It proposes an independent budget office to evaluate city finances, the mayor's estimates of revenues and the mayor's budget proposals, and to serve as a counterbalance to the powerful Office of Management and Budget.
To assure the independence of the new office, the charter proposes that its director be appointed to a four-year term by a committee consisting of the Council president, the comptroller, one borough president chosen by all five borough leaders and one Council member selected by the Council.
Nathan Leventhal, the charter commission's secretary and a former Deputy Mayor, said the new budget office was one of the panel's most important innovations.
Mr. Schwarz said the office ''enhances the ability of all the players to play with a full deck.'' He added, ''We think it is one of the things that will lead to savings in the overall budget.''
 
Political Jobs Barred
The charter also proposes to bar the city's elected officials and senior administrative officials from holding the posts of county leader or state committeeman in political parties. Except for Council members, all elected and top appointed officials also could not be political district leaders.
The charter plan calls, too, for these new programs and agencies:
* A commission, chaired by the Council president, to regulate city practices on public access to information. The mayor would be required to keep city contracts and related information centralized and on computers, and to make the information available to the public.
* An Office of Economic and Financial Opportunity to help businesses owned by women and minorities compete for the more than $5 billion a year in city contracts.
* A deputy executive director in the Department of City Planning to coordinate long-range planning.
* The payment of interest when city agencies are late paying bills to companies and nonprofit groups doing business with the city.
* A commission to monitor efforts by city agencies to provide equal employment opportunities to minorities and women.
 
Attention to Planning
The charter would also require new reports on many subjects. Among them would be an annual report from the mayor giving statistical information on social, economic and environmental conditions in each of the city's 59 community districts. The report would address matters like infant mortality and infectious diseases, and it would cite national statistics and standards to place local concerns in context.
Mr. Schwarz believes the report would contribute greatly to the debate over the city's budget priorities.
''We've tried to increase the attention given to planning and the general effort to address the city's problems in a systematic sense and at the outset,'' he said, ''instead of the relatively overbalanced emphasis now on ad hoc disputes, individual disputes, resolved at the last minute.''

Markets
 The stock market completed its best week in 16 months after a frightening plunge at the end of the previous week. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 2,689.14, up 5.94 points for the day and up 119.88, or 4.7 percent, for the week. The Dow had fallen 190.58 points, or 6.9 percent, on Oct. 13, but a growing number of investors overcame their anxiety and decided the plunge was a fluke and a buying opportunity. [Page 33.] A $475 million ''junk bond'' issue of Chicago and North Western was finally sold by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, but the terms had to be sweetened because of disarray in the high-yield bond market.

HEADLINE: Dow Up By 4.7% For Week

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
The stock market yesterday completed its best week in 16 months with a mixed performance, although futures-related buying at the close pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to a small gain.
New York Stock Exchange volume was the lowest of the week, at 164.8 million shares, but pushed the weekly total to 1.17 billion, the first total over one billion since 1987.
The recovery was aided by good inflation news on Thursday, but analysts said it mostly represented a willingness of investors large and small to believe that the plunge in prices the previous week was a fluke and presented a buying opportunity.
 
6.9% Fall Previous Friday
 On the previous Friday, the Dow fell 190.58 points, or 6.9 percent, after the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said it had been unable to arrange financing for a leveraged buyout at $300 a share. During that week, the Dow fell 7.8 percent, the worst weekly showing since the 1987 crash. 
''It appears that the ghost of 1987 has been exorcised,'' said Gene Jay Seagle, chief technical analyst at Gruntal & Company, after the Dow closed the day up 5.94, to 2,689.14. For the week, the Dow, the most closely watched measure of the market's movement, rose 119.88 points, or 4.7 percent, the best weekly showing for the index since it rose 5.9 percent in the week ending June 3, 1988.
UAL plunged 21 5/8, to 168 1/2, yesterday, bringing its total loss for the week to 111 1/4, or 39.8 percent. British Airways, which had been an investor in the previously planned buyout, said that it did not intend to participate in any new deal for UAL. AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped 2 1/2, to 70 7/8, bringing its total weekly loss to 27 3/4, or 28.1 percent. Earlier in the week, Donald J. Trump, the developer, withdrew his offer to buy AMR.
 
Transportation Average Down
 The Dow Jones transportation average fell 32.71, to 1,230.80, bringing its total weekly loss to 175.49 points, or 12.5 percent. It was the worst week for the average since the 1987 crash, but the decline was deceptive. Of the 20 stocks in the index, 12 were up for the week and just six down, and the index would have shown a gain of about 22 points but for the action of the two large airlines.
Declines on the Big Board yesterday outnumbered advances by 829 to 662, despite the late rises in some stocks connected to the expiration of October stock index futures and options.
Traders said most of the program trading involving the expired October stock options and index futures took place on Thursday afternoon and early yesterday, thus removing pressure on equities yesterday.
Under Big Board rules, order imbalances relating to the expiration of futures and options are announced at 3:30 P.M. to draw in offsetting orders. All the imbalances yesterday were on the buy side, the largest being a 420,900-share imbalance in Exxon, which rose 3/8, to 46 1/8. While the imbalances did not have a major impact on prices, they helped push up the Dow more than 7 points in the final half-hour.
''So far, the market is not showing much sign of the panic carry-over that we had two years ago, especially since we survived Oct. 19th,'' said Mr. Seagle of Gruntal, referring to the second anniversary of the 1987 crash, when the Dow fell 508 points, or 22.6 percent.
''Investors have been through this before and are beginning to realize that recent program-driven markets call for sharper moves than before,'' he said. ''It is probable that the decline on Friday will prove to have been a 'normal' intermediate correction, just as Oct. 19, 1987, was the beginning of a foreshortened bear market.''
 
S.&P. 500 Off 0.03, to 347.16
 In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 0.03, to 347.16, while the Big Board composite index eased 0.05, to 192.12. Each index turned in its best week in 16 mohths.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index dipped 0.24, to 382.57, while in over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.13, to 470.67. Both indexes were up for the week, but by far smaller margins than the indexes of large stocks.
Marsh & McLennan jumped 1 1/4, to 81. Insurance stocks rose for the third day in a row on expectations that the price-cutting war in the industry was near an end in the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake.
Philip Morris was the most active stock, slipping 1/8, to 44 3/8, on a volume of 2.5 million shares. Other active blue-chip issues included A.T.&T., up 1/8, to 43 5/8; Chevron, up 5/8, to 66 7/8; Bristol-Myers, off 3/4, to 52; I.B.M., up 1/4, to 104 1/4; Citicorp, off 1/4, to 31 7/8, and General Electric, unchanged, at 56 5/8.
In over-the-counter trading, Groundwater Technology slumped 6 1/4, to 24. The company reported that earnings per share in its fiscal second quarter could fall to as much as 20 percent below last year's level.

HEADLINE: Treasury Notes and Bonds Decline

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury note and bond prices eased yesterday in lackluster trading. Dealers attributed the dull session to the absence of any significant economic or market news and the usual caution that precedes a week in which a large amount of debt is scheduled for sale.
On Monday, for example, the regular weekly Treasury bill auctions will total $15.6 billion, up $400 million from the previous auctions and the largest such offerings since December 1986. The next day, $10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes are scheduled for auction, the largest amount since April 1987. 
Because the bill issues will be roughly $1.55 billion larger than those maturing, it will enable the Treasury to raise that much new cash.
 
Bill Rates Unchanged
 The discount rates on outstanding Treasury bills, however, were virtually unchanged, despite the Federal Reserve's moves to drain more reserves from the banking system through weekend matched sales of bills and other short-term Treasury issues. The late-morning draining hardly budged the key Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans.
The funds traded at 8 11/16 percent almost all day. Meanwhile, the discount rates on current Treasury bills closed virtually unchanged on the day, with the three-month issue at 7.57 percent, the six-month bill at 7.56 percent and the one-year bill at 7.35 percent.
''It seems that with the stock market stabilized, the Fed has set a funds goal at between 8 5/8 and 8 3/4 percent for the time being,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''But the fixed-income market's focus today was on the first auction of $4.5 billion of 30-year Refcorp bonds on Wednesday. At the moment, there seems to be little interest in these bonds shown by the targeted markets, which are the pension funds and Japanese institutions.''
Yesterday, the bonds of the Resolution Funding Corporation, which was created last summer by the Government to rescue failing savings and loan institutions, traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.23 percent, compared with 7.98 percent on comparable Treasury maturities.
Mr. Sullivan and other credit market specialists expect the yield to rise at the auction on Wednesday, because the bonds carry a new ''name'' and thus do have a track record in the market. Also, it is believed that unlike the principal, the interest on the Resolution Funding bonds may not be fully guaranteed. Furthermore, the Government plans to sell $4.5 billion or more of these bonds each quarter for the foreseeable future, Mr. Sullivan noted.
 
Long-Term Bond at 7.98%
 Late in the session, the benchmark Treasury long-term bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, were being offered at 101 20/32, down 8/32, or a quarter-point, on the day. These raised the yield to 7.98 percent, from 7.95 percent Thursday and 7.86 percent a week earlier.
Earlier in the day, the long-term bonds hit an intra-day high of 102 8/32 as some traders covered their short positions in expectation of further large purchases of long-term bonds by Japanese interests. These buyers are said to have bought $1 billion to $2 billion of long-term bonds Thursday.
Elsewhere in the secondary market, the 8 3/8 percent notes of 1991 fell 3/32, to 100 26/32, for a yield of 7.91 percent. The new two-year notes to be auctioned on Tuesday traded at a yield of 7.90 percent on a when-issued basis, up from 7.85 percent Thursday. The 8's of 1996 lost 7/32, at 100 4/32, for a yield of 7.97 percent, while the long-term notes, the 8's of 1999, dropped 8/32, and now yield 7.98 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading In U.S. and Gold Is Stable

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher in quiet New York trading yesterday after a mixed performance overseas.
Gold prices were little changed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.30 an ounce, up 20 cents from Thursday. 
Currency traders attributed the dollar's modest rise largely to internal market influences in the absence of any new market-moving news. They said the market was awaiting the release of the September durable goods report on Tuesday and the preliminary report on the third-quarter gross national product on Thursday.
But Earl I. Johnson, a trader with the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said prospects for increased demand for dollars by the Japanese were giving some support to the currency.
''There seems to be fairly steady demand from institutions, such as large insurance companies, over there,'' he said.
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 142.425 yen, up from 142.00 on Thursday. And each pound bought $1.5885, down from $1.5975.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.8578 West German marks, up from 1.8500; 1.6285 Swiss francs, up from 1.6205; 6.3105 French francs, up from 6.2789; 1.17415 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17345, and 1,395.875 Italian lire, up from 1,360.75.
Silver prices held steady. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.089 an ounce, up from $5.080 Thursday.

HEADLINE: Fighting Addiction: 3 Days in Phoenix House -- A special report.;
Struggle and Hope From Ashes of Drugs

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
As though part of an enormous stage set for some brooding morality play, Phoenix House, a drug-treatment center, stands on the edge of a sinister block in the heart of the Morris Heights section of the Bronx. Scrawled across the treatment center's facade in graffiti are the letters C-R-A-C-K.
Just across the narrow, rubbish-strewn street, a fortified apartment building buzzes with the business of selling and consuming crack. Skeletal figures sit on steps and curbs sucking at fuming crack pipes.
The treatment center is sanity and order amid anarchy. Inside the modest, five-story former apartment building run by the Phoenix House Foundation, nearly every aspect of life is highly regimented: when residents eat, sleep, study and awaken is mapped out and posted. The men are required to be clean shaven, creating an almost military sameness among them. No one, including the center's 44 women, is allowed to wear elaborate jewelry. 
 
'Bring Structure Back'
With the permission of the residents, a reporter spent three days living and working in the drug center, participating in the house chores, group encounters, seminars and classes and, along with newcomers, mopping, sweeping and serving meals.
''We have to bring structure back to their lives,'' said Douglas Scott, the center's director who 21 years ago was a heroin addict sleeping in a wheelbarrow in Harlem. ''We want them to get rid of those negative patterns they had out there in society.''
Drug therapy here, which takes a minimum of 18 months, is rooted in a philosophy common to such long-term programs. Addicts are first humbled with menial jobs, then given steadily increasing responsibilities.
At the same time, they undergo counseling to bolster their resolve to resist drugs, said Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, president of the Phoenix House Foundation.
The treatment is drug free. Addicts are required to detoxify before entering the program.
Henry Benjamin said he could feel himself changing for the better. A year into the program, Mr. Benjamin, 30 years old, said his mind was clearing after more than a year and a half of smoking crack in Harlem.
''People who use drugs always feel that they are running after the drug,'' he said. ''You never have time to think about what to do with your life.
''After not using drugs you eventually see this is the right place to be to get yourself together. There's nothing for me in the streets.''
Phoenix House was founded in 1967 in New York City by a small group of young heroin addicts who pooled their welfare checks and began developing a program built on group encounters, hard physical labor and an environment free of drugs.
Today, the Phoenix House Foundation is a private nonprofit organization that operates six treatment centers in New York and four in California. Phoenix House provides 1,000 beds in New York in contracts with the State Division for Substance Abuse Services. It serves addicts as young as 14.
The program also develops drug education curriculums for public and private schools across the United States.
 
Circle of Confrontation
'You Can't Do This Alone'
 Seated in a circle, a dozen residents lock eyes on the flushed face of Cynthia Terry, a street-toughened young woman raised in Harlem. Choking back her tears, she spoke of years of neglecting her three children and of drunkenness and drug abuse. The group's observations and questions were relentless.
''Why don't you talk to anybody?'' shouted a 21-year-old crack addict. ''You're encapsulated.'' ''This is what I've got for you,'' screamed another. ''You can't do this alone.''
In a broken voice, the 30-year-old Mrs. Terry told the group that she had become reclusive after a recurrence of guilt about the death of her mother, who died a decade ago of lupus, while Mrs. Terry was snorting cocaine.
''She was always there for me, and all I could do was go out and get high,'' Mrs. Terry said, sobbing. ''I want to start my life over. I want to be a good mother, and this is so hard. It hurts. it hurts an awful lot.'' The group, including Mrs. Terry, then bore down on several others who they believed had shown recent signs of withholding their feelings - ''stuffing feelings,'' or ''encapsulating,'' in the slang of Phoenix House.
 
Search for Identity
'I Feel Better About Myself'
 The issue of identity looms large inside this former apartment building, where men and women live and work to escape their addictions.
Crack addicts have traded in the trappings of their former identities to look like bank teller trainees.
''That's all image,'' explained Dennis McCabe, 22 years old, dressed in a crisp white shirt, narrow necktie and pressed pants. ''I feel better about myself when I look like this.''
Since July, he has been assigned to kitchen duty, where residents sweat and gripe over steamy stoves and hoist and scour dirty pots. Mr. McCabe, who is addicted to hard liquor and hard drugs, is charged with overseeing the kitchen operation.
Like everyone else in the house, his work is part of his therapy. Mr. McCabe said he used to begin his day by drinking a half pint of Absolut vodka in the shower. He said he drank because he was alone, and he was afraid to extend himself to people or become responsible for them. To challenge Mr. McCabe's fears, the counselors forced him to work supervising the kitchen crew.
When new residents arrive, they are usually put to work on the service crew: cleaning the toilets and mopping, sweeping and dusting. The experience serves in part to humble them, in part to teach them the Phoenix House system from the ground up.
A resident who sweeps the worn marble and wood stairwell that winds from the basement to the fifth floor is careful not to leave a single mop string in his wake - even though more seasoned residents often interrupt him to quiz him on the rules and regulations that govern the life inside the house.
Sexual contact between participants in the program is not permitted, nor is smoking in the bathrooms or entering rooms without invitation. Breaking any of these rules could lead to loss of a high-status job, weekend leaves or even expulsion from the program.
Cheryl Baldwin, 32, lost her temper and cursed a staff member. After three and a half months of working at a Phoenix House induction center, where new residents are screened and prepared for life in a drug-treatment center, she was busted back to the service crew where she said she feels ''suffocated.'' Even though she dislikes her new job, she still offers advice on proper behavior to less experienced residents.
''I didn't understand what I had learned in three and a half months,'' said Ms. Baldwin. ''Now I cry. I want to get back outside and work.''
She realizes that there are consequences to her behavior, she said.
Everyone is responsible for their area in dormitory-style sleeping quarters. Beds are made with crisp hospital corners. Shoes are neatly lined up beneath the bed's edge. Clothes are hung up, with the hangers all facing the same way. There are frequent inspections, too. The entire house could be placed on a weekend ban - meaning no one is permitted to leave - if things get sloppy.
The watchword is consistency, Mr. Scott said. ''They got away from all those normal, real feelings of trust and honesty and now have to begin with building up their self-esteem,'' he said. ''One way to do that is to do well and start feeling good about yourself.''
He customarily invites groups of new residents to his office, where he offers a slice of cake and a chance to discover that he can be their friend as well as a howling, omnipresent task master.
The meeting is a break in a day that is a slave to routine.
 
Life of Regimentation
'You've Hit Rock Bottom'
 Every day begins the same way.
 After a 30-minute breakfast at 7 A.M., there is an hour-long meeting that includes inspirational songs and skits written and performed by the addicts. One humorous skit urged residents to take special care in selecting a babysitter. The performers were two characters wearing mops on their heads and speaking in Caribbean accents. When their fictional ''Rasta Babysitting Service'' is found to be indifferent to the children, the room roared with laughter. Yet the point is made when the skit's mothers reclaim their children.
The rest of the day dissolved into a blur of seminars, classes to prepare for the general equivalency diploma, rap sessions, job assignments and more meals and meetings. There is little free time until 9 P.M. Lights are out at 11 P.M. The 185-word Phoenix House philosophy is recited from memory at least twice a day.
The weekend schedule is slightly more relaxed, with rented videos available and highly supervised trips ''out into New York,'' as the residents refer to the world beyond the walls of Phoenix House.
Most of the residents are between the ages of 20 and 40. They come from a range of socio-economic backgrounds but were ultimately impoverished by their various addictions, usually crack, cocaine, heroin, PCP or liquor; sometimes, all of them. Most are on public assistance, which helps to pay for their treatment, Phoenix House officials said.
Fifteen percent of the residents are remanded by the criminal-justice system for treatment. Many have lengthy criminal records, which often include armed robbery, burglary, prositution and drug sales, residents say.
''You've lost everything when you've got to come here,'' said Yolanda Turner, a 28-year-old crack addict who after 14 months of treatment is taking a word processing course outside the center. ''You've hit rock bottom. This place is no resort at all.''
 
Falling From Grace
 
Eternal Vigilance And Freedom
 In the lower lounge, a rough-hewn basement with chairs and the only television in the house, Lawrence Robinson sat wearing shredded ''bum's clothes'' over his own.
Mr. Robinson sadly studied the faces of his inquisitors - impassioned, impatient. Each screamed for a chance to indict him.
After 15 months of accepting the regimentation of Phoenix House and drug-free living, Mr. Robinson, a 38-year-old former New York Telephone engineer, had ''fallen.'' While in the final stages of the recovery program, crack cravings overwhelmed him and his new discipline dissolved into a hazy inhalation of a palmfull of crack rocks, he said.
Recently he returned to Phoenix House to try to regain his footing. On returning, he said he was ''embarrassed and ashamed'' about what he had done.
But no blind hostility greeted him. Peer counseling, steps to understand, began anew. For more than 30 minutes Mr. Robinson listened as a dozen fellow residents alternately berated and befriended the man now forced to wear a torso-sized sign announcing his lapse in judgment. ''I knew what tools to use,'' he said in a soft-spoken defense. ''I just didn't use them.''
Some residents have been known, although rarely, to sneak out to smoke crack. They are dealt with severely. One was required recently to sit at a table in a hallway and talk for days to fellow residents, one at a time, about why he had forgotten or ignored what Phoenix House had tried to teach him.
''When people leave here and get high, it's a selfish act,'' said Carmen Irizarry, a Phoenix House counselor who two years ago was herself a heroin addict recovering in the same institution.
In her office and in several other rooms including the main lounge, tanks of exotic fish are prominently displayed. No one knows why fish have become so popular at Phoenix House. But they seem appropriate since most residents say they feel as though they live in a fish bowl. Little escapes the collective eyes and ears of the house. Several of the residents, known by the clipboards they carry, keep tabs on the exact locations of all residents at all times. There is no privacy.
''If you know something, everybody else is going to know it,'' said William McDowell, a 40-year-old Vietnam veteran, whose shrapnel injury led to morphine addiction and then to a 25-year heroin habit. ''Once you tell one person, that person is going to tell someone else.''
Very often what residents notice in fellow residents is brought into the group encounters, a centerpiece of Phoenix House's drug-free treatment.
 
Tradition of Help
 
'It Takes A Long Time'
 For more than 20 years, addicts have been turning to this Phoenix House and its tradition of helping addicts help themselves to sobriety.
''We are really optimistic about this,'' said Douglas Chiappetta, director of the Therapeutic Communities of America, a Washington-based trade group for drug and alcohol rehabiliation programs. ''They are not just dealing with the drug addiction, but the reason that drives that person to use drugs.''
Yet long-term residential drug programs like Phoenix House have their critics. Residential treatment is relatively expensive, they note, annually costing about $15,000 a person compared with methadone maintenance programs exclusively used for heroin addiction, which cost about a fifth that amount. Additionally, residential treatment program officials acknowledge that drop-out rates in their programs are high, up to 60 percent.
But supporters of residential treatment claim that their graduates tend to stay drug free.
Since crack exploded on New York City streets five years ago, the number of crack-related drug admissions to rehabiliation programs has more than tripled, according to a recent report by the New York office of the Federal Drug Administration. The center on Phelan Place, like the others in the city, is operating at capacity, its officials said.
Testifying before a Congressional committee this fall, Dr. Rosenthal said a recent recidivism study found that ''only 5 percent of one group and 1 in another'' had returned to drug use after five to seven years after completing treatment.
It is still too early to know how effective drug-free residential treatment has been in dealing with crack addiction, he said, because widespread crack use is relatively new.
There is no substance known to counter crack's powerfully addictive hold, experts say.
''It takes a long time,'' Dr. Rosenthal said. ''In a period of three to 10 months the fog starts to clear.''
 
Demands of the Effort
 
'What We Do: Examine'
 Manny Rivera began his day in high gear. The 50-year-old former heroin addict is one of the center's eight counselors. Intellectual, energetic and demanding, Mr. Rivera is revving up his group.
Paraphrasing Socrates, he tells them that an unexamined life is not worth living. ''And in a therapeutic community, that's what we do: examine.''
Borrowing from Abraham Lincoln, he tells them, ''I don't think much of a man who doesn't know more today than he knew yesterday.''
One resident confessed that she did not want to be in the program. After seven months, she said she had grown tired of the house rules, regulations and procedures.
''If you saw a man lying in the middle of the street with a broken arm and leg after being run over by a car and he didn't want to go to the hospital, what would you say?'' Mr. Rivera asked the group.
''You would say he wants to die,'' he said, answering his own question. ''You need to be here.''
She lowered her head and nodded.

HEADLINE: For Victims of the Hurricane, Pain and Uncertainty Linger

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AWENDAW, S.C., Oct. 20

 BODY:
Every morning for almost a month, 75-year-old Harper McNeil has climbed into his rusted 1972 station wagon and driven to the debris-strewn site where Hurricane Hugo obliterated his trailer home Sept. 21.
Near the beginning of this month, Mr. McNeil applied for Federal emergency assistance, which he hopes to use to buy a new trailer. But he has not yet received any word about his application, and for now all he can do each day is sit alone in his parked car and wait and hope.
''I feel better being here,'' said Mr. McNeil, a retired stevedore whose wife died in April. He is staying with his son nearby but wants to remain independent. ''My mind feels better when I'm here. It's home.'' 
 
'Nothing Is Like It Was'
The nation's attention has moved on to a new disaster, the California earthquake, but here where the hurricane struck, the pain continues, the needs remain enormous and questions about the future still abound.
''Nothing is like it was,'' said Jimmy Lewis, who is living in a 10-by-10-foot utility building and awaiting a disaster loan to rebuild his home in Alvin, S.C., while his wife and daughter stay with relatives. ''People seem different,'' he said. ''Nothing seems like it was before the storm came up.''
Hurricane Hugo remains the nation's costliest storm, with damage on the United States mainland estimated at more than $5 billion. In South Carolina alone, 24 of the state's 46 counties have been designated Federal disaster areas.
 
Criticism of Federal Effort
The month since the storm hit has brought both enormous deprivation and astonishing generosity throughout the Carolinas. There remains considerable criticism of the pace of the Federal disaster effort, which is coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
''Now San Francisco gets to find out what it means when someone says, ''I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help,' '' said Dan O'Rourk, who owns a marina that was severely damaged on Folly Beach near Charleston.
But others say FEMA has become a convenient place for venting frustrations. And part of the lesson of Hurricane Hugo is the reminder that what nature ripped apart man cannot easily stitch back together.
 
A Daily Routine Has Returned
For many residents, the routine of daily life has returned. In Charleston, the historic homes on the Battery and the elegant shops and restaurants on King Street seem almost back to normal except for the neat piles of tree limbs and debris stacked by the curb. For homeowners with insurance, the problem is often finding a contractor, not coming up with the money.
But in the poor neighborhoods farther inland, and throughout the shoreline and countryside of one of the nation's poorest states, the hurricane's toll is still everywhere.
It ranges from the eerie, splintered ruins of what is left of the Francis Marion National Forest to towns like Manning, Sumter and Camden, nowhere near the shore, that are still littered with upended trees and overturned mobile homes.
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston acknowledged in an interview that the recovery of downtown masks the continuing problems, particularly for the city's poor.
''They live closest to the economic edge,'' he said. ''Their houses are less solid. Their insurance is less extensive. Their jobs are less secure. Their churches have fewer resources. It is always the poor who get hurt the worst.''
 
Aid Remains Elusive
In a state that ranks 42d nationally in per capita income, an enormous number of people are finding how close to the edge they are and how elusive aid remains.
Gherman Guthrie's livelihood depended on the 40-foot shrimp boat he built himself five years ago. A month after the hurricane, it has been patched up and is almost seaworthy, he said. It will eventually need a $7,000 overhaul, but he does not have the money and does not think the Federal emergency effort can help him.
''If you can make $25,000, you probably don't need the loan they can give you,'' he said. ''If you're making $7,000 or $8,000 you can't get one because they say you're not able to pay it back.''
Others said the chaotic pressures of realigning life after the hurricane made it impossible to spend the hours or days needed to wait in line and grapple with the paperwork to apply for Federal assistance.
''I don't understand,'' said Allston Leland, a shrimper in McClellanville, S.C., who saw one of his boats sink and who has propped up the other on land awaiting repairs. ''They give farmers $100,000 not to plant peanuts, and here we're totally wiped out, and they're trying to figure out whether to give us 4 or 8 percent loans. Someone's got their priorities out of whack.''
In some towns, like McClellanville, a seaside community that was one of those hit hardest by the storm, recovery is still a full-time job, whether it is shrimpers trying to get their boats together, homeowners hauling away debris or people arranging food and shelter for children or the elderly.
 
Help From Unexpected Places
Like many other communities, McClellanville could not have come back without a vast volunteer effort from around the country. A crew of 45 striking miners from West Virginia appeared from nowhere, pitched tents for themselves so they could help the town dig out.
There were contractors who donated building materials, and the residents of Ocean County, N.J., who sent 37 truckloads of food and clothes, three fire trucks and a dump truck, and electricians and other workers to help McClellanville.
About 30 miles away in Cordesville, where almost every building suffered damage, a group of volunteers in the Mennonite Disaster Service from several states were repairing buildings today. They expect to work in the town regularly over the next year.
''Without the volunteers, without the one-to-one help, I don't know where we would be,'' said Patti Gross, a McClellanville resident. ''They've been absolutely beautiful.''
Feelings are far more mixed about the Federal relief effort. Officials admit the Government has been slow. Of 23,451 applications for emergency grants of up to $10,000 in South Carolina, only 1,939 have been approved and 1,500 checks totaling $4.2 million have been sent out. Of 16,754 people who have applied for temporary housing assistance, 1,782 have received aid so far.
The Government has more than 2,000 trailers for emergency housing, and 150 of them have been moved to South Carolina. So far, one family has been placed in one.
Inspectors must review damage before approving claims. When the first center opened a week after the storm, there were 25 inspectors for the whole state; now there are 100. Fewer than a third of the 26,000 damaged or destroyed residences whose owners have applied for grants or housing assistance have been inspected.
 
Even FEMA Is Overwhelmed
Even FEMA officials say the task has been overwhelming, especially for an organization that relies on part-time reservist staff members who work only when called up.
''We had St. Croix, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Charleston, and now San Francisco,'' said Verne McCloskey, center director for the FEMA office in Moncks Corner, S.C., one of 12 now open in the state. ''There was a hurricane in Texas and a flood in Kentucky. We just can't get to everyone that fast.''
There are many people whose needs far exceed what FEMA can provide.
Emily Runey's house on what was the second row of houses - it may soon be the first - off the beach at Folly Beach, S.C., is barely standing. One room is habitable and the rest is a waterlogged pile of boxes and rubble.
She has applied to FEMA for a $10,000 grant for repairs, but city officials say it will cost $50,000 to salvage it.
''I'd rather my throat be cut than move,'' said Mrs. Runey, a 72-year-old retired seamstress. ''And where do I have to go to? I just want things fixed up so I can live decent.''
Charleston has raised $1.1 million in donations that will go toward home repairs and other needs the Government cannot meet.
Officials in Folly Beach are hoping to raise $300,000 to $400,000, but they know it will not be easy. In addition to residents' problems, the city faces severe revenue problems because most of its businesses, including the Atlantic House restaurant, its best-known attraction, were destroyed.
''We lost the restaurant, the marina and 50 percent of the houses rented out to tourists; that's most of what we had,'' said Carol Linville, who is the wife of the town's Mayor, Bob Linville, and who is heading the relief operation. ''We're just hoping other cities around the country will adopt us.''
Jack Glover, a spokesman for FEMA, said much of the criticism of the agency and the relief effort reflected a lack of awareness of the agency's structure and what it can and cannot provide.
''This is not the great engine of social justice,'' he said. ''We're here to provide temporary assistance in an emergency.''
He said that in the long run, communities emerge from disasters as well off or better than they had been, because of the vast construction efforts.
But Mayor Riley of Charleston said the nation's growth, particularly along the coasts, may be outstripping its ability to manage disasters.
 
Patience Is Praised
''The one thing we know for sure is that each natural disaster will involve more people and be more complex to deal with,'' he said.
Mr. McCloskey of FEMA praised the patience of the people of South Carolina. ''People have been wonderful, long-suffering and patient,'' he said.
But after a month of uncertainty, most are hoping to get their lives in order soon.
Mr. Leland, the shrimper from McClellanville, may have summed up the mood when he tried to decide whether an available crane would be big enough to lift his 50-foot shrimp boat, Regulus.
''They say it might take care of it,'' he said. ''We don't want no more mights. We're about mighted out here.''

HEADLINE: A Potential New Soviet Export Product: Cold-War-Surplus Missiles

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
In an effort to turn swords into plowshares, or ''tanks into tractors,'' as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d put it last week, the Soviet Union is trying to turn its SS-20 missile into a commercial rocket for launching small satellites into space.
The SS-20, an intermediate-range missile that held three nuclear warheads, was eliminated as part of the 1987 treaty banning medium- and shorter-range missiles based on land. The Soviet Union is in the process of destroying its 654 SS-20 missiles.
But now, with the help of a Houston-based company, Moscow wants its SS-20 factory to make a space launcher that could be transported to launching sites around the world. It would be the first Soviet-American joint venture derived from military armaments. 
Officials familiar with the project were unable to say exactly when, or if, it might be realized, because of the the approval needed at various levels of the United States and Soviet Governments. Some Federal officials worry that the conversion project might violate the 1987 treaty or complicate the negotiation of future arms accords. After all, they say, a rocket is able to serve either military or civilian ends.
 
Part of Economic Change
Promoters of the project insist that only peaceful uses are envisioned for the rocket and that this could be easily confirmed by inspectors. They say such conversion projects are crucial to the success of the economic restructuring now sought by Soviet officials.
''They don't want to throw people out of work,'' said Arthur M. Dula, president of Space Commerce Corporation, which has joined the Soviets to develop and market the new rocket. ''We think it's interesting that the Russians want to convert their industry to something other than building weapons.''
So far, Mr. Dula said, seven or eight potential customers have asked for information, and Norway, Canada, Brazil and Australia have shown interest in providing launching sites. In Moscow on Oct. 11, Mr. Dula obtained technical specifications, which he will use to conduct a detailed market survey.
Mr. Dula has worked with Moscow on other commercial space projects, including the sale of satellite launchings on large Soviet rockets and the use of Soviet space hardware for the display of advertising.
 
To Be Priced Competitively
Moscow says its end of the conversion deal is being handled by Technopribor, a Soviet consortium set up to export previously secret technology that has been declassified as some defense industries try to switch to civilian production. Technopribor's deputy director, Yuri S. Solomonov, recently told Tass, the official Soviet news agency, that the rocket's price for lofting commercial payloads would be lower than that of any Western competitor.
In an interview, Mr. Dula said the price could range from $3 million to $5 million. By contrast, launchings by a new small rocket under development in America, the Pegasus, are to cost $6 million to $8 million.
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Forces Treaty calls on the Soviet Union to scrap not only its SS-20's but also 170 SS-4's, 6 SS-5's, 726 SS-12's, 200 SS-23's and 84 SSC-X-4's. For its part, the United States is destroying 247 Pershing 2's, 170 Pershing 1A's and 442 ground-launched cruise missiles. The treaty bans flight testing and production of all these missiles as well as production of their launchers.
The SS-20, known in the West as the ''Saber,'' is a 54-foot-long, two-stage, solid-fuel missile that was moved about on a huge green vehicle that had 12 oversized tires. A Pentagon publication, ''Soviet Military Power,'' said in 1987 that ''the mobility inherent in the SS-20 design has afforded a level of undetectability and survivability unmatched in previous systems.''
 
Can Launch 770-Pound Payload
The Soviets call the new commercial rocket ''Start.'' It is to have three stages instead of two, to give the payload extra kick, and is to be 65 feet long. Mr. Dula said it would be able to lift payloads of up to 770 pounds into orbit. The main use, he added, would be for launching small scientific satellites measuring about three by four feet. He said the rocket, its mobile transporter and associated tracking equipment could be flown virtually anywhere in the new AN-225 ''Mriya,'' the largest transport aircraft in the world.
''The whole idea is to be able to launch from the customer's launch site, or from his driveway, if he wants to,'' Mr. Dula said.
There is a growing worldwide market for the launching of small satellites, which are becoming increasingly powerful as they benefit from the revolution in the miniaturization of electronic circuitry.
The Soviets have said they can build 300 launchers within 10 years after a decision to go ahead. Flight testing of the launcher could begin in early 1991.
 
Steps Before Go-Ahead
A Soviet go-ahead decision depends on the results of the market survey, Mr. Dula said, adding that the decision could come within a few months. Government experts said the Soviet Union would also have to consult in detail with the United States to iron out any potential conflicts with 1987 treaty before pressing ahead with the project. The treaty set up a Special Verification Commission for American and Soviet representatives to ''resolve questions relating to compliance with the obligations assumed'' under the treaty.
The factory that once built SS-20 missiles is at Votkinsk, west of the Urals. More than two dozen American inspectors are stationed there permanently to make sure the Soviets comply with the treaty, which calls not only for the destruction of existing intermediate and shorter-range missiles, but also for an end to the production of new ones.
The ''Start'' rocket, Mr. Dula said, is of a completely new design that will not incorporate the main parts of SS-20 missiles, such as rocket motors, all of which are to be destroyed. The plan, however, calls for using engineering plans and tooling for the SS-20, as well as some existing parts that the treaty allows to be converted for other purposes. For instance, the SS-20's guidance system is to be used to steer satellites into orbit.
Soviet officials have acknowledged that conversion of the factory would require new legal and technical safeguards to insure against possible military use of the commercial rocket. American officials are wary. Possible Conflict With Treaty State Department and Pentagon spokesmen said they could make no comment about the conversion project, and one State Deparment official said ''people are looking at the possibility of conflict'' with the treaty.
An official at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said other worries included whether the project might complicate the negotiation of a Start treaty to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, since the new commercial rocket might be counted as a Soviet SS-25 missile under rules being developed. The SS-25 is a three-stage missile that is slightly longer than the SS-20. He also said the project might violate international limits on the export of ballistic missile technologies.
''We don't have enough information on it at this point to make a judgment,'' the official said.
On Monday, Secretary Baker said the United States was prepared to provide Moscow with advice and technical assistance to help restructure the Soviet economy, adding that the transformation of ''tanks into tractors'' that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union had spoken of had yet to materialize.
Mr. Dula said he hoped the rocket conversion plan would find favor with Mr. Baker.
''The Soviets are trying to compete in areas where they're good,'' Mr. Dula said. ''They're not going to succeed with Coke or pizza. Their aerospace industry is the best they've got in the country, and they're trying to convert it to commercial production.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Jews Plan Drive to Protect Auschwitz Site

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Troubled by the decay of buildings and exhibits at the site of the Auschwitz death camp, American Jews are organizing an international campaign to conserve them.
Polish experts have long recognized an urgent need for conservation measures, but given the depressed state of Poland's economy little money has been available.
This month, Kazimierz Smolen, the director of the Oswiecim-Brzezinka Museum, as the camp site is officially known, signed an agreement permitting a team of conservation experts to visit the site in December to assess what kind of preservation work is necessary. The team will be headed by James Frantz, the chief conservator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, The agreement said the purpose of the inspection, which is scheduled for Dec. 15 to Dec. 17, will be to develop a ''program of preservation of the premises and buildings'' at the camp. Signing the agreement with Mr. Smolen was Kalman Sultanik of New York, vice president of the World Jewish Congress, and Frank Reiss, the vice president of the Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, which is financing the initial study. 
The camp has been the center of a dispute over the presence of a Carmelite convent just outside its walls. Roman Catholic Church leaders only recently bowed to pressure from Jewish groups demanding that it be moved from the site, which they consider the central symbol of the Nazi genocide carried out against European Jewry.
 
'Entirely Unrelated'
Mr. Sultanik stressed the importance of carrying out plans to build an interfaith center near the camp site to which the nuns are to move. But he said the conservation project was ''entirely unrelated'' to the convent dispute.
According to Mr. Sultanik, who also represented the Lauder Foundation, the idea is to begin an international campaign to raise money for refurbishing and preserving the camp remnants.
Many of the buildings at the various sprawling camp sites that make up Auschwitz are in an advanced state of decay. Visitors to Birkenau, the nearby site of enormous gas chambers and crematoriums where the Germans sent millions of Jews to their deaths, are struck by the decrepit condition of the wooden barracks that once housed Jews awaiting their fate. Many were destroyed by fire right after the war and others were dismantled by local people seeking building material.
But there is also serious concern over the state of exhibits in Auschwitz, the main camp site, including huge heaps of personal items, like hairbrushes, spectacles and luggage, as well as mounds of human hair, that testify to the brutality of the camps.
''If nothing is done the place will simply fall apart,'' Mr. Sultanik said in a telephone interview.
But he said the plan was to ''restore and improve'' the camp site ''without disturbing the exhibits, barracks, crematoria and other facilities.''
 
'This Demonic Symbol'
The project appears to bear the potential for concern that changes could be made in the character of the camp site.
Reflecting some of the those concerns, Rabbi A. James Rudin, the national director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish Committee, cautioned against any refurbishing project that would ''alter the character of Auschwitz, this demonic symbol.''
On a visit to Warsaw to prepare a conference of Jewish and Polish leaders, Rabbi Rudin said, ''Maintenance is one thing, but the second large question is how will the Holocaust be remembered, how will it be taught 50 years from now.''
He said the convent dispute and the re-emergence of the Catholic Church in Eastern Europe after years of repression by Communist Governments prompted concern among Jewish leaders about attitudes toward Jews and the recollection of the Holocaust.
''We are moving into a new generation that will not have survivors around to remind them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Some Say Plan for Lake Erie Park Could Make Matters Worse

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRESQUE ISLE, Pa.

 BODY:
Despite a decade of evidence that breakwaters ruin shorelines, Pennsylvania recently began building the world's largest breakwater system here to protect one of the nation's most popular parks from the pounding waves of Lake Erie.
Presque Isle State Park is little known outside the Great Lakes region, but it attracts more visitors - six million last year - than any national park except the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. The 3,100-acre peninsula, which forms a natural harbor for the city of Erie, has five and a half miles of sandy beaches and such a diversity of forests and wetlands that botanists say it is one of the rarest and finest ecological preserves in the world.
But almost every winter storms erode its beaches, and geologists say this 600-year-old sand spit will be washed away by lake currents and storms in 300 years if erosion is not controlled. For many years, the state and Federal governments have replenished the beaches with thousands of tons of new sand at a cost of up to $1.5 million a year. 
 
Effort to Cut Annual Costs
Sixteen years ago, in an effort to cut these costs, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed building a breakwater of rocks parallel to shore that would rise six feet above the waterline and act as a buffer, absorbing the energy of crashing waves and protecting the beaches. The corps says the plan, which is estimated to cost $30 million and was approved by Congress last year, offers a permanent solution and would reduce the cost of the annual sand replenishment program to $500,000.
The state endorsed the federally subsidized plan because there was no good alternative, said Mary Ellen Bolish, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Resources, which oversees state parks. She said that Federal subsidies for the existing sand replenishment program were winding down and that the state could no longer shoulder those costs alone.
But a number of safety and environmental questions have been raised about the breakwater, including fears that it would create the dangerous turbulence of riptides and would trap bacteria that would aggravate a pollution problem that caused temporary beach closings 15 times last year.
A variety of geologists and engineers, including some hired by the state last year, say the project's designers have not shown persuasively that the breakwater will warrant the risk and expense. ''The state could buy sand forever just with the interest payments it would get by putting the breakwater money in a bank,'' said Paul D. Knuth, an associate professor of geography at Edinboro State University in Edinboro, Pa.
Dr. Joseph T. Kelley, a marine geologist with Maine's Geological Survey, said his state outlawed breakwaters a decade ago. He said the problem with breakwaters is so well established that the certification exam for geologists in Maine includes the question: ''If one were to erect a breakwater offshore from a beach, what would be the effect over the next five to 10 years?'' The correct answer, Dr. Kelley said, is that sand would be trapped directly behind the breakwater and severe erosion would occur at both ends of it.
Dr. Orrin Pilkey, a professor of geology at Duke University who is an authority on beach erosion, said breakwaters are outlawed in North Carolina, and in many other states, including South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana, they are meant primarily to protect harbors. ''The Corps of Engineers is very, very far behind in understanding this trend,'' he said.
 
Questioned for Many Years
The Presque Isle project has been questioned in professional circles for many years but has never encountered organized opposition. By now the plan has gathered so much political support in the state that it is almost a taboo to criticize it, said Wasinder S. Mokha, a member of the Presque Isle State Park Advisory Board and director of the Public Works Department in Erie, which adjoins the park.
''It just keeps steamrolling along and nobody wants to stop and think about it anymore,'' Mr. Mokha said. ''But if public hearings were held today, there would be enough technical information to put tremendous doubt about the advisability of building the breakwater, and it would never be built.''
The Pennsylvania delegation to Congress, including Senator John Heinz, a Republican with a strong environmental record, lobbied hard for Federal financing for the breakwater. ''The Senator would share any concern raised by the experts,'' said Leonard S. Glickman, the Senator's legislative specialist on the breakwater. ''But Presque Isle has been studied for years by the Army Corps of Engineers and all the studies the Senator has seen indicate that the breakwater has a chance; if it doesn't work, we go back to where we were.''
Construction cranes, now gathering in Erie harbor, will soon start placing more than half a million tons of desk-and car-sized boulders in 58 separate mounds, one every 350 feet along a line parallel to the shore and 300 feet out.
Opponents say it is difficult to determine where design and politics part company in the project, and they cite two examples of how the corps rewrote its plan to get Federal subsidies. In 1981, for instance, the corps justified the breakwater plan as a way to protect a recreational area. But in 1986, after the Reagan Administration rejected that idea, the corps submitted the same plan but said it would provide no recreational benefits - only protection for Erie Harbor.
 
From 12 Years to 2
In another instance the corps, to win Congressional approval, agreed to build the project in two years after previously insisting that the breakwater had to be constructed over 12 years to permit flexibility in design, reduce costs and maximize benefits. Richard J. Gorecki, project manager for the corps, concedes that the plan has been compromised, but he added, ''I don't have any problem building it in two years.''
State officials say they relied on the corps' expertise in endorsing the project. ''The corps is really the primary sponsor of the project,'' said Terry R. Fabian, director of the State Office of Natural Resources in the Department of Environmental Resources. ''They have looked at all the specifics.''
Still, he said, the state was sufficiently concerned about the project to have the plans reviewed by a coastal-engineering firm, Moffatt & Nichol of Raleigh, N.C. ''They were satisfied with the project,'' Mr. Fabian stated.
But the consultants said in their report that they were unable to reach any conclusion. ''Segmented breakwaters may be the appropriate solution, but there has been insuffient evidence presented that the proposed structures wil perform adequately,'' the consultants said in the June 1988 report.
The study also raised questions about the project's economic justifications, its engineering assumptions and its effect on public safety. John R. Lesnik, an author of the report, said in a recent interview that the corps had disagreed with the findings and had ignored its call for further study.
''There is room for reasonable doubt and disagreement on whether the breakwater will work,'' Mr. Lesnik said.

HEADLINE: Science Agency Cancels Supercomputer Aid

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The National Science Foundation has canceled the financing for the John von Neumann National Supercomputer Center in Princeton, N.J., one of five supercomputer centers in the nation.
The foundation decided not to renew its financing for the center beyond September 1990, the end of the current five-year grant period. The center,, which is operated by a consortium of 14 universities, including Princeton, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has received about $44 million from the Federal science agency in the last five years. It had expected grants of about $69 million over the next five years. 
Several computer science experts said last week that the decision, announced by Princeton on Tuesday, was surprising because the supercomputer centers are widely viewed as the foundation of the Bush Administration's plan to link the nation's supercomputers with a high-speed computer network.
 
Equipment Problems
National Science Foundation officials defended the decision, saying it was made because ETA Systems, the company that made the two computers used by the von Neumann Center, went out of business in April.
''It was a difficult situation, but they were faced with hardware and software that was less than adequate,'' said Thomas Weber, director for advanced scientific computing at the foundation. ''It was a risk when the decision to fund the von Neumann Center was made in 1985. It's unfortunate that the risk didn't pay off.''
The financing cutback was not related to budgetary concerns, he said.
''This is more negative fallout from the demise of ETA Systems,'' said Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for Supercomputer Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ''This is an unfortunate development that shows what can happen when strategic American manufacturers remove themselves from the marketplace.''
When the program to create supercomputer centers began, there were few supercomputers at educational institutions. Now there are 35 to 40 nationwide. The von Neumann Center supports the research of 1,400 scientific researchers nationwide. A Setback for the U.S. The closing of ETA Systems, the Minnesota supercomputer maker that was a subsidiary of the Control Data Corporation, was seen as a setback for United States high-technology industries. American computer makers now hold a lead in supercomputing over Japanese competitors, but the Japanese are making significant progress.
Officials at the von Neumann Center said the foundation's decision undercut national science and industrial policies. ''I was astonished at this decision,'' said Doyle Knight, president of the center. ''It is inconsistent with the recommendations of their own peer review panel.''
He said, for instance, that the foundation's review had endorsed the center's proposal to buy a supercomputer made by Cray Research Inc.
Mr. Knight also said the von Neumann Center had trained more specialists in supercomputing than any other center in the United States.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL AFTERSHOCK;
California Quake Seen as Challenging State's Reluctance to Tax and Spend

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The devastating earthquake here is already having a political aftershock: a re-examination of California's reluctance to tax and spend, enshrined in law by a series of voter initiatives over the last decade that now constitutionally handcuff the state's ability to repair its crumbled highways and bridges.
Officials in the Bay Area, in Sacramento and in Washington are to meet to design a Federal relief package, expected to total more than $3.5 billion, and consider new state taxes, probably on gasoline, to pay the huge repair bills.
But before California can spend much of this money, experts say, voters will have to go to the polls and rewrite the constitutional provisions that put California in the forefront of a taxpayer revolt that began in 1978 with a ground-breaking ballot intitiative by Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann and solidified the next year in another Gann measure. 
Experts in state government, taxation and California politics have little doubt that these shackles will be loosened in response to the recent catastrophe, which left a shambles of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and a half dozen stretches of Bay Area highway, with new damage discovered every day and projected repair times lengthening. Change in Political Landscape? But there are larger questions being asked here about whether the earthquake has changed the political landscape in more lasting ways, about whether the temblor that rolled through seven counties on Tuesday jolted Californians out of the dream of adequate services and extensive public works without new taxes.
Representative Don Edwards, a Democrat and the dean of the California Congressional delegation, compared the potential for a political sea change to events that followed July's Supreme Court ruling limiting access to abortion. That ruling prompted vigorous lobbying by abortion rights groups and modified positions by elected officials who had previously been adamantly opposed to abortion.
''Something like that could happen here,'' Representative Edwards said.
Mr. Edwards and other local leaders, most of them Democrats opposed to the taxing and spending limits, noted that California has been suffering a quiet dimunition of services for a decade, now highlighted by an enormous natural disaster.
''This state has contrived through the initiative process to bind itself in fiscal knots and restrict itself in emergencies,'' said Representative Vic Fazio, a Democrat. ''Now Mother Nature has entered in and brought that reality more clearly to the fore.''
 
Two Constitutional Limits
There are two state constitutional provisions that limit California's ability to tax and spend, the first more famous and the second more far-reaching and disabling in the current crisis.
The first measure, Proposition 13, was approved by the voters here in 1978. It limits real estate taxes, which finance an array of county and city services. Experts estimate that this measure has cost local governments $7 billion a year statewide since its passage.
The second measure, passed the following year and referred to here as the Gann Limit, puts a lid on annual government spending, based on a complicated formula involving population and inflation. While Proposition 13 was forcefully opposed by most of the state's politicians, the second measure was generally supported because elected leaders felt, ''The people had spoken and they are the boss,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
The state is expected to reach its spending limits this year, as it did last year, when tax refunds were made to the people of California. Once the limit is reached, new tax revenue, like the 25-cent-a-gallon gas tax suggested this week by several state legislators to pay for damaged roads and highways, cannot be spent without mortgaging the future.
The Gann measure permits the state to exceed the limit in emergencies declared by the Governor and Legislature, but the money must then be subtracted from the general fund in the next three years, potentially causing drastic reductions in vital state services. ''We have no resilience in an emergency, given these limits,'' said Eugene Lee, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley.
To use new gasoline tax revenue under these circumstances, state voters would have to cast ballots on whether to amend the Constitution. Such a measure, sponsored by State Senator John Garamendi, a Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, is already on the ballot for next June's primary election. Until the earthquake Tuesday, the prospects for passing the ballot measure were ''dismal,'' said Jim Donnelly of the California Taxpayers Association, a lobbying group.
 
Alternatives for State
To receive Federal disaster aid, the state must come up with 25 percent in matching money, either from a rainy day fund that currently has $800 million or by collecting new taxes, which cannot be spent without a vote amending the State Constitution. It is doubtful that Gov. George Deukmejian will empty the contingency fund, which would not count against the Gann limits but would leave the state's cupboard bare.
A special legislative session is expected to be convened here by Governor Deukmejian. He is a staunch opponent of new taxes, but this week he said he ''had not ruled out'' a ''temporary tax increase'' to help pay for rebuilding the area's highways and bridges.
That legislative session could also consider calling a special election to hurry the process of waiving the Gann limits. Bidding and the letting of contracts for highway reconstruction generally take a long time, and thus in real terms there is no hurry to amend the Constitution. But voters are more likely to approve such a measure while the calamity here is fresh in their minds.
''As time goes by, my guess is people are more likely to vote 'no,' '' said Randy Hamilton, a visiting scholar at the Institute for Government Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ''The public memory is short.''
 
Shift in Sentiment
Bruce Cain, the associate director of the Berkeley institute, said public sentiment here had already been shifting before the quake. Lately, Mr. Cain said, Californians have begun to realize that the Gann limits failed to foresee the conditions of the late 1980's: a mushrooming population that included needy newcomers like the South East Asian refugees, new social problems like AIDS and drug abuse, and growing environmental concerns, all of which cost huge sums of money.
In this climate, both citizens and politicians are quick to ask whether the collapse of highways and bridges was, in part, a result of maintenance delayed by fiscal constraints.
''Up and down the state, repairs have been put off because of lack of money,'' said State Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Democrat who is head of the Assembly Transportation Committee.
Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for governor here in 1990, hotly challenged that contention, arguing instead that the problems on the Nimitz Freeway, the major scene of destruction here, were a matter of obsolete technology.
''If the premise is that we have been chintzy and set ourselves up for a fall, I don't think the facts bear that out, '' Senator Wilson said. It is probable and proper that there be some kind of inquiry. But I don't think the appropriate question is whether we have been spending enough on infrastructure.''
But television images are more vivid than reports by blue ribbon commissions and could reshape a debate in the nation's most populous state, where the tax revolt of 1978 lay the foundations for the supply-side economics of the Reagan Administration.
''Bureaucrats have been assuring us that things are all right while privately crossing their fingers,'' said State Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a Democrat. ''In the practical world where politicians live, that debate has come crashing down on the Nimitz.''

HEADLINE: DARKENING GLOOM IN A STRICKEN CITY

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Calif., Oct. 21

 BODY:
Probably no Northern California city was harder hit economically by the earthquake than this picturesque town on the rocky Pacific Coast. Almost all its downtown business district is in ruins, 250 businesses are shut and 2,000 people are out of work.
The almost festive air that reigned on the sunny day after the quake turned to gloom, anger and frustration today as rains began and the true costs - and the deaths - began to sink in.
The quake, centered a few miles northeast of downtown, devastated the city's commercial center when it turned the Pacific Garden Mall into splinters. The four-block mall, whose historic Victorian buildings housed scores of boutiques, restaurants, bookshops and other stores was the town's main raison d'etre for the millions of tourists who visit annually. 
 
'Not Very Promising'
''The outlook is not very promising,'' said Robert J. Shepherd, the city's director of finance. ''People came to Santa Cruz to stroll the Garden Mall and go to the beach, not to look at wreckage. Everybody in this town has lost something.''
Barred by city building inspectors from visiting their shops, more than 300 angry owners and employees jammed into the City Council chambers to fill out entry permits and discuss their problems with the Downtown Association.
How much of the mall can be rebuilt and how many businesses salvaged is not yet known. But gone for now are small businesses that gave this city its appealing flavor and generated $100 million a year in sales and $1 million in sales taxes for the city.
 
More Pervasive Damage
While the overall damage was greater in San Francisco and Oakland, the impact on this city of 47,000 was disproportionately large and more pervasive.
When President Bush visited the mall on Pacific Avenue Friday, he saw what remained of Santa Cruz's three bookstores, Lulu Carpenter's restaurant, Rainbow Records, Chi Pants, the Acapulco Restaurant, Camouflage, Revelation, Earth Angel and scores of other shops and eateries. These buildings have been ''red tagged'' by the city, meaning they may have to be demolished.
For the shop owners, the chief issue is whether they can remove inventory and business records, to salvage something with which to restart. Not all were certain that Santa Cruz would recover soon enough as a tourist destination to make it worth reopening.
Neal Coonerty has operated the Bookshop Santa Cruz on the mall for nearly 23 years until Tuesday evening. The jolt peeled off the north wall of his store and it collapsed into the Coffee Roasting Company next door, killing two employees there. One book store worker was trapped in the basement for a while.
Now Mr. Coonerty and his staff of 25 are applying for unemployment, some sleeping nearby in their cars. ''At this point, the building is going to have to come down,'' Mr. Coonerty said. ''The big question is whether we can get the inventory out to start over. It's like waiting to hear if you have cancer.''
With the Christmas season near, Mr. Coonerty had $450,000 worth of inventory on hand, at retail, and owes large sums to publishers. ''If we can get the books out, we can pay,'' he said. ''Otherwise I don't know what to do.'' If he can recover, the bookseller plans to reopen in a tent on the parking lot until a new building is ready. In one of the starker quirks last week, Mr. Coonerty left his shop early Tuesday to mail a $1,000 check to help fellow booksellers wiped out by the hurricane in South Carolina. ''A half hour later, our store was down,'' he said.
Meanwhile, frustration mounted among shop owners. ''The President and the Governor can go in, but we can't,'' complained Robert Rader, who has run Rader's Jewelry & Loan Company on the mall for 30 years. His windows were all blown in, leaving ''several hundred thousand'' in goods vulnerable, although he presumed most is protected by his safe.
 
Forced to Evacuate
Alan Johns, the owner of Warehouse Liquors on Front Street, managed to get in the day after but was forced to evacuate by the authorities. He estimated that up to three-quarters of his $60,000 in inventory was destroyed. He has been meeting with the state alcohol control authorities and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the hopes of relocating temporarily.
''I'd like at least to get in and get my checkbooks and invoices,'' he said, waiting outside City Hall in the drizzle for the business owners meeting to begin. Just who is to pay for all these losses is a big question. Neil Sandow, a broker with the William W. Kelly & Company insurance agency, has been besieged by clients.
City officials estimated that there had been $83 million in damage, including $46 million to public installations like sewers and water lines. They said they expected to lose about $2 million a year in sales taxes, business license and parking fees from the lost tourism, or nearly a tenth of the city's $25 million general fund.
There was some good news. Of the 13,000 homes and apartments in the city, no more than 50 had been red-tagged for possible demolition, although nearly all had some damage. ''The residences fared extremely well, and except for the Pacifc Garden Mall, other businesses fared very well,'' said Anne Marie Mitroff, a spokeswoman for the city. The mall consisted mostly of older unreinforced buildings, but most newer parts of the city suffered relatively minor cosmetic damage, like fallen mirrors and shelves.
This was not the first time Santa Cruz has been hit by nature. About a quarter of a century ago, a flood on the San Lorenzo River rushed through downtown. And there was hope that the latest calamity, if the downtown is rebuilt, would result in stronger buildings and housing above the shops. And there would be much new work for contractors, landscapers and painters.
But for now, few were taking solace in that, given the lost income and tax revenues. ''For a city the size of Santa Cruz,'' said Mr. Shepherd, the finance director, ''this is a major impact.''

HEADLINE: 595 High Earners Avoided Income Tax in '87

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 21

 BODY:
A handful of the highest-earning Americans are still able to avoid paying Federal income tax despite repeated Congressional efforts to close loopholes.
Of 529,460 couples and individuals who reported total income above $200,000 on returns filed in 1987, 595 paid no tax, the Internal Revenue Service said in a report issued this week. Those 595 had income averaging $600,000, and two out of three had capital gains averaging $490,000. 
An additional 33,805 couples or individuals who earned more than $200,000 paid tax at an effective rate of less than 15 percent, typically less than a middle-income family would pay. Almost 3,000 high-income people paid less than 10 percent.
The estimates were reported without comment by the I.R.S. in the quarterly ''Statistics of Income.'' The agency has been required since 1978 to estimate the number of high earners who legally avoid paying any tax.
High earners were able to avoid taxes by reporting big losses on farm and partnership investments; by accumulating large capital gains, 60 percent of which were excluded from taxation in 1986; by claiming itemized deductions averaging $262,000 and by using the credit for taxes paid abroad. The figures do not include high earners whose incomes are made up largely of tax-exempt interest, like that of most municipal bonds. The I.R.S. report is based on unaudited returns; after an audit, some of the returns could lose their no-tax status.
Returns covered in the latest report, reflecting income earned in 1986, were the last filed before most provisions in the latest Federal tax overhaul took effect. Several changes in that 1986 law were designed to reduce the ability of high earners to avoid taxes.
The report showed that the number of people with annual incomes above $200,000 grew from 370,430 on returns in 1985 to 529,460 in 1986. The chief reason apparently was a big selloff of investments in 1986 to avoid a higher capital gains tax that took effect in 1987.
 
Attempts to Toughen Law
Fifty-three couples or individuals who earned more than $200,000 paid no Federal tax on returns filed in 1977, and the number has generally grown steadily. Exceptions were in 1985, when it dropped to 325 from the previous year's 579, and in 1987, when it fell by 18.
The percentage of tax-free high earners has risen despite repeated toughening of a provision aimed at requiring all high-income people to pay some tax despite the large number of credits and deductions they may legally claim.
Thirty percent of those earning more than $200,000 paid a minimum tax on returns filed in 1987. The Federal revenue from this source was $4.8 billion, an average of $30,263 per return.
 Here are some of the income and deduction items reported by the 595 couples or individuals who paid no tax:
* 457 had wages averaging $232,000.
* 394 had capital gains averaging $490,000.
* 3 received unemployment compensation. Nearly 4,600 of the 524,460 people with incomes over $200,000 reported some unemployment compensation.
* 5 reported net income from farming, averaging $1,400 each. But 58 had farm losses, averaging $275,000 each.
* 118 had state tax refunds averaging $21,000.
* 548 received interest income averaging $133,000.
* 262 reported net partnership income averaging $334,000, but 320 had partnership losses averaging $700,000.
* 33 had taxable Social Security benefits averaging $6,000.
* 9 received alimony averaging $267,000.
* 373 reported dividends averaging $136,000.
* 275 deducted home mortgage interest averaging $68,000.
* 325 reported charitable contributions averaging $49,000.
* 25 had medical deductions averaging $110,000.
* 19 claimed casualty and theft-loss deductions averaging $668,000.
The I.R.S. said 133 of the tax-free high earners claimed itemized deductions - chiefly interest - that exceeded their income.

HEADLINE: Alfred Hayes, 79, Retired Chief Of the Reserve Bank of New York

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Alfred Hayes, who headed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York until 1975 and played a pivotal role in the national and world banking systems for nearly two decades, died yesterday at a nursing home in New Canaan, Conn. He was 79 years old and a longtime resident of New Canaan.
Mr. Hayes was known as a conservative money manager who took a strong stand against inflation. He also had a reputation as a lightning-fast mathematician. 
The bank he led in New York is by far the most significant of the 12 that make up the Federal Reserve system. It dominated the system until William McChesney Martin Jr., then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, did battle with Mr. Hayes's predecessor, Allan Sproul, to wrest control from him.
Mr. Sproul resigned in 1955, and Mr. Hayes, a vice president of the New York Trust Company with 23 years of banking experience, took his place. When, at age 65, he handed the reins to Paul A. Volcker, Mr. Hayes said he was proud to have mended fences and with the board.
 
Aid for Britain
''The great strength of the system,'' he told an interviewer in 1975, ''is the existence of the 12 semi-autonomous reserve banks.''
But Mr. Sproul and Mr. Hayes successfully defended New York's special standing in the important Federal Open Market Committee by keeping their bank's permanent hold on the vice chairmanship. The committee sets general policy on buying and selling Government securities in the open market - the key instrument in monetary policy.
A frequent visitor to central bankers' meetings overseas, Mr. Hayes came to the rescue when crises battered the British pound sterling in the mid-1960's. He was instrumental in persuading other central bankers to buoy the British currency with a multibillion-dollar credit package.
Being a monetary conservative, Mr. Hayes was against involving the central banking system to help fiscally troubled cities. ''As a practical matter,'' he said when New York City faced bankruptcy in the 1970's, ''there are very good reasons for the Federal Reserve to stay clear of this problem.''
 
Rhodes Scholar
After his retirement, he moved to Morgan Stanley International, holding the posts of chairman and advisory director until 1981.
Mr. Hayes's love of reading did not keep him from skiing and tennis, and he was fond of the theater and photography as well.
He was born on Independence Day in 1910, in Ithaca, N.Y., where his father, also named Alfred, taught constitutional law at Cornell. He attended private schools, studied at Harvard and graduated from Yale in 1930.
Then, after a year at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration, he spent two years as a Rhodes scholar at New College in Oxford, England, and joined the City Bank Farmers Trust Company, which is now part of Citibank, in 1933 as an investment analyst.
Mr. Hayes moved on to New York Trust's bond department in 1940. He served as a lieutenant in the Navy and then rose to vice president in charge of New York Trust's foreign division, the post he held when called to lead the New York Fed.
Mr. Hayes is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Vilma Chalmers; a daughter, Anita Gratwick of Philadelphia; a son, Thomas C., of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, M. V. Hayes of Woodstock, Vt.; a sister, Christine Hayes of Washington, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Now Showing, Survival of the Fittest

BYLINE: By ALJEAN HARMETZ

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
The buzzword in Hollywood today is ''bulk'' - in studio size and in movies. The strongest studios are committed to making more movies, pictures that are larger in scope and budget, films that can feed a growing worldwide appetite in television, cable and home video.
''For better or worse, the wave of the 90's will be huge, well-financed companies that are involved in four or five forms of entertainment and whose competition is not other American companies but Sony in Japan and Bertelsmann in Germany,'' said Terry Semel, president of Warner Brothers.
For moviegoers, the changes will make a difference in what is on the screen. Almost immediately, increased numbers of bigger and more elaborate movies from the major studios will replace films supplied by defunct independents. As always, however, films produced will be determined by what sells, and long lines this summer for ''Batman'' and ''Parenthood,'' which drew crowds of people in their 30's and early 40's, have pretty much determined the tone of production for the next 18 months. 
The studios that will survive the 90's are jewels in the crown, protected parts of a larger corporate whole. As the strongest of them - Paramount Pictures, Universal, Warner Brothers, the Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox - have increased their bulk and their global reach in production, theatrical distribution, television, home video, foreign sales, cable and pay cable, most of the others have shriveled.
The survivors will thrive because it is the seemingly unduplicable energy, pacing and glamour of American films for which worldwide audiences hunger. As foreign sales become more and more important to the studios, actors' salaries will rise even higher since stars are more necessary to attract foreign audiences. The floor for top male stars is now $5 million a picture. But if Chevy Chase gets $6 million, will Tom Hanks and Steve Martin be satisfied with $5 million for long? Budgets are already rising as studios turn to the kind of action movies that can leap national boundaries. ''Black Rain'' cost $37 million. ''Tango and Cash,'' a prison movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, cost over $50 million. So did ''The Abyss.''
Five years ago there were nine major studios and more than a dozen independents snapping at their heels. What has happened since duplicates the plot of Agatha Christie's thrice-filmed murder mystery ''And Then There Were None.''
One by one both majors and minors have been eliminated. Figures from Variety, the industry trade journal, are a dramatic illustration. In September 1987, independent distributors released 53 films. Last month they released 26. Slaughtered by their lack of cash, their lack of size or their lack of good movies, Lorimar, Cannon, Tri-Star, New World, Atlantic, De Laurentiis, Vestron, Film Dallas, Island, Alive and half a dozen smaller companies have gone bankrupt or been reorganized or swallowed up by one of the bigger fish in the Hollywood sea.
Weintraub Entertainment Group is teetering. And MGM/UA with its glorious lineage is perceived by its rivals to be on its deathbed.
Three years ago Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, predicted the downturn in production. ''So, I was only off by two years,'' he said a few days ago. ''But it was extremely clear a year ago that we'd already gone into the slide.''
Disney's response was a plan to double its output of movies by forming a second production wing, Hollywood Pictures. At MCA's Universal Pictures, the chairman, Thomas Pollock, plans to release 25 films in 1990, up from 10 in 1986. ''With its enormous overhead, the biggest sin for any studio is not to make enough movies,'' said Mr. Pollock.
''I was hired to triple production,'' said Joe Roth, who became chairman of Fox Film Corporation, owned by Rupert Murdoch, two months ago. ''The game plan is increasing production and distribution in all media all over the world.''
Not all the game plans are alike. Here is a studio-by-studio profile of the strengths, weaknesses and strategies of each of the competitors during the next 18 months.
 
UNIVERSAL
A Lawyer Swings For the Fences
 Universal Pictures has been the surprise of 1989. Three years after he took over amid whispers that an entertainment lawyer would be hopelessly out of his element making creative decisions, Thomas Pollock has crafted a string of what he calls ''doubles and triples,'' including ''Field of Dreams,'' ''K-9'' and ''Uncle Buck.'' Although none have been $100 million home runs, few of his 1989 movies have struck out. With Steven Spielberg's sequel to ''Back to the Future'' ready for release at Thanksgiving, Universal, now in a tie with Paramount for third place at the box office, may well challenge for first.
Unlike Disney, Universal is not creating a second production unit. ''Big studios are not necessarily the best at making movies, but we're the best at marketing and distribution,'' said Mr. Pollock. ''It probably isn't possible for Universal to make 25 films well each year, but it's certainly possible for Universal to market and distribute 25 films well.''
Universal plans to rely on outside relationships to provide it with a steady stream of product. Imagine, Ron Howard's company, is 20 percent owned by Universal. This year it came up with ''The Burbs,'' ''The Dream Team'' and a major hit, ''Parenthood,'' and there will be four or five films next year. Amblin, Steven Spielberg's company, has its headquarters on the lot and will give the studio three movies in the next three months. ''Our job is to tell them what we can sell,'' said Mr. Pollock of such semiautonomous suppliers.
With movies like ''Parenthood'' and ''Sea of Love,'' Mr. Pollock is taking advantage of the aging of the movie audience. ''In the early 80's, your movies had to appeal to the 12-to-25-year-old audience,'' he said. ''Today, if you can keep your costs down, you don't have to get that audience at all. Unless you make movies with $20 million budgets for narrow audiences, most pictures won't lose you any money.''
One example: ''Field of Dreams,'' a risky fantasy aimed at 30-year-olds, cost $12.5 million. Because of the unusual strange subject matter, Universal sold off foreign theatrical rights, leaving it with only a $5 million cost (before advertising expenses) for a film that has sold $61 million worth of tickets in America and Canada.
But Universal is faulted for giving away up to 50 percent of the ''back end'' or potential profits on its films to such stars and directors as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ivan Reitman of ''Twins,'' a 1988 blockbuster.
 
WALT DISNEY
Sleeping Beauty Is Now a Giant
 Since Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg took over The Walt Disney Studios five years ago, the sleeping beauty has turned into a giant that was in first place at the box office in 1988. Because Disney made movies more cheaply and released fewer of them, the company also led in the average profitability of its films last year.
The indefatigable Mr. Katzenberg describes himself as ''a bottom fisherman.'' Disney's first successes were made with such down-on-their-luck actors as Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler. The studio recently made an exclusive deal with Goldie Hawn, whose last movies have been box-office disappointments. Equally important, the studio put writers under contract because stars and directors go where the good material is.
The penalty of being smart and first is that people use you as a blueprint. Universal is taking a leaf out of Disney's book by trying to put writers under exclusive contract. Mr. Roth at Fox says that he is emulating Disney's way of ''getting a lot of product and not wavering when they are convinced that a concept is salable.''
''I think consolidation means good news for those of us who are going to survive,'' said Mr. Katzenberg. ''Although I also think it's a disgrace that we have a national atmosphere in which the trading of assets is valued far beyond the creating of assets.''
In the title character of last year's top box-office film, ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the studio created a new asset for Disney's theme parks and merchandising division.
Said Mr. Katzenberg: ''No matter what your vision of the future is, no matter what technology will be the gatekeeper for the consumer -the phone company or satellite or some Captain Courageous invention none of us have heard of yet - the four priorities of making things work in the entertainment business are product, product, product and product.''
Of Disney's decision to create the separate Hollywood Pictures to supply extra product, Mr. Katzenberg said: ''We asked, 'How can we have the most control?' By consistently delivering lots of quality product.''
In an effort to become a major television supplier, Disney has recently spent more than $100 million to tie up the writer-producers who created or were instrumental in the success of such series as ''Golden Girls,'' ''Empty Nest,'' ''21 Jump Street,'' ''Roseanne'' and ''My Two Dads.'' These deals are worth from $5 million to $10 million for each of the writing-producing teams.
The majority of Disney movies are initiated by the studio, but Disney does have one steady producing partner in Interscope (''Three Men and a Baby,'' ''Cocktail''). No matter who makes its movies, Disney is known for keeping elbows- and knees- as well as hands-on control. Executives at other studios admiringly call the Disney leaders arrogant.
When Rick Moranis, the star of ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' asked for $2 million to do the sequel to the $125 million blockbuster, most other studios would have given in. Disney threatened to replace him with Martin Short.
In the eyes of Hollywood, Disney's strength is also its weakness. Its reliance on Mr. Katzenberg may cause a bottleneck when the studio is making 25 movies a year. Disney's two units, Touchstone and Hollywood, have separate staffs, but Mr. Katzenberg's fingers are still on both pulses.
 
PARAMOUNT
Eddie Murphy Plus A Godfather
 The No. 1 studio in 1986 and l987, Paramount has slowed down.
 Frank Mancuso's game plan since he became chairman in 1984 has been to create tent poles: high-visibility and often high-budget movies whose success supports the rest of the schedule. But Paramount's tent poles are breaking. ''Star Trek V'' and ''Friday the 13th Part VIII'' did poorly last summer. Steven Spielberg refuses to make another ''Indiana Jones,'' nor will Paul Hogan make a third '' 'Crocodile' Dundee.'' The studio's other franchise, Eddie Murphy, is only under contract for three more films. Many Hollywood deal makers feel that Tom Cruise has replaced Mr. Murphy as the world's biggest movie star, but Mr. Murphy - who, like Mr. Cruise, gets $8 million a movie - is no worse than second, and he is widely reported to be unhappy at Paramount.
Mr. Mancuso, who is considered a brilliant distributor, said that the studio had just revived ''the ultimate Paramount franchise'': Francis Coppola's ''Godfather III.'' The movie is scheduled to start production Nov. 15.
For its major films Paramount relies on home-grown producers and pays up to $5 million a year apiece to care for them and house their staffs. The most successful have been Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (''Top Gun''). They have not made a movie since ''Beverly Hills Cop II,'' which was released in May 1987, but they are now developing an auto racing film for Tom Cruise. Other major Paramount producers are Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lansing (''Fatal Attraction,'' ''Black Rain'') and Art Linson (''The Untouchables'').
Paramount is trying to increase the number of movies it releases but without the missionary fervor of Disney, Universal and Fox.
 
WARNER BROTHERS
After 'Batman,' What's Next?
 The success of ''Batman'' and ''Lethal Weapon II'' - a total of $393 million in ticket sales so far - masks a weakness at the studio. Warners has released 23 movies this year; only those two and ''Lean on Me,'' the story of the tough high-school principal Joe Clark, have made much of a profit at American theaters.
As of Sept. 24, Warners led in the box-office race with 18.4 percent of ticket sales, according to Variety. But Disney, in second place with 15.2 percent, had only released 14 films. And Paramount, with 14.4 percent, had distributed 11 movies, fewer than any of its seven rivals.
''Our appetite in production will continue to be very aggressive,'' said Mr. Semel, Warners' president.
In terms of distribution, Warners is leaping to take advantage of the consolidation in the industry. ''We're making our distribution companies around the world available to other people's films,'' Mr. Semel said. ''We'll grow because there are fewer distributors able to bring product to the marketplace for theaters, cable and television.''
Warners' special relationships are with Clint Eastwood, whose last few films have been box-office disappointments; Joel Silver, the producer of ''Lethal Weapon''; the former Columbia chief David Puttnam, who plans to supply two movies a year; David Geffen (''Beetlejuice''), who steadily produces one movie a year; Mr. Spielberg's Amblin, which will have ''Gremlins II'' ready for next summer, and, most importantly, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the producers of ''Batman'' and ''Witches of Eastwick.''
Sony has purchased Mr. Guber and Mr. Peter's production company, Guber-Peters Entertainment, and asked them to head Columbia. If Warners allows them to wriggle out of their contract, it will leave a big hole in the studio's schedule.
 
20TH CENTURY FOX
Fresh Air And Tent Poles
 ''How is Hollywood facing the next two years?'' asks Joe Roth. ''Aggressively. I sense that not everyone is going to survive. The stronger you get, the less of a target you are.''
Like Columbia and MGM/UA, Fox has had a revolving door to its executive suite. Much of what Hollywood acts on comes from perception. Fox was dismissed as a studio with hardening of the arteries. The energetic Mr. Roth, who started with a bare cupboard, is perceived to be ''a breath of fresh air.''
''I have 15 movies in the works for the second half of 1990,'' Mr. Roth said.
His first, ''Die Hard II'' with Bruce Willis, is planned for release in June. The bulk of Fox's schedule will come from ''medium-budget-range movies that don't require Eddie Murphy or Tom Cruise,'' he said. ''But three or four times a year I'm venturing into a star-driven tent pole.''
In addition to his other problems, Mr. Roth has handicapped by saying he only wanted to stay in his job for three years. When it can take two years or more to shepherd an idea into a final film, such pronouncements make directors and producers nervous - as David Puttnam discovered at Columbia.
 
COLUMBIA/TRI-STAR
Not Enough In the Pipeline
 Despite and partly because of Sony's purchase of Columbia, the studio is in disarray. Producers, actors and directors will choose a studio with a stable management, so most observers think that Columbia will struggle for the next few years.
Successful executives at other studios are angry that the sale to Sony will mean millions of dollars for Jeff Sagansky, who had little box-office luck during his four years at Tri-Star, and for Dawn Steel, whose fatal flaw at Columbia was an inability to put enough movies into production.
When Ms. Steel replaced David Puttnam two years ago, she chose to make what are called housekeeping deals with movie stars, paying from $300,000 to $3 million a year to house an actor's production company. That strategy was clever shorthand to let Hollywood know that Columbia was back in the mainstream movie business. But such ''first look'' arrangements rarely translate into films because actors can be wooed away to other studios by good scripts.
In a striking example of the difference between Disney and Columbia, Ms. Steel purchased ''Pincushion,'' a $500,000 script about a country suffering a plague after a biological disaster. Other bidders saw ''Pincushion'' as a gritty $10 million action movie, and John Carpenter was willing to direct with Jamie Lee Curtis starring. Because Cher, who has a housekeeping deal at Columbia, expressed some interest, Ms. Steel had the script rewritten several times. The cost, including a retainer for Mr. Carpenter, is now up to $1.5 million, and Cher still has not committed.
In contrast, when Disney was wooing Dustin Hoffman to star in ''Dead Poets Society'' and the actor asked for one more rewrite, the studio said no and hired Robin Williams.
Columbia has one solid relationship, with Rob Reiner's Castle Rock, which produced the surprise hit ''When Harry Met Sally . . . '' Michael Douglas's production company has an exclusive three-year deal to make movies for the studio, which might or might not star Mr. Douglas.
If Warners' Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters end up running Columbia, Hollywood can prepare for more bidding wars. In the past, the two producers have concentrated on buying expensive, highly visible material such as ''The Color Purple'' and ''The Bonfire of the Vanities.'' They recently spent $1 million for the rights to the story of the martyred Brazilian rubber tapper Chico Mendes.
 
ORION
A Little Fellow Fights to Survive
 Orion is Hollywood's object lesson in the problems of being small. The studio was created and is run by a management team that headed United Artists in the 1970's and won Oscars for best picture three years in a row (''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' 1975; ''Rocky,'' 1976; ''Annie Hall,'' 1977).
Although Orion is respected for its taste and its willingness to tackle risky material (''Amadeus,'' ''Platoon,'' ''Mississippi Burning''), Hollywood wonders whether it can survive. The majority of top executives at other studios think that Orion will be the next studio to be sold.
Orion's major movie last summer, ''Great Balls of Fire,'' was a box- office disaster. And, when its pictures falter at the cash register, Orion does not have the cushion of a big library to sell in various mediums as its rivals do.
''Summer was not very kind to us,'' said Eric Pleskow, president of Orion. ''Our films did not find audience favor. But we are undaunted. We do not see ourselves at a disadvantage just because other people are trying to make more films. We're all fish in the same pond. Things will always depend on the films you make.'' Orion's major long-term relationship is with Woody Allen. The company recently became a home for the director Jonathan Demme and the actor Kevin Costner, who is directing and starring in a post-Civil War adventure film, ''Dance With Wolves.'' Orion also has nonexclusive but what Mr. Pleskow calls ''special relationships with long-term implications'' with Dennis Hopper, Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer.
 
MGM/UA
Oldies, Goodies But Nothing New
 In the jargon of the industry, MGM/UA has ''no throw,'' no viable projects in its development pipeline. The deal to sell the company to Qintex, an Australian conglomerate, has apparently failed. The only advantage to buying MGM/UA instead of developing a studio from scratch is the 1,000-film United Artists library and home video rights to the 3,000 MGM films that were sold to Ted Turner. And there may be a bit more box-office mileage from the ''Rocky'' and ''James Bond'' series.
 

 
'THE INDUSTRY ALWAYS SURVIVES'
In addition to being a movie star and the Academy Award-winning director of 'Ordinary People,'' Robert Redford is one of the rare stars who puts time and money into the independent film movement. He is the founder of the Sundance Institute, which supports independent film makers. In January he will produce ''Dark Wind,'' the first of a series of low-budget movies based on the novels of Tony Hillerman. Errol Morris (''The Thin Blue Line'') will direct the detective story about the exploits of a Navajo police officer.
''The film industry always survives,'' Mr. Redford says. ''Through thick and thin, through inflations and recessons, it survives better than most. It's up, down, boom and bust, but it's never out.
''Control of the industry shifts. Twenty years ago, the studios, which had had their own autonomy, were taken over by outside conglomerates - Gulf & Western, Warner Communications, Transamerica. The congclomerates tried to run things strictly as a business. Films are this crazy mix of business and art.
''There are good signs to this new consolidation, but it may mean an even greater eye to the bottom line, which will threaten the independents. Just a few years ago there was a big hurrah coming out of the independent film world, a cry of enthusiasm and glee. The independent film market - the financing and festivals - had started to increase. Now it may be harder to get distribution. Independent film makers will always have a hard time because their films don't make money or bring the audience in as much.
''I'm committed to diversity. If the consolidation leads to a narrowing of production and distribution, in effect the consolidation is a problem.
''As to the artist within the system, musical chairs are never good news for the artist. It makes them feel like they're standing on the California coast along a fault line.''

The Pendulum Swings Away From Cynicism

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg

 BODY:
In the 1980's art has seemed to suffer from a fin-de-siecle anxiety. The source of that anxiety has been a fundamental skepticism about the possibility of ''making it new.'' Instead of seeming limitless, culture and the world itself have come to be seen as finite, closed systems that have been depleted by overuse. All that is left for artists is to reflect on their own imprisonment in a universe of existing words, forms and images.
This point of view has come to be known as post-modernist, and it represents a radical departure from the spirit of boundless originality and individuality that characterizes most of the art of this century. To artists and critics of the 1980's, that optimistic spirit, identified with the rarefied and to some eyes elitist esthetic of modernism, was exhausted by the beginning of the decade. But now, at the end of the decade, it is showing signs of staging a comeback.
The cracks in the post-modern empire of skepticism and dismay are as yet minuscule, but they suggest that the precepts of modernist art are not as discredited and exhausted as many have assumed. Modernism's conception of the artist as a seer, its unabashed quest for spiritual experience and its belief in abstraction as a means of achieving this experience have caught the attention of a generation for whom post-modernism's challenges to originality and authorship seem cynical and - even worse - old hat. 
That photography should be at the forefront of this revival is no small paradox. It is, after all, the medium that post-modernism has prized for its role in the manufacture and reproduction of cultural stereotypes. In the post-modernist decade of the 80's, photographs acquired both critical cachet and marketplace success. But in the same way that photography's profligate nature helped post-modernists dismantle the modernist canon, it has made appropriation, fabrication, pastiche, rephotography and other hallmarks of post-modernist art practice seem repetitious at an early age. In this observer's eyes, at least, there already exist enough pictures of artificial environments and of rephotographed magazine advertisements to last several lifetimes. The post-modernist point seems to have been made, in spades. The photographs of quintessential modernists like Alfred Stieglitz, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Alexander Rodchenko, on the other hand, were fueled by the artists' passionate beliefs in the power of images to change individual lives and, ultimately, the world. This gives their images - of skyscrapers, machines, city streets - a simplicity that life today cannot match. Life in the 1920's and 1930's probably did not match it either, but the visual evidence of the modernist period between the wars in Europe and the United States has a clarity of purpose we can only envy.
Most sea changes in art are accompanied by timely historical exhibitions that give voice and focus to unspoken discontents. Exhibit No. 1 in the case of modernism redux is ''The New Vision: Photography Between the World Wars,'' a beautiful and invigorating show of 125 photographs from the Ford Motor Company Collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. While the exhibition's curator, Maria Morris Hambourg, may not have intended the conjunction, the pictures in ''The New Vision'' display precisely the optimistic, experimental spirit of creativity that many artists are now seeking to restore.
As if to reinforce the point, the New York Public Library is currently presenting a retrospective exhibition of Berenice Abbott's modernist photographs, some of which also appear at the Metropolitan. And a show of Aaron Siskind's postwar abstractionist images, which was recently on view at the Museum of Modern Art, served to recall the visionary qualities of a later modernist era, one in which Abstract Expressionism was the dominant style. Together, these three exhibitions are as powerful a demonstration of the appeal of modernist photography as one could conceive. To an art audience tired of strategically calculated art positioned with one eye on critical theory and one eye on the marketplace, they are a salve to the spirit.
But it is not only in photography that the modernist legacy is being looked at with fresh eyes. Sherrie Levine's recent show at Mary Boone Gallery, for example, consisted of frosted white abstract sculptures that were presented in elegant wood and glass cases. While the work had Miss Levine's customary cutting edge - the three-dimensional shapes were appropriated from the ''bachelors'' in Marcel Duchamp's ''large glass'' - it also evoked the economical beauty of early-20th-century sculpture. The artist's subject may have been Duchamp, but the artworks themselves seemed a homage to Brancusi. Miss Levine is no modernist, of course, but she is remarkably adept at sensing and distilling the exact temper of the art world.
Just what makes modernist art in general, and modernist photography in particular, seem so appealing today? Partly it is a matter of nostalgia. In addition, the practitioners of what was called the ''new photography'' aimed their pictures not at an insular art world but at the culture at large. Moholy, from whom the exhibition borrows its title, conceived of ''the new vision'' as a revolutionary force and the camera as an instrument of truth. Stieglitz committed himself to the metaphoric capabilities of the medium, attempting to capture simultaneously personal and universal feelings in his pictures. The absolute sureness of their faith in art and their uncompromising vanguard cultural spirit shine like beacons in today's climate of dimmed expectations.
It is difficult not to be in awe of the modernists' drive for formal purity in their art. The pictures in ''The New Vision'' seem pared to their essence, without the fractious details and ironic incongruities that are currently fashionable. The prints are utterly gorgeous in terms of technique, and while they are minuscule in comparison with the vast majority of today's art photographs they seem more potent for it. The architect Walter Gropius's image of New York's Flatiron Building, taken at such an angle that it seems to be falling over, is a mere 9 by 7 inches, but it does not need to be an inch larger. Charles Sheeler's 1927 picture of the Ford River Rouge plant, about the same size, is so poster-perfect that it serves not only as a signature image of the Machine Age but also as a not-so-subliminal advertisement for the exhibition's sponsor, the Ford Motor Company. (These and all the other prints in the show were originally in the collection of John C. Waddell, who donated a portion of their value to the museum, with Ford picking up the rest of the tab.) Compared to these pictures, much in contemporary photography can seem flabby and overblown. The backlit color transparencies of Jeff Wall, for example, which were shown at the Marian Goodman Gallery last month, towered overhead and reached lengths of more than 10 feet, but their size seemed designed mostly to evoke the blatant artificiality of billboards. At more than $100,000 a picture they seemed inflated in another way. Such considerations served to obscure the artist's medium-sized ideas about social relations and the environment.
On the other hand, some recent photographs do seem to aim at the kind of unalloyed beauty found in ''The New Vision.'' MacDuff Everton's color panoramas of picturesque itineraries in Britain and South America, at the Janet Borden Gallery (560 Broadway, through Saturday) and Lynn Davis's powerfully stark prints of icebergs, at Lowinsky Gallery (584 Broadway, through Nov. 4) are examples of old-fashioned attitudes about photography - and landscape photography in particular -being dressed up in new, seemingly post-post-modern clothes.
But perhaps the clearest indication of the new-found interest in modernist photography lies in the recent return to abstraction. While rebuking the notion that abstraction is innocent of cultural fetters, the new wave of abstract image-making - by such artists as Cindy Bernard, Adam Fuss, Oliver Wasow, James Welling and, one might argue, the Starn Twins - also reflects an attempt to move beyond the re-use of imagery from mass culture. Siskind, of course, is the living master of modernist abstraction, and his influence can be felt as well as seen in a show at the Zabriskie Gallery called ''Abstraction in Photography'' (724 Fifth Avenue, through Nov. 25). The exhibition includes Fuss, Welling, Andres Serrano and Astrid Klein on its contemporary roster, as well as Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Man Ray and other important modernists who figure in ''The New Vision.''
Abstraction - or at least abstractionist leanings - is an important focus of ''The New Vision,'' although none of the curator's organizing categories address it directly. It can be seen in Paul Strand's close-up of his movie camera, taken in 1922, in Berenice Abbott's distorted self-portrait of about 1930, and in Florence Henri's mirror-image ''Still Life With Lemon and Pear'' circa 1929. None of these images is abstract in the sense that the subject is unrecognizable, but each seeks to separate pictorial experience from everyday reality. Henri's picture, with its Cubist-inspired overlapping planes, puts one in mind of Jan Groover's work of 50 years later. Miss Groover's recent color still lifes, which were shown last season at Robert Miller Gallery, are as convincing revivals of modernist photography as we are likely to see.
Abstraction was attractive to photographers between the wars because it represented a plane of experience in which natural, intuitive vision seemed to override cultural convention. In other words, it was a step outside the bounds of ordinary life and in the direction of the spiritual. Since it was free of cultural coding, it also represented something the artist could claim entirely as his own creation; it was a sign of the artist's independence and visionary status. Abstraction represents much the same notions today, especially among painters in their 20's and early 30's, in whom the urge to resuscitate abstraction seems greatest.
According to the prevailing theories about post-modern life, however, abstraction is no more free of cultural coding than any other form of representation. Indeed, post-modern theorists would argue that abstraction is itself a social representation - one that can be used, for example, to restore the claims of artistic autonomy that post-modernist art disputed. Thus a theoretically grounded artist like James Welling is not merely practicing a form of abstraction, he is critiquing it. A Welling image may look like a Robert Motherwell painting in its form, for example, but it simultaneously reveals itself as a camera image of chunks of Jell-O. Photography, once again, serves as a reminder of culture's domain.
Photography served many of the modernists in much the same way, especially in the practice of photomontage, which was employed by the Dadaists, Surrealists and Constructivists and by political activists like John Heartfield. Photomontage, as a technique, and Dada, Surrealism and Constructivism, as movements, were disruptive and disorienting in an effort to change the way people looked at the world. Rather than aspire to abstraction, the Surrealists and Constructivists tried to find the keys to the new vision hiding in the mudane and overlooked. This helps explain Duchamp's marvelous 1936 photograph of a cigarette shorn of its wrapper, and Rodchenko's worm's-eye view of pine trees in Pushkin Park. In pictures like these - as well as in all the cameraless photograms, solarized prints and multiple exposures the show contains - ''The New Vision'' suggests that modernist photography was as discomfiting to the established culture of its time as post-modernist photography has been to ours.
The difference, of course, is that the Dadaist, Surrealist, Constructivist and Bauhaus artists all had clearly defined (if not always clearly stated) programs. The age of early modernism was also an age of manifestoes and theoretical tracts, and these writings served to position these movements at the leading edge of avant-garde art in the early 20th century. In the late 20th century, modernism no longer is supported by its early theory, and no new theory has emerged that would give it a new vanguard status. Post-modernism's critique of cultural production - in essence, that art can no longer pretend to be innocent of its broad social context - does not leave much room for a modernist response. If the modernist revival is to mean anything more than style - anything more than a fashionable pastiche, fashionably recycled - then it needs to counter post-modernist theory with a theory of its own.
As luck would have it, one post-modernist theorist has already prepared the ground. Jean-Francois Lyotard, in a book called ''The Post-modern Condition: A Report on Knowledge,'' has arrived at the startling conclusion that post-modernism is the precursor of modernism. ''A work can become modern only if it is first post-modern,'' he wrote in 1979. ''Post-modernism thus understood is not modernism at its end but in the nascent state, and this state is constant.'' Lyotard's contrarian point is that modernism has always rebelled against its own momentum: Picasso and Braque broke with Cezanne, Duchamp broke with them, and so on. Every ''post-modern'' rupture is merely another step in modernism's evolution. In this sense, one could say the current modernist revival was inevitable. (''The New Vision: Photography Between the World Wars'' will remain at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 83d Street, through Dec. 31, after which it will travel to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. A catalogue of the exhibition, with essays by Maria Morris Hambourg and Christopher Phillips, is being distributed by Harry N. Abrams; a companion volume, ''Photography in the Modern Era: Documents and Critical Writings From Europe, 1913-1940,'' edited by Mr. Phillips, has been published by the museum and Aperture. Every weekend through Nov. 11 the Metropolitan is showing classic modernist films in conjunction with the show.)

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
The 'Original' 'Show Boat' Comes to TV, Via New Jersey

BYLINE: By KEN MANDELBAUM; Ken Mandelbaum is the author of '' 'A Chorus Line' and the Musicals of Michael Bennett'' (St. Martin's Press).

 BODY:
The only American musical of the 1920's that remains a part of the standard musical theater repertory, the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein 2d ''Show Boat,'' has been revived frequently on Broadway, in the West End, by opera companies and stock and amateur groups, and in the movies.
But unlike other Hammerstein musicals, such as ''Oklahoma!'' or ''Carousel,'' ''Show Boat'' is never performed in precisely the same version that Ziegfeld Theater audiences witnessed in 1927 when it opened in New York. While Kern's hit tunes (''Make Believe,'' ''Ol' Man River,'' ''Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,'' ''You Are Love,'' ''Bill'') and the leading characters and the basic plot about prejudice, miscegenation and unhappy marriage have always remained, the 1927 text has been altered in virtually every subsequent incarnation.
So, when the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., and WNET's Great Performances series jointly decided to mount the musical last June, they were faced with an abundance of choices. The result of the course they took can be seen Friday evening at 9 on WNET and other Public Broadcasting Service stations as Great Performances begins its 17th season. 
This new ''Show Boat,'' although initially presented in a theater, was specifically conceived with television in mind. More than 1,200 performers were auditioned, and ''screen tests'' for several of the leading roles were held to find actors who would not only sing and act the parts well but also look right on camera.
Adapted from Edna Ferber's sprawling 1926 best-selling novel about life and love on the Mississippi over a span of 50 years, ''Show Boat'' was a revelation to audiences, offering three-dimensional characters and a depth of emotion unknown to musicals of its period. Kern and Hammerstein pushed ''Show Boat'' further than any musical of its time in terms of the integration of song and dance into the dramatic situation, while creating a score whose richness has rarely been equaled on the musical stage.
When ''Show Boat'' traveled to London in 1928, three of the Broadway numbers were dropped. The 1936 film version omitted five of the stage numbers and added three new ones, while the 1946 Ziegfeld stage revival reorchestrated the score, eliminating tubas and banjos, and cut several of the original songs.
Some of these changes were made to shorten a work that ran more than four hours at its first tryout in the world premiere performance in Washington, while others reflect changing racial attitudes or progress in scenic design. Then, too, some of the original material, written for specific star personalities (Charles Winninger, Helen Morgan, Sammy White and Eva Puck), proved less suited to subsequent performers.
Attempts to restore ''Show Boat'' to its original three-hour form began in the early 1960's, when Miles Kreuger, who wrote a book on the show's history, '' 'Show Boat': The Story of a Classic American Musical,'' and Robert Russell Bennett, the show's original orchestrator, looked into the Rodgers and Hammerstein warehouse on West 52d Street and found boxes containing the original 1927 orchestral parts.
In 1982, the Houston Grand Opera, a company that had already successfully restored Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess,'' presented ''Show Boat,'' and John McGlinn, then music editor for the company, was asked to reconstruct a full orchestral score from the surviving 1927 parts. This production, also seen on Broadway at the Gershwin Theater in 1983, went back to the original script, restored several musical cuts and employed the original overture and orchestration, both unheard since 1927.
In 1982, the complete original orchestral score, including all material dropped during the show's tryout, was found in the Warner Brothers music storage warehouse in Secaucus, N. J., and this discovery led directly to a landmark recording of the score, issued by EMI a year ago and conducted by Mr. McGlinn. This 3-hour-and-45-minute album contains not only the complete score as heard in 1927 but also music cut on the road, music written for the show but never used, material added for revivals and film versions, and much of the dialogue and underscoring.
The EMI album, while an archival marvel, created a certain amount of controversy over whether the material unearthed for the recording should be used in subsequent stage versions. (EMI has since issued a single-disk version reflecting the score as heard on opening night on Broadway.) William Hammerstein, son of the show's lyricist-librettist, who has frequently directed ''Show Boat'' productions, cautioned, ''We have to remember that when authors and composers who have experience and talent remove numbers from shows they're working on, they do it for good reason.''
The version that television audiences will see, directed for the Paper Mill Playhouse by the company's artistic director, Robert Johanson, takes advantage of 30 years of ''Show Boat'' scholarship. ''We had the good fortune to be able to look back on all of the versions that exist,'' Mr. Johanson said, ''and choose what we felt - based on Edna Ferber's novel and the intentions of Oscar Hammerstein as related to us by his son Bill Hammerstein - was the heart of 'Show Boat.' But we wanted to keep the show under three hours.
''Much of the material on the EMI album doesn't enhance the dramatic action, and I don't think you can do a stage show to satisfy your own personal museum desires. You have to please the audience and not go beyond their endurance level.''
The Paper Mill version departs from the original ''Show Boat'' on several occasions, most notably in its inclusion of a scene from the 1936 film version containing the song ''Ah Still Suits Me.'' That was written to strengthen the role of Joe, the stevedore on the Mississippi steamboat, for Paul Robeson, whose other big song is, of course, ''Ol' Man River.'' Three musical numbers from the original have been eliminated. ''In Dahomey'' was dropped for reasons of time and economics - it requires hiring a large black dance chorus in addition to the regular chorus. ''Till Good Luck Comes My Way'' was cut from productions of the show long ago, as it was part of a scene used to permit a scene change and was eliminated when scenic changes became more fluid. The song ''Ah Still Suits Me,'' which was added to this production, replaces the original's ''Hey, Feller!''
The Paper Mill version softens the starkness of the original opening, substituting the phrase ''colored folk'' for the original's lyric, ''niggers all work on the Mississippi.'' The recording uses the original lyric. The Paper Mill decision was arrived at after much soul searching. William Hammerstein says that he prefers to see the original lyric performed, but adds: ''In every production I've ever staged, I've tried to explain to the black singers that the word was used to show right from the beginning that there are two separate worlds on stage. That opening line is a complaint, made out of deep-seated resentment. While the performers often agree, they just can't say it, and I don't blame them.''
Mr. Johanson offered the black chorus members of his production the chance to decide the issue for themselves, and their decision led to excising the offending term.
The Paper Mill version also contains several major restorations, some not seen since the musical's Broadway premiere. Television audiences will see the scenes of Act II performed in their original order for the first time since 1927, along with the world premiere of the opening chorus of the Trocadero Music Hall scene, eliminated before the show went into rehearsal in 1927.
More significantly, the part of Kim, daughter of Magnolia and Ravenal, has once again been made a significant part of the action of the final scenes. Portrayed by the same actress (Rebecca Baxter) who plays Magnolia, Kim performs the reprise of ''Why Do I Love You?'' - first performed by Irene Dunne on the 1929 national tour of ''Show Boat'' - which is developed in the Paper Mill staging into a full-scale production number.
''Kim has to be brought back,'' says Mr. Johanson, ''just as she was in Ferber's novel, to tie it up and to emphasize the idea that the river and life go on and on. By having the same actress play Kim, we show that people contain something of those that have come before them, and that they carry that forward with them.''
Audiences watching the new version can expect to see a larger company (48) and more dancing than in most recent ''Show Boat'' productions, along with staging that emphasizes the kind of continuous, fluid movement common in contemporary musical productions.
This ''Show Boat'' version comes from New Jersey because WNET, Channel 13, is licensed in Newark, and executives of the channel were interested in presenting an arts program emanating from the Garden State. After visiting Millburn, they decided that they had found a company whose productions of popular American musicals would make ideal fare for home viewing. ''We contacted William Hammerstein and the Ferber estate,'' Mr. Johanson says, ''and it proved miraculously simple to work out. They all wanted it to happen because they wanted a genuine record of the show as a show.''
Paper Mill budgeted $1.2 million for this ''Show Boat,'' about $200,000 more than for most of its musical productions. A grant from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts made up the difference; the council also gave $400,000 to Channel 13 for the telecast.
To translate the production to television, WNET called on Kirk Browning, director of countless television versions of plays, operas and musicals over 40 years. Three performances were shot ''live'' in their entirety, the finished tape reflecting more of the final performance than the others.
According to Ted Chapin, executive director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein office, the Paper Mill/WNET version may become the standard performing version of ''Show Boat'' for years to come. This ever-evolving watershed of musical theater history may finally be taking on definitive form.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S NEW IN AUTO DEALERSHIPS;
As Profits Slide, a Struggle to Survive

BYLINE: By LISA H. TOWLE; Lisa H. Towle is a New Jersey-based writer.

 BODY:
These are tough times for the nation's $303 billion a year business of selling automobiles.
Over the next two years, the National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group, estimates that about 10 percent of the nation's 25,000 dealerships will go under. And J.D. Power & Associates, a marketing concern in Agoura Hills, Calif., predicts that by the year 2000 half of the 16,000 dealer owners will sell or go out of business. 
While manufacturers had a banner year in 1988, with total vehicle sales peaking at nearly 16 million units, dealers had their worst year in decades. Their after-tax profits fell to less than 1 percent.
And 1989 will probably be bleaker still. In the first six months, dealers' operating profits plunged by 96 percent from the same 1988 period. After five record years, sales of new autos slumped 7 percent in the first six months. The poor showing prompted the association to revise its 1989 sales forecast to 14.7 million cars and light-duty trucks, down from 15 million.
Yet falling sales are only one reason profits have sagged. Dealers largely blame the rebates and incentives that manufacturers require them to offer buyers to clear their inventories and offset overproduction. Popularized during the recession in the early 80's, these programs, the association says, have outlived their usefulness and only burden dealers with paper work.
''Do manufacturers really think customers don't know that the price they're getting after the rebate is what they should have paid in the first place?'' said Ron Tonkin, president of the association and of Ron Tonkin Dealerships in Portland, Ore. ''Rebates are phony.''
While BMW and Volkswagen plan to drop their rebate programs and offer lower prices, instead, others have not followed suit. In fact, for the first time, some 1990 models will come off the production line with a rebate attached.
To survive, many dealers have taken steps to improve their longstanding public image as smooth operators. Some flaunt cleaner stores and cleaner selling practices.
To gain operating efficiencies, strong dealers are acquiring their weaker, cash-poor brethren for fire-sale prices. They are looking for capital from sources other than banks, some of which have become skittish lenders as dealers' profits have fallen. Several investment bankers including Smith Barney and Oppenheimer are gearing up to help them line up financing.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE BUDGET IMPASSE;
Don't Mess With Gramm-Rudman

BYLINE: By ISABLE V. SAWHILL; Isabel V. Sawhill is an economist and senior fellow at the Urban Institute.

 BODY:
Pressure is building to revise Gramm-Rudman, the budget-balancing legislation enacted in 1985 and amended in 1987. Indeed, Congress seems to be on the verge of adopting a pattern of amending the law every two years. This year the argument for revising the targets will have a new and powerful twist: the need to protect people's retirement checks by segregating the Social Security accounts from the rest of the budget for deficit reduction purposes. Although politically appealing, this argument is fundamentally flawed. The right choice is to count Social Security the same way as other outlays and to preserve whatever discipline is left under existing Gramm-Rudman rules.
The concern about Social Security stems from the fact that a 1983 effort to put the system on a fiscally sound path is currently generating an excess of payroll tax receipts over benefit payments. These surpluses are being used to finance a portion of the Government's regular operating expenses. To prevent this, it is argued, we must balance the budget without the use of these funds and set the surpluses aside to pay for the baby-boom generation's retirement. 
But excluding these surpluses from budgetary calculations would balloon the estimated deficit by $54 billion in 1989 and by much higher amounts in subsequent years. Thus, setting them aside would require a much more ambitious set of overall deficit reduction targets and a stretching out of the period over which budget balance is to be achieved if the annual targets are to remain reasonable. In the process, the temptation to modify the 1991 target to put it in the range of what is politically feasible in an election year is likely to be irresistible. The whole package would then be sold to the public as a way of protecting the Social Security system.
Politically, it is a brilliant plan. Liberals will like it because it appears to protect Social Security and conservatives will like because it promises to limit spending. But politics aside, it is a terrible idea.
First, the plan is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Social Security system works. Most people believe that any portion of the surplus not used to pay current Government expenses can be squirreled away for a rainy day. Just as an individual can put aside money in a bank account to spend at a later time, so, it is argued, the trust fund can accumulate surpluses to pay for the baby boom's retirement.
The analogy is a false one. Whatever the Gramm-Rudman rules, the Social Security surplus is invested, by law, in Government securities. The Treasury then spends the money either to finance a portion of the deficit (as it is doing now) or to retire previously accumulated debt by repurchasing bonds from the public (as it would do if there were no deficit). In both cases, the Social Security Trust Fund is left with nothing but paper i.o.u.'s. These do no more to protect the long-term solvency of the system than the moral commitment that already exists to pay these claims. By themselves they do not produce additional real resources to meet the needs of the elderly population.
To be sure, a more ambitious set of deficit reduction targets than are on the books could, if achieved, produce more national savings and more economic growth. For example, if the Treasury were a net lender rather than a net borrower in financial markets this would put downward pressure on interest rates and encourage more investment. But the public shouldn't be led to believe that changing the Gramm-Rudman rules is automatically going to produce more deficit reduction and more growth (the record is not encouraging here). Nor should they think that more growth is going to have more than a minor effect on the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. Higher growth increases payroll tax revenues but it also increases Social Security benefits (because these are tied to wages). The net result is a rather modest improvement in the long-term fiscal position of the system. Indeed, whatever the rules and the rate of economic growth, tax burdens will have to be increased substantially in the 21st century.
A second problem with changing the accounting rules for Social Security is that it would eliminate all fiscal discipline in one of the fastest- growing parts of the budget and set a precedent for doing the same thing in other areas, like Medicare. These two programs have been responsible for all of the growth in Federal outlays relative to gross national product since 1962. Unless this growth is contained, or overall tax burdens are increased substantially, the rest of Government will be starved for funds. Spending for such purposes as education, the war on drugs, preventive health care, infrastructure, research, the environment and other investments in the future will be crowded out by the escalating costs of programs for the elderly. Worse, by artificially segregating Government accounts in this way, chances are that the elderly will come to view this money as rightfully theirs and will demand and receive additional benefits. Outlays would then grow even more rapidly and Social Security would find itself in a still deeper fiscal hole when the baby boom retires.
Finally, using the public's (misplaced) fears about their own or their children's retirement checks as an excuse for changing the Gramm-Rudman rules in 1991 would be the ultimate in budget chicanery. Truth in budgeting requires sticking with the existing targets. If a balanced budget can be achieved by 1993, a more ambitious set of targets, involving surpluses in the Government's overall accounts including Social Security, could then be set. But the purpose would be to encourage economic growth rather than to protect the Social Security system and no segregation of accounts would be necessary.
For all of these reasons the White House and Congress should resist changing the budgetary rules one more time and instead make a concerted effort to meet the current targets. Alternatively, they could scrap the whole Gramm-Rudman process, which has badly distorted budget-making in Washington and contributed little to reducing the deficit. The public, in turn, needs to understand that the Government's ability to meet its obligations to the elderly has nothing to do with how the Government keeps its accounts and everything to do with what we, as citizens, are willing to pay for.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL FINANCE;
Hanging On When the Dow Plunges

BYLINE: By Deborah Rankin

 BODY:
With the stock market on a roller-coaster course again, many people are wondering if they belong in the equity market at all. But most financial experts warn against panic selling should the Dow Jones industrial average experience another precipitous drop, the way it did on Oct. 13, and urge long-term investors to hang on for the ride.
''The only people who should be selling right now are those who have a near-term cash need,'' said George Barbee, executive director of Price Waterhouse's Personal Financial Service in Waltham, Mass. ''If you have college tuition coming up, or plan to retire soon, or hope to buy a house within the next couple of years, you should get out of the equity market if you haven't already.'' 
Mr. Barbee said he expects the market to ''bounce around a lot,'' with daily fluctuations of as much as 100 points. Because of this volatility, people who are going to need to draw on their financial resources soon should put their money into investments ''with little or no risk of capital loss.'' This, he said, means purchasing things like certificates of deposit, Treasury securities and money market funds.
But people who can afford to take a longer-term view, and don't need to touch their money for 5 or 10 years, should be buyers, not sellers, say many financial planners. ''This is not a time to give up and go home,'' said Kathy Muldoon, a vice president with Carter Financial Management in Dallas. ''This is a time when there's money to be made.''
Because she feels that most small investors, ''who buy 100 shares of this and 100 shares of that,'' lack the savvy and experience of big institutions and can be clobbered by short-term trading swings, she suggests buying mutual funds instead. Among the value-oriented funds she thinks will perform well in the future are Weingarten Equity Fund (managed by AIM Distributors in Houston), Royce Fund-Value Series (Quest Distributors in New York), Templeton Growth Fund and Templeton World Fund (Templeton Funds in St. Petersburg, Fla.), and any of the Pioneer equity funds - Pioneer Fund, Pioneer II and Pioneer Three (Pioneer Group in Boston).
Dollar-cost averaging, in which people invest a set sum in mutual funds (or individual stocks) on a regular basis, remains a good technique, but should be speeded up now, she said. ''You ought to be accelerating, by amount and timing. If you had been investing $500 every month, think about doubling that amount and buying every two weeks.''
Does this mean you should be 100 percent in equities? Far from it, although studies by Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago-based research group, show that for almost every 5-year and 10-year period since the crash of 1929, stocks have far outpaced fixed-income investments.
''Most of my clients are only 25 to 30 percent in stocks, which is probably one reason that I didn't get a single client call after Friday the 13th,'' said Alexandra Armstrong, head of a Washington, D.C., financial planning firm bearing her name.
Miss Armstrong believes it is a good time to purchase ''defensive stocks'' - those likely to suffer less in a recession - like Waste Management, Disney and Martin Marietta. For those who prefer mutual funds, she suggests Washington Mutual Investors, a fully invested growth and income fund (American Funds Distributors in Brea, Calif.).
The rest of her clients' portfolios are in a mix of fixed-income investments, like bonds and Treasury bills, and real estate, through such means as partnership arrangements. But determining the exact mix of these different investments, a technique called asset allocation, can be a difficult task in today's unsettled times.
''There's no magic formula,'' said Dennis J. Kelly, a financial planner and vice president in the New York office of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a Philadelphia brokerage house. ''In the last 15 years or so, we've had five major tax acts, four recessions, watched interest rates go from 21 percent to 7 percent, and seen inflation go from 15 percent to 1 percent. All these vagaries impact investors, and will continue to exist.''
Mr. Kelly employs several strategies to minimize the impact of such volatility on clients' portfolios. With fixed-income investments, he staggers maturities, so that clients have a range of 1- to 12-year paper. He then reinvests as the shorter-term securities come due, so that clients earn a rolling average of market rates. To maintain diversity outside the fixed-income area, he also suggests investing the semi-annual bond coupons and the discount amounts between the purchase price and the face value of Treasury bills in individual stocks or stock mutual funds.
But he is wary of going out too long in fixed-income securities, and prefers to concentrate in the 5- to 10-year range. ''That's just far enough out so you can get some capital appreciation should rates drop dramatically, but not so far out that you'll get killed if you guess wrong.''
For individual stocks, Mr. Kelly recommends Wal-Mart Stores because it is well positioned to weather an economic slowdown. ''During a recession, people who historically shop at traditional department stores step down a peg or two, and bargain-hunt at discounters,'' he said. ''Wal-Mart's new warehousing concept has given them a jump on their competitors.'' He also likes certain oil stocks, particularly Amoco and Sonat.
For mutual fund investors, he suggests Addison Capital, a low-load proprietary fund of Janney Montgomery available through brokers. Many load funds have a sliding scale of front-end sales charges, which decline as the amount invested increases. Mr. Kelly suggested that people who plan to use dollar-cost averaging to purchase shares can minimize the sales charges with such funds by signing a ''letter of intent'' stating that they plan to buy a certain amount in the fund over 13 months. Even though the purchases may be made monthly, rather than in one lump sum, the buyer can qualify for the lowest sales charge on the total amount invested over that period, he said.
Of course, people can avoid sales charges entirely by finding a no-load fund that they like. Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor, a monthly newsletter, says that while he's ''long-term bullish'' on the market, he also thinks it's time to cut holdings of speculative growth funds and switch to more conservative funds with low volatility. He recommends a number of ''all-weather'' funds, which tend to outperform their peers in down markets but lag a bit in up markets. His choices: Wellesley Income and Vanguard Star (Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa.), Janus Fund (Janus Capital in Denver), Gabelli Asset (Gabelli Funds in New York), Evergreen Total Return (Saxon Woods Asset Management in Harrison, N.Y.) and Strong Investment (Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management in Milwaukee).

HEADLINE: The Realities of 'Friday the 13th'

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Thank you, Tokyo.
Had it not been for the Japanese, the recent 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average could have gone from a scary market aberration to a disastrous financial freefall. With global exchanges now linked, as trading closed in New York that Friday, all eyes were on how Tokyo would open the following Monday. But because Japan remained calm, disaster was averted. ''If it weren't for Japan holding up, I'd say that internationalization was a disaster,'' said Barton M. Biggs, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Co.
But the fact that Japan held firm illustrates the benefits - and the risks - of continued market globalization. Financial theory teaches that there are no returns without risk and greater stock market links give investors the opportunity to make more money in more places. With that, however, comes new risks: of a system that is far more vulnerable to sudden jolts and of individual central banks that are increasingly unable to do anything about it.
''The danger of globalization is that if everyone goes crazy at the same time, you've got a bigger problem than before,'' said Hans Stoll, director of financial markets research at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University. Said Richard Levich, a finance professor at New York Unversity's Stern School of Business: ''You've got more eyes focused and when news comes out you've got more people running through a small door.'' 
And that rush is what almost took place when the Dow plunged 190 points in the last 45 minutes before the New York Stock Exchange closed on Oct. 13. The Federal Reserve Board took advantage of the weekend, when most markets were closed, to try to calm the markets by promising liquidity.
Financial experts say the event adds several points to the debate about the impact of greater market internationalization:
* The appetite for foreign equities will increase despite such terrifying market plunges because these securities help provide diversification that reduces portfolio risk.
* On any single day, except for times of worldwide panic, most stock exchanges generally act independent of one another. In general, they respond to specific economic, cultural and regulatory environments in their countries - differences that keep the various equity markets from marching in lock step. A rise in prices in London doesn't automatically spell a rise that day in Tokyo.
* Over time, globalization will reduce the power governments have over their nation's economy. The increased ease with which money can flow across borders means policy makers can no longer assume that their nation's capital is captive. Because of this, some say financial markets will play a larger role in overriding, or even setting, economic policy.
* When a worldwide market panic sets in, globalization can take a bad situation in one market and create an international crisis. This took place during the stock market plunge in October 1987 when ''hot money'' from investors seeking to liquidate their positions at any price circled the globe.
* Investors have less of a safety net than they once had because there is now no single lender of last resort. In the past, jittery American markets could be calmed by assurances of ample liquidity from the Federal Reserve. While such assurances are still powerful, globalization lessens their impact. This is because central banks all have different national interests and cannot be expected to act as a united front during a crisis.
''It doesn't really matter whether globalization is good or bad,'' said James Rogers, a finance professor at the Columbia University Business School. ''Nothing can be done about it. Electronics and communications are changing the world. There's lots of money sloshing around the world and it's got to go somewhere. Many of the economies are closely linked and that means their markets will be closely linked. Now, everyone has to worry.''
 
Cross-Border Craze
 Certainly, nothing appears to be halting the trend toward greater cross-border equity trading. As American firms set up shop overseas and foreign investment houses settle here, it has become increasingly easy for investors to buy the stocks of other nations.
Since 1980, foreign trading in United States securities has increased by 19 percent annually to reach $384 billion at the end of 1988. American purchases of foreign equities have increased by about 30 percent annually, reaching about $151 billion in 1988, according to the Securities Industry Association.
From an investment perspective, globalization provides investors a safe way to get greater portfolio diversification without reducing their expected returns. The notion is that investing in many countries provides safety since as one country's market goes up, another's may go down.
As a result, overseas investments are becoming a standard part of most institutional portfolios. And, increasingly, mutual funds made up of stocks from a single country or geographic region are being bought by retail investors. Since 1985, global equity funds have grown faster than the mutual fund industry in general. With about $20 billion in assets, they now represent about 10 percent of the total mutual fund market, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Yet their returns can be wiped out in one terrifying moment if investors panic. While long-term investors may be fine, those with short-term focus can be devastated.
''This time we saw the Frankfurt market drop after our market dropped,'' said John J. Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. ''But that seemed to be a local condition rather than enormous amounts of hot money running around the world. Hot money makes the markets riskier, more volatile, for short periods of time. What we saw after 1987, is that if you hung on, in most markets in the world you would have been better off than before 1987 occurred.''
Ironically, for all the market linkages, studies show that exchanges generally perform independently of one another. ''The evidence shows that markets are driven by what happened in local economies,'' said Gary P. Brinson, president of Chicago-based Brinson Partners, which manages about $12.5 billion.
Of course, there are global economic trends that can affect many markets similarly. For instance, most world markets have rebounded since the 1987 crash, largely due to sustained global economic growth. The tendency of markets to respond to different cues, while still keeping an eye on one another, was also evident in the Dow's recent 190-point plunge. New York fell on Friday and then recovered on Monday. London and Tokyo remained firm on Monday.
 
Japanese Composure
 ''When the Japanese market didn't overreact, other markets sensed what was happening and came back into synch,'' said Joseph R. Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.
The events also reflect the influence that investor psychology has on the markets. For instance, Mr. Brinson said Japanese investors are generally less sensitive to risk considerations and are more likely to ride out a storm. ''They have been through an ebullient period of their economy,'' he said. ''Their currency and their markets are strong. It's given the Japanese a great deal of self-confidence about their situation.''
Likewise, the unexpectedly steep decline of 13 percent in the Frankfurt exchange reflected unique West German attitudes. ''We were flabbergasted that the German market went down as far as it did,'' Mr. Brinson said. ''German investors are almost hyper risk-averse and if any global event takes place, it is amplified within the minds of the German people.''
In fact, these differing responses to the 190-point drop in New York has turned some notions about the German and Japanese markets on their heads. Theoretically, the underpriced German market should be considered a less risky investment than the Japanese market, where stocks are considered overpriced. But that theory did not hold in the most recent drop.
''German individuals panicked because of what was happening in the United States,'' said Mr. Biggs of Morgan Stanley. ''After what happened last week, the risk premium for Germany should go up, and for Japan it should go down. What all professionals agree is that Japan, the most overpriced market in the world, consistently understands panic better than anyone else.''
Increased market globalization is also bringing about shifts in power between financial markets and their home governments. ''The most significant implication of globalization is that a domestic government cannot really control the economic destiny of a country because the capital will leave,'' said Michael A. Petrino, president of Matrix Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn. ''For instance, if you have a disadvantageous tax policy, the capital will leave, unemployment will go up and you get thrown out of office. This means that markets will determine economic policy to a larger degree than they did when we had highly segmented markets.''
And this means a new role for the central banks. Steven Einhorn, chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs, said that increased market links have brought about heightened international economic policy coordination, with the Group of Seven's attempts to stabilize foreign exchange rates one prominent example. After October 1987, virtually all major central banks provided liquidity to their economies. ''They acted like our central bank, and going forward, they would continue to do that,'' Mr. Einhorn said.
But others aren't so sure. ''Averting a crisis requires coordination of central banks; and when there are national interests that diverge, you may not be able to assure that,'' said William L. Silber, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''A crisis in Japan, for instance, may lead the Japanese central bank to do something that may not be in the best interest of all other countries. You do not have the safety net of a single central bank except to the extent that central banks agree to cooperate. That's a safety net, with holes.''
 
Global Limitations
 Still, for all these links, barriers remain that prevent the worlds' exchanges from becoming more fully integrated. The limitations are real: back-office operations are often cumbersome and time-consuming, settlements in different currencies can be problematic and regulations vary significantly among countries, as do corporate accounting standards.
''The major barrier to greater globalization is regulation,'' said Morris Mendelson, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of Business. ''America doesn't like Americans being taken for a ride on foreign exchanges. And there are significant clearing and settlement problems. Let's say you want to trade Japanese securities in Tokyo. You've got to ship them off to Tokyo and convert your money to yen. That's a lot of delays.'' But Steven H. Reynolds, managing director of the investment group at the Bankers Trust Company, noted that many of these barriers are falling. ''Ten years ago, the limitations were infinite,'' he said. ''Day by day, they are being broken down. The world is changing rapidly toward a more unified system.''
What is more, informal contacts among traders and bankers are solidifying. Mr. Reynolds said that after the October 1987 crash, ''there was little cooperation and coordination among market participants.'' But, this time, ''principals in this country contacted people overseas and exchanged knowledge so that investors didn't act irrationally.''

HEADLINE: WEEK IN BUSINESS;
Hectic Recovery For Stock Prices

BYLINE: By STEVE DODSON

 BODY:
Stocks came back after the Friday the 13th plunge of 190 points. Sell orders poured in when the markets opened on Monday and the Dow Jones industrial average had an early 60- point loss but the market turned around within about an hour and the day ended with the Dow up 88 points. Volume on Monday was 416 million shares, the fourth-busiest day ever. The rest of the week saw an 18-point drop on Tuesday but a gain of nearly 40 points on Thursday. The Dow closed out the week at 2,689.14, up 119.88 points, a record. Before the American markets opened Monday, the European markets showed losses, with Frankfurt losing the most, 13 percent. But the Tokyo market fell only 2 percent, helping prevent a recurrence of the worldwide panic seen in the October 1987 crash. So far, the only serious damage appeared to be to some takeover deals, particularly in the airlines. Since Oct. 12, the Dow Jones transportation index has fallen 17 percent. 
 
*
 The credit markets benefited as the Federal Reserve gave clear indications early in the week that it would feed money to the economy to help alleviate any stock market crisis. Yields on the Treasury's 30-year bonds stayed below 8 percent all week. At week's end, however, some people in the credit markets were saying they detected signs that the Fed had decided it had eased enough and would hold the key short-term rate, the Fed funds rate, at about 8.75 percent . . . The dollar stabilized after plunging during the stock selloff.
 
*
 The problems of ''junk bonds'' worsened. At least four issues of the high-yield securities, totaling more than $1.5 billion, were postponed because of poor market conditions. The junk market has had the jitters since late summer. Companies issuing the bonds must pay rates as much as seven percentage points higher than on comparable Treasury issues.
 
*
 Housing construction was down 5.2 percent in September, with the annual rate dropping to 1.26 million units, its slowest pace in seven years. A large inventory of unsold homes and fears about rising mortgage rates last month were given the blame . . . Consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of a percent in September, leaving the inflation rate so far in 1989 at the same 4.4 percent posted in 1988 . . . The trade deficit widened sharply in August, reaching $10.8 billion, as imports climbed to a record level and exports posted a small decline . . . Business sales were up a strong 3.1 percent in August, while inventories rose only three-tenths of a percent.
 
*
 Two airline deals were in turmoil. The stock market's plunge was set off by the failure of the UAL bidding group to complete financing for its $6.75 billion offer for the parent of United Airlines. The group said it would try to organize a lower bid, but that effort was dealt a severe blow last week when British Airways said it would no longer take part. In the original offer, British Air was to have taken a 15 percent stake in exchange for providing the bulk of the deal's cash, $750 million. UAL stock was near $170 late Friday; earlier this month it had traded near the $300 a share being offered by the bidding group . . . In the wake of the market selloff, Donald J. Trump withdrew his $120-a-share, $7.5 billion offer for AMR, the parent of American Airlines. He said he might make another offer, at a lower price.
 
*
 Some big names reported profits for the third quarter. I.B.M.'s earnings were down 29.7 percent, at the low end of what had been expected. Digital Equipment was off 32.5 percent. Apple Computer was up 49 percent because of a stock transaction, but operating profit rose only 2 percent . . . Philip Morris, the world's largest consumer goods company, had a 21 percent rise in earnings . . . Merrill Lynch was down 37.5 percent, but Charles Schwab had a 70 percent gain . . . Citicorp had a 9 percent decrease, but Wells Fargo was up 17 percent and NCNB's profit more than doubled. J. P. Morgan and Manufacturers Hanover had the big losses that had been expected after they added to their reserves for third world loans . . . A.T.&T. was up 19 percent; MCI rose 58.7 percent, and GTE was ahead 17.6 percent . . . Drug companies generally reported double-digit percentage gains.
 
*
 Miscellanea. Ford Motor will quit importing its Scorpio luxury sports sedan from West Germany because of poor sales. The base price for the car is $28,400 . . . The cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits will be 4.7 percent next year, the largest increase in seven and a half years . . . Farley Inc. will sell its Cluett-Peabody unit to Bidermann of France for $600 million. Bidermann's designer clothing lines include Ralph Lauren and Yves Saint Laurent. Cluett-Peabody makes Arrow shirts and Gold Toe socks . . . K Mart is paying $322 million for the 41 stores of Pace Membership Warehouse Inc., a Colorado-based operator of no-frills discount stores.

HEADLINE: Prospects;
Free Trade With Mexico

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
In comments made before a Senate hearing on the Latin American debt situation, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher predicted that the United States and Mexico would eventually enter into a free-trade agreement similar to the one that went into effect with Canada in January. Four experts comment on the possibility.
 
Rogelio Ramirez de la O
General director, Ecanal, an economic analysis and consulting firm in Mexico City.
 We are heading in the direction of a free-trade agreement. It is only natural to formalize the integration of our two countries, which is happening anyway. A silent agreement is in place and an agreement will only formalize it under a corpus of law. The Mexican Government has given the signals that say it is willing to ensure access to Mexico and to negotiate a formalized agreement. Mexico will go along with a pact if it is not outside the scope of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules. Mexico has done a great deal of homework on opening its economy. Conditions for an agreement could proceed out of negotiations on textiles, electronics and autos. 
The Mexican economy stands to benefit most from an agreement because the American markets are so large. To serve that market Mexico would have to build larger plants and get economies of scale. That will bring much greater levels of productivity.
 
Alan J. Stoga
Managing director, Kissinger Associates.
 A free-trade agreement with Mexico is desirable, but it should include Canada. I would say the optimal strategy is for the three countries to get together to define their objectives. They should begin with a free-trade agreement and then think beyond to a common market agreement.
Clearly we need to do what Japan did. Japanese industries have been obtaining products from other countries in Southeast Asia. We need to do the same thing but we need to do it with Mexico. We need to do this not just to take advantage of low wages but also to take advantage of the more pro-export structure of Mexico. We need to create better trade and have a prosperous Mexico.
 
Sidney Weintraub
Dean Rusk Professor, Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas, and author of ''Marriage of Convenience: the relationship between Mexico and the United States.''
 If Commerce Secretary Mossbacher says ''Let's do it,'' I think we'll just gulp and stall. In the next 10 years we may see a free-trade agreement with Mexico, but it won't come before then. What we'll see is a process. We'll see a series of agreements on textile quotas, steel, intellectual property and so on. We'll see a series of negotiations that will conclude in a free-trade agreement. The rest of the world is moving toward regional trading blocks and big corporations and industries trading with each other. But I think Canada will be reluctant to share its preferential access to the American market with Mexico.
 
C. Michael Aho
Chief economist, Council on Foreign Relations.
 Mexico has asked for years to have access to the American market. However, I think Mexico's nationalists will be very vociferous against an agreement. American labor unions don't want to compete with low-wage Mexican labor so they're against a pact. I don't see a compreshensive agreement between Mexico and the United States before the next century.
The problem with a bilateral trade pact is that it will tend to undermine the expectations that were engendered by the first one with Canada. If we want to have a special auto pact with Mexico, Canada will be in an uproar.
The one thing that could push an agreement, however, is if the negotiations under way at the GATT fail to produce results. In the mid-1980's, Reagan was frustrated on trade and said he'd negotiate bilateral trade agreements with whatever country he could find. With the Canadian free-trade agreement he demonstrated he could do it. Mexico would be the only other that could be justified.

HEADLINE: Private Carriers vs. the Post Office

BYLINE: By WAYNE CURTIS; Wayne Curtis is a writer on Peaks Island, Me.

 BODY:
Last summer, about 5,000 Atlanta subscribers to Time, Sports Illustrated, People and other Time Warner publications found their magazines in unexpected places: not in their mailboxes, but sealed in waterproof plastic bags under their boxes and on their doorsteps.
It was the work of Publishers Express Inc., a wholly owned Atlanta subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. Within five years, Publishers Express plans to open a much wider crack in the United States Postal Service monopoly by delivering magazines, catalogues and advertising in 38 metropolitan areas nationwide.
Private carriers like Publishers Express hope to thrive as magazine publishers and direct marketers search for alternatives to the post office. At present, private carriers deliver about a million magazines a month, compared with the 866 million magazines and newspapers delivered at second-class rates by the Postal Service each month. But the private services say they are poised to expand rapidly after the next postal rate increase, possibly in early 1991. 
Even a member of the United States Postal Rate Commission, John W. Crutcher, grants that the private carriers are a threat. ''I see no reason they can't make a go of it, especially in doing some cream-skimming,'' he said. The Postal Service could find itself with a dwindling volume of magazines and bulk mail to support higher-cost delivery routes and services, he added. ''If they choose to let all that business go out the door, the cost of mailing a letter would increase more dramatically.''
If Time Warner see private delivery first as a means of cutting its own costs, United Delivery Systems wants to exploit an emerging market. U.D.S., based in Grand Rapids, Mich., dominates the industry, delivering 800,000 magazines a month. Phillip D. Miller, the company's founder, sees his business taking off. ''There's no question that the last postal rate increase created the environment for alternate delivery to thrive,'' he said.
Private carriers are taking advantage of exceptions to the Postal Service's legal monopoly on mail. Just as the United Parcel Service and the Federal Express Corporation can deliver packages and overnight letters, Publishers Express and U.D.S. depend on provisions allowing private delivery of catalogues and magazines.
The private carriers face more obstacles than rain, hail, sleet and snow. Previous private efforts to deliver magazines have failed. The Postal Service says its own rates might stabilize in the 1990's. When rates held steady in the mid-1980's, U.D.S. deliveries dropped 70 percent.
But large mailers are increasingly open to private carriers. Though alternate delivery costs are comparable to the Postal Service's now, mailers fear the next second-class rate increase will be at least 25 percent. In April 1988 the Postal Service raised rates by 18 percent. ''There's more interest in alternate delivery now than I've seen in years,'' said Marilyn Luers, distribution supervisor at the Meredith Corporation.
Meredith, one of the first publishers to pursue alternatives to the post office, uses U.D.S. to deliver 345,000 copies a month, including 200,000 of Better Homes and Gardens. The Hearst Corporation delivers 187,000 magazines a month through private carriers. Times Mirror Magazines Inc. distributes 40,000 copies a month of three titles - Golf, Popular Science, and Home Mechanix - through U.D.S. in Michigan. ''Almost everything one hears about postal rates is negative, and my level of interest rises as we get closer to the next rate increase,'' said Diane Potter, Times Mirror Magazines' vice president of circulation.
Time Warner's service delivers just 21,000 magazines a month now, but it has the potential for huge expansion. Time Warner is the nation's largest second-class mailer, with $175 million in magazine postal charges last year. Since 1971 Time magazine's delivery costs have soared sevenfold. ''There's no question that postal costs have far outstripped the other costs of publishing,'' said Deane D. Raley Jr., the company's director of paper purchasing, distribution and postal affairs.
Publishers Express is only Time Warner's latest, and largest, delivery venture. ''We've dabbled in it from the beginning,'' Mr. Raley said. ''We delivered in milk trucks when they had milk trucks.''
The new service was begun in June in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta. Just 13 part-time carriers drive their routes weekdays between 3:30 A.M. and 6:30 A.M. Mr. Raley contends that Publishers Express can deliver magazines earlier and in better condition than the Postal Service. ''Getting it there before dawn is sort of like getting it there a day early for people who work,'' he said.
Time Warner recently signed up Meredith and Rupert Murdoch's News America Publishing Inc. as partners in Publishers Express. In five years, the venture plans to employ 2,200 carriers.
Publishers Express plans to wrap catalogues and direct-mail advertising with the magazines. Fees from these ''ride-alongs'' can give private carriers a major advantage, allowing them to lower their rates for magazines. The Postal Service delivers advertisements and catalogues as third-class mail, prohibiting publishers from sending these with their magazines at lower second-class rates.
U.D.S. already has close ties with direct marketers. Mr. Miller, U.D.S.'s 38-year-old president, founded the company in 1973 to deliver supermarket and department store circulars. With a typical U.D.S.-delivered magazine, two or three catalogues or advertising inserts ride along. The company also delivers advertising packets separately from magazines.
Within five years, U.D.S. aspires to be in the top 95 metropolitan areas, reaching 40 percent of all mailboxes in the United States, with potential annual revenues of $400 million, up from $5 million currently. But so far, U.D.S. is ''a national umbrella organization'' by Mr. Miller's description only, delivering to just 14 Middle Western markets and Buffalo. Publishers have not given Mr. Miller the long-term commitments he needs to build a nationwide system. Mr. Miller said he is negotiating five-year contracts with Hearst and Meredith, but most of his current contracts have 60- or 90-day termination clauses.
The odds have been against any private magazine carrier circumventing the post office for long. In the 1970's, many carriers failed when they tried to match the Government's rates. Poor service doomed another wave of small carriers that vanished in the early 1980's. Publishers were ''awash with complaints'' about damaged or undelivered magazines, said Larry Flynn, director of customer service at Hearst Publications.
Some private carriers say that publishers flirted with alternate delivery just to frighten the Postal Service into moderating its rate increases in the mid-1980's. ''Alternate delivery has been like the second girlfriend,'' said Leonard Merewitz, a Postal Rate Commission economist. ''Mailers visit them to make their first girlfriend jealous, but they eventually come back.''
Ken Hunter, an associate postmaster general, is confident that his agency will prevail. ''If we get our costs back at or below the Consumer Price Index, which we have every intention of doing, then I think alternate delivery will subside again,'' he said.
But Mr. Miller's optimism remains boundless. ''We believe that some day we'll be looked back on as another Federal Express or MCI,'' Mr. Miller said. ''There was no such thing as an overnight package 15 years ago. There was no such thing as a newspaper insert 20 years ago. I'm very confident that we've got the trend right.''

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: FORECASTING INFLATION;
'P-Star' Can Spot Inflationary Trends

BYLINE: By L. DOUGLAS LEE; L. Douglas Lee is vice president and chief economist of County NatWest/Washington Analysis Corporation, part of the NatWest Banking Group.

 BODY:
Recent work at the Federal Reserve board, christened P-Star analysis, has stimulated a renewed debate about the relationship between the money supply and inflation. This new work is based on the earlier work of Irving Fisher, which he conducted evidence, and concluded that the P-Star concept is helpful in understanding inflation.
Members of the Federal Reserve and its staff have been very careful in describing the usefulness of the P-Star concept. This is not a short-term forecasting tool that will predict next month's consumer price index. Nor will it provide simple answers to the policy choices central bankers must make. 
What P-Star will do is provide a reasonably useful guide to whether inflation should be expected to speed up or slow down over the next 6 to 12 months. It can serve as an indicator of inflation over this period of time, provided there are no shocks to the system, like a major oil price change, and provided the current trends continue with respect to growth and the velocity of money - the number of times each unit of money is used to purchase the nation's output of goods and services each year.
After reviewing the Federal Reserve's analysis and agreeing that it provides a useful approach to understanding the relationship between the money supply and inflation, one is left wondering how well P-Star will travel. Can it be applied to other countries?
If a concept is really helpful in understanding the workings of a capitalist economy, then it should be helpful when applied to any particular capitalist economy. To ascertain whether P-Star is equally useful outside of the United states, my colleagues and I examined the concept as a predictive tool in a number of different countries. We applied P-Star analysis to the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia. For each country, we found that the P-Star concept is useful in understanding the relationship between the money supply and inflation.
Applying empirical tests to any economic theory is always a tricky proposition, but this is even more true when the theory is tested for different countries.
Capitalism is the common denominator, but each economy has its own characteristics. Definitions of commonly used terms, like money supply, vary. Measurements are made differently and data are aggregated differently. In some cases, financial instruments in one country do not have an exact counterpart in another.
With this standard in mind, we have reached conclusions about the outlook for inflation in each of the countries we examined. What makes these conclusions so interesting is that in each case P-Star analysis confirms the results of our inflation analysis based on traditional methods using real growth, wage trends, capital costs, resource costs, and so on.
In the case of Japan, our economists have concluded that the P-Star analysis is useful, provided transitory shocks like the oil crisis and the recently imposed 3 percent consumption tax are excluded. This work suggests that inflation in Japan has probably peaked as these special factors boosting inflation work through the system.
For Britain, there appears to be an unusually long time lag between changes in the actual rate of inflation and changes in the expected rate of inflation. Our analysis suggests that the current policy that has resulted in 14 percent interest rates and a sharp slowdown in the growth of the money supply is not excessive. However, it will have to be maintained for some time before the inflation outlook improves.
In Australia, the leveling out in the growth of the money supply since the end of 1988 points to the likelihood that there will be a lower inflation rate for 1990 and 1991.
No matter which country is used for the P-Star analysis, however, a healthy dose of caution is appropriate. It is quite possible that the stock of money outstanding in the world is large enough to maintain inflation's current momentum. In other words, there is still a substantial amount of liquidity in the global economy that was accumulated during 1987 and 1988 and that could cause inflation problems. Central bankers must continue to be alert to this possibility as they develop their policies.
It is our conclusion that P-Star is not foolproof. But neither is any other tool of economic analysis. Its results are sensitive to assumptions about economic growth, money velocity, and money growth, and it is most useful in judging the long-run forces influencing inflation. Having said that it is not perfect, however, it is also worth saying that the P-Star analysis is a useful addition to the tools that help us better understand the workings of the economy. In short, P-Star travels well.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: FORECASTING INFLATION;
The Fed's New Tool Just Doesn't Work

BYLINE: By LACY H. HUNT; Lacy H. Hunt is chief economist at Carroll, McEntee & McGinley Inc. Stephanie Murphy assisted with this article.

 BODY:
The research staff of the board of Governors of the Federal Reserve has developed what is described as a new method for forecasting inflation. The announcement of this new construct brought a great deal of publicity. The equation, which is called P-Star, is a throwback to strict monetarism in its most primitive form. However, my analysis of P-Star's results over the last three years shows it to have been a faulty predictor of inflation. A number of sound fundamental reasons suggest this approach is too limited to be used as a tool for successful monetary policy decisions.
P-Star is a derivative of an equation developed by Irving Fisher, the great American economist of the early 20th century. Professor Fisher's original equation stated that the money supply, called M, when multiplied by the velocity of money, called V, equals the current dollar value of the nation's gross national product. By velocity, Professor Fisher meant the number of times a dollar passes through the economy as it buys the nation's output. In this equation the term ''P'' is what economists call the current price level or the rate of inflation in the economy. 
To arrive at P-Star, the Federal Reserve's staff uses as a starting point the same equation Professor Fisher used. But the researchers at the Federal Reserve have introduced assumptions that transform this simple economic truism into a forecasting device. Rather than use the current value of velocity, the Federal Reserve's equation fixes it at its 30-year historical average, not at its current rates. And, instead of using the actual real growth rate in the economy in the equation, the Federal Reserve substitutes a figure - 2.5 percent - which it deems to be the long-term annual potential growth rate of the economy. According to the Federal Reserve, this formula is a guide to identifying the nation's future inflationary tendencies.
There are a number of limitations to the Federal Reserve's approach. First, since the Federal Reserve's equation uses a fixed value for the velocity of money and the potential growth rate of G.N.P., then the inflation rate - in the Federal Reserve's equation - can only be determined by changes in the money supply. But, in reality, the inflation rate is determined by the demand from all sectors of the economy and the growth of the money supply is only one aspect of that demand. Fiscal policy, family income, corporate income and international income all contribute to inflation. So do the costs of production, which are influenced by changes in wage rates, swings in productivity, availability of plant capacity, movements in the price of oil, argricultural and other commodities prices, as well as the cost of imported goods.
In addition, the assumption of a stable rate of velocity for money is highly questionable. In late 1986 and early 1987, velocity averaged about 1.55, which means that each dollar changed hands 1.55 times during each of those years. In the second quarter of this year, however, velocity jumped to almost 1.69 - a significant increase. Velocity can also be ascertained only after the fact. Swings in interest rates and the changing attitudes of investors about current and prospective economic conditions, as well as other factors, all influence changes in velocity.
The Federal Reserve's researchers also ignore the fact that the economy does not grow at a constant rate of 2.5 percent from quarter to quarter as this forecasting tool assumes. The actual growth rate may rise above, and then fall below, the assumed potential rate of growth for several years. Problems also arise in measuring the potential rate of growth in the economy. While the Federal Reserve's figure may have been valid in the 1960's and 1970's, such a number is probably too optimistic in the current environment of diminishing labor-force growth and considerably weaker gains in productivity.
In view of these limitations, one might expect that P-Star is doing a poor job forecasting actual inflation. The surprise is how bad it really is. According to my analysis, in seven of the last nine quarters, P-Star underestimated the inflation rate. Only once was P-Star on target. P-Star's cumulative error of 5 percent was greater than the inflation rate for all of 1988. This shows the problem with inserting fixed values into Professor Fisher's old equation.
There is no reason to believe that the P-Star equation will provide any useful information about future inflationary trends unless velocity were stable, the economy grew at a fairly constant rate, and the prices of labor, oil, and all other inputs to production remained fixed. By relying on P-Star, the Federal Reserve could misread the economy's future inflation rate, thereby making misguided policy moves. The Federal Reserve may be lulled into the view that inflation is under control when that is not the case.

California Struggles With The Other Side Of Its Dream

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
FROM the beginning, California has been the American symbol of opportunity, freedom, renewal, sunny paradise and human dominion over a land that was as beautiful as it was terrible. Dams and aqueducts brought water into the desert, where vast cities and farms blossomed. Dramatic bridges and mammoth freeways turned small towns into powerful cities. Roads were terraced into steep hillsides and houses were cantilevered along canyon walls.
In just 15 seconds on Tuesday evening, nature sought to restore a bit of its equilibrium. A powerful earthquake knocked down a freeway in Oakland, ravaged San Francisco's Marina district and tore the commercial heart out of the lovely tourist town of Santa Cruz near the quake's epicenter south of the bay. Scores of people died, a painful reminder that California, for all its beauty and wealth, is particularly vulnerable to some of nature's harsher realities. 
The quake came at a time when the Golden State was already grappling with a profound shift in its once-shimmering self image as problems mounted with growth. The image of Los Angeles has changed from that of a utopia of wide beaches and myriad possibilities to that of a vacuous sprawl of clogged traffic and brutal crack gangs under a dirty halo of smog. Pretty San Francisco evokes grim thoughts of AIDS.
''We are in a watershed time even without this quake,'' said the historian Kevin Starr in San Francisco. ''This is not the end of the California dream, but an element of correction has become an essential part of the California formula. The idea of coming to California to escape reality was a bad thing for the state, for its literature and culture.''
It was sobering to know that Tuesday's frightening jolt was perhaps only one-thirtieth as powerful as the ''Big One'' that the experts say is all but inevitable. The United States Geological Survey said the quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, did nothing to alter its ominous warning that there is a 60 percent chance of a quake with a Richter magnitude of 7.5 to 8.0 along the San Andreas Fault near Los Angeles and a 50 percent chance of one in the Bay Area in the next 30 years.
Almost from the Gold Rush, California has straddled a psychological fault as deep as the geological ones, caught between psychic plates of optimism and doom. The earthquake has for now underscored the latter, what Bill Bradley, a Sacramento writer who is completing a book called ''The United States of California,'' refers to as the ''last frontier'' notion: the idea that Americans have pushed to the very end of the continent in pursuit of the American dream, and ruined it. Such themes have long pervaded California literature in the works of Nathaniel West, John Steinbeck and Joan Didion.
The quake has spawned arguments that technology has gone too far in trying to tame California's unforgiving terrain. The day after the disaster, Marc Reisner, the author of ''Cadillac Desert,'' a history of water in the West, wrote in an essay in the Los Angeles Times that he would not be ''staring at unseen corpses'' in the darkness from his San Francisco home if bridges, elevated highways and other ''gargantuan wizardry'' had not been built to ''snub nature.''
But once the dust settled, a more defiant view emerged. J.S. Holliday, the historian, chronicler of the Gold Rush, said in an interview that it was ''a mistake to emphasize the feeling that collectively or individually California is suffering any kind of psychic damage.'' People ''bore up'' under the much more powerful 1906 quake, he said, adding that the state needed more ''steel in the spine,'' to look to its ''glorious rambunctious hormonal'' past for succor. The quake was almost a favor, he went on, ''a test run at almost no price'' for the future.
Indeed, some San Franciscans emerged from the experience with a new sense of urban community. After he got over the initial terror, Herb Gold, a novelist who wrote ''Dreaming,'' about California real estate promoters who had to allay people's fears over quakes, found that a tremendous, unaccustomed sense of caring enveloped his Russian Hill neighborhood. And there was pride and astonishment on both sides of the bay that few took advantage of the chaos to loot and pillage.
Although few seemed to fully share the feelings of John Muir, the 19th century naturalist, who reported the joy of experiencing a quake in Yosemite Valley, many here saw value in being traumatized, shocked out of trivial concerns.
''For cultures to be mature there has to be some internalization of a tragic metaphor,'' said Mr. Starr, the historian. ''This gives a certain depth to a culture in San Francisco that was in terminal pursuit of the trivial. It was acting as if spending $100 million for a new baseball stadium was the greatest issue in history, as if the next restaurant opening was akin to a new Shakespeare play at the Globe theater. San Francisco has always had a temptation for frivolity. That's part of its charm, but this experience will give depth to the city again.''
Psychiatrists and sociologists said the trauma would fade quickly except for those who suffered profound personal losses. Californians expected some residents would move to other states or to less quake-prone parts of the state, and migration from other states might slow, for a while at least.
In Los Angeles, the country's second largest city, residents had good reason to ponder their good life and Mr. Reisner's words from San Francisco: ''Remember, you were supposed to have been hit before us. How many people are you going to squeeze into your deadly little arid basin? What are you going to do when your aqueducts are destroyed? When your freeways come tumbling down? When the mobility you have so assiduously pursued bites you back, paralyzing you?''
Whatever the local response, though, the national reaction of sympathy and awe for what happened served to validate the fact that California is not easily dismissed anymore as the land of fruits and nuts. It is the largest state, the world's seventh largest economy, seat of Silicon Valley and the aerospace industry. It is also home for 28 million people, one of every nine Americans, who live under the constant threat of imminent and random anhilation at the hands of the magnificent natural forces that are both the curse and the magnet of the West Coast.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Why the Deficit Is Paralyzing Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
RARELY in peacetime has a single issue dominated politics here the way the budget deficit is doing now.
The most important legislative measures of the year -tax cuts, expansion of child-care benefits, changes in Medicare and Medicaid and many others - are paralyzed. President Bush was compelled last week to order across-the-board reductions in spending for the military and most domestic programs, at least temporarily, because he and Congress could not agree on a deficit-reduction bill. Essential legislation to raise the Government's statutory borrowing limit, a bill that logically ought to be routine, will probably tie the lawmakers in knots over the next week or two. 
The dispute over the deficit is not really about how much more the Government is spending than it is taking in. Rather, it is about which party and philosophy should lead the country and, as an economic issue, it is a cover for other issues that are more difficult to grasp. Hardly anyone - not the politicians, not economists and certainly not the public - believes anymore that the deficit is the most critical problem facing the nation.
''If someone came down from Mars and looked at our economic problems, they'd be amazed at how much attention we pay to the deficit,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is one of the most serious students of economics in Congress.
In their new book, ''The Debt and the Deficit,'' the economists Robert Heilbroner and Peter Bernstein list what they consider more urgent economic goals than cutting the deficit. They include, in descending order of gravity: making the American economy more competitive internationally, controlling inflation, checking the decay of urban life, restoring the environment, reforming the financial markets and restraining ''corporate civil war,'' and improving education.
As for the public, the New York Times/CBS News poll found last month that only 3 percent of American adults consider the deficit ''the most important problem'' in the country, while 54 percent said it was drug abuse. As recently as January, 17 percent said the deficit was the nation's worst problem, and a few years ago it was seen as a truly major threat.
This is not to say that the deficit does not matter. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was about $160 billion, four times what it was a decade ago. As a proportion of Gross National Product, the current deficit is 3.1 percent, about half what it was in 1983 but still much higher than it has been historically in years when the economy was prospering.
Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration and now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, describes three schools of thought among economists about the significance of the deficit. He calls them the wolf at the door, the domesticated pussycat and the termites in the basement.
The wolves say that because of the deficit, this country faces an imminent crisis in which foreigners lose confidence in the United States economy, the value of the dollar plummets, prices at home rise sharply, interest rates soar and a market crash and severe recession follow. This view was once prevalent on Wall Street and in international financial circles, but it is heard less and less.
The pussycats, some left of center and some on the far right, hold that the deficit is trivial. The pick of the litter is Prof. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, a former president of the American Economic Association. He argues that when adjustments are made for inflation, for capital projects like highways and sewers that actually add to the nation's productive wealth and for the budget surpluses of state and local governments, the deficit turns out to be inconsequential.
But in Mr. Schultze's taxonomy, most economists are termites. The deficit, they believe, may not be the nation's most urgent problem, but by draining away productive investment by Americans, it is eroding the quality of life of the next generation. Benjamin M. Friedman, professor of political economy at Harvard, puts it graphically: ''America has thrown itself a party and billed the tab to the future. The costs, which are only beginning to come due, will include a lower standard of living for individual Americans and reduced American influence and importance in world affairs.''
But if the consensus is that the deficit is not a dire situation, why does it so dominate the political debate? The main answer is that it gives politicians a backdrop for deep-seated views. Democrats can argue that, despite years of prosperity under Republican Presidents, times are not so good as they seem. In outlining a Democratic vision of the economy, including a lower deficit, the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said last week that ''for the first time, the American people now fear that their children will be worse off than they were.'' From the Republicans' perspective, the deficit gives President Bush and his allies an excuse for opposing Government social programs without appearing to be callous. The economist Milton Friedman maintains that the deficit is a blessing in disguise because it has restrained the Democratic Congress from voting for more spending and thus more Government intrusion into the marketplace and people's lives.
Another reason for the emphasis on the deficit is that the solution is so easily understood. Neither politicians nor economists know how to end poverty, control inflation without inducing a recession, persuade Americans to save more, improve American goods or attack many other economic problems they may perceive as more critical. But no one doubts how to end the deficit: raise taxes, cut spending or both.
''Of course, the deficit matters,'' said Representative Schumer. ''But what it is really is a security blanket. When things go wrong, you can always blame it on the deficit. Other problems are more serious, but the deficit is easier to talk about.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Noriega Might Stay, But the Canal Will Go On

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UNDER the Panama Canal treaties, a Panamanian is supposed to take over as administrator of the waterway on Jan. 1. But in the last few weeks, the Bush Administration has made clear that that will not happen if Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is still ruling Panama. Nevertheless, the canal will continue operating regardless of whether General Noriega retains or surrenders power, American officials say. These officials assert too that the treaties will remain in force, even though there may be problems carrying out some of the provisions.
Both Panama and the United States are eager to see the canal operate without interruption. The waterway is vital to Panama's economy, and while it has lost some of the importance it once had in American eyes, it still remains significant for the United States' strategic and economic interests. 
Panamanian and American employees of the canal report being harassed by the Noriega regime, and the political turmoil in Panama has increased the costs of operating the canal. But the United States and Panama share a strong interest in seeing continued use of the canal by ships carrying wheat, corn, soybeans, oil, coal, automobiles, chemicals, lumber, iron, steel and other cargo. For these reasons, the war of nerves over the continuation of General Noriega in power has not been allowed to do any serious harm to operations of the 75-year-old canal.
Nevertheless, the next step in that war of nerves appears likely to involve the canal and the schedule for implementing the treaties, under which Panama is supposed to assume complete responsibility for managing operating and maintaining the canal at noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
Until that date, the canal is to be operated by the commission, an agency in the executive branch of the United States Government. The administrator of the canal, now an American, is appointed by the President and is subject to confirmation by the Senate. On Jan. 1, Dennis P. McAuliffe, the administrator, is stepping down, and a Panamanian recommended by the Panamanian Government is supposed to become the administrator, subject to Senate confirmation. An American is to replace the Panamanian whose term as deputy administrator expires on the same day.
 
Prospect of a Standoff
In the last few weeks, as American attention focused on the coup attempt in Panama, many senators said they would not approve a candidate proposed by the Noriega regime. The Bush Administration has said it would not accept recommendations from the regime, which it regards as illegitimate. The standoff does not necessarily imply any interruption in canal operations, however. One temporary solution being considered by the White House is simply to appoint an American as deputy administrator, leaving a vacancy in the office of administrator.
There is much debate about the military and commercial importance of the canal, which was built when warships were the major strategic weapon. Planes and missiles have superseded ships in that role, some analysts say, and not many military ships now pass through the canal. But a study by the conservative Heritage Foundation says the waterway ''remains a strategic choke point.''
Under the treaties, American rights to station forces and maintain bases in Panama end in December 1999 unless there is an agreement to extend such rights. Considering the vicissitudes of Panamanian politics, some members of Congress say the only way for the United States to be sure that the canal will stay open after 1999 is to keep forces there, and the United States may seek a base rights agreement with a post-Noriega government.
Canal officials estimate that 14 percent of the United States' seaborne trade moves through the waterway. However, the canal faces growing competition from pipelines, air freight carriers and sea-rail transport. The number of ships passing through the 50-mile waterway dropped by about 15 percent in 1983, after the opening of a pipeline to carry Alaskan oil across the isthmus of Panama. Since then, the number of ships and the cargo tonnage have been climbing gradually. Michael Rhode Jr., the secretary of the Panama Canal Commission, which operates the canal, said that with a projected increase in world trade, ''We expect cargo tonnage to grow by 1.5 percent to 2 percent a year'' in the 1990's.
While demanding the departure of General Noriega, the United States insists that it is still committed to the Panama Canal treaties. Sol M. Linowitz, one of the treaty negotiators, has said that abrogation of the treaties would inflame nationalist sentiment in Panama and could undermine the legal basis for American troops to remain there.
So White House officials take pains to avoid casting their reluctance to approve General Noriega's candidate for administrator now as a breach of the treaty arrangements. They say they still cling to the hope that somehow General Noriega will have relinquished power by Jan. 1 so they do not have to worry about the problem.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Who Has to Do What As New York Prepares To Pick a New Mayor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
THE nomination of David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani for mayor of New York City last month also produced two political truisms: that Mr. Giuliani could not win without first deflating Mr. Dinkins, and that this would be Mr. Dinkins's election to lose.
After coasting in a post-primary euphoria while Mr. Giuliani appeared to be self-destructing, Mr. Dinkins spent last week dousing political brushfires, or worse. For the first time, he appeared vulnerable to what would be the city's only successful mayoral campaign by a Republican in a generation.
Now, with just over two weeks before the general election, the candidates have reversed strategies. Mr. Dinkins, after issuing an ultimatum to Mr. Giuliani to abandon ''gutter politics,'' has gone on the offensive with a television commercial portraying Mr. Giuliani's flipflops. Mr. Giuliani, while still sprinkling salt in Mr. Dinkins's largely self-inflicted wounds, has substituted a positive television advertisement for a negative one. 
In interviews, independent political consultants and some advisers to the candidates say the shifts are overdue. The consultants make some additional suggestions to the candidates for the closing weeks.
It is not enough, they argue, for Mr. Dinkins to offer himself as just another nice guy - everybody knows where they finish. He must paint Mr. Giuliani as a Reagan Republican whose philosophy goes against the grain of a city in which enrolled Democrats seem unusually united and outnumber Republicans 5 to 1. Dramatize the contrast by visiting the day care centers that would have been shuttered because of budget cuts by a Republican administration but were maintained by a Democratic mayor.
The consultants say Mr. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, still needs to reassure many voters that he has the heft to deal with urban crises. They applaud his recruitment of Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, to an economic advisory council and his appointment - premature, perhaps - of a transition team led by Nathan Leventhal, a former deputy mayor. But they bemoan his ducking of debates, as Mr. Giuliani did in the Republican primary, as seemingly arrogant.
Meanwhile, the Dinkins campaign must contain the hemorrhaging from its political wounds, the latest being the payment of $9,500 to a group headed by a self-described black nationalist, Robert (Sonny) Carson, ostensibly for a get-out-the-vote drive on Primary Day, and accounts of apparent discrepencies between the $1 million value Mr. Dinkins placed on his stock in a communications company and his sale of the stock to his son two years later in 1985 for $58,000. If he had undervalued the stock, he might be liable for state gift taxes.
Those controversies may represent Mr. Dinkins's greatest vulnerabilities. New Yorkers need no reminder that he would be the city's first black mayor, and while he won 3 in 10 votes among whites in the Democratic primary, the pool of whites is larger in the general election. Last week, Arthur J. Katzman, a Queens Democrat and senior member of the City Council, said he would not vote for Mr. Dinkins because ''he has got baggage around him that I can't tolerate,'' which he identified as Mr. Carson and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, among others. Moreover, the stock controversy revived memories of Mr. Dinkins's failure to file income tax returns for four years ending in the early 1970's. He later paid in full and blamed the lapse on negligence, but that may reflect on his ability to manage a $27 billion city budget.
The Giuliani forces, with the candidate himself a former Federal prosecutor and his campaign manager a tax lawyer, were trying to make the most of it. ''You have a pattern,'' said Peter Powers, the Giuliani campaign manager. ''He's not in control.''
After initial fumbling with the complicated accounting, Mr. Dinkins demonstrated coolness under fire during a news conference on Friday reminiscent of Geraldine Ferraro's interrogation over family finances after her nomination for Vice President in 1984. But what will register with voters: Mr. Dinkins's responses or the questions?
''I don't think this is fatal, but it makes it a very close race,'' said Meyer S. Frucher, a Dinkins adviser. ''Dinkins has been hurt, no question. But they haven't made Giuliani a viable alternative.''
Strapped for cash, Mr. Giuliani may not be able to keep his positive commercial on television. Can he afford not to? With scars still visible from his own self-inflicted wounds - among them, racial remarks by the comedian Jackie Mason, Mr. Giuliani's onetime ambassador to the Jewish community - he must broaden his appeal. Corruption might have been a better issue had Mayor Edward I. Koch been his opponent.
So Mr. Giuliani, the consultants argue, has to dramatize his municipal agenda and position himself as a renegade Republican. Rather than making President Bush's appearance at a Giuliani fundraiser last week the climactic moment of his campaign, he should instead call upon the President to sign legislation to provide Federal funds for abortions for victims of rape or incest. Is It Too Late? Is it too late for Mr. Giuliani to catch up? Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader and Giuliani adviser, likened the dynamics of the evolving campaign against Mr. Dinkins to Saturn's rings: ''The first is me and 40 others; then, the people who read three newspapers a day; the third ring is my mother, who reads The New York Post and watches the 10 O'Clock News. The question is, has the impact of the charges gone from the first to the third? I suspect, based on the polls, that it has not penetrated.''
That was last week, though, and, as Governor Mario M. Cuomo said, ''there's time for a few more swings in this race.''
Of the stock controversy, a sanguine Norman Adler, political consultant to the Teamsters union, which is supporting Mr. Dinkins, said, ''I just don't think this is a knockout punch.'' But, he added, ''Now, the question is, what else is there?''
Variables do emerge, some beyond a candidate's control. In the primary campaign, the murder of a black teen-ager by a gang of whites in Brooklyn was said to have solidified support for Mr. Dinkins. In 1969, when the city last elected a Republican, John V. Lindsay's victory was attributed to five M's: his weak opponents, Mario (Procaccino) and (John) Marchi; a visit by (Golda) Meir, the former Israeli prime minister, and the euphoria of the Moon landing and the Mets victory in the World Series. Mr. Giuliani's hopes seemed tied to the letter C: crime, crack, corruption, compassion, competence, character, color, Carson, cronyism, credibility and, most recently, cash.
Yet David Garth, a strategist for Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Koch, suggests that the winner may again be determined by an M-word.
''It's going to be the one who makes the fewest mistakes,'' Mr. Garth said.

HEADLINE: A Return to The Past in Austria's Alps

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL; HANS FANTEL writes on sound and video for The New York Times.

 BODY:
NOT many visitors to Salzburg realize that just a short drive south of the city, in Austria's Hohe Tauern national park, a unique project is underway. The Austrian Government has set aside a section of the park - dubbed Tauriska, after the region's ancient Celtic name - for an experiment in small-scale economic development.
Unlike national parks in Unlike national parks in the United States, Tauriska is not conceived of merely as a nature preserve. Although it lies in a spectacular and largely unspoiled region of the Alps, protecting the wilderness is not its only aim. Rather, the project fosters the folkways of the region and even promotes a distinctive local economy in balance with the natural environment.
''This is an inhabited park,'' explained Alfred Winter, commissioner of cultural affairs for Salzburg Province. ''The villages are as much part of it as the mountains and forests. After all, this place has been settled for more than a thousand years.'' 
Austria's national park consists of adjacent Alpine tracts administered separately by the provincial governments of Salzburg, Tyrol and Carithia. Tauriska is a special sector within the park, chiefly government-financed and concerned with cultural preservation. The Tauriska project, now in its sixth year, came just in time to save 10 colorful mountain settlements in a region roughly the size of the Berkshires region of Massachusetts. It can be traversed in about two hours and is home to a total population of about 35,000.
In recent decades, these ancient hamlets, many dating back more than 500 years, had declined in population as their younger people drifted to cities and factory jobs in search the kind of life they observed on television. Mountain farms, which once enlivened the echoing valleys with the gentle clanking of cowbells, all but disappeared.
But now this trend has slowed, and even reversed in some cases. Word has got around that the cities in the plain and their factories are not as inviting as they look on television, and quite a few younger villagers are staying or coming back now that Tauriska provides congenial forms of economic opportunity.
''In this town, we now again have families with several generations living side by side,'' said Otto Kaiserer, the mayor of Rauris, one of the main villages of the region. ''This provides a different atmosphere. We can feel the change. Everything holds together again.''
Economic opportunity has been created partly by the organized revival of traditional crafts, notably lace-making and embroidery, cabinetry and the making of painted peasant furniture, as well as fine hand-crafted ironwork. Some home distilleries have been restored to prepare their special kind of (perfectly legal) moonshine from local fruits and berries. One town, Hollersbach, has started growing medicinal herbs on a relatively grand scale, and the fragrant and colorful herb fields cover acres of valley bottom near the town's center.
These products are sold, mostly to tourists, at the local Heimatwerk shops, which are cooperative outlets for these small family enterprises. One of the best of these outlets is in Neukirchen, a village not far from Hollersbach, and there is a Heimatwerk even in Salzburg, right under the carillon in the Residenzplatz. In addition, the provincial government at Salzburg is making efforts to develop markets for these hand-crafted products through major department stores in several large cities. The trade supports apprenticeships for younger members of producing families that will assure the continuity of once-endangered crafts and skills.
The historic restoration of the villages provides local employment as well as an impetus to the revival of old trades. Many of the finest houses in towns like Rauris, Hollersbach and Neukirchen were built in the early 1500's, when they flourished as centers of Alpine gold mining. Having fallen into disrepair during the decades after World War II, they are now being authentically renovated. This calls for the skills of stonemasons, woodcarvers, ironsmiths, shinglemakers and restorers of frescoes, whose workshops are open to visitors. Even the asphalt of streets and sidewalks has been torn up and replaced with the traditional cobblestones. ''It all builds local pride,'' said Mayor Kaiserer of Rauris. ''And that's an absolute requirement if a town is to live.''
We approached Rauris by a serpentine road winding upward through a broad valley flanked by peaks as high as 12,000 feet. From a parking place at the a short walk took us to a small central square dominated by a Gothic church whose 13th-century murals have kept remarkably well in the clean mountain air - an unexpected art treasure in these rustic surroundings. Across from the church, a massive but surprisingly graceful stone house dates from about 1500. Its gabled roof is weighted with huge stones and the curiously angled bay windows blaze with geraniums. Recently restored, the building now serves as the town library and community center. Next to it, an inn of similar vintage, the Gasthof Grimming, serves meals under its ancient vaulting.
OPEN meadows surround the town, and marked hiking paths extend for many miles, offering splendid vistas and well-kept benches from which to enjoy them. Even strangers meeting on these paths exchange a cordial ''Gruss Gott,'' Austria's traditional salutation.
Despite the emphasis on tradition, visitors will find no trace of a museum atmosphere, no self-conscious imitation of the past. Rather, Tauriska is an attempt to create a vivid present within a preserved natural and cultural framework.
Nor is Tauriska planned purely as a tourist attraction. Naturally, everyone wants visitors to come, but not in the proverbial droves. Nobody wants these valleys turned into parking lots, or people bumping into each other on the hiking trails. And nobody wants big hotels crowding out the country inns - many of them old farmhouses with their original furniture - that now abound throughout the area.
The planners are talking of ''controlled tourism,'' with access sufficiently limited to assure tranquillity in town and even a feeling of solitude up in the mountains. One proposal, still under consideration, is a ban on motor vehicles in the narrow side valleys. Cars would be parked near the main road outside the narrow valleys, and from there visitors would be transported to the higher regions on horse-drawn farm wagons.
It is in the upper reaches of these valleys that nature conservancy takes over as the chief goal. Here, at the glaciers' edge, beneath the the mountains' icy peaks, the natural ecology remains undisturbed. Thanks to the Tauriska plan's rigorously enforced conservation measures Indigenous animals, from ibex to eagles, once rare, have now returned in encouraging numbers. The expanse of mosses in the highest ice-free regions, the flowering meadows reaching just above the tree line, and then the tall pines - all these are to remain pristine. Nearer the villages, barns and stables must adhere to traditional forms and materials. It has been suggested that during certain hours no sounds of machinery should disturb the stillness of the valley.
''At first the local farmers were all against it,'' said Mr. Winter, an athletic man in his mid 30's whose is the moving force behind the Tauriska project. ''They didn't want any constraints on the use of their property. But when they saw all the positive changes in the townships that had adopted the program, they changed their minds. They now realize that land values have risen as a result. No land is ever expropriated to create the park. All that is needed is acceptance of the idea and observance of the rules.'' And, after a thoughtful moment, he added ruefully: ''That's a tough notion to get across to independent mountain folk.''
The Tauriska program, is not just economic and ecological, Mr. Winter stressed. It includes the revival of folk music and festivals involving regional costumes and dances, along with the sometimes grotesque masks meant to frighten off evil spirits - a device similar in function to the hex-marks of the Pennsylvania Dutch.
At the same time, cultural contact with the larger world outside the valley is encouraged by concert series and theater performances, bringing in artists to perform in local churches and in splendid old buildings restored to serve as community centers. ''We don't want to isolate the population from the modern world,'' said Mr. Winter. ''We want them to take part in it, but on their own terms.''
He doesn't claim credit for the idea. The basic notion of reviving the economy and ecology of small towns comes from Leopold Kohr, a former professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Professor Kohr, a native of Salzburg who emigrated to the United States and now lives in London, believes that many of the social and ecological crises in the modern world are basically problems of scale and can be solved by a return to smaller, self-contained settings for human activity.
Tauriska is the first tryout anywhere for Professor Kohr's ideas. Visitors who are not too distracted by the splendor of the scenery or the charm of the towns can also observe what may prove to be an important social experiment.
 
VENTURING INTO ALPINE VALLEYS
 
Getting There
Tauriska comprises several separate valleys clustered in the part of Salzburg province called the Pinzgau. At its center lies the resort of Zell-am-See, which can be reached from the city of Salzburg in little more than an hour by going part of the way on the A 10 Autobahn to the south. Those who don't mind a more leisurely two-hour drive through the ragged limestone formations of the Salzburger Kalksteingebirge might opt for the older parallel road leading through the ancient town of Hallein. Zell-am-See itself looks like the setting for an operetta, with a rococo square, an early Gothic church, and a charming lakeside promenade. From there, Tauriska towns like Rauris and Hollersbach are within easy reach by car or bus.
 
Lodging
Rates are for double rooms. Travelers preferring to stay at a world-class hotel where English is spoken as a matter of course might check in at the elegant Grand Hotel (phone: 23880) whose spectacular location on a promonitory in the lake justifies room rates of about $150 for a room with bath and balcony. The simple, pleasant Hotel Kaiserhof (6216) run by Otto Kaiserer, mayor of Rauris, is a good example of local country inns. A room with breakfast goes for about $14 a person.
Accommodations in an old chalet full of rustic antiques can be found in Hollersbach at the Gasthof Kaltenhauser (81170) where a room with a balcony costs about $25 per person and offers a view of the church steeple against deep-green hemlock forests and white mountain peaks.
 
Dining
A meal at a local inn might consist of Bauernschmaus, the indigenous version of what is called choucroute garni in Alsace. It is a combination of mild, wine-cured sauerkraut, roast pork and sausage, usually served with dumplings. For lighter fare, there is always tender veal (Kalbsbraten) from the dairy farms or trout (Forelle) fresh from the local streams. For desert try Kaiser schmarrn (a fluffy pancake with plums) or a copious souffle known as Salzburger Nockerl, and finish the meal with a Kaiserbirn pear brandy or a Marillen-Likor - a fragrant distillate of apricots. Meals will run from about $12 to $30; the latter price should include wine and service.

Braniff Cutback: What to Do With Tickets
When Braniff Airways filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Sept. 28, it left a lot of customers wondering what to do with the tickets for their canceled flights. ''Technically the tickets are still valid until Sept. 27, 1990, but that doesn't help our passengers who have tickets to cities we no longer serve,'' said a Braniff spokeswoman. The airline, which had been serving 40 airports with 256 flights a day, now has only 46 flights to 11 airports.
Some other airlines, including Trans World Airlines and Continental, are accepting Braniff tickets when there are seats available on their own flights, but the conditions vary from airline to airline.
For people who want refunds, truth-in-lending laws offer some protection to those who paid by credit card. But those who paid by cash or check are now creditors of the airline and will have to file a claim with the bankruptcy court. 
According to information supplied to Braniff by the Department of Transportation, a person filing a claim should get a ''Proof of Claim'' form from a United States courthouse or a stationery store that sells legal forms. Keep one copy and send the original to the United States Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Florida, First Bankers Building, 135 West Central Boulevard, Suite 950, Orlando, Fla. 32801; reference case number 89-3325. If possible, a photocopy of the ticket should be enclosed.
There is no guarantee that payment will be made or, if it is, that it will be for the full amount. The process will take several months ''at least,'' the spokeswoman stressed. More information: 800-282-5586.
 
Artful Design On the Thames
Visitors to London this fall will find at least one new museum, the Design Museum, which aims to reunite the world of art and work by explaining the development of design in such items as typewriters, radios, cars, trains, bicycles and newspapers. The museum, sponsored by the Conran Foundation, which was established by Sir Terence Conran, the owner of furnishings stores, occupies a converted warehouse at Butler's Wharf on the south bank of the Thames across from the Tower of London.
The foundation says the museum's role is ''to promote an understanding of the contribution of commercial and industrial design to everyday life.'' Roller skates, computers on which visitors can design such products as toothbrushes, and exhibits tracing the design of goods from Wedgwood china to experimental video gadgets from Japan are among the exhibits.
The Design Museum (at Maguire Street and Shad Thames; telephone 403 6933) has a riverside cafe, library and lecture theater. It is open daily, except Monday, from 11:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M., and admission is about $3.20. The building can be reached by walking across Tower Bridge from Tower Hill Underground station on the north side of the river or by ferry from Tower Pier to Butler's Wharf. It is also close to London Bridge Underground station.
 
U.S. Warns Of Cuzco Peril
Visitors to the temples and other archeological sites at Cuzco, Peru, are warned in a State Department advisory not to wander far from well-traveled roads because of the possibility of violent crime. Tourists, the advisory said, have been robbed in Cuzco and on trains between there and the pre-Incan city of Machu Picchu.
In the last three years there have been several instances of sabotage against trains on the Cuzco-Machu Picchu line, including two that ''resulted in the injury and death of United States citizens,'' the advisory said. Thousands of tourists travel safely each year, the message added, but ''no security is provided along the route.'' It advised hikers to avoid the Inca Trail and said that those who did use it should travel in large groups with guides. Robberies, it said, were frequent and some victims have been seriously injured.
The State Department said that aside from anti-Government activity by two terrorist groups, a difficult economic situation has lead to increased crime in tourist areas. In general, road travel is not recommended.
The advisory listed several areas that should be avoided and pointed out that while other areas were considered relatively safe, conditions could change at any time. For this reason, American visitors should seek the latest travel information on arrival in Peru and register with the consular section of the United States Embassy in Lima.
 
Tall Ships In New Zealand
Sailors, from novice to experienced, can sign on to assist the professional crews aboard tall ships in New Zealand this winter. Voyages are of 3 to 16 days and nine itineraries between New Zealand ports. There will be 13 departures from Dec. 27 to Feb. 22. The program will coincide with New Zealand's 150th anniversary celebrations next year.
The oldest of the five ships in the package is Trade Wind, which was built in 1911 and has space for 10 guest sailors as well as the regular crew of 8. Spirit of New Zealand, built three years ago, is the newest ship. She has a crew of 11 and accommodates 42 passengers. Annette Wells of the Adventure Center in California, which is offering the program, said there were no private cabins or bathrooms. The guest sailors would share cabins and sleep in bunks, she said.
Participants can extend their stays to attend some of the anniversary events. One is the Commonwealth Games (for athletes from British Commonwealth countries) being held at various sites in New Zealand from Jan. 24 to Feb. 7. The expeditions range from $386 for three days afloat to $1,300 for 16 days. (Adventure Center, 1311 63d Street, Suite 200, Emeryville, Calif. 94608; 800-227-8747 outside California and 415-654-1879.)
 
U.S. Football In Dublin
A large contingent of football fans from Pennsylvania and New Jersey is expected to lead many more Americans to Dublin when the Rutgers University Scarlet Knights and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers kick off the second Emerald Isle Classic at Lansdowne Road Stadium on Dec. 2. A Massachusetts tour operator that is the official packager for the event is offering three programs that include game tickets.
A parade and a charity ball are among festivities being planned for the event, which is the last scheduled game of the season for both schools. The organizers of the Classic say 10,000 Americans went to Dublin for last year's game, which ended with a victory for Boston College over West Point. The event reflects the growing interest in Britain and Ireland of American football.
The three packages offered by Brian Moore International Tours (116 Main Street, Medway, Mass. 02053; 800-982-2299 or, within the state, 508-533-6683) include round-trip air fare from New York or Pittsburgh and game tickets.
Prices per person in double occupancy begin at $699 for three nights in guesthouses; $799 for a six-night self-drive plan with rental car and rooms in hotels or farmhouses, and $1,099 for a six-night bus tour, accommodations and some meals.
 
MALLETS SWING IN FLORIDA
At Wimbledon the grass courts are deserted, but in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., the ''Wimbledon of croquet'' begins tomorrow and continues through the finals next weekend. The national open singles and doubles championships will be played on the home courts of the United States Croquet Association at the PGA Sheraton Resort.
Ninety top players who have spent the summer qualifying in five regional championships will compete for the singles crown and a share of the $5,000 purse.
Johnny Osborn of the New York Croquet Club will try to regain the singles championship he held for seven years before losing it to Reid Fleming, a player based in Vancouver, in last year's final. Forty doubles teams will vie for the doubles title. Matches will be played Monday through Sunday, 8:30 A.M. to 6 P.M., on the five courts at the resort's Croquet Club. Admission is free.
A courtside luncheon with unlimited champagne will be held next Sunday in connection with the tournament to benefit the Croquet Foundation of America. Tickets are $25 a person.
The PGA Sheraton Resort (407-627-2000) describes its croquet complex as the largest in the Western Hemisphere.
The resort also has 5 golf courses, 19 clay tennis courts and a five-lane lap pool.

HEADLINE: WHAT IS FUKUYAMA SAYING? AND TO WHOM IS HE SAYING IT?

BYLINE: By James Atlas; James Atlas is an editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
THE YEAR 2000 FAST APPROACHES, and millennial doom is in the air. Global warming, nuclear proliferation, chaos in Eastern Europe. Even the notion of post is over. Post-modernism, post-history, post-culture (to borrow the critic George Steiner's term) - we're beyond that now. ''The sun is about to set on the post-industrial era,'' declares the economist Lester C. Thurow in The New York Times.
What follows post? Samuel P. Huntington, Eaton Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard, has a name for the latest eschatological craze: ''endism.'' The critic Arthur C. Danto theorizes on ''the end of art.'' Bill McKibben, a former staff writer for The New Yorker, issues a dire report on ''The End of Nature.'' Clearly, it's late in the day.
On the face of it, the lead article in the summer issue of The National Interest, a neoconservative journal published in Washington, seemed like more bad news. ''The End of History?'' it asked. The author, Francis Fukuyama, a State Department official, was unknown to the public, but his article was accompanied by ''responses'' from Irving Kristol, Allan Bloom, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and others notable for their gloomy prognostications. 
The magazine's readers were in for a surprise. What was Fukuyama saying? That the end of history is good news. What is happening in the world, claimed his eloquent essay, is nothing less than ''the triumph of the West.'' How else to explain the free elections in Poland and Hungary? The reform movement in China? The East German exodus?
In Fukuyama's interpretation, borrowed (and heavily adapted) from the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, history is a protracted struggle to realize the idea of freedom latent in human consciousness. In the 20th century, the forces of totalitarianism have been decisively conquered by the United States and its allies, which represent the final embodiment of this idea - ''that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy.'' In other words, we win.
Within weeks, ''The End of History?'' had become the hottest topic around, this year's answer to Paul Kennedy's phenomenal best seller, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.'' George F. Will was among the first to weigh in, with a Newsweek column in August; two weeks later, Fukuyama's photograph appeared in Time. The French quarterly Commentaire announced that it was devoting a special issue to ''The End of History?'' The BBC sent a television crew. Translations of the piece were scheduled to appear in Dutch, Japanese, Italian and Icelandic. Ten Downing Street requested a copy. In Washington, a newsdealer on Connecticut Avenue reported, the summer issue of The National Interest was ''outselling everything, even the pornography.''
''Controversial'' didn't begin to cover the case. Unlike that other recent philosophical cause celebre, Allan Bloom's ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' Fukuyama's essay was the work of a representative from what is often referred to in academic circles as the real world. This was no professor, according to the contributor's note that ran in the magazine, but the ''deputy director of the State Department's policy planning staff.''
It wasn't just the message, then; it was the source. Maybe there was an agenda here. . . . By mid-September, Peter Tarnoff, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, could speculate on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times that ''The End of History?'' was ''laying the foundation for a Bush doctrine.'' Not bad for a 16-page article in a foreign-policy journal with a circulation of 6,000.
YOU HAVE TO PASS THROUGH A METAL detector to get to Francis Fukuyama's office in the State Department, and the silver plaques beside the doors - INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS MATTERS, NUCLEAR RISK REDUCTION CENTER - confirm that this isn't a philosophy department. But the elegant private dining room on the 8th floor, overlooking the Potomac, could easily be mistaken for an Ivy League faculty club. Plush carpets, chandeliers, a sideboard out of Sturbridge Village, oil portraits of 19th-century dignitaries on the walls - an environment conducive to shoptalk about Hegel.
It's mid-September, and the arrival of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze for meetings with Fukuyama's boss, James A. Baker 3d, is less than a week away. ''It's a busy time,'' says Fukuyama, apologetically. Apart from assisting in the preparation of ''talking points'' for the Secretary of State, he's been besieged with telephone calls from book editors and agents eager to cash in on his famous article.
How does he account for the commotion? ''I don't understand it myself,'' Fukuyama says quietly, sipping a Coke. ''I didn't write the article with any relevance to policy. It was just something I'd been thinking about.''
He does seem an unlikely celebrity. (But so was Paul Kennedy. So was Allan Bloom.) His khaki suit has an off-the-rack look about it, and he speaks in a tentative, measured voice, more intent on making himself clear than on making an impression. A youthful 36, he emanates a professorial air - an assistant professorial air.
Fukuyama doesn't quite fit the neo-conservative stereotype. Whatever ideological direction he has gone in lately, he's still a child of the 60's. He belongs to the Sierra Club; he's nostalgic for California, where he worked for the Rand Corporation; he worries about pesticides in the backyard of the small red-brick bungalow in the Virginia suburbs where he lives with his wife and infant daughter.
''The last thing I want to be interpreted as saying is that our society is a utopia, or that there are no more problems,'' he stresses. ''I simply don't see any competitors to modern democracy.'' In short, he's a liberal neo-conservative.
Fukuyama grew up in Manhattan's Stuyvesant Town, a middle-class housing development on the Lower East Side. His father was a Congregational minister who later became a professor of religion, and Fukuyama's own direction in the beginning was toward an academic career. As a freshman at Cornell in 1970, he was a resident of Telluride House, a sort of commune for philosophy students; Allan Bloom was the resident Socrates. They shared meals and talked philosophy until all hours, living the good life Bloom would later evoke in ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' the professor and his disciples sitting around the cafeteria discussing the Great Books.
Fukuyama majored in classics, then did graduate work in comparative literature at Yale, where he studied with the deconstructionist Paul de Man (who would achieve posthumous notoriety when it was discovered that he'd published pro-Nazi articles in the Belgian press at the height of World War II). ''It was kind of an intellectual side journey,'' Fukuyama says.
After Yale, he spent six months in Paris, sitting in on classes with Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida, whose abstruse and fashionable discours would become required reading for a generation of American graduate students. Fukuyama was less than impressed. ''I was turned off by their nihilistic idea of what literature was all about,'' he recalls. ''It had nothing to do with the world. I developed such an aversion to that whole over-intellectual approach that I turned to nuclear weapons instead.'' He enrolled in Harvard's government department, where he studied Middle Eastern and Soviet politics. Three years later he got a Ph.D. in political science, writing his thesis on Soviet foreign policy in the Middle East.
Fukuyama's first job out of the academic world was at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. Then, in 1981, Paul D. Wolfowitz, director of policy planning in the Reagan Administration (and also a former student of Bloom's), invited him to join his staff. Fukuyama worked in Washington for two years, then returned to Rand.
For the next six years, he wrote papers for Rand on Soviet foreign policy, speculating on such weighty matters as ''Pakistan Since the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan'' and ''Soviet Civil-Military Relations and the Power Projection Mission.'' In ''Gorbachev and the Third World'' (published in the spring 1986 issue of Foreign Affairs), Fukuyama claimed that Soviet foreign policy was still expansionist, and that despite efforts to economize at home and act conciliatory abroad, Gorbachev was quietly ''trying to stake out a more combative position'' in client nations like Angola and Afghanistan, Libya and Nicaragua. The message of these heavily footnoted articles was clear: The cold war is still on.
Last February, shortly before he returned to Washington to become deputy to Dennis Ross, the new director of policy planning, Fukuyama gave a lecture at the University of Chicago in which he surveyed the international political scene. It was sponsored by his former professor, Allan Bloom. ''My whole life has been spent in organizations that prize technical expertise,'' says Fukuyama. ''I was anxious to deal with larger and more important issues'' - what Bloom calls ''the big questions.''
As it happened, Owen Harries, co-editor of The National Interest, was looking around for a think piece on the current situation - a piece, as Harries explains it, that would ''link history with the great traditions of political thought.'' Harries got hold of Fukuyama's lecture and instantly recognized that it was ''a provocative, stimulating essay, just what the times needed.''
HARRIES, A DONNISH, PIPE-SMOKING Welshman whose desk is piled high with books - he was educated at Oxford and was for many years a professor of politics - belongs to a type that exists only in Washington. Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic, calls them ''policy intellectuals.'' In New York, people talk about the latest issue of Vanity Fair; in Washington, they talk about the latest issue of Foreign Policy.
Some of these policy intellectuals are in government; Carnes Lord, the author of a highly regarded translation of Aristotle's ''Politics,'' is national security adviser to Vice President Quayle. Others are ''fellows'' or ''scholars'' at the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution. Often, they have grand titles; Michael Novak, for instance, is the George Frederick Jewett Scholar in Religion and Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. Many are fugitives from academic life. ''A lot of people around the office came up to me after the article appeared,'' Fukuyama says. ''Hegelians who hadn't gotten tenure.''
The political orientation is well to the right. ''We hold to a traditional view of foreign policy,'' says Owen Harries. And what does he mean by ''traditional''? ''The belief that power politics is still in business. A belief in the efficacy of force.''
The National Interest is clearly a well-heeled outfit. It's funded by the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, a prominent neo-conservative organization; the John M. Olin Foundation, established by a wealthy manufacturer who made his fortune largely in munitions, and the Smith Richardson Foundation -which, says Harries, ''supports a number of good causes around the place.''
The magazine's quarters, in a modern office building on 16th Street in Washington, are a far cry from the grubby cubicles one associates with political journals on the left (if there still are any). The floors are carpeted and the phones ring with a muted chirp. The elevator has piped-in Mozart instead of Muzak. Directly across the street, behind a high wrought-iron fence, is the Russian Embassy.
The National Interest, now four years old, is the creation of Irving Kristol - listed on the masthead as its publisher. His desk at the magazine is sort of in the lobby area; but then, he occupies many desks. Apart from his two magazines (he's also publisher of The Public Interest), Kristol is a distinguished fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Last year, he gave up his professorship at New York University and moved to Washington. New York was no longer the nation's intellectual center, he wrote in The New Republic a few months later, explaining his decision. The intellectuals had disappeared into the universities. The culture of Washington was just as ''nasty and brutish,'' in Kristol's Hobbesian view, as anywhere else. ''But there is one area in which Washington is an intellectual center, and that is public policy: economic policy, social policy, foreign policy, today even educational policy.''
Living in Washington doesn't make Kristol any less a New Yorker. The cigarette, the rumpled seersucker jacket, the shrewdly self-deprecating wit are more congenial to a seminar room at the City University of New York's graduate center on 42d Street than to a Washington think tank. Why did ''The End of History?'' make news? ''I'd like to think it's because my coming to Washington from New York has raised the level of discussion,'' Kristol says with a laugh. And Fukuyama's thesis? ''I don't believe a word of it.''
Neither did a lot of other prominent opinion-makers around town. ''At last, self-congratulation raised to the status of philosophy!'' sneered Christopher Hitchens, a Washington-based Englishman who writes a column for The Nation. ''The Bush years have found their Burke, or their Pangloss.'' For Strobe Talbott, editor at large for Time magazine, ''The End of History?'' was ''The Beginning of Nonsense.''
If it wasn't nonsense, Fukuyama's basic thesis wasn't exactly news, either. For months, conservatives had been gloating over the demise of Communism. ''The perennial question that has preoccupied every political philosopher since Plato -what is the best form of governance? - has been answered,'' wrote Charles Krauthammer in The Washington Post last March, before anyone had ever heard of Francis Fukuyama. ''After a few millennia of trying every form of political system, we close this millennium with the sure knowledge that in liberal, pluralist, capitalist democracy we have found what we have been looking for.'' Essentially, that was Fukuyama's message, but it didn't draw swarms of reporters to Krauthammer's door.
So how did ''The End of History?'' become such a big event? It was the Hegel spin that did it. Not only is America winning, Fukuyama claimed, but the flourishing of democracy around the world is the fulfillment of a grand historical scheme. The end of the cold war and the disarray of the Soviet Union reflected a larger process -the realization of the Idea. History, Hegel believed (or Fukuyama says he believed), ''culminated in an absolute moment - a moment in which a final, rational form of society and state became victorious.'' And that moment, it just so happens, is now.
A weird thesis, utterly speculative and impossible to prove. But ''The End of History?'' was a stylish performance, erudite and written with a rhetorical flair rare in the somber prose of Washington policy journals; it possessed intellectual authority.
Fukuyama's respondents greeted the piece with open arms. ''I am delighted to welcome G.W.F. Hegel to Washington,'' declared Kristol. Senator Moynihan, himself a Harvard government professor before he discovered politics, confessed that his grasp of Hegel was shaky; but he dusted off his European history, tossing in a few references to Marx and Rousseau. ''It is not often that one has the opportunity to argue about Hegel in The National Interest (or anywhere else, for that matter),'' noted the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, who is the wife of Irving Kristol. Soon after the article appeared, there was a conference held to discuss it at something called the United States Institute of Peace. Kristol, Himmelfarb and Krauthammer were in attendance, along with the Sovietologist Richard Pipes. The rest is . . . history?
IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE why Fukuyama's essay won favor among this community. It's not only the high-flown references to Kant and Hegel, not only the message that Western democracy beat out the competition. ''The End of History?'' has a polemical edge familiar to readers of ''The Closing of the American Mind.''
Like Bloom, Fukuyama doesn't have much patience for non-Western cultures. (''For our purposes,'' he writes, ''it matters very little what strange thoughts occur to people in Albania or Burkina Faso.'') And like Bloom, Fukuyama's no booster. The West isn't so hot either. At the heart of his critique is a veiled contempt for the very culture whose triumphs in the political sphere it purports to celebrate.
What distinguishes Fukuyama from the crowd of conservative pundits elated by Gorbachev's troubles is his curled-lip attitude toward the victorious party. Say the West has won, that fascism and Communism are dead, that no significant ideological challenges are on the horizon - then what? There's an ''emptiness at the core of liberalism,'' Fukuyama maintains. What does America have to offer? ''Liberal democracy in the political sphere combined with easy access to VCRs and stereos in the economic.'' The society Hegel envisioned at the end of history, a universal state in which the arts flourish and virtue reigns, is nowhere to be found. Instead we're stuck with a ''consumerist culture'' purveying rock music and boutiques around the world.
So the end of history may not be such a good thing after all. In fact, Fukuyama concludes, it will be ''a very sad time.'' Why? Because the meaning of life lies in the causes that we fight for, and in the future there won't be any. ''The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands.'' Put plainly, we're heading for a time of ''boredom.''
As a Washington cab driver said when I tried to explain why I was in town, ''Give me a break!'' Does Fukuyama really believe all this? ''I guess I prefer not to answer that,'' he said one afternoon, talking in his State Department office. ''Leave it ambiguous. All I can say is, if people can't take a joke. . . .''
That he meant to be provocative is obvious; but it's clear from his rational, erudite prose that he wasn't fooling around. As a political theorist, Fukuyama is more in the tradition of Bentham or Locke than of pop futurists like Alvin Toffler. ''All I meant by that last paragraph,'' he says, ''was that there's a tension in liberalism that won't go away. There are all kinds of reasons for being a liberal: the security and the material wealth it provides, the opportunity for spiritual and intellectual development. But it fails to address some fundamental questions. You know, what are the higher ends of man? Should we just be content with having secured the conditions for a good life, or should we be thinking about what the content of that good life is?''
IF LIBERALISM STILL has a few kinks to work out, Communism is finished, although ''there may be some isolated true believers left in places like Managua, Pyongyang or Cambridge, Massachusetts,'' writes Fukuyama with characteristic acerbity.
In Cambridge, the contempt is mutual. Even in that citadel of 1960's subversion, there aren't too many Communists left, but there is an inordinately dense concentration of people around Harvard Square who know their Hegel, and the summer issue of The National Interest sold out there virtually overnight. By and large, the Cambridge intelligentsia is dubious about ''The End of History?'' The distinguished Harvard government professor Judith N. Shklar didn't even have to read Fukuyama's piece in order to dismiss it as ''publicity.'' Her colleague Daniel Bell, who did, pronounced it ''Hegel at third remove . . . and wrong.'' (Bell's classic book, ''The End of Ideology,'' anticipated Fukuyama 30 years ago.) The historian Simon Schama, author of ''Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution,'' is more tolerant. Himself an idiosyncratic practitioner of the genre, he found the piece ''spirited and lively,'' but wonders how Fukuyama could have failed to address the revival of religious fundamentalism or the conflicts that could arise out of nationalism. ''It's more of a theological document, don't you think, a work of prophecy,'' he says. ''I mean, nobody really believes in the end of history.''
It's not too hard to think of scenarios that would spoil Fukuyama's end of history. Who's to say what would happen in the Soviet Union if glasnost and perestroika collapse? What new dangers might a reunified Germany pose? Or a newly industrialized China? And what about the nuclear threat? That would put an end to things, the political scientist Pierre Hassner observed, ''in a more radical sense than he envisages.''
Gertrude Himmelfarb's response in The National Interest was perhaps the most damaging refutation of all. To begin with, Hegel never said that history would end in a literal sense; it's a continuous process in which ''the synthesis of the preceding stage is the thesis of the present, thus setting in motion an endless dialectical cycle - and thus preserving the drama of history.'' And what about black poverty, the poverty of the underclass? asked Himmelfarb. In southeast Washington, where young blacks are dying nightly in the front lines of the drug war, history doesn't seem over; it seems to be just beginning. As Irving Kristol tartly put it, ''We may have won the cold war, which is nice - it's more than nice, it's wonderful. But this means that now the enemy is us, not them.''
Liberals complained that Fukuyama ignored the third world. Conservatives weren't too enthusiastic about his dour assessment of the winning team. Where is it written that government should provide for the spiritual needs of its citizens? Michael Novak wondered in Commentary. Democracy promises freedom from tyranny; it doesn't promise to make us happy. ''The construction of a social order that achieves these is not designed to fill the soul, or to teach a philosophy, or to give instruction in how to live,'' Novak wrote. Democracy isn't a required course; it's an elective.
ANUMBER OF COMMENTATORS have compared ''The End of History?'' to the famous article published by George F. Kennan in Foreign Affairs in July 1947 and signed with an anonymous ''X.'' Kennan's essay warned of Moscow's expansionist tendencies and called for a policy of ''firm and vigilant containment,'' thus supplying the term that would come to characterize America's foreign policy in the postwar era.
In an article in Policy Review last summer, ''Waiting for Mr. X,'' Burton Yale Pines, the magazine's associate publisher, called for an update. The cold war was over, Pines agreed; only what was the United States doing about it? How to deal with the turmoil Gorbachev's reforms have provoked? What should be our policy toward Eastern Europe? ''Needed, in essence, is another 'X' article,'' wrote Pines - an article that would encourage the United States to seize the initiative. Given this hunger for a sequel, it's not surprising that Fukuyama is being touted as our ''X.''
But is he? It's tempting to dismiss the whole thing as a media phenomenon. ''Each year needs a new sensation,'' says Daniel Bell. ''It encapsulates a mood that people feel and gives it a vocabulary.''
The practical consequences have been more difficult to measure. In the wake of Shevardnadze's visit, interpreters of foreign policy were busy scrutinizing speeches for evidence of endism. Did Fukuyama's article reflect President Bush's thinking? Was it a high-level policy paper in disguise? Senator Moynihan, for one, is skeptical. ''The minute you announce that the cold war has ended and history is over,'' he notes, ''a lot of people are going to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, we're out of a job.' '' If only for bureaucratic purposes, then, history is still a going concern. As for the article's actual influence, ''there's no connection between this piece and what the Government does,'' Kristol says flatly. ''No one in the Administration has read it.''
Everyone else has. Whether or not we've reached the end of history, we haven't reached the end of ''The End of History?'' The fall issue of The National Interest featured more ''responses,'' and you still can't pick up a magazine or a newspaper without stumbling across some reference to Fukuyama. ''I don't see much of a future for liberal democracy here in Peru's Shining Path country, but people would be pretty excited about VCRs if they only had electricity,'' the journalist Tina Rosenberg reported with laconic irony in The New Republic, writing from Baja Collana, Peru. ''But that's just one of those technological problems Francis Fukuyama says we'll have to spend our time grappling with now that there are no more ideological conflicts to keep us busy.''
In a way, though, the question mark in Fukuyama's title has pre-empted criticism. History, after all, is only a way of making sense of things. Human beings depend on narrative to create an illusion of order, the literary critic Frank Kermode has argued in his profound book, ''The Sense of an Ending.'' ''To make sense of their span they need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems.''
''The End of History?'' is a poem. (No wonder no one in the Administration has read it.) Even if we have come to the end of history, that may not be the end of it. As the historian Jerry Z. Muller observed, writing in Commentary last December, ''After late capitalism comes more capitalism.'' And after the end of history comes more history.
 
THOUGHTS FROM 'THE END'
The passing of Marxism-Leninism, first from China and then from the Soviet Union, will mean its death as a living ideology of world historical significance. For while there may be some isolated true believers left in places like Managua, Pyongyang, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, the fact that there is not a single large state in which it is a going concern undermines completely its pretensions to being in the vanguard of human history. And the death of this ideology means the growing ''Common Marketization'' of international relations, and the diminution of the likelihood of large-scale conflict between states.
This does not by any means imply the end of international conflict per se. For the world at that point would be divided between a part that was historical and a part that was post-historical. Conflict between states still in history, and between those states and those at the end of history, would still be possible. There would still be a high and perhaps rising level of ethnic and nationalist violence, since those are impulses incompletely played out, even in parts of the post-historical world. Palestinians and Kurds, Sikhs and Tamils, Irish Catholics and Walloons, Armenians and Azeris, will continue to have their unresolved grievances. This implies that terrorism and wars of national liberation will continue to be an important item on the international agenda. But large-scale conflict must involve large states still caught in the grip of history, and they are what appear to be passing from the scene.
The end of history will be a very sad time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns and the satisfaction of sophisticated consumer demands. In the post-historical period there will be neither art nor philosophy, just the perpetual caretaking of the museum of human history. I can feel in myself, and see in others around me, a powerful nostalgia for the time when history existed. Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its North Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once again.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong on Borrowed Time

BYLINE: By Margaret Scott; Margaret Scott is cultural editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review. She lives in Hong Kong.

 BODY:
EARLIER THIS MONTH, WHILE CHINA'S LEADERS WERE staging a grandiose celebration of their revolution's 40th birthday, thousands of somber Hong Kong residents gathered for a dreary commemoration of their own. Far from the fireworks display in Beijing, Hong Kongers huddled in a rainstorm near the bronze statue of Queen Victoria, singing patriotic songs and listening to mournful poems dedicated to those who died in Tiananmen Square.
Since the Beijing massacres on June 4, Hong Kong has become a city frightened of its future and obsessed with one date - July 1, 1997, when Britain is to return its colony to China. (Box, page 32.) The city of almost six million is increasingly torn between those who already have a foreign passport or can obtain one, and the 60 percent or so who cannot afford to leave or are unwanted elsewhere.
Hong Kongers are pursuing the possibility of flight with the same diligence they show in making money. Banks and financial institutions are concocting ways to snare passports for their senior staff. Smooth-talking representatives from Singapore, Fiji, Thailand, Canada come offering foreign travel documents - for a price. A glitzy shopping mall recently became the scene of a near-riot when some 30,000 people scrambled to get application forms for permanent residence in Singapore. Even American Congressmen such as Stephen Solarz have joined in, visiting the colony with proposals to admit more Hong Kongers to the United States. 
To Hong Kong's business moguls no survival scenario seems too farfetched: Some suggest moving Hong Kong to a spot near Darwin, Australia; others propose the west coast of Scotland; still others argue the United Nations should lease Hong Kong from China and turn it into ''the Switzerland of Asia.''
The mood of grim desperation is a far cry from the euphoria that engulfed Hong Kong before June 4, when crowds of close to a million jammed the streets in support of China's democracy movement. In late May, Hong Kongers held a jubilant fund-raiser for the students at the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club's Happy Valley racecourse. Wealthy entrepreneurs in Rolls-Royces, bankers, Queen's Counsels, students, secretaries and factory workers - all poured in by the hundreds of thousands to the ''Concert for Democracy in China.'' When the legend ''Chinese of the world unite'' flashed across the racecourse's vast video screen the cheers were deafening. After 12 hours, the scattered bins were full of red and green bank notes - about $1.5 million raised for the Chinese students. The mood was one of joyous hope: China would be reborn in Hong Kong's own image, and with time to spare before 1997.
But there was no rebirth in China, only tanks and gunfire and death. In Hong Kong that Sunday, mournful defiance reigned, and by day's end, hundreds of thousands of people had poured into the streets in protest. It wasn't long, however, before protest gave way to panic and, for many, a frantic search for a way out.
Now, more than four months later, Hong Kongers feel trapped between a looming Chinese motherland they cannot change and a departing imperial motherland - Britain -that is betraying them by pulling back the welcome mat from all but a select few. More than 45,000 emigrated from the colony last year and that number is expected to soar. But thousands of others, less wanted or less affluent, are searching for passports. They are British subjects, but London has made it clear that holding a Hong Kong British passport is not good enough for entry to Britain.
For Hong Kong's economy the situation spells danger. If Hong Kongers know they can gain asylum in Britain upon request, many, if not most, will stay in the colony and keep it prosperous. But if London keeps the gate closed to most, many will work full time seeking asylum elsewhere and the colony's economy will nosedive.
During the months since the Tiananmen massacre, the choices for Hong Kongers, especially the young, have begun to seem increasingly stark: Beg Britain for protection, or join the fight to change China. This choice gives expression to a fundamental clash of identities that is becoming ever more apparent in the city - a clash between British and Chinese Hong Kong.
HONG KONG THRIVED ON THE GREED of 19th-century opium traders and the dreams of Chinese fleeing the mainland.
Like San Francisco, Hong Kong was a place of hope and opportunity; it was built by Chinese immigrants who had found their golden mountain, and it grew under a colonial tradition of authoritarian rule.
It has been a winning combination, as anyone gazing down on the city from Victoria Peak can see. Once squat and concrete, Hong Kong is now a city of soaring, glass-sheathed skyscrapers. Looking over Victoria Harbor, the eye is inescapably drawn to a new addition reigning over the skyline: the Bank of China, a 70-story rocket of a building of silver glass designed by I.M. Pei. It is a testament to China's growing dominance in Hong Kong's economy.
A 1959 Life magazine cover story on the city quoted a British civil servant: ''Healthy neglect, that's what did it . . . . Leave the Chinese alone, I always say, and they'll muddle through. . . .''
What was healthily neglected was democratic institutions. The colony was ruled with the trappings of democracy but none of the substance. A Legislative Council meets inside a stately building wth a dome and Ionic columns, but only since 1985 has anyone run for office. And these elected members -24 of the 57-member body - are indirectly voted in by functional constituencies (one represents lawyers, another doctors and so on) with only about 60,000 voters out of Hong Kong's six million people.
It is the Executive Council, chosen by the British-appointed Governor (currently Sir David Wilson) and serving as his cabinet, that holds the real power. Sitting on this council as its most senior member is the standard-bearer of British Hong Kong: Dame Lydia Dunn. If, as the author Jan Morris has said, Hong Kong is the epilogue of empire, then Dame Lydia, the daughter of Cantonese emigrants, could be its heroine - though lately she has been playing the damsel in distress in her plea for the right of abode for Hong Kong's British subjects.
I met Dame Lydia in her elegant downtown office at John Swire & Sons - one of the British ''hongs,'' those huge shipping and trading companies born of empire and once the wellspring of the city's power. Thin, petite, immaculately tailored in a red suit, Dame Lydia is an executive director at Swire's - not quite a taipan, but close. With her taste for Chanel suits and her degree from Berkeley, she is the epitome of the Westernized Chinese. Her fair complexion and almond-shaped wide-set eyes are classic Cantonese. She switches easily from Cantonese (the mother tongue of 98 percent of Hong Kong's population) to English. Handpicked by the colonial administration as a rising political star, she was appointed to the Executive Council in 1982.
After the Beijing massacre, Dame Lydia remarked that at least Hong Kong could be consoled by its newfound sense of identity - a sense of unity forged, she said in her most soothing tones, by a recognition of just how separate, how different, Hong Kong is. Hong Kong's future thus depends on protecting that separateness, on insuring that the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's promise of ''one country, two systems'' actually comes to pass.
We met in a room paneled in blond wood and lined with portraits of past taipans. Shortly before, Dame Lydia had traveled to London to plead for British passports. (By 1981, Hong Kong residents had been stripped of their right to live in Britain, and their passports are now merely travel documents.) British newspapers, impressed with her determination, dubbed her ''The Iron Lady of the East,'' an Asian Margaret Thatcher. But when she appeared before Parliament's select committee on foreign affairs looking into the colony's future, the Iron Lady broke down and cried.
''I felt so humiliated,'' she told me. ''I was born under British rule and I grew up as a Hong Kong Chinese - Chinese but different. We want to stay that way, that is what this whole thing is about. But I keep conjuring up this image of proud Hong Kongers shuffling around the globe, searching for a place that will take them in. I feel so humiliated.''
Dame Lydia's British Hong Kong crowd has spawned the ''Honor Hong Kong'' campaigners, an assortment of taipans and Hong Kong Chinese business tycoons who have hired advertising agencies, including Saatchi & Saatchi, to convince Britain's powerbrokers to grant Hong Kongers right of abode. One full-page ad shows a young Chinese businessman in an impeccable pin-striped suit. ''There's no point in being almost British,'' the copy reads. All he wants is insurance for the future in the form of right of abode. ''Otherwise, being almost British is like being homeless.''
So far, the ''Honor Hong Kong'' campaigners have been dismally unsuccessful. The Britain they identify with worries that a huge influx of Hong Kong Chinese would upset Britain's fragile racial balance. In late September, British Foreign Secretary John Major told the United Nations General Assembly that only those ''essential to Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity'' could be resettled.
Just who that includes the Foreign Secretary did not make clear. The current gossip in Hong Kong has it that Britain has postponed revealing this crucial bit of information in order to shield the Prince and Princess of Wales from any embarrassment when they visit the colony next month. When it comes, most expect the news will be bad -current estimates of the total number to be admitted hover around 200,000, probably limited to those with ''special skills,'' with independent wealth or with British spouses. When these terms are spelled out, the reaction in Hong Kong will likely be bitter.
For those who advocate an autonomous Hong Kong, it is a shame that the Crown Colony is separated from mainland China only by a filthy creek called the Shenzhen River. They would prefer an ocean - so that Hong Kong could be, like Singapore or Taiwan, a Chinese place that is not China. Because China is so close, autonomy will require a deft balancing act: encouraging economic interdependence, which is growing by the day, while discouraging political meddling.
''China will let Hong Kong survive not because it is just or right but because of our economic value,'' says Dame Lydia. Under the Britsh, she continues, ''We have been told to stay out of politics and if we did we could make money. We did.'' Up to Tiananmen Square, China's commissars had expected to inherit the same deal.
There once was reassuring talk within the colonial bureaucracy of political reform of a more democratic Hong Kong; but when China voiced displeasure, the talk became muted, the timetable vague. Indeed, it was those who inhabit Dame Lydia's Hong Kong, espousing allegiance to British values, who since 1984 have been the most chary of democracy.
After 1984, the British and Chinese governments cleverly invoked patriotism to sell the Joint Declaration and blunt any talk of democracy. Deng's ''opening'' was going so well, Hong Kong's people were told, and your return to the Chinese motherland will only help his reforms. But it is a delicate affair - don't rock the boat. Democracy is not what China wants; don't displease China.
But then the students took over Tiananmen Square and laid a new claim on Chinese patriotism. Now, Dame Lydia and others have begun to wonder whether the pace of reform should not pick up again. After all, Dame Lydia says, democracy is a useful ingredient in restoring confidence.
''Democracy is now the most important safeguard we can give to the majority who cannot leave,'' she says. ''They need to feel that they have leaders who represent their interests.'' In July, the legislature agreed in principle to a proposal that would create, for the first time, some directly elected legislative seats in time for 1991.
Dame Lydia's separate Hong Kong is the product of empire, but there are others who evoke a different future, the one encapsulated on the videoscreen that day in May: ''Chinese of the world unite!'' It is the call of those who believe that Hong Kong, as the capital of overseas China, must fight to free the motherland.
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE humid August evenings, and the 34-year-old Francis Lau was settling in for another night at Hong Kong's mock Tiananmen Square. With his blue jeans, daypack and wire-rimmed glasses, Lau, a high school teacher, looks the part of the former student activist he is. Crowded around him in a tiny encampment outside the turnstiles of the Star Ferry that crosses Victoria Harbor were banners, wall posters caricaturing Chinese leaders (Premier Li Peng as a bulldog with a spike collar, Deng Xiaoping withdrawn under his turtle shell), tables strewn with pamphlets, and a tape recorder endlessly playing the Internationale. Overhead a banner proclaimed: ''Chinese in Hong Kong and China should come together to fight for democracy to the end.''
Lau and his friends were exchanging tidbits on the latest victims of China's purge. No one talked about passports here. ''The right of abode will only help the elite,'' Lau told me, rearranging a stack of placards. ''Why beg from a colonial government? Our future is with the Chinese students. We both need democracy. Hong Kong's only future is a democratic China.''
Like Dame Lydia, Lau and his colleagues invoke unity -but the unity of patriots fighting against China's current rulers. Li Yi, editor of the journal The Nineties, offers this comparison: Just as the overseas Chinese bankrolled Sun Yat-sen's revolution against the Manchus, earning the sobriquet ''mother of the revolution,'' today's overseas Chinese must be the ''mother of counterrevolution,'' rescuing Wuer Kaixi and other leaders of the student movement and supporting them in building a democratic movement outside China.
This call plays on the deeply ambivalent patriotism of overseas Chinese, most of whom are refugees from communism. For them, Deng's reforms had held only a fragile appeal - one demolished along with the goddess of democracy. But though they have broken ranks with Deng Xiaoping, the Hong Kong patriots remain loyal to Chinese civilization by holding aloft the students, their values and their goals, as ''the real China.''
One who heeded this call was Jimmy Lai, who stole across the border from Canton when he was 11 and now, at 40, owns Giordano, a clothing conglomerate. ''I was Chinese but could never relate to China,'' he told me, sitting in his stylish, high-tech office in Kowloon. ''I lived with that typical contradiction of overseas Chinese. But the students in Tiananmen changed all that.''
Lai didn't join the sit-in at the Star Ferry but he was part of the euphoric crowd at the racecourse and took part in the series of huge marches through Hong Kong's streets. ''I cried everyday,'' he said. ''I'm lost in it. Us Chinese, we are like the Jews. We are waiting for a messiah. The students are our messiah.'' Once he made money for the sake of making money, but ''now I make money with an ideal.''
His company printed 23,000 T-shirts for rally organizers and then began making shirts emblazoned with the faces of student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi, Chai Ling, Wang Dan. He also donated more than $60,000 of his own money.
LATE IN AUGUST, Lau and his friends abandoned their miniature Tiananmen. They had stayed long enough, Lau told me, to show Beijing they were not afraid. It was now time to move into an office and continue the crusade for democracy in China.
Not far from Jimmy Lai's chic office, in a room borrowed from the Professional Teachers Union on the ninth floor of the Good Hope building, members of the executive committee of the Hong Kong Alliance for the Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movements in China conduct long, arduous meetings, discussing what to do next. Martin Lee, a Legislative Council member, a barrister and a Queen's Counsel, along with another local legislator, Szeto Wah, formed the alliance in those heady days of late May, joining together 200 local groups. But now it is dissolving into factions.
One of the most tangible disagreements debated around the square conference table is what should be done with the alliance's $2.5 million treasure chest -money collected for the students but never dispensed. But on this question hinges much broader ones: Can Wuer Kaixi and his small band of exiles bring on a revolution? Can Hong Kong really change China? And, even if Hong Kong could be the mother of counterrevolution, is it worth the risk? Isn't it inviting China to snuff the colony out?
In July, Wuer Kaixi and others, including the exiled former journalist Liu Binyan, founded the Democratic China Front in Paris. Their largest benefactor was the alliance, which paid for Wuer Kaixi's plane ticket and put up the money to furnish the Maison Chinoise de la Democratie, the Paris office donated by the designer Yves Saint Laurent. So far, the alliance has helped more than 60 dissidents flee China. If these dissidents wind up as the heirs of Sun Yat-sen, Hong Kong is well on its way to being their sponsor.
Beijing bristles at this prospect, branding the alliance a bunch of subversive counterrevolutionary plotters. On July 21, an article in the People's Daily, China's official newspaper, attacked the alliance for ''declaring that they would make Hong Kong the front line for supporting subversive activities and help supply weapons and ammunition to counterrevolutionary rebels!''
In public, Lee and the alliance insist they will not be intimidated, that they will continue to support the democratic movement; besides, they say, guns were never part of their intended largesse. But behind closed doors at the Good Hope building, matters are not so clear.
Democracy Tides, for instance, was the alliance's newspaper, until it printed this: ''We must become the bridgehead of the democratic movement. . . . As for the idea of one country, two systems and 50 years of autonomy, that idea has been destroyed. . . . '' Some alliance members thought this was too provocative; Democracy Tides is now an independent publication.
The more aggressive alliance members, which includes those who tended the tiny Tiananmen, believe it is a waste of time to worry about Beijing's reaction. For them, the Joint Declaration has been rendered worthless; they are convinced that no paper treaty will stop the People's Liberation Army. And they view the right-of abode campaign as the great escape. Instead, they say, they will stand by Hong Kong's ''real'' people, those who cannot afford to flee or have nowhere to go. Yes, Hong Kong needs democracy, they say; but, more important, China needs democracy.
The more moderate alliance people, including Martin Lee, concentrate on what needs to be done in Hong Kong, now. They demand that the Basic Law - Hong Kong's miniconstitution, now being drafted by a special committee chosen by Beijing - insure that the territory's judiciary will remain independent; that Hong Kong's political reforms be accelerated so that by 1997 the entire legislature is directly elected, and finally, that Hong Kong's future chief executive be directly elected come 1997, rather than appointed by Beijing. Most important perhaps, they demand that the Joint Declaration be renegotiated to bar the People's Liberation Army from Hong Kong - a demand that Beijing has already denied.
Is reforming Hong Kong more important than reforming China? Or is it the other way around? In the Good Hope conference room, the debate continues, week after week. Lee, whose father was a general in the vanquished Kuomintang army of Chiang Kai-shek, argues that fighting for democracy does not preclude fighting Britain for right of abode; as he sees it, Hong Kong citizens need all the protection they can get from the current Chinese state. Francis Lau and others consider it somehow dishonest to fight for British passports; how, they ask, can you claim to be fighting a revolution against Beijing and then ask for an escape clause in case things get rough?
THERE ARE PLENTY of people, Dame Lydia among them, who consider the alliance a dangerous outfit that is undermining Hong Kong by confronting China. If Hong Kong doesn't want interference from China, then Hong Kong can't interfere in China either. She has a point; but what constitutes interference?
For instance, is the effort to record and preserve the history of the student movement interference? Right after the massacre, people in Hong Kong began compiling videotape collections of news footage to be smuggled into China. (One woman I know bought a kung fu movie, replaced the movie with a news video and carried it over the border.) Hong Kong students gathered outside the train station to offer China-bound passengers neatly prepared sets of news clippings, asking them to tuck them in their bags and distribute them at their journey's end.
In Hong Kong, photography exhibits, a huge audio-visual show called ''The Awakening,'' a new dance performance entitled ''Hellscreen'' -all commemorated the student movement and the crackdown. Professors and lecturers at Hong Kong University have painstakingly compiled a record of what happened the night of June 3-4 as well as a list of intellectuals and students who have been arrested. Another group of writers and film makers have created the Democracy in China Publication Fund to finance scholarly books on the student movement.
Are such efforts interference in China's internal affairs? Beijing says they are.
There are pessimists who say that, in any case, the chances are slim that any of this will survive. Lynn Pan, a writer who lives in Hong Kong, refers to the city's new breed as ''Treaty-Port Chinese,'' pointing out the similarities between the modernized, comfortable Hong Kong Chinese and the educated, professional types who lived in Shanghai before the 1949 revolution. They only lasted one generation, she says, and then they were wiped out or emigrated. She thinks the same thing will happen in Hong Kong.
DOWN THE BLOCK from where Martin Lee and the alliance debate tactics, in Mong Kok, one of the most densely packed urban pockets on the globe, Samuel Poon and some neighbors gather at a tea shop after work. Another immigrant from across the border, Poon, a burly man of 45, has worked in a textile factory for 20 years; he has watched his two children grow up and Mong Kok evolve from a maze of squatter's huts to tenements to high-rises. Before June 4 he never thought about emigrating; now he calls it his impossible dream.
''I feel trapped and afraid,'' he says. ''I came to Hong Kong to get away from the communists. And now they are coming. Before, I thought they had changed, but now I see they haven't.'' He repeated this to his friends in Chinese. Everyone nodded.
He and his friends know of the activities of the alliance from Hong Kong's newspapers and from television. I asked him if he thought the alliance represented his interests. As a Chinese, he said, he approves of what they are doing, but as a Hong Konger, he is afraid of China's reaction.
''I support the students. I support democracy,'' said Samuel Poon. ''But what can we do? Hong Kong is powerless.''
 
1997, AND AFTER
On July 1, 1997, Britain will return Hong Kong to China, which will govern the former colony as a ''Special Administrative Region.'' Under this arrangement, Hong Kong is to enjoy ''autonomy'' that will be maintained for at least 50 years. The Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, signed by Britain and China in 1984, sketches out the terms of that autonomy.
 
Defense
Beijing may send troops into Hong Kong ''for the purpose of defense,'' but these forces, according to the Joint Declaration, ''shall not interfere in the internal affairs'' of the city.
 
Economic System
The Joint Declaration states that Hong Kong's ''previous capitalist system and life style shall remain unchanged for 50 years.'' It stipulates that ''the socialist system and socialist policies shall not be practiced'' in Hong Kong, that private property shall remain legally protected and that Hong Kong's government shall retain the power to set its own economic policies and to enter into trade agreements as ''Hong Kong, China.''
 
Political Structure
Hong Kong's government will be composed of Hong Kong residents and headed by a chief executive ''to be selected by election or through consultations held locally'' and to be ''appointed by the Central People's government.'' Other top officials ''shall be nominated by the chief executive'' and ''appointed by the Central People's government.''
 
Law & The Judiciary
The ''laws previously in force in Hong Kong . . . shall be maintained, save for any that contravene the Basic Law,'' the latter being Hong Kong's miniconstitution, which a committee selected by Beijing is drafting. Hong Kong's legislature will be able to enact laws but must report them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in China. There will be a new court of last appeal; its judges will be appointed by the chief executive.
 
Taxes
Hong Kong's government will raise its own taxes, devise its own budgets and spend its own public funds independently of China. China will not be allowed to levy taxes in Hong Kong. - MARGARET SCOTT

HEADLINE: NOTED WITH PLEASURE

 BODY:

The Dazzle of Evil
 Nothing is more fascinating than the failings of great artists. This summation of Louis-Ferdinand Celine is from ''Danube'' by Claudio Magris (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).
 Celine let himself be dazzled by the revelation of evil. He listened to the voice of degradation, said Bernanos, like a confessor in a slum quarter; but he did not have the ability, unlike some of the old father-confessors, to take a nap between one penitent and the next, weary of the reiteration of predictable sins: he failed to see the stereotyped banality of evil. Like other French writers of his generation, who thought that they could echo Gide in saying ''J'ai vecu,'' he sought for ''life'' without suspecting the megalomania of such a pretension. By bawling at the top of his voice, as he himself wrote, he thought he was defending a virginal, unsophisticated innocence of the ego. He prided himself contemptuously on not being a clerk, as if that ought to guarantee him some sort of special authenticity, and as if all Hemingway's brawling ought, a priori, to be more poetic than Kafka's office routine. 
 
Is Art an Honorable Discharge?
 Evelyn Waugh was such an embarrassing soldier that the British Army gave him a special leave, even though there was a war on, to go home and write a novel. This is from ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War'' by Paul Fussell (Oxford University).
 Pronounced ''unemployable'' soon after Crete, Waugh was granted a prolonged leave to write Brideshead Revisited, an absurd anomaly, to be sure, but under the circumstances the handiest way of removing him, with his satirist's sharp tongue, from contact with troops. Finally, he accompanied Randolph Churchill on an error-studded mission to Yugoslavia, which began with an airplane crash, from which Waugh miraculously escaped little damaged, and ended with comic misapprehensions on both sides as Waugh tried earnestly to explain to the Pope the dangers to the Church posed by Yugoslavian Communists but got in return His Holiness's ''English parrot-talk of how many children had I'' and the usual handful of blessed rosaries to take home.
 
On the Peninsula of Regret
 It sometimes happens that angry old women are full of a furious, wrinkled poetry. Here's one who has transplanted her quarrel with life to Florida, where she feels nothing but impatience for the other expatriates. This is from ''Rosa,'' a novella in ''The Shawl'' by Cynthia Ozick (Knopf).
 She had nothing in common with them. Old ghosts, old socialists: idealists. The Human Race was all they cared for. Retired workers, they went to lectures, they frequented the damp and shadowy little branch library. She saw them walking with Tolstoy under their arms, with Dostoyevsky. . . . They were from the Bronx, from Brooklyn, lost neighborhoods, burned out. A few were from West End Avenue. Once she met an ex-vegetable-store owner from Columbus Avenue; his store was on Columbus Avenue, his residence not far, on West Seventieth Street, off Central Park. Even in the perpetual garden of Florida, he reminisced about his flowery green heads of romaine lettuce, his glowing strawberries, his sleek avocados.
It seemed to Rosa Lublin that the whole peninsula of Florida was weighted down with regret. Everyone had left behind a real life. Here they had nothing. They were all scarecrows, blown about under the murdering sunball with empty rib cages.
 
The Overflow of Poetry
 Robert Frost's talk was almost as famous as his poetry. In ''Robert Frost Himself'' (Braziller), Stanley Burnshaw tells us what it was like.
 And now he had started again, the one-way speaker nobody wanted to stop: taking us off into talk of people, books, events, speculations, tragedy, fortune, marking each with a word, a quip, a comment brief or long, with an obbligato of tone and gesture none might forget. His listeners were part of this presence in a bond of voice, tone, bodily motion, easeful-to-taut gaze of the eyes, between the poet who spoke and the one or the few who were there. Tape recordings could hardly give a sense of the humor or earnestness, of the shifting rhythms, the mimicking phrases . . . with their unmistakable messages. Now I was borne on a wave of friendliness flowing steadily - the low-pitched voice: soft, beguiling, bluff, mocking, brusque, as the thought required.
 
The Upside-Down Cake of Culture
 Some travelers come home with fond souvenirs and others bring back mostly ironies. This is from ''Harp'' by John Gregory Dunne (Simon & Schuster).
 East and west, I wonder how the local intelligentsia feel about being trotted out to meet the visiting firemen from America. The conversations are generally impenetrable. ''I in Los Angeles once,'' my host said in Jogjakarta. ''You in Los Angeles once?'' I replied, falling into a kind of makeshift pidgin. I was eating pineapple upside-down cake, the dessert I was given every time I had dinner with Indonesians; it seemed the local idea of an Occidental delicacy. ''Where you in Los Angeles?'' ''Manhattan Beach in Los Angeles.'' ''Really?'' ''You know Manhattan Beach?'' ''My cousin lives in Manhattan Beach.'' I felt like a tennis player trying to keep the rally going. ''First cousin?'' ''Second cousin.'' ''Ah, second cousin.'' Then wild whooping laughter. ''Second cousin,'' he repeated.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Churches as Builders;
A Struggle Over Sites in the South Bronx

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN the waning days of the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, it is still uncertain whether a housing production program that could bring Nehemiah-style one-family houses to vacant, city-owned land in the South Bronx will ever get started.
The city has offered sites for about half the 1,500 houses that South Bronx Churches would like to build. But the plan, with a formal memorandum of understanding waiting to be signed, has been sitting with the group since August with no sign of a decision. Speculation is widespread that the organization is holding back in hopes of getting a better reception for its program in the next administration.
But that seems doubtful because the principal leaders of nonprofit assisted-housing development in the South Bronx over the last decade feel that the Nehemiah approach uses too much land to accommodate too few people of a single, and low, income level. Their preference is for mixed-income, higher-density development. 
Nevertheless, major sites have been offered, including a cleared urban renewal tract at Prospect Avenue and East 163d Street about the same size as Site 404, the 4.35-acre cleared urban renewal plot near the Hub, the central business district at East 149th Street and Third Avenue, where South Bronx Churches had hoped to start its program.
These efforts come on top of many additional difficulties in transferring the production concepts of the Nehemiah program to the South Bronx. Site preparation costs are much higher than they are in the flat open land of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, where the Nehemiah plan made its name with I. D. Robbins as builder and the Levittown approach as model. The public investment per housing unit is much higher in the Bronx, which argues for more intensive re-use of the land.
Another problem lies in the nature of South Bronx Churches itself as a nonprofit housing producer. It is led by clergymen without a housing background and community organizers with a major voice in policy decisions. For housing expertise, it places full reliance on the outspoken Mr. Robbins. After he publicly called Abraham Biderman, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, ''a liar,'' Mr. Biderman refused to deal with him directly. That has not hastened the arrival of a Nehemiah program in the South Bronx.
The positions and tactics of South Bronx Churches are influenced also by James Drake, a 52-year-old Industrial Areas Foundation staff member whose career as an organizer includes eight years as administrative assistant to Cesar Chavez, the farm labor organizer in California.
According to Mr. Drake, if South Bronx Churches had an ''ironclad'' agreement from the city that the offered sites indeed would be available in accordance with the schedule the city specifies, ''I think we could start building.'' He also objects to language in the proposed memorandum of understanding that would oblige South Bronx Churches, if it signs, to support to development of Site 404 under the New York City Housing Partnership program.
Mr. Robbins, for his part, says he is not confident he can assure the organization that he can deliver houses at the prices he promises if he must depend on the availability of dispersed sites not already under the city's control. The goal is to sell houses for $42,500 to buyers, building them for $57,500 with a $15,000-a-home city subsidy.
But the basic problem is density and housing mix. Extended too broadly, the densities that the Nehemiah plan espouses are too low to satisfy local leaders' interest in gradually rebuilding, at least partly, the area's decimated population. The South Bronx may never become the crowded metropolis it was in 1950, but neither is it going to shrink away to a suburb of one-family homes.
THUS the sites must be chosen with care, saving for higher-density use, and also middle-income use, those locations where they are appropriate and the market will support them.
In some ways the problem is exactly the opposite of the one William Levitt faced when he built Levittown. The essential fact after World War II, when veterans and their families were thirsting for new low-cost homes, was that a huge middle-income demand for housing already existed in his suburban market. In the South Bronx, that market must be nurtured back to existence.
It is the siting issue that has attracted most attention. Some of the supporters of the Nehemiah effort in the South Bronx feel that the Koch administration reneged on a promise to provide Site 404. Last April more than 5,000 people turned out to a rally to hear the administration castigated for its decision to award the land to a private builder to produce three- and four-story town houses under the New York City Partnership program.
CITY officials say that Site 404 never was promised, formally or informally, to South Bronx Churches. The Rev. John L. Heinemeyer, pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church and former chairman of the South Bronx Churches housing committee, said that ''we proposed it and it was not countermanded or denied, but it would be unfair to say it was formally offered to us and taken back.'' The Rev. Bertram Bennett, current chairman of the committee, also said that ''no city official ever said that Site 404 would go for Nehemiah housing on a sole-source basis.''
What does seem plausible is that the city administration was goaded by the Nehemiah initiative and the powerful church support it engendered to push into construction land that it might have preferred to hold in inventory for future midrise development. More recently, it had been discussed by planning officials as a possible ''showcase'' site for Melrose Commons, an effort to develop a wide area of underdeveloped land west of Third Avenue extending to the middle-income Concord Village development.
This is a long-term project, involving heavy site acquition and preparation costs, needing environmental and public land-use review. Site 404 was never shown on maps of Melrose Commons, however. It can be redeveloped without the planning and environmental reviews needed for the Melrose Commons project.
The written offer of alternative sites and the proposed memorandum of understanding was sent by Mr. Biderman, the housing commisioner, to Mr. Heinemeyer in August. The commissioner said that sites sufficient to start 159 homes by December would be granted, that sites for 450 more houses would be available for construction by December 1990, and that action would start promptly on the urban-renewal acquisition process to acquire still more sites.
For Site 404, the Koch administration, backed by Borough President Fernando Ferrer, has chosen a typical Housing Partnership density of 57 units to the acre. There are to be 251 housing units, mostly in three-story masonry buildings, with two-bedroom apartments on the first floor and three-bedrooms on the second and third. The mix is 72 two-bedrooms, 155 three-bedrooms and 24 one-bedrooms. Onsite parking is be provided for 50 percent of the units.
The builder, the Briarwood Organization, is an experienced company based in Bayside, Queens. Vincent Riso, the president, said that two-bedroom units would sell for $68,000 and three-bedrooms for $76,000. The one-bedrooms will sell for for $45,000. Construction is to start in the spring.
The units are targeted for buyers with incomes between $22,000 and $32,000 a year, Mr. Riso said, which is close to the average incomes of Nehemiah buyers. As a rule, buyers' ability to meet the down payment and cover all the closing costs are the crucial factors in eligibility, and the housing is targeted to meet the conditions of the market where it is built. According to the city, the average income of current Nehemiah buyers in Brooklyn, based on mortgage documents, is $31,000.
Housing built under the Partnership's program typically has densities of 30 to 60 units an acre. Ironically, even these densities 15 years ago would have been derided by community officials as exemplary of the ''planned shrinkage'' doctrine that housing officials once put forward as the policy that should guide new development planning.
The most extreme example of low-density Bronx development was the original Charlotte Street project of Edward J. Logue, with six houses to the acre, spacious lawns and yards and white picket fences. The Nehemiah density is higher than that at about 20 units to the acre, but well below the existing Bronx zoning.
Since last year the over-all planning issues have been explored by a housing and neighborhood task force of the New Directions for the Bronx project formed by Borough President Ferrer and Community Board 3. Its report is being written by William B. Shore, senior vice president of the Regional Plan Association.
The 45-member task force is chaired by Genevieve S. Brooks, executive director of MBD Community Housing Corporation, a major nonprofit housing sponsor. The task force advocates densities of 60 to 100 units to the acre for Melrose Commons.
One-family houses built at large scale at low densities are too wasteful of land, said Ms. Brooks. ''We would be foolish if we did that,'' she said. Moreover, the same moderate-income level of buyer that is reached under the Nehemiah plan can be reached in other higher-density home-building programs, she said.
''The task force is quite clear that they want to bring middle-income people into the Bronx and keep them there,'' Mr. Shore said, ''and there should be much more mixed-income development. There should also be a higher density than is now being built on vacant land.''

HEADLINE: A Skyscraper-High Office Space Surplus

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
WITH office construction running at high levels at a time when New York City and its suburbs are struggling through an economic downturn, experts say the region is confronting the largest office space surplus in more than a decade.
The surplus, reflected in vacancy rates nearly twice as high as during the early 80's, seems certain to grow before it starts to be absorbed; studies show that the same industries that had been the region's fastest-growing office tenants earlier in the decade have been thinning their employment ranks.
Manhattan brokerage houses, banks, advertising agencies and insurance companies are cutting costs deeply, reorganizing and laying off workers. In the suburbs, where a wave of corporate relocations had been supporting a real estate boom, hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and management purges have left huge blocks of office space vacant.
Analysts expect demand to weaken further in some parts of the region's service-oriented economy. The Oct. 13 stock market plunge served as a reminder of the volatility of trading and employment on Wall Street. But beyond that, the experts say, many small and middle-sized companies in the city and its suburbs are planning to leave. 
''The key growth industries of the 1980's are now growing at a snail's pace, if at all,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, New York Regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. One result, he said, was a ''churning real estate market'' in which many businesses are looking for lower-cost or more technologically advanced offices, but adding little to the overall demand for space.
The impact of job losses on demand for office space is shown by the kind of arithmetic being done these days by real estate brokers. With each office employee estimated to need 250 square feet of space, the loss of 23,000 jobs recorded by Mr. Ehrenhalt's bureau at New York City banks and brokerage houses between October 1987 and August this year translates into a demand loss of 5,750,000 square feet of office space. That is the equivalent of five of the large buildings now going up in midtown Manhattan.
Even without the economic slowdown, analysts say, the torrid pace of commercial construction in Manhattan would have led to a temporary surplus. The Manhattan boom was prompted by by zoning incentives - allowing larger buildings than are normally approved in West Midtown - that expired in May 1988. The zoning incentive deadline prompted the construction of 16 high-rise buildings with more than 9 million square feet of rentable space, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate concern. It said ten of the buildings are complete but 38 percent vacant and six are scheduled for completion by the spring.
OVERALL, vacancies in modern, well-located buildings are running at 13 percent in Manhattan, and from 18 percent to just under 28 percent in the region's suburban corporate centers, according to several studies by real estate companies.
''For most New Yorkers this is just fine,'' said John Dowling, Cushman & Wakefield's executive vice president. For companies planning to expand in the region, he added, conditions in the commercial real estate market ''are like motherhood.''
The high inventory of vacant commercial space is good and bad news for the regional economy. On the one hand, with developers and landlords struggling to rent out space, banks, pension funds and other large lenders are worried that some builders will be forced into bankruptcy. On the other hand, with rental rates flat or declining, many companies are looking at large blocks of space and the region may be regaining some of the corporate cachet lost since the stock market collapse of 1987.
Competition for large corporate tenants is intense. One developer, William Zeckendorf Jr., attracted three major tenants - Ogilvy & Mather and NW Ayer, the advertising agencies, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the law firm - by making them limited partners in Worldwide Plaza, his huge complex of offices, condominiums and retail space that takes up a full bock bounded by Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 49th and 50th Streets.
Cushman & Wakefield said the average rent in midtown Manhattan is $40.20 a square foot, up 75 cents from a year ago, and downtown rents average $34.77, down 93 cents from a year ago. And many owners have been offering tenants as much as a year's free rent and extensive interior renovation to meet their needs.
''There are very good real estate deals to be had in New York,'' said Gene Croisant, executive vice president of RJR Nabisco, the diversified tobacco and food company, which announced in September that it was moving its headquarters and 100 top executives from Atlanta to a high-rise on Avenue of the Americas at 52d Street. Its move bucks a trend of the last 20 years in which dozens of large, diversified corporations have moved their headquarters away from Manhattan. RJR Nabisco will occupy three floors of a building vacated last year by J. C. Penney, which moved its headquarters to Plano, Tex.
Analysts say they do not expect many moves like that of RJR Nabisco, but the real estate industry is rife with expectations that several large leases will be signed over the next six months, principally by New York City companies planning to consolidate now separate operations in new, state-of-the art offices.
News America Corporation, the publishing company; Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm; Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and Kidder Peabody, the securities firms, and Chemical Bank are reported to be looking for new headquarters in Manhattan. Indeed, executives say that if commitments are made by all the large shoppers currently in the market, more than 20 million square feet of offices - more than the entire inventory of most large cities - would be filled by new tenants.
''We are playing a game of musical chairs, waiting for the music to stop and a few big chairs to be filled,'' said Bruce Eichner, a Manhattan developer who is seeking tenants for a high-rise office building he is completing on Times Square. ''At this point we are all looking for lead tenants, but just watch what happens after the first two or three big deals are announced. You will see an awful lot of activity.''
One area of robust demand for space has been among foreign corporations, many of which have had small offices in the New York region for decades but are now consolidating and expanding.
''New York is the place where markets operate and the place one has to be,'' said Melissa Wall of Midland Montagu, the third largest bank in Britain, which this year moved its American headquarters and 500 workers to three floors of City Spire, a new tower on 56th Street west of Avenue of the Americas. The company had been running its national operations, which are involved in currency trading, commodities and other financial markets, from three smaller Manhattan offices and one in San Francisco.
Although Manhattan's vacancy rates are far higher than in the early 80's, they are not as high as during the fiscal crisis of the 70's, when dozens of large employers fled and nearly 20 percent of the city's newest and most conveniently located offices were empty.
NOR is the surplus throughout the New York region as severe as in some parts of the Sun Belt, where a wave of construction in suburban corporate areas in the mid-80's led to a glut. Cushman & Wakefield said several areas had vacancy rates above 25 percent, including the suburbs around Houston, Austin and San Antonio, Tex., Newport Beach, Calif., and Boca Raton, Fla.
Demand for New York City offices, like the city economy itself, began surging in 1978 and cooled in some industries by 1985. As Manhattan vacancy rates shrank below 5 percent from 1978 to 1982, landlords were able to raise their rents fourfold, from an average of $10 a square foot to $40, a rate that has changed little since 1982.
Some experts maintain that higher vacancy rates are a healthy development because of the changing character of the city's and the region's economy. There is a greater dependence on fast-changing, technologically advanced industries like securities trading, consulting and professional services - industries that go through wide cycles of profitability and employment - and some vacancies are necessary as a cushion. When these industries enter periods of rapid expansion, the experts say, it will be necessary to have vacant offices complete and available for rent.
''It used to be that vacancy rates normally ran at 5 or 6 percent, and at 11 or 12 percent people got very upset,'' said William Wheaton, a real estate economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Now it's a different market. Owners are a bit worried, but nobody expects things to cave in.''
Nonetheless, Mr. Wheaton said the vacancy rate in New York City is too high for a period of sluggish economic activity. He added that it would grow higher - perhaps as high as 15 percent - before it begins to reverse.
David G. Shulman, director of real estate research at Salomon Brothers, said that 6.3 million feet of new office space would be completed in midtown Manhattan over the next two years and that this was twice as much new space as could be absorbed. A result, he said, is that vacancy rates will swell throughout the city as tenants are drawn away from established buildings in lower Manhattan by landlords aggressively marketing their new midtown space.
''Underlying demand is just too weak'' for all of the new construction, he said.
Executives say many companies are certain to reduce their employment levels. In a survey of 600 executives who control ''middle market'' companies in the region - those with annual sales of $10 million to $250 million - Bank Leumi Trust Company found that most were pessimistic about economic prospects. The bank, which released its survey results in September, said 23 percent of the respondents planned to move their companies out of the region over the next five years. The price and availability of office space was not cited as a major factor, but drug abuse, crime, high taxes and high housing costs were among their biggest problems pointed to by the executives, the bank said.
One problem peculiar to some of the region's business centers is that their corporate real estate - much of it built for companies that left Manhattan in the 70's and early 80's - was designed to meet needs of individual companies looking for something different from a routine, big-city office environment. When those companies left or reduced their employment, as many have, it has sometimes been difficult to find others to fit the same space.
''There are a bunch of Taj Mahals out there,'' said Mr. Shulman.
HARDEST hit has been Fairfield County, which in the 1960's and 70's became a magnet for large corporations, including more than a dozen of the nation's 500 largest companies. Now, huge blocks of the same corporate space are for rent.
One example is in a lush residential section of Greenwich, Conn., where the headquarters built in the early 70's for the American Can Corporation has been nearly vacant for more than three years. American Can sold off its manufacturing businesses, became a much smaller company specializing in financial services, changed its name to Primerica Corporation, and vacated most of the headquarters by 1986. Greenwich officials have denied repeated requests to set aside their zoning rules that allow only one corporate tenant in the building.
In Stamford, Conn., the Singer Corporation, dismantled after a hostile 1988 takeover, has left a gleaming corporate headquarters building vacant. And in Danbury, Conn., where the Union Carbide Corporation became a corporate pace setter in the early 70's by erecting a circular, glass-enclosed headquarters - somewhat resembling a space station dropped in the woods - brokers have been scrambling to find corporate tenants. Union Carbide has vacated large blocks of space in its headquarters since its 1984 disaster in Bhopal, India, and a corporate restructuring.
Many other suburban corporate installations have been vacated, leaving the office vacancy rate in Fairfield County at 27.6 percent as of last June, according to Rostenberg-Doern, a real estate brokerage based in Stamford, Conn., and White Plains that publishes a semi-annual real estate report. The surplus is the largest in the New York region and one of the largest in the country.
In New York City, where most of the current surge of office construction is in midtown Manhattan, intense competition for tenants has prompted a northerly migration from Wall Street and other parts of lower Manhattan. A result is a growing surplus of downtown space, particularly blocks suitable for law firms, small brokerage houses, consulting organizations and other medium-sized Manhattan companies.
''Downtown has lost its middle market,'' said Maurice D. Solomon, executive vice president of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage based in Manhattan. An analysis by Cushman & Wakefield found that in midtown the vacancy was 13 percent, the same as at the end of 1988, but that in downtown it was 13.6 percent, as opposed to 11.9 percent at the end of 1988.
Much of this is attributable to the retrenchment throughout New York City of industries that had been leasing vast blocks of office space during the region's economic boom earlier in the decade. One such industry is banking, which entered a period of consolidation and layoffs even before the stock market collapse of October 1987. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in an analysis of New York City, said bank employment, which had been as high as 172,600 in August 1986, has been declining steadily. Banks in the area employed 162,400 this August, it said.
Wall Street employment has shrunk sharply since the 1987 market debacle. The analysis found 147,500 employed in August in securities and commodities brokerages, down from 162,400 in August 1987.
One industry that continues to expand is legal services, with law firms in the city growing, merging and expanding their business with clients around the world. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said 75,400 people were practicing lawyers or employed by law firms in August after a steady expansion throughout the decade. The industry now employs almost 30,000 more people than in 1980, according to the analysis.
But the advertising industry, another of the city's engines of economic growth in the early 1980's, has been buffeted by mergers and layoffs in the last four years. Advertising agencies employed 39,500 in August, down from a peak of 41,500 in August 1985, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Gazing Into the Economic Crystal Ball

BYLINE: By Jon F. Weinstein; Jon F. Weinstein is a Hauppauge executive and was a delegate to the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business.

 BODY:
THE bad news: The Long Island economy faces trouble. The good news? We should start thinking about making some changes in our regional economy. While the Island has long-term strengths, the time to deal with a future of stress is before a storm.
This newspaper and daily life recount the grim realities: accumulating garbage, exploding taxes, paralyzing traffic, fragile defense jobs, lack of affordable housing, massive electrical costs and a worker shortage. Long-term solutions of these and other major problems will help to solve remaining ones. However, if we do not re-examine how we do business and conduct our local economic lives, solutions will not be enduring; they will be Band-Aids. 
Big business and bigness itself are not completely negative phenomena. Many functions can best be performed on large scales; big business breeds major technological developments as well as the ability to do great things that smaller organizations cannot easily accomplish. But bigness can become a mind set. ''Long Island will grow if we get more big companies here,'' boosters say, or, ''Long Island is big - big business, big projects, big bucks -and that's how it will stay big.'' These are short-sighted beliefs. Before those who represent big interests feel that this is a rank condemnation of growth and large size, don't.
There is need and room for both large operations and dispersed, innovative, smaller ones. We should plan to down-size in order to up-size our quality of economic and environmental life. We need service, specialization, innovation, and a gradual diminution of what Paul Hawken in ''The Next Economy'' calls the intermediation of economic life.
Great size and distance from human efficiency often go hand in hand. Depersonalization and inefficiency based on lower-incentive environments are often bred by massive institutions. Likewise, innovation flourishes in a small field. A National Science Foundation study showed that small companies produce 24 times as many industrial innovations as larger firms do. Research and development is big on Long Island: our efforts must uplift and promote small R & D shops.
Between 1972 and 1982, over two-thirds of the new jobs in the United States were created in companies with 20 or fewer employees. Since Long Islanders are both critical and service-conscious, small can be better. Smaller companies can better respond to a changing economy. It is fun to crystal-ball-gaze. When I do, I see the following economic shifts in Long Island's future:
Medical research: We already have both a technologically and intellectually rich base. The future demands new medical hardware, and ''peopleware'' as well. Long Island should take the lead in developing a broad range of mechanical as well as human service medical support that we require for the next century.
Aerospace: New fighters and more old ones are important. However, the future challenge in aerospace will come in the form of rehabilitating older aircraft and developing ''smart'' systems for use by a group of military and civilian workers needing sharper training tools.
Waste management: Some call it ''garbagecare.'' Smaller organizations can aid localities in dealing with a new generation of waste disposal needs.
EducationaL development: Despite the high test scores we run up, schooling is in trouble on Long Island, as it is all over. Home-based, freelance and innovative educational tutoring and curriculum development can be a vital industry.
Housing rehabilitation: Barring miracles, no major expansion of affordable housing is foreseen. Therefore, revamping and rehabilitating existing structures to address new living needs will likely be a big business on Long Island.
Alternative energy technology: From cutting electrical use to alternative sources, energy will be a linchpin issue on Long Island. The most innovative and entrepreneurial among us will develop responses to our inadequate energy supply that will likely be our burden for the next half century.
From home-based mental health services to innovative defense contracting and a huge host of roles in between, companies and organizations that will produce and distribute in newer, more streamlined and individualized ways will cause truly constructive growth on Long Island.
The Regional Plan Association recently estimated that the Nassau-Suffolk population would jump by about 224,000 between 1987 and 2005. Vehicular registrations are projected to jump even more. A shift to smaller organizations will allow localities to tame is traffic. By doing this, we alter traffic patterns and garner more breathing space.
E. F. Schumacher wrote in ''Small Is Beautiful'' that ''wealth, education, research . . . are needed . . . for civilization . . . what is most needed today is a revision of the ends which these means are meant to serve.''
In the next century, development of smaller, more responsive and innovative businesses that respond to specialized community needs can help us cope with the future.

Statistics in Support Of the Indefensible

 BODY:
The adage ''Statistics don't lie, statisticians do'' came to mind when I read That Irving Gerber feels comfortable living in ignorance of economic realities is his prerogative. However, selling his ignorance to others is, in his own words, indefensible.
Let's give Mr. Gerber the benefit of every doubt (including the assumption that his statistics are accurate). His citations fail to substantiate his point that better education can be had for a fraction of its current cost. For instance, he criticizes the Oceanside district for having three assistant superintendents for 5,000 students where it ''used to have 10,000 children and one superintendent.'' 
When did that district have 10,000 children and one superintendent? 1929? 1945? 1962? How many buildings did the district maintain to house 10,000 students and how many now? How many of the current students require special services not formerly performed but now mandated by the state, which cost money and require coordination and supervision? Finally, no mention is made of whether the students of Oceanside are performing better, worse or the same as they did in the good old days, whenever they were.
Mr. Gerber also states that Bayport lost 1,400 pupils in 10 years, yet doubled its budget. Mr. Gerber, does it cost you the same to live as it did 10 years ago? Has your electric, gas or water bill increased? How about your food bill or the cost of getting to and from school? It is beyond dispute that the cost of these necessities have skyrocketed. Schools, like other entities, are not immune to economic fluctuations. Given his admirable desire to improve our schools, how would Mr. Gerber propose to maintain quality, if not to at least maintain the former status quo he thinks so highly of?
Would Mr. Gerber be willing to kick in 10 percent of his pension to help keep our schools afloat instead of burdening the ''poor taxpayers'' who don't even have the benefit of any pension plan to look forward to in retirement, but who have children in school now?
Mr. Gerber says, ''we are paying for a pig in a poke...to satisfy the power lust and prestige needs of school superintendents and school boards.'' Being a retired principal of the illustrious New York City school system (and who could ever question the efficiency and economy of that system, of which Mr. Gerber himself is a product), could he cite any functionary of our educational system who has chosen his lot for its ''glamour appeal'' instead of for the intrinsic value of having a say in the care and nurturing of our children? Would he ever have tolerated denying students the necessities, regardless of cost increases? I should think not.
Finally, while Mr. Gerber magnanimously recognizes that teachers are ''professionals'' deserving of the salary increases they have fought for and won, he has arbitrarily designated a $40,000 or $50,000 ceiling, and no more than cost-of-living increases, on what those professionals should be allowed to earn.
In support of this argument, he asserts the inanity that teaching has long been equated with poverty in our history and our ''pedagogues can hardly cry poverty'' now. However, Mr. Gerber neglects to mention that teachers' starting salaries remain well below that of other professionals, and that the ceiling he espouses may generally be reached only after teaching 20-odd years in the same district and/or earning the equivalent of a Ph.D. in education.
In fact, teachers are now required to acquire a master's degree within five years of graduating from college merely to continue to pursue their career. Does a mere 4 or 5 percent increase on a starting salary in the low $20,000 range realistically reflect not only the cost of living, but the cost of financing the undeniably high cost of becoming a teacher? Does 8 percent? Isn't a 25-year veteran entitled to earn more than a pittance?
The statistics Mr. Gerber ignores are infinitely more telling than the ''facts'' he cites as to why costs have increased. While excess spending may exist in some school programs, and overactive egos may affect an occasional superintendent or board member, Mr. Gerber's accusations beg the very issue of running schools.
Where does Mr. Gerber sugest that schools begin? Reduce the already deficient supply of teachers by returning them to subsistence wages? Stop providing heat or nutritious lunches or bus services, while making children travel twice as far to sit in overcrowded classrooms? Cut back on textbooks and supplies?
The cost of keeping a school on par with its own performance of 10 years ago has become very expensive. We cannot wish away today's high costs by clicking our ruby slippers together three times and repeating, ''There's nothing like the old days.''
There is no Yellow Brick Road leading to an educational Emerald City. If you want quality, you have to pay for it, and I can think of no better place to splurge than on the future.

HEADLINE: Many Issues Neglected In Race for Governor

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
AS it enters its final weeks, the campaign for governor is attracting notice as much for what the candidates are not talking about as for what they are.
In addition, the campaign's negative tone is raising concerns that voters who are not registered Democrats or Republicans may be turned off and stay home on Election Day.
''Some people are beginning to feel this could be one of the lowest turnouts in history,'' said Richard Roper, the executive director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University. ''The candidates are not presenting themselves in a way that will entice voters to come out.'' 
Besides electing a governor when they go to the polls on Nov. 7, voters will pass on the merits of five referendums, involving $590 million in bond issues, and will decide which party will control the 80-member State Assembly for the next two years. The Assembly races take on added significance in light of the 1990 census because of the Assembly's role in Congressional redistricting that will follow the census.
In their television commercials and in their two televised debates, Representative Jim Courter, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, and Representative James J. Florio, his Democratic rival, have attacked each other in personal terms.
Mr. Florio has accused Mr. Courter of lying, of prejudice against homosexuals and of failing to quickly clean up toxic waste on property he owns. Mr. Courter has accused Mr. Florio of accepting contributions from a labor union once controlled by the mob, of interceding on behalf of people in trouble with the law and of countenancing questionable financial deals made by some former associates in Camden County.
Taking a page from Gov. Thomas H. Kean's 1981 campaign book but perhaps failing to read the final chapter, Mr. Courter has signed a pledge not to increase the income tax or sales tax in his first term. Mr. Kean promised not to increase the two taxes and pledged to try to reduce the sales tax. But within a year he signed increases in both taxes to close a budget deficit of several hundred million dollars.
The two candidates take different positions on auto insurance and on abortion. Mr. Courter supports deregulation of the insurance industry, and Mr. Florio favors tighter controls. Mr. Florio supports a woman's right to choose an abortion, and Mr. Courter opposes abortion, except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother's life is in danger.
But aside from discussing those issues and a few others like the environment, the candidates have not provided the public with much information on pressing state concerns like AIDS, affordable housing, urban revitalization, welfare reform, job training and health care.
Mr. Roper said some of those items have become grist for the debates in the form of anecdotes - Would you leave your child in a classroom with a child who had AIDS? - but were not discussed in a more substantative way, for example, What do you plan to do to meet the growing problem of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in a state with one of the highest rates of AIDS-related health problems among children in the country and the fourth highest incidence of the disease?
''I've seen some position papers by the candidates in forums before special-interest groups,'' Mr. Roper said, ''but the general public does not participate in the policy arena, and the people expected to vote are being left out.''
 
Role in Redistricting
The approach of the 1990 census gives the Assembly races additional significance. New Congressional districts based on population changes will be drawn by the Legislature and approved by the Governor. When one party controls both houses and the governorship, the new map invariably includes districts fashioned to give the controlling party maximum advantage in subsequent Congressional races.
The last two maps, after the 1970 and 1980 censuses, were challenged in court, and the final redistricting plans were dictated by a Federal court.
Republicans have a narrow majority, 41 to 39, in the Assembly and must retain control to have a hand in designing the map that will go to the Governor. Democrats control the Senate and will do so when the redistricting bill is drafted. Mr. Florio has been pictured as the front-runner in the gubernatorial race for most of the campaign, which has heightened the importance of the Assembly races for the Republican Party.
The executive director of the State Republican Committee, Peter Verniero, has said that the party could lose two Congressional seats if both houses and the Governor are Democratic and if the new map they draw up survives a court test. The current Congressional delegation comprises eight Democrats and six Republicans.
 
Approval Sought for Bonds
In the public questions on the ballot, voters are asked to approve the issuance of $590 million in bonds to finance a variety of land acquisition, construction and grant programs. The first question calls for $300 million to acquire land for conservation and recreation and to preserve farmland.
The second question seeks permission for the state to spend $125 million to improve state and community-based centers for the developmentally disabled and the mentally ill, and to build additional corrections centers.
The third referendum would provide $50 million for low-interest loans and grants to local governments to upgrade storm-water systems and to prevent local sewers from overflowing into state waterways.
The fourth question asks authorization to spend $115 million to repair state, county and municipal bridges and to acquire railroad rights of way.
The last question does not call for new spending but asks permission to expand the purposes of the 1981 and 1986 hazardous waste discharge bond acts, to allow money already allocated to be used for projects to protect underground drinking water supplies.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
To Challenge Top Students, Academies Are Needed

BYLINE: By Robert F. Guarasci; Robert F. Guarasci lives in Fort Lee.

 BODY:
AT a time when other states are moving aggressively to provide challenging opportunities for their best and brightest high school students, New Jersey is lagging behind.
Since the beginning of this decade, at least 17 states have established specialized academies for students who excel in science and math. At these schools, students are taught by scientists and other highly trained instructors and are offered courses like astrophysics, genetics and biotechnology. They are able to work with sophisticated equipment, including state-of-the-art computers, and in many cases are linked with mentors at companies who provide them with expert and practical guidance. 
New Jersey, however, has refused to build specialized academies for our top students. The State Department of Education has instead preferred to focus its efforts on encouraging each local school district, of which there are more than 500, to devise and implement its own advanced curriculums, based on a district's unique circumstances and needs. It's a policy that, while good in some ways, doesn't go far enough in addressing the needs of the state's most outstanding students.
It's easy to agree with the basic thrust of the department's policy. It probably is best, as they maintain, for each individual school district to create whatever programs it feels are needed for its students. And if every district had the talent and the resources to establish its own truly advanced curriculums, there would be no problem. But this is not the case.
While some school districts, like Paramus and Tenafly in Bergen County, do offer their top students advanced science courses, not all do. Similarly, some schools like Fort Lee High School, my own alma mater, have programs that link gifted students with mentors to allow in-depth study in a particular area of interest. But again, not all districts offer programs like this.
Bergen County is also the site of the state's most comprehensive and encouraging attempt to provide gifted students with superior instruction. Planners from a number of the county's school districts have developed a groundbreaking concept to share resources among all of the county's schools.
Part of this effort will be a new facility in Hackensack called the Academy for Advanced Science and Arts, and its objective will be to offer challenging coursework to qualified Bergen County students. It's a real plus for those who live in Bergen, but students in the state's other 20 counties are not as fortunate.
The problem, of course, is that unless a student happens to live in a place that offers the appropriate coursework, that student's needs are not being met. Though there is a chance that a student in this predicament might be able to attend classes at a local college or perhaps special summer programs like the Governor's School in Math and Science, these opportunities are limited and not available to everyone. And so the fairness gap exists. The remedy, I believe, is simple. The state should act quickly to build a centrally located campus of specialized academies for our best and brightest high school students. Most of the other states have limited their efforts to math and science academies, but New Jersey should go even further. Our campus should contain several academies that would address the needs not only of students skillful in math and science, but also of students who are interested in careers in government, the arts and other fields.
Critics are certain to point out drawbacks. Some might cite the cost of such an undertaking. It doesn't have to be prohibitive. Let's interest the leading corporations in this state, as well as civic- minded benefactors, in sharing in the cost. Additionally, school districts that send students to this academy might help to defray costs by paying tuition for each student they send. And perhaps bonds could be issued to help cover land acquisition and construction costs.
Local school district officials might fear that their best students would be taken from them. That might be true, but our real concern ought to be for our students' potential and not for a particular district's scores or statistics.
If the academy is of the boarding variety, as it is in nine other states, some educators and parents might worry about a teen-ager growing up away from home. But there's no reason why students couldn't return home often enough, especially if the academy is located centrally, to maintain close contact with family and friends. And perhaps the programs could be designed to accept students for one or two years, rather than for the entire four years of high school.
In truth, the establishment of a campus of specialized academies for our most gifted high school students would not supersede or undermine current policy, only complement it. Let each district continue to do all it can to reach the greatest number of its top students, but let's also have a campus of specialized academies that would bring together our most outstanding students, who, with their parents, would choose to enroll in them.
It's ironic that a state that's been leading the way in its introduction of progressive educational initiatives should fall behind other states on a matter as important as this. The consequences of inaction for our students and our economy are too great. We simply cannot in good conscience deprive generations of future students of the chance to develop their talents to the fullest. And if we do, every one of us will eventually pay the price.

HEADLINE: Opposing a Raise For Federal Judges

 BODY:
I was intrigued by Federal Judge Harold A. Ackerman's responses to questions concerning the pay increase issue for Federal judges, in a recent New Jersey Q & A. Judge Ackerman's reasons for supporting a raise for the judiciary were at least more substantive than those provided by President Bush and Chief Justice Rehnquist.
As much as I respect Judge Ackerman for his 34 years on the bench, the last 10 as a Federal district judge, and for his obvious dedication and love for his work, I feel compelled to take exception to some of the arguments he uses to justify a raise for Federal judges.
His main argument for the judiciary is that inflation has eroded the base pay of the justices. Is inflation any less eroding of the income of the 98.6 percent of the American people who earn less than the current $89,500 received by Federal judges and members of Congress? 
The same holds true for educating one's children. With college tuition rates increasing at twice the inflation rate, everyone is having difficulty paying for children's education.
As for Federal judges leaving the bench in droves, the average vacancy rate for the Federal bench is 35 to 40 seats a year. That translates to a 5 percent turnover rate, as opposed to a 15 to 20 percent turnover in the private sector.
There are over 700,000 lawyers in the United States, of whom about 750 are Federal district or appeals court judges. With such a huge pool of legal talent to choose from, it is difficult to imagine there would be any problem in finding qualified replacements. Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said the Constitution is what the judges say it is. But it's the Federal judges, not the Supreme Court, who have the greatest influence on how the Constitution is interpreted. The Supreme Court hears only about 150 cases a year, while the inferior courts pass judgment on thousands of cases a year.
This is all the more reason why we have to change the method of selecting Federal judges from that of a patronage political plum system to one that seeks the most qualified and indiscriminate in terms of political affiliation, ideology, race and gender. Only then would I be willing to listen to arguments about qualifications and the dispensing of equal justice for all.
There are those who seek election to Congress and appointment to the Federal bench as springboards to the lures of the lucrative salaries offered by the private sector. Would Federal judges have the same value to the private sector had they not first obtained Federal judgeships? I wonder how justice is served when a Federal judge presides over a case that may involve a future law partner? I would build a moat around the legislative and judicial branches of government in the form of a conflict-of-interest barrier about five years wide.
Judge Ackerman did not mention that a retiring Federal judge receives as a pension the salary he had on the last day of his employment. Nor did he make reference to the Federal judges who have achieved senior status, permitting them to choose their caseloads, and that 20 percent of them handle no caseloads, being content to hang on to take advantage of any raises that come along.
The fact that we are now a debtor nation and supporting our current standard of living on borrowed money makes President Bush's proposal to raise the salaries of Federal judges by 25 percent and raise executive branch salaries substantially - and by extension, the salaries of members of Congress - reprehensible to the voters. The people want the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government anchored to the Constitution and want to place a tether on these branches so that they cannot economically distance themselves too far from the American people.

HEADLINE: Lack of Mass Transit Affects Employment

 BODY:
Senator Frank Lautenberg's fine article (''Reducing the Labor Shortage,'' Opinion Page, Sept. 3) on the labor shortage in this state, with emphasis on high unemployment in urban areas, did not address a major reason for this state of affairs: lack of available mass transit.
N. J. Transit should vigorously develop reverse-peak service from urban areas to suburban and even rural job sites, so that the urban poor, most of whom cannot afford a reliable car, can get to these job sites where employers are crying for help.

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: AUGUSTA, ME.;
Competing For the Malls

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH plans for regional shopping malls in both Augusta and Waterville have been announced, it is generally acknowledged that only one is likely to be built.
In Augusta, Melvin Simon and Associates of Indianapolis, the shopping-mall developer, has commitments from three department stores for a 500,000-square-foot mall it wants to build on 50 acres. And in Waterville, the owners of 330 acres are set to select a developer for a 550,000-square-foot mall there. 
''There's not room for both,'' said Greg Boulos, a commercial real estate broker in Portland who is not involved in either project. ''Either one will go.'' Both projects are near an exit of Interstate 95, separated by about 20 miles. ''In some ways we're competing with each other, but both are putting on blinders and trying to get the permits we need,'' said Gary Craig, whose family owns or has options to buy the Waterville tract. He said his site has better access from I-95 and will not need extensive preconstruction work because of wetlands.
But Michael Murphy, a spokesman for Simon and Associates, said the company is already working with the Army Corps of Engineers to solve problems posed by five acres of wetlands and is preparing a traffic study to see what road work will need to be done. He said his company examined several sites, including the Craig property, but deemed Augusta ''far and away the best.'' It is the state capital, with low unemployment as a result largely of state jobs, is centrally located and, has 22,000 people, as opposed to Waterville's nearly 18,000.
Maine has only three regional enclosed malls, the largest being Maine Mall in South Portland, a 1.1-million-square-foot center built in 1971. Bangor Mall, built in 1978 and serving much of the northern part of the state and Canada, has 550,000 square feet. Auburn Mall, about 30 miles southwest of Augusta, has 300,000 square feet and was completed in 1979.
Retail space is considered by analysts to be the healthiest segment of Maine's real estate market, especially in the three cities where there are malls. Strip shopping centers, covering 500,000 square feet, near the Maine Mall, for example, have few vacancies.
In addition, a 200,000-square-foot center to be built nearby next year by New Market Development Company of Atlanta has anchor stores already committed. The same company plans to build a 260,000-square-foot shopping center near the Auburn Mall.

Keeping U.S.-Aided Housing Affordable

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

 BODY:
IN an experiment that could have national significance, a section of a 20-year-old housing complex here was sold last month by a private developer to a nonprofit corporation specifically designed to own and operate the project.
As a result, 286 units of the 548-unit development called The Beavers - a complex of 62 two-story garden apartment houses on a 32-acre site developed with the help of a Federal mortgage interest rate subsidy - will remain affordable for low- or moderate-income tenants.
The John M. Corcoran & Company of Milton, Mass., bought the complex six years ago. Its sale of the 286 units to the nonprofit Pelham Corporation was financed in two ways - with $13.6 million in tax-exempt bonds issued by the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency, a state agency and the $3.65 million from the leasing of 58 of those units to the town's public housing authority for 99 years. The state's Executive Office of Communities and Development provided the funds for those units. 
As its contribution to affordability, the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded up to 95 section 8 housing vouchers to the Framingham Housing Authority to assist tenants whose income is less than 50 percent of the area median, which is $45,000 for a family of four.
In the 60's and 70's, the Federal Government helped financeabout 650,000 new low-cost rental units around the country through its mortgage interest rate subsidy, according to Michael Nail, director of community development for the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, an organization of government and private nonprofit community development agencies.
The quid pro quo was that the developer maintain the low rents over the mortgage term, in some cases up to 40 years. It was agreed that the Federal use restrictions could expire in 20 years if the property owner wished to prepay the mortgage.
In the past few years, as projects approached prepayment eligibility, Federal, state and local officials and housing advocates have sought measures to protect existing lower income tenants from rent increases that would exceed their ability to pay.
''These expiring-use projects are time bombs ticking away that are due to detonate now,'' Mr. Nail said. Landlords often want to prepay mortgages to convert them into condominiums and others may no longer find it attractive to own such properties after the 1986 changes in the tax law, he explained.
Early in 1988, the Federal Government imposed a moratorium on prepayments until next February. But as the number of low-income families grows and the supply of low-cost housing shrinks, said Mr. Nail, the specter of more homeless people has led many communities and states to try to acquire some of these properties to maintain their long term affordability. ''Massachusetts has been one of the leaders,'' he said.
In this state, where about 170 rental projects were built under the Federal mortgage interest-rate subsidy program, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis last year called upon developers to negotiate new agreements to preserve the low-cost housing stock here.
''If developers did not cooperate in negotiating reasonable deals, it was feared that the state legislature would pass laws to limit their ability to prepay mortgages or convert to condominiums,'' said Joseph L. Flatley, who is in charge of preserving and building low-cost housing for the state's Executive Office of Communities and Development.
HE also noted that developers with ''expiring use'' properties, such as Corcoran, work with the state and Federal governments in the construction and management of other housing projects.
''We have an ongoing relationship with H.U.D. and E.O.C.D.,'' said Richard J. High, director of development for Corcoran, which owns and manages about 8,000 rental units, including some public housing, in the Northeast and Southeast.
With the 1986 tax changes, he said, losses on low-cost rentals ''were no longer permitted to shelter income from other property.''
''We were sitting with property that was not providing any economic return,'' Mr. High said. ''It forced our hand.'' He added that Corcoran was now seeking a similar deal to sell off the remaining apartments.
''Given the pressure from the Federal and state government not to do what we thought we had a right to do when we bought the property,'' he continued, ''the deal is pretty good, but it's not a fair-market deal.'' He said that Corcoran received about $60,000 per unit plus a contract to manage the apartments and a $3 million contract to renovate them.
The Beavers sale and its unusual refinancing is the state's first, according to Mr. Flatley, the state housing official, but he expects that within six months, four to six more projects will negotiate transfers of ownership that will maintain low rents.
Housing advocates here applaud the sale of the Beavers apartments, since it seems to minimize tenant displacement. They also endorse the sale of ''expiring use'' properties to nonprofit groups.
But they question the amount of tenant involvement in the Pelham Corporation. Its eight-member board includes two state appointees, a Corcoran staff person and local advocates for lower-income tenants, including the Southern Middlesex County Tenants Council. But there are no Beavers tenants on the board.
''We believe these properties should be sold to tenant controlled non-profits or limited-equity cooperatives,'' said Lizbeth Heyer, legislative coordinator of the Massachusetts Tenants Organization. Moreover, she added, ''the Beaver deal is very expensive and the state should not hold it up as a model that can be reproduced, especially given its current fiscal problems.''
But, said Mr. Nail, the national housing organization official, ''if the state had not intervened, the landlord would probably have made much more profit and the units would have been lost from the affordable housing stock.''
THE project was orignally built for about $3.3 million with a federally subsidized mortgage for which the developer paid about 3 percent interest rather than the prevailing 5.5. percent, Mr. High said.
To qualify for a unit just prior to the sale last month, the income of a family of four could not exceed $38,500. Rents range from $242 to $319 a month for the small two- and three-bedroom units.
About 26 percent of the tenants earn more than 80 percent of the median income in the area, 34 percent earn 50 to 80 percent and 41 percent earn less than 50 percent. Under terms of the sale, the tenant income distribution will remain similar. But rents will now be 30 percent of the tenants' income. Rent increases will be phased in over three years after a one-year renovation plan, which started last month, is completed, Mr. High said.
Corcoran bought the project in this town about 45 minutes west of Boston, in the fastest growing sector of the state, intending to convert it to condominums that would sell for about $110,000, he said.
In this town of about 60,000 residents, condominiums sell from $110,000 to about $300,000; the median home price is $175,000 and sales have gone up to $1.3 million; rents meanwhile range from $650 to $1,000 a month for two- or three-bedroom apartments, said Randall J. Kincaid, the chairman of the Board of Assessors.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Augusta, Me.;
Competing For the Malls

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH plans for regional shopping malls in both Augusta and Waterville have been announced, it is generally acknowledged that only one is likely to be built.
In Augusta, Melvin Simon and Associates of Indianapolis, the shopping-mall developer, has commitments from three department stores for a 500,000-square-foot mall it wants to build on 50 acres. And in Waterville, the owners of 330 acres are set to select a developer for a 550,000-square-foot mall there. 
''There's not room for both,'' said Greg Boulos, a commercial real estate broker in Portland who is not involved in either project. ''Either one will go.'' Both projects are near an exit of Interstate 95, separated by about 20 miles. ''In some ways we're competing with each other, but both are putting on blinders and trying to get the permits we need,'' said Gary Craig, whose family owns or has options to buy the Waterville tract. He said his site has better access from I-95 and will not need extensive preconstruction work because of wetlands.
But Michael Murphy, a spokesman for Simon and Associates, said the company is already working with the Army Corps of Engineers to solve problems posed by five acres of wetlands and is preparing a traffic study to see what road work will need to be done.
He said his company examined several sites, including the Craig property, but deemed Augusta ''far and away the best.'' It is the state capital, with low unemployment as a result largely of state jobs, is centrally located and, has 22,000 people, as opposed to Waterville's nearly 18,000.
Maine has only three regional enclosed malls, the largest being Maine Mall in South Portland, a 1.1-million-square-foot center built in 1971. Bangor Mall, built in 1978 and serving much of the northern part of the state and Canada, has 550,000 square feet. Auburn Mall, about 30 miles southwest of Augusta, has 300,000 square feet and was completed in 1979.
Retail space is considered by analysts to be the healthiest segment of Maine's real estate market, especially in the three cities where there are malls. Strip shopping centers, covering 500,000 square feet, near the Maine Mall, for example, have few vacancies.
In addition, a 200,000-square-foot center to be built nearby next year by New Market Development Company of Atlanta has anchor stores already committed. The same company plans to build a 260,000-square-foot shopping center near the Auburn Mall.

HEADLINE: Old Shows With New Twists

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
THE show is George and Ira Gershwin's ''Oh, Kay!'' The year is 1926, the setting is a swanky estate in Southampton and the characters include a titled bootlegger (The Duke) and an English heiress (Lady Kay).
But not at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, where the musical comedy about Prohibition has been transported to a Harlem speakeasy: the mythical Paradise Club.
Meanwhile, at the Yale Repertory in New Haven, ''Miss Julie,'' August Strindberg's classic tragedy, circa 1888, about the fatal attraction between a countess and a valet, is not being played out in a chilly Swedish castle, as prescribed, but on a coffee plantation in Brazil, and the antagonists are named Dona Julia and Joao (for Jean). 
By coming up with new interpretations of old works, the two theaters are expanding the possibilities for nontraditional casting, one of the most discussed topics in theater today. For both Goodspeed and Yale, these productions mark the first time a play or musical has been rediscovered by a director, reinterpreted and recast entirely for minority actors. But the Yale Repertory has made a tradition of nontraditional casting ''in the 'colorblind' or integrated sense, even before it became a fashionable issue,'' said Robert Wildman, a theater spokesman. ''Our audiences take it for granted; we just do it.'' In the most recent instance, in this season's opening production of the 1953 comedy ''The Solid Gold Cadillac,'' Tommy Hollis, a black actor, was cast as a business tycoon and politician in a role that had customarily been given to whites.
Other Connecticut theaters - the Long Wharf in New Haven and Hartford Stage - practice colorblind casting ''in context,'' said Arvin Brown, the artistic director at Long Wharf. ''We cast from show to show,'' he said. ''It has to do with the fabric of the play. If it is not falsified, as long as you're not playing mix and match, an actor of any race can play any role and should.'' He mentioned the casting of black actors in Long Wharf productions of such plays as ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Camille.''
 
A Multicultural Family
As for Hartford Stage, in its production of ''Pericles,'' the actors playing the title character, his wife, her father and their daughter were white, black, Hispanic and Asian, respectively.
But giving a play a new setting with an all-minority cast could signal a trend, if not a breakthrough. ''It can make terrific sense if you're creating a world that has its own unity,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We haven't done that yet, but I'm not averse to it if it works.
The Yale Repertory's ''Miss Julie,'' which opened Friday and runs through Nov. 11, is ''singular and a first,'' said Lloyd Richards, the artistic director.
''We seized the opportunity of moving the play without changing it - and the play permitted us that opportunity,'' Mr. Richards said. ''We won't restructure a playwright's work by bending it from its original intent. Here, we can go deeper into what the playwright provided. It's an organic thing to do.''
Transplanting ''Miss Julie'' from Sweden to Brazil without modernizing it was the idea of the Jamaican-born director Dennis Scott, who last season staged ''Playboy of the West Indies,'' a retelling by a playwright, Mustapha Matura, of Synge's Irish classic, ''Playboy of the Western World.''
 
Conflicts in New Terms
''I thought we could take Strindberg's original conflict between class and gender one step further and ask: Is there a similar set of relationships between color and economic exploitation?'' Mr. Scott said.
''Shifting the setting thus allows the combatants a historically determined position, and the audience can see the relationships between class and power in new terms. A socio-economic and cultural conflict is created by adding just a few years - the action takes place in the early 1890's - right after the emancipation of slaves in Brazil.''
Mr. Hollis, who appeared in the Yale Repertory production of ''The Piano Lesson'' by August Wilson, which will open on Broadway in April, said nontraditional casting opens up employment opportunities for minority actors and can reinvigorate plays.
''If you put these plays on as they were written in the first place, no black would be cast in them,'' Mr. Hollis said. ''Rethinking can wake up audiences - and wake up old plays. No one will come in saying, 'Oh, we've seen it a hundred times before.' All of a sudden, it's brand new. I don't know whether the rest of the country knows what to do with this yet. We'll have to see successful attempts at it.''
Commenting on the director-created concept of nontraditional casting, the veteran producer William Ross, whose touring productions have played at the Westport County Playhouse, said: ''Any effort we make in terms of casting nontraditionally is important. It's only getting lip service in the commercial theater. We've had novelties like an all-black 'Guys and Dolls' and 'Hello Dolly' on Broadway, and they just become statistics.''
''But this is a new way to move forward,'' he added. ''It's healthy, and I applaud it.'' Earlier this month, Mr. Ross received a Paul Robeson Award, given by the Actors Equity Association for his efforts to create equitable casting opportunities in the theater.
 
The Romantic Lead
At the Goodspeed, Dan Siretta, the associate artistic director and resident choreographer, was responsible for reconceiving ''Oh, Kay!'' which runs through Dec. 23 with Ron Richardson as the romantic lead, Jimmy Winters, a playboy.
''When I looked at 'Oh, Kay!,' it had a complacent script by Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse, and I didn't even know what to do with the opening scene,'' Mr. Siretta said. ''The plots were thrown together.''
''Then I came upon the number 'Clap a Yo' Hands,' and it all started with that,'' he explained. ''It had an introductory line about a 'red hot mammy' so that a white character could sing it. I started to play with the idea of giving it a rush of new energy - and a real identity to the characters. Kay was rich and had a yacht, and they all lived off their money. Now she survives by working in an upscale club. It's still 1926, and we're in the middle of Prohibition, but by making it black and moving it to 138th Street, the story has an edge, and it's totally believable.
''This is a rediscovery, not a re-creation. It can never be done as it once was. How can it? And the opportunity existed to open up an old American musical to a black cast - with a real book, not a revue like 'Black and Blue' or 'Ain't Misbehavin' .' So this is a first for us.''
 
'A Strong Point of View'
Since Mr. Siretta, Martin Connor, the musical's director, and James Racheff, who adapted the book, are white, Sheldon Epps, who conceived and directed the musical revue ''Blues in the Night,'' was engaged as the production's artistic consultant ''to provide a strong point of view as a black American,'' Mr. Epps explained.
''The spirit of the original lines was kept but something had to be done about the language, which suddenly had a false English tone,'' Mr. Epps said. The play now has names that have the resonance of musical royalty and become harbingers of the Harlem Renaissance, like the title Duke and the switch from Lady Kay to Lady Katie. ''Lady was an esteemed title given to a black artist, like Lady Day,'' Mr. Epps said.
On the song ''Clap a Yo' Hands,'' Mr. Epps commented: ''That was a racist setup, and we've thrown it out. Now it has a real life and there's a new truth to the score because Gershwin was influenced by the Jazz Age and black music. The music is now coming from a natural place, and the material has a new point of view. That's not happening anywhere.''
''We didn't just take a show and dip it in chocolate,'' Mr. Epps explained. ''We gave it an environment that supports the material and makes casting it this way realistic and exciting. If this was just another gimmick, no one would be served by it. Now here's a chance to open up new doors for black actors, and that's exciting for the theater in general. Why don't we just call it open-minded casting?''
 
'Another Revival'
Mr. Connor, an English director, said: ''When I was asked to do 'Oh, Kay!,' I thought, What's the point of another revival? But Dan's idea made me stay. Looking at the original script, it's clear that the topicality of it made it a success. It was risque and naughty to deal with something blatantly illegal.
''But once Prohibition was lifted, the immediacy and danger and recognizability faded away, and this became a quaint little American musical. Now it's in the center of clubland - and the Gershwin estate was convinced of our integrity so they gave us permission to do it this way.''
Mr. Richardson, who won a 1985 Tony Award for his performance as the runaway slave Jim in the musical ''Big River,'' learned Japanese and recreated the role in Japan with an all-Japanese cast two years ago. ''If it weren't for white companies doing musicals, I would never get a chance to be in them,'' he said.
In Pennsylvania, Mr. Mr. Richardson has played supporting roles in ''Camelot'' and ''Man of La Mancha'' and the lead in ''West Side Story.''
''I wouldn't get to be a traditional leading man like Jimmy Winters,'' he added. ''That doesn't happen to black actors - unless the show is 'Dreamgirls.' '' ''There are no blacks in 'Les Mis' or in 'Phantom.'
''In 'Oh, Kay!,' the parallels between the original character and the one I'm playing are consistent. It's my hope that producers and directors will open their eyes to the possibilities created by a completely reconceived production like this. And this may be the first time a black company has played the Goodspeed Opera House since the minstrel shows in 1877.''

HEADLINE: Dinkins Pledges to Cut Spending By 1% to Reduce the City's Deficit

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

 BODY:
Acknowledging that New York City faces ''difficult times'' financially, David N. Dinkins, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said yesterday that he would be prepared to cut city spending - except for the Police Department - by 1 percent to reduce a looming budget deficit.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate who has criticized Mr. Dinkins for his ''free-spending'' policies, ridiculed the proposal, saying it was nothing more than a formula created by Mr. Dinkins to avoid making difficult choices.
Mr. Dinkins said yesterday on ''News Forum,'' a morning interview program on WNBC-TV, that spending cuts would be one way he would deal with the fiscal austerity that most experts agree awaits the new mayor.
 
The Giuliani Plan
''I am prepared to institute a 1 percent cut across the board,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''If that is not enough, we'll see what else we have to cut.'' 
Mr. Giuliani attacked the plan as irresponsible, saying that he would instead take a number of steps, including the refinancing of city bonds and the reinvestment of pension funds.
''David Dinkins's whole reaction to the budget crisis is to run away from it and say things that are deeply disturbing,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference in midtown Manhattan. ''And now he comes up with a 1 percent decrease, which is in essence trying to substitute a formula for a tough assessment.''
Until now, Mr. Dinkins has refused to answer questions about the budget deficit, saying he would await recommendations from task forces. He said in one interview that he would rather be ''hazy and fuzzy'' than ''upset some apple carts prematurely.''
His nod yesterday in the direction of spending cuts - instead of taxes, layoffs or other ways to close the gap -came a day after Mr. Giuliani said fear of Mr. Dinkins's election had caused a decline in New York City bond prices on Friday. Mr. Giuliani's assertion was disputed by the City Comptroller's office.
Mr. Giuliani repeated yesterday that bond traders were ''very afraid'' of a Dinkins election, although a recent report in Barron's said market analysts had expressed wariness about both candidates, since neither has ruled out a tax increase as a solution to the city's fiscal problems.
Mr. Giuliani will be endorsed today by Crain's New York Business, a weekly newspaper, which said, ''Mr. Dinkins's style of governing will lead to years of inaction and paralysis.''
The Crain's editorial praised Mr. Giuliani's ''intelligence and commitment,'' which, it said, ''suggest that he will, in a resonable amount of time, learn the job.''
 
Hiring Freeze Recommended
At the news conference yesterday outside the Women's National Republican Club, Mr. Giuliani said that in addition to refinancing city bonds and reinvesting pension funds, he would seek a hiring freeze to reduce the deficit.
''We are taking a responsibile approach,'' Mr. Giuliani said, adding that spending cuts should be specific and not spread across the board.
On Tuesday, Mayor Edward I. Koch is expected to outline his plan to reduce the deficit in this year's budget. City officials now estimate that the gap will exceed $500 million.
Paul Dickstein, the city's budget director, would not say disclose yesterday how the city expects to close the budget gap, but he said spending cuts would be ''considerably more'' than the $75 million originally predicted.
 
Bigger Deficit Next Year
Mr. Koch, who entered office in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, has repeatedly pledged to leave office with a balanced budget. But even if this year's budget is balanced, fiscal experts are predicting a larger deficit next year, based on a decline in revenue and an increase in costs, tied in large part to pending settlements with municipal unions.
Mr. Dinkins stressed that the Police Department would not be affected by any budget cuts in his administration. ''What we don't cut is cops,'' he told Gabe Pressman of WNBC, ''because if we cannot be safe and secure in our persons, in our homes, in our parks, in nighttime as well as the daytime, the rest of this will matter little.''
Later, however, he said budget constraints could delay the hiring of police officers from the Police Academy's next two graduating classes, in January and next June. During the Democratic primary campaign, Mr. Dinkins criticized Mr. Koch for similar delays, saying the postponements had created the illusion of an expanded, or ''phantom,'' police force.
Such delays in hiring are ''to be avoided, if at all possible,'' Mr. Dinkins said yesterday.
 
'From His Own Experience'
Because state and Federal law determines much of the city's budget and sets the level of more than half the work force, not all city services would be affected by an across-the-board squeeze, Mr. Dinkins noted yesterday. And the amount saved by a 1 percent cut would depend on where it fell in the budget cycle, one of his advisers said.
The campaign aide, Barbara Turk, said the idea of a 1 percent across-the-board cut had come up in recent staff meetings but had not been recommended by the campaign's Council of Economic Advisers, which is led by Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Mr. Dinkins ''got this from his own experience as Borough President,'' Ms. Turk said.
Mr. Dickstein said yesterday that the Koch administration has never made an across-the-board budget cut, although it has asked agencies to determine what effect a percentage cut would have on their programs. This was done last year as the budget was modified to match revenues, he said, but the final cuts were made on an agency-by-agency basis.
 
Makes Report Public
Mr. Dinkins, who was emerging from a week of intense scrutiny of his taxes and personal finances, yesterday released a report that the City Department of Investigation had done on him. The report was made after Mr. Dinkins, who was to become a deputy mayor, had withdrawn his name after revealing that he had failed to file city, state and Federal income taxes for four years.
The report, which Mr. Dinkins until now had refused to make public, was signed in September 1975 by Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner. Mr. Scoppetta said in a letter to Mayor Abraham D. Beame, ''This investigation has uncovered no evidence of a derogatory nature which would disqualify'' Mr. Dinkins from a city appointment.
Campaigning in Brooklyn yesterday, Mr. Dinkins called on Mr. Giuliani to reciprocate by releasing Federal background investigations of him, as well as his income-tax forms for the last 19 years. Asked if he suspected his opponent, a former United States Attorney in Manhattan, of financial wrongdoing, Mr. Dinkins said, ''I am far more careful with the reputations of people than some I know.''
On the campaign trail yesterday, the issue of Mr. Dinkins's transfer of 588 shares of stock in the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation to his son in 1986 seemed to be fading. Mr. Giuliani stopped hammering at the differences between the stock's $58,000 sale price and the $1 million value Mr. Dinkins put on it in 1983. Asked about the matter on WNBC yesterday, Mr. Dinkins said that in 1983 he was listing its ''market value,'' whereas on other city disclosure forms, he was asked to give ''the estimated cost at time of receipt.''

HEADLINE: War on Cocaine in Peru Is Sputtering

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Oct. 22

 BODY:
In this country where 65 percent of the world's coca crop is grown, the United States and the Government are waging a tiny anti-drug campaign with a handful of men and helicopters.
Each day, unless it rains, 20 to 40 Peruvian policemen and three or four agents from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration fly into the jungle in American-piloted helicopters in search of simple field laboratories and dirt airstrips.
Of the scores of laboratories and dozens of airfields believed to be scattered across the heart of the coca-producing region, the Americans and Peruvians have destroyed 19 laboratories and 12 airfields since beginning operations in early September, a few days after President Bush announced his campaign to fight illegal narcotics trafficking.
 
Little Effect on Big Industry
American and Peruvian officials acknowledge that their efforts so far have had little effect on an industry that yields up to $1.5 billion a year and directly supports up to 300,000 farmers and their families. 
''It's small,'' said a senior United States official. ''But it's coming along. I'm very optimistic of a lot of additional resources.''
President Bush said in September that $261 million would go for anti-narcotics programs in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. None of the $73 million that has been designated as Peru's share has yet arrived. Last year, Peru received $10.5 million to fight drugs.
 
Fighting Growers and Guerrillas
For eight months before September, the United States and Peru had suspended anti-narcotics police operations and the forced eradication of coca crops because of violent resistance from the coca growers and leftist guerrillas. The eradication effort, which had been limited, has not been resumed. A senior American official estimated that Peru's crop of coca, from which cocaine is extracted, may expand by 20 percent this year, compared with 10 percent in previous years.
Peru's cocaine industry has been dealt at least a temporary blow, American and Peruvian officials say, by American-backed actions in Colombia in which the police and military have seized more than 350 drug smuggling planes and have been trying to capture the major international drug chiefs.
Shipments from Peru of semi-refined cocaine for final processing in Colombia have dropped by half, American and Peruvian officials estimate, and tons of semi-refined cocaine are piling up in jungle redoubts. As demand from Colombia has fallen, the officials say, the price for a kilogram of semi-refined cocaine, or base, as it is called, has plunged from $1,400 last August to about $600.
 
Prices in U.S. Remain Steady
''There's been a lot of disruption in Peru's cocaine production as a result of the pressure in Colombia,'' said a senior American official. ''The planes aren't flying and the decision makers are dispersed and moving around, making it harder to orchestrate these loads.''
United States officials in Washington and Miami say, however, that neither cocaine supplies nor prices in the United States have changed significantly since the Colombian President, Virgilio Barco Vargas, declared war on drug traffickers on Aug. 18; this is partly because of huge stockpiles in Latin America, the Caribbean and the United States.
When cocaine prices drop, American and Peruvian officials say, other crops like coffee and cacao become more attractive to farmers. But Peruvians and Americans who have been in the Upper Huallaga Valley, Peru's main cocaine-growing area, in the last few days say that farmers there seem to regard the current price decline as a temporary phenomenon and give no indication they plan to abandon their illicit crops.
 
Waning Support for Drug War
Both American and Peruvian officials worry that waning public support in Colombia may curtail anti-drug efforts there. Furthermore, law enforcement officials say they have evidence that new smuggling routes on roads, rivers and in the air are being established and they speculate that Colombia's traffickers may move their laboratories into northern Peru and parts of Brazil.
Colombia has been the main battlefield of the drug war as narcotics squads have retaliated for Government raids with bombings and assassinations. But no drug lords have been captured in Colombia and the Government has had few dramatic anti-drug operations in recent weeks, prompting a growing perception among Colombians that the battle is being lost and that negotiations should be considered.
American officials say that traffickers in Bolivia, which grows perhaps 25 percent of the world's coca, have their own refineries and shipping networks and have been little affected by the actions in Colombia.
 
Strapped for Money
Some American officials say it is unrealistic to expect more from Peru, where the economy declined by 20 percent last year and where cocaine production yields are estimated at equal to as much as half the country's annual legal exports of $3 billion.
''This country is in the middle of an economic crisis,'' an American official said. ''It doesn't have the resources.''

HEADLINE: Cleveland Mayoral Race Marked by a Bitter Feud

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Oct. 20

 BODY:
A bitter feud between the old guard and a new generation of politicians is under way as Cleveland's most powerful black official campaigns for the Mayor's office against a onetime protege.
George L. Forbes, 58 years old, the longtime president of the Cleveland City Council, appears to be badly trailing Michael White, a 38-year-old state senator, in a campaign filled with name-calling and allegations of impropriety on both sides.
The Forbes camp has charged that Mr. White beat a former wife and is a ''slum landlord'' whose inner-city property violates housing codes. Mr. White has denied charges of wife abuse and has vowed to repair the violations at his property. At the same time he has accused Mr. Forbes of using his office for personal gain and of using his wife, Mary, as a ''front person'' for improper investments. Mr. Forbes has denied the charges. 
''It's a nasty race with plenty of publicity,'' said Robert Hughes, chairman of the Cuyahoga County Republican Party. ''It's been bang-crash-boom since the primary.''
 
Top Vote-Getters in Primary
The two men, the only two blacks in a field of five contenders in the primary, were the top vote-getters in the nonpartisan primary last month. Their victory assured that Cleveland would have its first black Mayor since Carl Stokes, the first black Mayor of any major American city, left office in 1971.
A poll by The Cleveland Plain Dealer of 802 registered voters showed Mr. White leading Mr. Forbes 46 percent to 27 percent with 28 percent undecided. Mr. White had support among a cross-section of voters, while Mr. Forbes, an often combative and blunt politician who has alienated many white voters in his 27 years on the council, showed little support beyond black voters.
Mr. White garnered 66 percent of the white vote in the poll as against 9 percent for Mr. Forbes. Among blacks, the two men were almost tied with Mr. Forbes getting 26 percent and Mr. White 25 percent. The poll was taken Oct. 16-19 and had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
The campaign is being seen as a referendum on Mr. Forbes's 17 years as president of the Council, a time during which the city has gone from bankruptcy while Dennis Kucinich was Mayor in the 1970's to economic revival under Mayor George V. Voinovich, a longtime friend and frequent ally of Mr. Forbes.
In some ways, the economic successes of the Voinovich years appear to be working against Mr. Forbes, whom Mr. White and other critics are seeking to portray as an elitist who has been quick to give tax breaks to developers while ignoring the neighborhoods. The Forbes campaign has the backing of several major developers who are hosting a $3,000-a-table fund-raising event for him on Monday.
 
Alliances With the Wealthy
The topic of Mr. Forbes's alliances with the wealthy came up repeatedly during a debate this week between the two men, in which Mr. Forbes was berated by citizens for sitting in the owner's box instead of in the stands at a recent Cleveland Indians game. He was also assailed for statements attributed to him in local newspapers in which he reportedly told developers, ''There's no advantage to being around poor people.''
Mr. Forbes denied the allegations. ''I never said that ridiculous statement. It's insane and ridiculous,'' he said. The Forbes campaign received a blow late this week when Mayor Voinovich said he would not endorse a candidate for Mayor. Mr. Forbes, who has opposed fellow Democrats in the past to support the Republican Mr. Voinovich, had hoped that an endorsement from Mr. Voinovich would improve his standing among white voters.
Many whites have felt antagonized by Mr. Forbes over the years with his bluntness and frequent use of racial epithets. Television broadcasts must regularly censor expletives from his interviews. Not all of the ire is aimed at whites.
Mr. Forbes's displays once provoked former Mayor Stokes to call him a ''foul-mouthed, uncouth, unregenerated politician of the most despicable sort.'' Two years ago, Mr. Forbes threw a chair at a black City Council member and called him a ''mulatto punk.'' That same year, during a Council committee hearing, he asked a pregnant woman who was testifying there, ''Are you knocked up again?''
Mr. Forbes made no apologies for the chair incident and has said the latter incident was taken out of context.
The Forbes camp has tried to downplay the episodes and create uncertainty about his opponent. ''We all know too well about the outbursts,'' said Tuan Bustamante, Mr. Forbes's campaign manager. ''But his opponent is an unknown quantity. He has not faced the scrutiny that George has been under. People see George mad for five seconds of television and don't know he's been there for four hours. They see it totally out of context.'' He dismisses this behavior as a way of getting his point across. ''It's like when Mike Tyson or Muhammad Ali go into the ring,'' he told The Plain Dealer. ''It's all show-biz. The purpose is to get the job done and make sure the city comes out ahead. Most of the things I do I think out. I'm not as crazy as people think.''
In recent days, he has been running advertisements with his young grandson to show another side of his personality, but some analysts say it may be too late. ''I don't think you can soften a 17-year image in two weeks,'' Mr. Hughes said.
Meanwhile, Mr. White, capitalizing on white hostility toward Mr. Forbes, has been portraying himself as a unifier of the city's disparate communities, comparing himself to Mayor Curt Schmoke of Baltimore and other black mayors who have had wide crossover appeal. He has spoken out in favor of a key concern of white voters, the ending of forced busing in Cleveland, and has promised a city ''free of division, free of hatred, free of bickering, one Cleveland for blacks, whites and Hispanics.''
White voters are being seen as pivotal in the race in a city where there are nearly as many black voters as white and where the black vote is almost evenly split between the two men.
''This race will be decided by the white voters,'' Mr. Stokes said. ''Mike White has to walk that line of appealing to white voters while keeping blacks on his side. And George has to walk that line to keep that nominally irate white citizen from purposely going to the polls to vote against him.''

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Crowe v. Abrams: A Private Feud Over Handling Panama Becomes Public

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The feud pits a true believer against a four-star admiral; a six-shooter against a 16-inch gun on a battleship.
Neither Elliott Abrams, the onetime Assistant Secretary of State who shaped the Reagan Administration's Panama policy, nor Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, who fought to keep American troops from fighting in Panama, still holds his Government post.
But both have an abundance of ill will left over from the days when they vied for control of American policy. Now their animosities have been played out in public, complete with name-calling and jousting in the Op-Ed pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. 
It is a display that tells a lot about the two men, but perhaps it tells even more about the state of the art of feuding in Washington in the ideological 80's.
 
Gauntlet Thrown and Picked Up
''I was aware for a long time that Abrams was bad-mouthing me under the table all over town, saying, 'Isn't it sort of weird that the J.C.S. are wimps,' and things like that,'' Admiral Crowe said in an interview in a small office he keeps at the Pentagon in retirement. ''I was getting a little bit tired of Elliott. Now that I'm free to talk, I felt I should throw down the gauntlet.''
Mr. Abrams was only too willing to take it up. ''The chairman's position consists of distortions, name-calling and leaks,'' he said in a telephone interview from Sao Paolo, Brazil, where he was representing a client as a private lawyer. ''Basically the position of the J.C.S. was: 'Count us out. Maybe the State Department, the C.I.A. or the Treasury can do something, but don't look at us. Period.' ''
Bare-knuckled battles of words are rare in a town where Government officials generally curse their political foes in closed-door meetings or off-the-record remarks to think tank audiences. Public discussions of who-said-what in policy meetings would violate convention and secrecy rules and probably get the offenders thrown out of their jobs.
 
Doubts on a Reagan Policy
But this month's failed coup in Panama brought more than stinging recriminations about President Bush's handling of the crisis. It also cast doubt on the wisdom of the Reagan policy that pushed Washington into a diplomatic cul-de-sac in Panama, raising questions about the use of military intervention to force change in another country's leadership.
The heart of the debate centers around whether, as Mr. Abrams argues, the admiral's refusal to use force in Panama was responsible for keeping Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in power, or, as Admiral Crowe believes, that policy goal was never worth risking the loss of American lives and the alienation of Latin governments.
In his Op-Ed articles in The Times and The Post this month, Mr. Abrams accused the admiral of delay, obfuscation, gross exaggeration of the military threat from Panama's Defense Forces, leaks of sensitive White House meetings and contempt for the civilians who disagreed with him.
In a verbal declaration of war published as a letter to the editor of The New York Times last week, the usually tranquil Admiral Crowe, who retired from the military three days before the Panama coup attempt, fought back. He called Mr. Abrams' proposals ''naiive in their formulation and reckless in their casual commitment of our military men and women.''
 
Battling Out of Character
Such recklessness, he continued, ''is not unknown among young appointees who have never served in uniform,'' adding, ''However, Mr. Abrams raised it to an art form.''
Analysts in and out of government were stunned that two high-profile people who held such influential postswould comment on such sensitive matters so personally.
''It's not in the nature of either of these guys to make personal attacks, but here they were, two players just out of the Government, and they grabbed the opportunity to make their points,'' said Abraham D. Sofaer, the State Department legal adviser for both the Reagan and Bush Administrations. ''And,'' he said as an afterthought, ''this is a town that, if you play dirty, you'll get it back.''
 
Fighters With Different Styles
Both Mr. Abrams and Admiral Crowe are fierce intellectuals who relish a good fight, but that's where the comparison stops.
Admiral Crowe is 64 years old, 6 feet tall, weighing nearly 200 pounds and is rumpled even in his formal uniform with the 33 medals and decorations. A Princeton Ph.D. in politics, he has never commanded a ship larger than a diesel submarine in 47 years of military service, though he has served in Vietnam, the Middle East, Western Europe and the Pacific.
His detractors say he is too political, too accommodating to the civilian leadership and reluctant to use force unless he can win. His pet peeve is lawyers.
 
A Master of the Diatribe
Mr. Abrams, 41, is well-spoken and well-tailored, a Harvard-educated conservative lawyer from New York who has never served in the military. A master of well-argued staccato diatribes, he was the most forceful defender of the Reagan doctine in Central America, calling himself a ''gladiator'' for the cause and advocating an American military invasion of Nicaragua following the assault on Grenada in 1983.
If Admiral Crowe lopes, Mr. Abrams swaggers.
But when Admiral Crowe read Mr. Abrams' article, he took off both his stars and his gloves. His first thought, he said in his Oklahoma twang, was, ''This snake's hard to kill.''
''I never took on Elliott publicly before,'' he said. ''I didn't think it was proper as Chairman, and I was never being hurt that much. But in the wake of recent events I felt we needed a little more sanity in the public dialogue.''
 
Spectrum of Possibilities
Admiral Crowe likes to tell stories of how, during war games, civilians are much quicker than military people to advocate the use of force. He said that when it came to Panama, he argued repeatedly at White House meetings that he didn't want to put American boys at risk unless Panamanians did the same.
He recalled attending a dinner party in Panama in which political opposition leaders told him, '' 'I'm not going to put my sons in the streets' -that didn't exactly grab me,'' he said.
In his defense, Mr. Abrams says, ''Nobody was proposing D-Day in Panama, but there was a broad spectrum of overt and covert possibilities that would have complied with all applicable laws, executive orders and regulations.''
The salvos offer a rare inside glimpse not only at the policymaking process but also of the Reagan Administration's dissonance on Panama policy, which echoes on today.
Admiral Crowe tried to delay imposing financial and economic sanctions in Panama, Mr. Abrams charged. Admiral Crowe replied that he never opposed sanctions; he only questioned whether they would achieve General Noriega's overthrow in a matter of weeks, as he said the State Department claimed.
 
When the Course Is Set
The State Department never claimed that economic sanctions would be enough to oust General Noriega, said Mr. Abrams, but Admiral Crowe remembers it differently. ''When people are arguing for their positions in the United States Government, it is quite common to make exaggerated statements,'' he said. ''Once your course is adopted, it doesn't matter whether you were right or wrong.''
In his most serious charge, Mr. Abrams said that Admiral Crowe's operation deliberately leaked and distorted sensitive proposals involving military action. Admiral Crowe acknowledged that ''military people do leak,'' but added: ''We consider an accusation coming from anywhere in State about leaking as sort of ridiculous. And Elliott was world class.''
Admiral Crowe does acknowledge that Mr. Abrams is not all wrong. The decision to conduct extensive military maneuvers and move troops as allowed by the Panama Canal treaties has politically embarrassed General Noriega and has not affected American servicemen. ''Elliott is correct that we didn't assert our treaty rights as vigorously as we are today, a move that has probably paid off,'' he said.
 
But the Bosses Decided It
Both men argue, accurately, that it was their bosses, not they, who made the ultimate decisions.
''Elliott gives me too much credit for making policy,'' said the admiral, a savvy political player who cut his teeth on Washington politics as an aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the early 1950's. ''I sat at the table, but I felt a little bit like the back bencher. I wasn't the Secretary of Defense and I wasn't the President.''
Mr. Abrams said: ''It's really disingenuous to say, 'Well, shucks, the President decided.' The President decided after being poorly served by his Joint Chiefs, after a behavior pattern by them that narrowed his choices unfairly.''
In his own defense, Mr. Abrams said that it was Secretary of State George P. Shultz, not he, who made all the recommendations. Admiral Crowe agreed that it was Mr. Shultz who pushed the use-of-force policy line, but added, ''Everyone knew that Elliott was the architect of the policy.''
Both men say that their motive in going public with their differences was to set the record straight and to set the tone of the future policy debate on Panama. But it is doubtful the two men will have much to say to each other again.
''After Panama I don't wish to have a personal relationship with Admiral Crowe because he and his staff went beyond the bounds of the acceptable,'' Mr. Abrams said . The admiral, who often says he can get along with anybody, gets less personal. He says: ''I don't want to start a running gun battle with Elliott. This was sort of fun. People shouldn't make too much out of it.''

HEADLINE: Dangerous for Japan to Leave U.S. Security Fold;
The Real Struggle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Rights and Wrongs of Blaming Japan'' (editorial, Oct. 16) is an improvement over earlier commentaries on the increasing strife between the United States and Japan. It properly points out that we have adequate laws to screen investments that endanger American economic leadership and control of our national economic destiny.
However, you do not mention that our trade laws are not vigorously enforced. The machinery in the Federal Government to deal with proposed sales of companies involved in strategic fields is not utilized. As a result, we continue to suffer from an erosion of our technological leadership. The gradual deterioration of our industries is fully recorded in your business section day by day. 
Your editorial is lacking in a long-range view of the U.S.-Japanese economic struggle and in a failure to note the distinctive qualities of the Japanese people and nation. Russell Braddon, the noted Australian historian, correctly points out in ''Japan Against the World, 1941-2041: The One Hundred Year War for Supremacy'' that ''ever since 1894 when they attacked Korea, occupied Seoul and sank China's navy, [the Japanese] have suffered an apparently insatiable thirst for inter national pre-eminence.''
This, I submit, is the real nature of the trade and investment struggle in which the United States is involved. Americans continue to think of Japan as a trade competitor rather than as a trade adversary with the objective of national pre-eminence, precisely as Japan did in the 1930's. Indeed, Mr. Braddon points out that Japanese officers and officials of more than a generation ago made it clear they were engaged in a war that would last 100 years.
Our problems can't be solved by trying to sell a little rice to the Japanese or by forcing them to modify their internal market. The United States must take unilateral steps to safeguard America's industries and technologies or it will become a second-class power in the world and Japan will truly gain the international pre-eminence it has sought throughout the century.

HEADLINE: Dangerous for Japan to Leave U.S. Security Fold

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Reassessing the United States- Japan relationship is a worthwhile, and increasingly necessary, undertaking given the enormous economic growth Japan has enjoyed since the end of World War II. However, the suggestions of Ronald A. Morse and Alan Tonelson (''Let Japan Be Japan,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 4) could be dangerously destabilizing for both Asia and the world.
The suggestion that a nuclear-armed Japan would act as a ''balance to Soviet power'' might be accurate in a strictly bilateral sense, but it is doubtful the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea or the countries of Southeast Asia would see it that way. Even without an aggressive military regime in Tokyo, any serious increase in Japanese defense capabilities that took place outside of a U.S.-Japan cooperative security effort would be a dangerously destabilizing development and would in all likelihood trigger a regional arms race. 
Also, Mr. Morse and Mr. Tonelson apparently overlook the fact that many influential voices in Japan do not wish to see their country cutting its economic and security moorings to the United States. They know all too well that such a ''divorce'' could place Japan in a most untenable strategic position.
Rather than freeing ourselves of this ''entangling alliance,'' we should work to further our cooperative efforts in scientific, industrial and military fields on an increasingly equal basis. An economically strong Japan does not require a severing of our mutual security commitments; indeed, it presents us with an even stronger rationale to reaffirm current cooperation and interdependence. Both countries would be far better off working to avoid choosing ''a more dangerous course'' than to be ''better positioned'' for its eventuality.

HEADLINE: The Voices of Namibia

BYLINE: By Anthony Lake; Anthony Lake is professor of international relations at Mount Holyoke College.

DATELINE: SOUTH HADLEY, Mass.

 BODY:
In the black township of Katatura, over supper, I listen to a former organizer and current supporter of the South West African People's Organization, which led the fight against South African occupation of Namibia and is now, by all accounts, its largest political party. He tells of his detention and torture by the South Africans 11 years ago.
He still bears physical scars. I ask him for his feelings about his enemies. And I ask whether after the elections in early November to form a Constituent Assembly, it can produce a constitution for an independent Namibia? Will the necessary spirit of reconciliation be possible? 
''Yes,'' he says to my questions. ''It must be so, for the good of the nation. So many have died. We must get on with living.'' He knows where his torturers now are, but swears he does not hate them. When he encountered policemen who had arrested him, he offered his hand.
How can this be, I ask the guests. Can other Namibians put aside hatreds? ''I think so,'' a friend of his says. ''It is strange. I wonder what kind of people we are. Maybe it is because under the South Africans we had to learn to hold things in.'' Then she reconsiders: ''But maybe our people will let them out again. I don't know. Maybe there will be civil war.''
Her ambivalence about the future is represented by people encountered during a tour of the central and volatile northern regions by an independent American commission monitoring the election process. These Namibians, black and white, provide a mixture of bitterness and hope.
A group of former Swapo members, who had been held in camps in Angola on dubious charges of spying, tell us of life in underground cells and tortures they have endured.
A member of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group recounts the inspiring enthusiasm of the Namibians who registered to vote, and almost all of those eligible did so. The 104-year-old woman who made it through the line. The man who was so proud, he joined every line he saw, registering four times before the computer could catch up with him.
A church worker describes his voter education work in the villages: ''For most of the people, this will be the first time they have held pen in hand. The 'X' they make on the paper will not only be the right they have suffered for. It will be the first letter they will make, the beginning of learning to write.''
In Ovamboland, where Swapo and South African forces fought most bitterly, a U.N. official describes two weeks of violence. The official suggests that it may have been a mistake to demobilize the infamous Koevoet counterinsurgency force (recruited and trained by the South Africans), rather than strictly confining it to base. The ex-fighters have gone on an angry rampage in Oshakati against Swapo supporters, using hand grenades, rifles and mortars.
An organizer for the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, the party favored by South Africa and Swapo's main national rival, admits he has hired demobilized Koevoet members as party workers. But he knows their violence is hurting his party. And he doesn't seem sure of how to control it.
A Swapo organizer explains why, according to most observers, Swapo has been responsible for much less violence than its chief opponent: ''We have been instructed to be patient. They want to make us fight, so the South Africans will say we are not ready for independence.'' But if the attacks continue, he says, ''It will be hard for Swapo leaders to control the people.''
A U.N. police monitor is frustrated because he must stand by and merely observe while his counterparts in the South West African Police do little to prevent violence. Nor can he do much to correct the bias against Swapo that the police seem to show. He is worried by the large numbers of guns and grenades held by people of all political stripes.
A white police chief in the north expresses his fears in ominous terms: ''We know that if Swapo doesn't win, they will fight again. We have our plans for it.''
In Windhoek, a white civil rights lawyer continues to receive phoned death threats that refer to the assassination of his friend Anton Lubowski, a white member of Swapo.
At our hotel in Windhoek, we are accosted by a local German-speaking businessman, full of beer and anger. He accuses the U.N. and Americans of ruining the country. ''But we've got the guns,'' he says. His pugnacity becomes surrealistic: ''And Germany did not lose the war.'' We are grateful he does not physically resemble some of the hard types we observed on the plane into Windhoek: men who could have cleared the bar room in ''Star Wars'' with a single glance.
We hope that more typical than these and the white police officers we met was a white Democratic Turnhalle Alliance organizer in a quiet area of the country. ''I am hopeful about the future,'' he says. ''Reconciliation is very possible. But we will need help from the outside, economic help, to be truly independent. Please do not forget us.''
It is no wonder that the promise of democracy is threatened by violence and fear. People who have been shooting at each other for 23 years must learn to compete within the limits of a democratic process. In such circumstances, politics is war carried on by other means. In the process, the habits of peace must be crated. This is not easy.
Almost certainly, the election will be held and then certified as free and fair by the U.N. But the current violence works against future reconciliation and increases the chance of postelection hostilities.
The stakes are large, not only for the possibility of peace in Angola but for South Africa. A white South African temporarily working in Namibia, a supporter of the South African Government, is carefully watching what majority rule will bring. ''If it works in Namibia,'' he says, ''it will work very well in South Africa.''
An American working in Ovamboland hopes Washington understands the danger in the violence: ''The South Africans must get their Administrator General in Namibia to make the police act fairly and put an end to the violence. I hope our own Government is doing all it can to get the South Africans to act.''
Such action would serve the interests of South Africa, Angola, the U.S. and others. And, maybe more important, it would help my supper companions in Katatura find the peace and security they deserve.

HEADLINE: Campaign Matters;
Crisis After Crisis Lying in Wait For Next Mayor

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Two weeks from tomorrow, either David N. Dinkins or Rudolph W. Giuliani will be mayor-elect of New York City after spending about $10 million and about 10 months campaigning. It's a wonder that anyone would want the job. The city's 106th mayor will lead New York into the final decade of the millenium, an era which Mayor Edward I. Koch's Commission on the Year 2000 said last year would be characterized by ''New York Ascending.''
''I think we are still right to have a basically optimistic outlook,'' said Robert F. Wagner Jr., the commission chairman, ''but, probably our tone was more positive than it should have been.'' 
Consider just a few of the problems the next mayor will face, but which neither of the major party candidates seems to have adequately addressed:
* ''The biggest decision is going to be associated with how to close whatever budget gap there is,'' said Stanley Brezenoff, the First Deputy Mayor.
''We can only get these things started.
The next mayor will have to decide for himself.'' He faces a problematic economy and high expectations, a budget gap this year of upwards of $550 million and $900 million next year with little likelihood of much help from Albany, and labor negotiations that Mr. Brezenoff said could be more intense than at any time since the city's mid-1970's fiscal crisis.
* The city may be heading for another record year for violent crime - topping the 162,916 reports of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault in 1988. Felony drug arrests in the first six months of this year were nearly 30 percent ahead of the comparable period last year. Jails are already filled beyond their legal capacity; the budget gap may jeopardize plans to hire all 2,000 police officers who were to be recruited this year to increase the force to 28,000.
* Estimates vary widely, but the number of heroin and cocaine abusers in the city may be in the hundreds of thousands and many who want treatment are said to be turned away. A municipal program to expand drug treatment is budgeted at only $32 million this year. But it would cost the city $171 million to treat 77,000 addicts by 1994.
* By the Board of Education's estimate, the dropout rate among public school students is 30 percent or more. The ascent of a new schools chancellor and a new mayor, said Mr. Wagner, the Board of Education president, represents an ideal time to lobby for legislative changes to make the system more effective. ''It's important not to squander the honeymoon,'' he said.
* The health-care system is under seige. It is plagued by an aging population, by patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, by overcrowded emergency rooms, and by inadequate centers outside hospitals for medical and psychiatric treatment. It is estimated that 200,000 New Yorkers are infected with the AIDS virus. Of the 22,000 who were diagnosed as having AIDS, about half have died, making this one of the deadliest epidemics in city history. Twice as many New Yorkers are now dying of AIDS each year than are murdered.
* One in four New Yorkers are classified as poor and the poorest sink deeper into poverty, the Human Resources Administration says. About a third of the 100,000 welfare cases represent the all but permanently poor. The average welfare recipient stays on relief for eight years. About 1,600 homeless families still live in 22 hotels; 9,500 individuals are in city shelters. About 450 babies a month are abandoned to hospitals, many the offspring of addicts, and 28,000 of their older brothers and sisters are likely to be in foster care this year. Meanwhile, a deadline looms to draft legislation to conform with new Federal welfare rules.
The next mayor will also have to help carry out a new City Charter and master its land-use processes, and decide how to develop the waterfront, dispose of garbage and control traffic.
But Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, warns that the city's ''generative cycle can be disrupted or reversed if we hesitate to attend to those issues now causing so much anxiety as New York's fast-paced decade draws to an exhausted close.
''If the city's institutions fail to shuck their encrusted shell,'' he said, ''if people continue to buy out of the social contract, if priority is not given to the fundamentally middle-class values of working New Yorkers of every economic standing, then the transnational corporations housed here will pull up stakes and head for more civil precincts. And countless New Yorkers who now fill their offices will relocate as well.''
New York may yet ascend, but the problems awaiting the next mayor promise that the battle will be uphill.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Rivals Differ On Growth and Ecology

SERIES: Courter and Florio On the Issues - First of three articles

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Pursuing prosperity and protecting the state from its excesses are common goals of both candidates for governor, but their ideas of how to make New Jersey both economically strong and environmentally clean differ, sometimes substantially.
Representative Jim Courter of Hackettstown, the Republican candidate, believes that New Jersey has to look outside its boundaries for help in disposing of toxic wastes. But when it comes to attracting businesses, he says he would not worry about offending other states in his efforts to lure a corporation.
''I wouldn't be so concerned about alienating New York,'' Mr. Courter said. ''I'm going to advocate for this state, not New York.'' 
 
Poorly Thought Out
Representative James J. Florio, the Democrat, believes that New Jersey's efforts at environmental protection were poorly thought out, and he would put some plans, including those for solid waste incinerators, on hold. He said he would act aggressively to keep business growing, but not at the expense of the environment.
''We're not going to have a healthy pharmaceutical industry or a healthy chemical industry if we don't have clean water,'' Mr. Florio said.
The candidates presented their views in separate interviews with New York Times reporters last week.
Their positions on economic development and the environment have often been overshadowed by auto insurance, abortion and their personal attacks against each other. More often than not they have stressed what their opponent has done in the past, rather than what they, if elected, would do in the future.
Important issues like the new state development plan and the state's pressing need for more affordable housing, which Governor Thomas H. Kean said in 1987 was ''one of the great challenges New Jersey faces,'' have scarcely been mentioned.
The candidates have paid more attention to the environment but new initiatives have been few. Both place a high priority on cleaning the state's air and water.
Mr. Florio proposes creating the new position of environmental prosecutor, charged with pursuing polluters and enforcing existing regulations.
Mr. Courter's primary environmental goal is to split the current Department of Environmental Protection into two separate agencies, one to concentrate on pollution, the other to conserve the state's natural resources.
Mr. Courter said that saving farmland and open space is essential because if not, ''there will no longer be a New Jersey as we know it.''
Cleaning up past mistakes also is an urgent need, he said, but while it is possible for some clean-up efforts to be put off, fields and pastures that are sold and developed are lost forever.
 
Both Dislike Solid Waste Policy
Mr. Courter said he was uncomfortable making such statements because people might incorrectly assume that he was not concerned about pollution. ''Both are important,'' he said. Mr. Courter and Mr. Florio criticized the state's handling of the solid waste crisis. The 21 counties were handed most of the responsibility for taking care of their own garbage once landfills were closed.
Now most counties truck their garbage to other states, leading to substantially higher property tax bills. In addition, most plan to build their own incinerator to burn the garbage. So far one has been built, three are under construction and six others are being reviewed.
''It makes absolutely no sense,'' said Mr. Florio, referring to the possibility that 21 incinerators could be built. He said that if elected he would put an immediate halt to the issuance of incinerator construction permits, taking six months to study ways to increase recycling and regional cooperation.
 
Pay-As-You-Throw Plan
Mr. Courter said he too would try to get counties to share incinerators and reduce the supply of garbage through increased recycling and having households pay fees based on how much garbage they produce, rather than the current flat rate.
One of Governor Kean's thorniest environmental problems was what to do with 5,000 barrels of radon-contaminated soil dug from under houses in Montclair. Community after community in New Jersey rejected the barrels, and they sat piled around the abandoned houses for nearly two years before being shipped to Tennessee.
Mr. Florio said it was foolish to have dug up the dirt without having a place for it. ''The alternative of last resort is taking up the problem from somebody and giving it to somebody else,'' Mr. Florio said. He said he would encourage research into technologies for neutralizing toxic wastes.
Mr. Courter said that because New Jersey is so densely developed, it must rely on federally approved disposal sites in other states for disposing of hazardous materials.
 
Luring Out-of-State Companies
Mr. Courter also said he would not hesitate to look outside the state for corporate tenants to fill new office buildings. Mr. Florio said he would focus economic development efforts on improving the concerns that businesses consider before relocating: housing, traffic congestion and the overall quality of life.
These issues are being addressed by the State Planning Commission as it draws up New Jersey's first development master plan. Both candidates have said little about the plan except to support the general goal of regional coordination.
But farmers and real-estate investors fear the plan may drive down the value of their land. And some fear that because the plan tries to nudge development away from open countryside, urban residents may be pushed out.
Since 1983, when the Supreme Court of New Jersey reiterated the obligation of all communities to provide their fair share of low-cost housing, the issue of putting housing in the suburbs for people of modest means has persisted. And in 1987 state officials estimated that New Jersey needed to build some 145,000 affordable dwellings, most in suburban areas where jobs are located.
Since then about 9,000 have been built or are now under construction.
 
Housing Rarely Mentioned
Despite that shortage, housing has rarely been mentioned during the campaign. Mr. Courter and Mr. Florio both want to simplify regulations. They said that because of high suburban land values and political resistance the state probably cannot meet the Supreme Court's housing objectives, and therefore they both support agreements in which suburbs pay cities to have low-cost housing built there.
Some, including John M. Payne, associate dean of Rutgers Law School and president of the Alliance for Affordable Housing, a nonprofit organization, disagree with that stand.
''I don't know whose nose is growing now,'' said Mr. Payne, referring to television commercials in which both candidates are portrayed as Pinocchio. ''I don't know of any basis for anyone to conclude that a suburban affordable housing strategy does not work.''

HEADLINE: Outdoors: A Reel of Diplomacy

BYLINE: By RICHARD LYONS

DATELINE: ANDORRA LA VELLA, ANDORRA

 BODY:
I WAS sitting in what passes for the Oval Office in this tiny principality high in the Pyrenees talking about fishing with several of Andorra's government officials when Prime Minister Josip Pintat walked into the office.
''Don't you dare say anything about fishing to the Prime Minister,'' demanded Roser Jordana de Madero, in her best Oxford-accented English.
I had come to this tiny mountain nation tucked between France and Spain to go fishing, having been here last year and seeing some of the trout. But I had to leave before I could try out a rod and reel. 
Now, a year later, I was back only to discover that the fishing season had closed for the year two weeks before my arrival. I kicked myself for not checking the dates more closely, but decided to confront the authorities.
So I appealed to Senora Jordana, who not only acts as Andorra's spokeswoman to the world as she is fluent in English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and her native Catalan, but also issues the fishing licenses.
I wanted special permission to fish, a permit she was reluctant to grant since one had never been issued before, ever. She realized I was going to appeal to the Prime Minister in the course of an interview about local economics, and considered it a waste of his valuable time; she quickly offered a deal.
''I'll speak to the Minister of Agriculture and if he approves I'll grant you a license to fish for one day that will permit you to catch one fish, only one,'' she said.
I agreed. The Minister agreed. So after the interview we both went to Senora Jordana's office so she could write the license.
''What is your nationality,'' she asked. ''I'm American; you know that,'' I said.
''Yes, but you have to be French, Spanish, English or German,'' she said. ''The application says so. For the day let's just say you're a Frenchman, you don't really have to speak French to the French.''
I agreed to be a Frenchman for a day.
''What is your marital status?'' she asked.
''Why is that needed for a special fishing license?'' I retorted. ''In Andorra, a Catholic country, I would be considered married but in the United States I am considered to be divorced. Besides, I want a fishing license, not a marriage license.''
The diminutive Senora Jordana shot me a piercing look and said: ''O.K., for the record let's say you're single. License approved. We'll skip the requirements for triplicate photographs and wave the license fee of 2,000 pesetas in the interest of Andorran-American friendship.''
She handed me two official looking documents containing sealed stamps and pointed me on the road to Llac, whose real name is Engolaster, a favorite among the 60 lakes in Andorra that are stocked with fish.
The view of the mountains and valleys was almost enough to take my breath away, and at an altitude of 5,360 feet, it almost did.
I drove several miles up a mountain until the road ended, then made it on foot for half an hour to a woodcutter's bunkhouse maintained by the local hydroelectric power authority.
I immediately flashed my special pass to the chief woodcutter, Senor Francisco, who regarded it with some suspicion until phone calls were made to the authorities.
I then ingratiated myself with Senora Francisco by giving vivid descriptions of my love for ''Los Trutas,'' views she said she shared, and proved her point by launching into a long fishing story spoken in Catalan while I nodded enthusiastically.
Eventually, sensing that I was simpatico about fishing, she loaned me an old rod with a Mitchell reel, some spinning lures and a plastic bucket for the fish. Then I headed for the lake, a 20-minute walk through the woods.
Half a dozen casts and I had the hang of it. I thought.
''Parlez vous Francais?'' a voice said behind me. Answering yes, the speaker who appeared to be out for a walk, said the tip of my rod was too high, and left, shaking his head.
''Habla usted el espanol?'' a voice said behind me. Again answering yes to yet another nature hiker, he said the tip of my rod was too low, and left, muttering.
A few minutes later, Jordi Bartumeu, the engineer in charge of the hydroelectric project, stopped by. His second job is game warden. He demonstrated a few tricks with the rod, pointed out the spots where the fish usually were thickest and mercifully left. I was a duffer and he knew it.
But suddenly, five minutes later, I got a bite, a proper bite, a fish that jumped and thrashed and leaped and fought. I pulled and tugged and reeled and prayed that the 2-pound test line would hold, and with a mighty heave threw the fish over my head onto the bank.
''Do you speak English?'' said a voice behind me. I was too euphoric to speak, so he continued, ''Rainbow trout, a beauty, used to catch them all the time in Kenya.''
I flopped on the bank alongside my fish and Major John King, East African Rifles Retired, or something like that, started telling me fishing stories from the bush, from India, from Western Australia. The sun never sets on fishing in the Empire, that sort of stuff.
I begged leave as gracefully as I could, returned the gear to Senora Francisco, gave her 200 pesetas over her violent protests, walked back to my car, returned to Andorra la Vella, and invited the disbelieving Senora Jordana to lunch at the best restaurant in the city.
Chef Claude Marty was ecstatic. ''Beautiful fish, at least a kilo; I'll cook it with a little butter and lemon,'' he said.
Chef Claude's estimate of the weight was a bit overdone, but not his preparation of the trout, and other diners around us at lunch eyed the platter greedily when it was set before me, wondering where I had gotten it. Trout had not been on the menu here in two weeks and they are a favorite dish in Andorra.
Senora Jordana gave me the ''don't you dare say one word'' sort of look, squelching my would-be braggadocio over the fish, and thus also saving herself endless explanations of why a foreigner could fish out of season when an Andorran couldn't.

HEADLINE: Shipments Of Steel Declining

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Reflecting a slowdown in the automobile and construction industries, steel shipments are below their year-ago level. Several analysts predict that total shipments in the second half of the year will be down as much as 15 percent from the comparable period of 1988.
As a result, total steel industry earnings, which have increased steadily over the last three years, will begin to fall this year, analysts say. They also predict intensifying competition among steel producers and possibly some price cutting. 
 
Drop in Shipments Expected
Several analysts estimate that industry shipments, which were about 84 million tons last year, will fall to about 81 million tons this year and to 75 million tons in 1990. The predictions take into account a drop in business from automobile makers, as well as makers of appliances, machinery and construction materials.
''Things won't get much better in the coming months, either,'' said John Jacobson, an economist with the AUS Group in Philadelphia. ''Profits and shipments are likely to be at their their lowest point in the last few years.''
Already, steel prices have fallen to their lowest point in more than two years, and operating rates for the nation's steel mills have tumbled to an average of 80 percent in the third quarter, from nearly 90 percent a year earlier.
Still, analysts say the effect on steel companies, which will report earnings later this month, will be less severe than in previous periods of declining shipments. For one thing, they say, steel companies are leaner and have lowered their break-even levels.
''Steel companies should still be profitable next year,'' said Christopher Plummer, an analyst with the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''With the improvements that have come in efficiency over the last few years, operating profits should still be fairly good.''
Mr. Plummer further explained that the decline in steel shipments and orders was ''a natural part of the industry's cycle,'' adding that ''after a 24-month boom period, you can expect market conditions to alter somewhat.''
Steel industry executives said the decline in shipments was generally in line with their expectations of market conditions this year. Many said they had altered their production and employment levels in anticipation of those conditions.
''We've been in a cost-cutting mode for a number of years,'' said Gary Millenbruch, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's third-largest steel producer. ''We have already been under the strategy of divesting our underperforming assets and modernizing our facilities.''
Steel shipments were down to about 19 million tons in the third quarter from 20.3 million tons in the quarter last year, Mr. Plummer said. That compares with an average of 22 million tons in the preceding two quarters, which were down slightly from the 1988 period.
Some steel industry executives discount the premise that price competition will result from the downturn in industry shipments and prices. They contend that they learned their lesson after the wrenching industrywide recession of the early 1980's, which left steel companies discounting prices in a desperate attempt to cling to market share.
''No one wants a return to those days,'' said a marketing executive at a large steel company who asked to remain anonymous. ''I think that the major steel companies have seen what can happen when you begin to have intensified price competition. No one wants that to happen again.'' As evidence of the industry's resolve to avoid such a scenario, executives point to the period after the six-month labor dispute at the USX Corporation that began in the summer of 1986. When the shutdown ended, steel prices, defying analysts' predictions, remained firm.
Nonetheless some operators of steel service centers - the industry intermediaries who cut and shape steel to customers' specifications -say that they have begun to see evidence of price competition.
While most steel companies will report their earnings within the next two weeks, Inland Steel Industries, which operates the nation's fourth-largest steel company, last week said that its third-quarter earnings plunged 70 percent from the year-earlier period.
''The short-term business outlook is clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets,'' said Inland's chairman, Frank Luerssen. ''The modest downturn of economic growth that began in the third quarter is reflected in some continued softness in our steel and service center markets.''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
When the Panic Failed to Happen

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE stock market news of last week, as in a famous Sherlock Holmes story where the key clue was that a dog failed to bark, may be more in what did not happen than in what did.
What did not happen was a panic, either by institutional investors who had leaped to get out late in the day the previous Friday or by anxious individual investors, a breed often spoken of on Wall Street as if they were far too naive and innocent to be exposed to the fact that, as J. P. Morgan once said, prices will fluctuate.
''As frightened as everybody appeared to be, you would have thought the scare would keep them away from the market,'' said Robert Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. Instead, retail customers of that firm were net buyers every day last week, and United States and foreign institutions joined in the buying. Mutual funds reported cash came in for equity funds. 
Early in the week, it was a blue-chip rally only. But by Thursday the party had spread throughout the market. On that day 1,235 issues went up in price on the New York Stock Exchange, the most for any day since June 8, 1988.
In short, investors showed a willingness to believe that the 6.9 percent plunge of Friday the 13th was no more real than the 22.6 percent drop of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average went down an unprecedented 508 points.
The 1987 crash did not presage a recession, let alone a Great Depression, and anyone who worked up the nerve to buy that day profited handsomely. That is a lesson that seems to have been well learned by both individual and instituional investors. As such, what may be happening is that investors are gradually accepting that even sharp market setbacks are nothing but buying opportunities and always will be.
That attitude is not unprecedented. The late 1920's were filled with sharp and quick setbacks for the market, but the fear factor gradually subsided. The culmination of that attitude came in the first week of December 1928, when the Dow dived 11.5 percent in a single week. It was the worst week for the average in 13 years, and was front-page news. In an era when stocks could be bought for 10 percent down, with the rest on a margin loan, such a fall was distressing indeed.
But judging from statistics on margin loans, public investors were not sent into panic selling. Instead, they came up with money to meet their margin calls, confident that a runway bull market would soon be back on track. And they were right. All the week's loss, and more, was made up within the next three weeks, and by the end of that month, the Dow was soon comfortably back setting new records.
In 1929, there were several sharp breaks, each a false warning. Then came the big one, in October, and those who assumed that it would be like all the rest were very wrong.
A quick market recovery certainly does not mean this is 1929 again. But it is interesting, and perhaps a sign of overconfidence, that traders were so quickly willing to believe that the quick 190-point fall said nothing about the economy and everything about the market itself. Those seeking reasons for the plunge focused first on an investor group's inability to finance a leveraged buyout of the UAL Corporation, and on what that said about the ability of future takeovers to be completed. But after that, the talk turned to imperfections in market structure that allow a market to fall 190 points on one day, and then regain almost 120 points over the following week, all without much in the way of fundamental economic news.
Had the decline continued, the program traders would no doubt have been blamed. They were largely forgotten as the market rose, but it is clear that much trading on Monday and Tuesday, in particular, was futures related. And one reason given for the rise on Thursday was forecasts that the expiration of October stock index options and futures on Friday would create a surge of buying. It did, but the increase Friday was a narrow one. The international economic situation got little attention in all the market talk, and it was virtually overlooked that important foreign markets had been sliding for a couple of weeks as central banks pushed up interest rates and brought on recession fears. There was no mention of the fact that fewer United States companies raised dividends in September than in any month in the past three years.
In the Holmes story ''Silver Blaze'' the lack of barking showed the dog thought all was normal when it was not. Last week's market action shows that investors now think plunges are normal and view them as opportunities for profit, not warnings of significant problems in the economy.
In the end, stock prices must be related to the state of the economy and to the outlook for the businesses the shareholders own. Index futures, program trading, circuit breakers and all the other paraphernalia of the 1980's may create volatility and opportunities, but they cannot change that fact. If it is forgotten by the time this bull market ends, it may make the eventual fall that much more surprising, and painful.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Offer Plan to Curb Farm Support

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 22

 BODY:
The United States will put forward in Geneva this week a plan to phase out many American farm programs if other countries agree to similar cutbacks. The offer is part of negotiations to end trade distortion in agriculture by the next century.
The strength of farm lobbies here and in Europe has created some skepticism about the plan, which will be introduced this week by Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills.
Officials from the European Community, which has 8 percent of its population on farms, compared with 3 percent in the United States, say it is unrealistic to expect governments to end support for farmers. 
 
'We Should Do It Also'
And the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, commented, ''I'm not going to be too terribly upset about what they're talking about now, because I just don't think it's going to get done.''
Mr. de la Garza said there was still ''basic agreement that we should try to ease out of major trade-distorting activities,'' adding, ''If other countries do it, then we should do it also.''
Among the American programs most affected would be those for dairy products and sugar, where price supports are set well above market levels, leading to overproduction, Administration officials said.
The plan, a high-priority undertaking several years in formulation under both the Bush and Reagan Administrations, calls on governments to stop making payments to farmers eventually, except in cases where the money would not distort either production or trade.
 
Uneasy About Proposals
Other American lawmakers were uneasy about the proposals. Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of a Senate trade subcommittee, said the ideas ''seem to be as much aimed at eliminating portions of the U.S. farm program that they oppose as at opening foreign markets. ''
For this round of trade talks, Washington has changed strategy. Most obstacles take the shape of quotas, variable levies and government licensing systems. These would be converted into tariffs, which are generally considered the barrier that least distorts trade. The tariffs would then be negotiated down in stages.
The proposals, which are being made at the start of a new phase of the three-year-old global trade talks known as the Uruguay Round, also call for eliminating market access barriers in farm products over 10 years and dismantling export subsidies over 5 years.
Administration officials briefed Congressional staff members and farm associations on the plan last week and expect to present it formally on Wednesday at a Geneva meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the 97-nation trade agency that is sponsoring the international negotiations.
 
European Criticism Seen
Although many nations have already agreed that the Uruguay Round should achieve ''substantial and progressive'' reduction of trade-distorting agricultural programs, the Administration's plan is likely to run into criticism in Europe, which seeks a slower pace of change.
Washington has been sharply critical of the community's agriculture policies, which use variable levies that curb imports and high price supports that stimulate production. Export subsidies then unload the excess production on world markets, depressing world prices.
But the United States, chiefly in dairy products and sugar, and Japan, chiefly in rice, also maintain tough barriers to market access.
A community official declined to comment on the American proposals ''until they could be studied'' but added that the 12-nation bloc was preparing its own ''comprehensive approach'' on the farm talks to be offered in about a month. Japanese officials also declined to comment.
 
U.S. Efficiency Seen
The Administration contends that the United States is the world's most efficient producer and that if trade-distorting policies are eliminated, American farmers will win back huge shares of the global market.
Elimination of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy would result, for example, in a $7 billion improvement in the American trade balance, the office of the United States trade representative calculated in a report this year.
Another rationale is the need for budget savings. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development placed the cost of agricultural support in the United States in 1988 at $73.8 billion, compared with $119.4 billion in the European Community.
 
Tariff Safeguards
Although the proposals envisage phasing out domestic farm programs that distort trade, they also call for safeguards that would allow reimposing tariff protection in case surges in imports injure local producers.
To prevent health and safety rules from being used as trade barriers, the United States calls for every country to adopt parallel standards.
To get serious talks under way, the American paper calls on trading partners to identify policies that most distort trade and then suggests how they should be phased out.
''There's room for negotiation,'' an Administration official stressed. ''We're not going to do this unilaterally. We'll only go as far as anyone else does and no further.''
 
Quotas for Australia
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (Reuters) - Australia has accepted new steel quotas on shipments to the United States and will back a new American farm trade proposal, its trade negotiations minister said on Friday.
The new quotas will allow big increases in exports during the next two and a half years and will follow an accord that recently ended, said the minister, Michael Duffy, after meeting with the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, and Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter.
New quotas were reached earlier with the European Community and some smaller producers, United States trade officials said.
Mr. Duffy also said he backed the farm trade proposal that Mrs. Hills will present next week.
He said the proposal called for curbs on commodity export subsidies and domestic farm supports and an end to limits on agricultural imports.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Chile Plans to Create Strong Central Bank

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Oct. 22

 BODY:
As it prepares to turn over power to elected civilians, the Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet is creating an autonomous central bank that it says will help preserve Chile's hard-won economic stability, growth and modernization.
Under a law to take effect Dec. 11, three days before presidential elections, a five-member independent council will be created to run the bank. It will direct monetary and exchange-rate policies and regulate the financial system.
The move is opposed by economic advisers to Patricio Aylwin, the Christian Democratic Party leader who is favored to win the presidency. They say the new central bank will be too powerful, going beyond the United States Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank. 
''It's one of various indications that this Government, while planning to hand over the Government, is trying to hand over as little power as possible,'' said Jose Pablo Arellano, executive director of Cieplan, an economic research organization that is expected to dominate economic policy in an Aylwin government.
 
Underlying Motives
But Alfonso Serrano, vice president of the current central bank, said critics of the plan do not really want an autonomous bank but want to be free to use monetary and fiscal policy in political ways.
''Everybody - the opposition and the Government - agrees on the need to maintain our macroeconomic equilibria,'' Mr. Serrano said. ''But something in the political process in Latin America has always made that difficult to do. Having an institution on the margin of the political situation would help guarantee stability.''
By creating an autonomous central bank, Chile is treading on new ground for a Latin American country. In neighboring Argentina, the new Government of President Carlos Saul Menem has committed itself to creating an independent central bank.
Mr. Serrano, one of a four-member panel that drafted the Chilean law, said the regulations studied as models were mainly those of the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank.
 
Sense of Well-Being
''I don't think there is anyone in Chile who doesn't remember the sense of well-being in 1971, the first year of the government of Salvador Allende, with the relatively low inflation and high incomes,'' he said. ''But an autonomous central bank would have seen that the expansion of spending would bring problems.''
By the time Mr. Allende was overthrown by the armed forces in 1973, the fiscal deficit was running 25 percent of gross national product, Mr. Serrano said. Inflation was running at an annual rate of about 1,000 percent.
The Pinochet Government reversed the nationalization and property confiscations and set out to build a free-market economy. Foreign banks laden with petrodollars poured loans into Chile until the foreign debt crisis, which hit the country in 1982-83 simultaneously with the collapse in copper prices.
After a painful depression like that of the 1930's in the United States, Chile began to rebuild its economy around diversified exports, especially fruit, forestry and sea products, and a low exchange rate for the peso relative to hard currencies. The result has been five years of strong economic performance, topped by growth that ran 10 percent on an annual basis for the first half of this year.
 
Inheriting a Surplus
The new Government is expected to inherit a fiscal surplus, healthy reserves, and a well-managed foreign-debt situation. Hernan Buchi, who was finance minister until he resigned in March and began a campaign to try to overtake Mr. Aylwin in the presidential race, is given much of the credit for the success.
Mr. Arellano said he and others on the Aylwin team agree with the departing Government on the need to maintain economic balance and intend to do so, if Mr. Aylwin is elected. But he argued that creation of an independent central bank was not necessary as a means of preventing deficit financing because the Constitution, adopted in 1980, already states that the central bank may not print new money to cover a fiscal shortfall, the common Latin American method when foreign loans are not available.
He said the best example of what he considered excessive autonomy for the new Chilean bank was its right to determine and regulate foreign-exchange policy, which he said would set it apart from the Federal Reserve. He said that would effectively remove from presidential influence such significant matters as the access of foreign investors to foreign exchange for the remittance of profits.
The other significant criticism from the Aylwin team is that President Pinochet will be able to name the first five members of the central bank's governing council. Although the terms are eventually to be 10 years, this first group will have terms of 2 to 10 years to create staggered terms for the future.

HEADLINE: U.S. MOVES TO LIMIT RACKETEERING LAW IN BUSINESS CASES

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
In moves that could significantly limit the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants, the Justice Department has revised rules governing the use of the racketeering law by Federal prosecutors.
The revisions limit both the types of crimes that can be used as the basis of a racketeering indictment and the amount of money that the Government can seize before trial. In addition, they require prosecutors to prove that innocent third parties will not be harmed by the forfeiture requirements of the racketeering law.
The law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, was originally aimed at organized crime and drug traffickers when it was passed in 1970. But lawyers and legal scholars have debated its use against white-collar defendants in securities fraud cases since the first such indictment was brought in 1988. 
 
Forerunner of Other Cases
That indictment, which charged five principals of Princeton/Newport Partners L.P. and a former trader with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with engaging in a racketeering conspiracy, broke the ground for a number of other RICO cases. These included the indictment of Michael R. Milken, the former head of Drexel's high-yield ''junk bond'' unit and racketeering indictments against scores of commodity traders in Chicago who were charged with cheating customers.
Under the law, a defendant who engages in a pattern of crimes through a so-called criminal enterprise can be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit all proceeds gained through the enterprise, if convicted. In addition, before a trial begins, the Government can seek to freeze a defendant's assets to preserve what it thinks is forfeitable.
Many of the cases in the securities area were brought under the supervision of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney in Manhattan who is now running for Mayor of New York. It is unclear if Mr. Giuliani's departure from the office had any impact on the Justice Department's view.
Some in legal circles contend that use of the law in white-collar cases has resulted in unintended consequences, such as damaging people unrelated to the crime. Those results, these experts said, may have prompted the Justice Department to act before Congress or the courts did.
''What you're seeing is the Justice Department responding to the risk of a legislative backlash,'' said Michael Goldsmith, a law professor at Brigham Young University and a vice chairman of the RICO cases committee of the American Bar Association. ''With RICO, there are situations where innocent parties are left unprotected.''
Legal experts also said that the new rules were a response to problems that had been observed in the law's recent use in nondrug cases. ''They represent a codification of common sense,'' said G. Robert Blakey, a law professor at the Notre Dame Law School who helped draft the racketeering law. ''What we are doing is learning that as RICO is applied outside of drug areas, it has to be applied differently.''
The revisions and clarifications of the Justice Department's position on the law were described in two internal memorandums to United States Attorneys across the country. The memorandums, which have been seen by a number of lawyers in New York legal circles, add new rules regarding forfeiture proceedings and clarify the rules regarding the use of charges of tax violations in prosecutions under the law.
 
Press Criticism Cited
In the forfeiture memorandum, Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., the Assistant Attorney General for the criminal division, wrote that the purpose of the new policy was ''to insure that the rights of all interested parties are protected.'' He added that the revisions were being made in response to ''considerable criticism in the press'' of the racketeering law's use.
Under the new forfeiture rules, prosecutors are required to provide details on the impact of an asset freeze on third parties not named in the indictment. That impact would have to be balanced against the need to preserve assets for forfeiture. The rules also require that prosecutors announce shortly after the indictment that the Government will work to protect the rights of innocent third parties.
In the Princeton/Newport case, defense lawyers argued that the efforts to freeze the partnership's assets led to its collapse. It is unclear whether the partnership would have dissolved had the indictment only charged securities fraud or tax fraud, and not racketeering.
However, people who have spoken with Justice Department officials said the collapse of Princeton/Newport, which led to the unemployment of scores of people, had left the department more sensitive to the possible impact of RICO charges on innocent parties in white-collar cases.
 
Proportional Amount Backed
The new forfeiture rules also require the Government to seek an amount proportional to the crime charged, rather than the fullest amount it can recover under the law. In all the RICO cases involving securities and commodity law violations, the Government has been criticized for seeking to punish defendants to a degree disproportionate to the crime committed.
In the Princeton/Newport case, which ended in convictions, the Government sought $21.5 million from the six defendants. The jury agreed to award only $3.8 million, with $3 million coming from a single defendant.
In addition, the new forfeiture provisions require that a prosecutor demonstrate to Justice Department officials that a remedy that is ''less intrusive'' than an asset freeze will not preserve the assets for the Government in the event of a conviction.
 
Tax Rules Clarified
In a separate memorandum from Shirley D. Peterson, the head of the department's tax division, the rules regarding the use of tax violations as the basis for a racketeering indictment were also clarified. Those rules, first reported in Newsday, would restrict the use of tax violations to bring RICO charges ''Tax offenses are not predicate to RICO offenses,'' Ms. Peterson wrote, noting that such a ruling was expressly stated by Congress. ''Charging a tax offense as a mail fraud charge could be viewed as circumventing Congressional intent unless unique circumstances justifying the use of mail fraud charges exist,'' like using the mails to lure people into fraudulent tax shelter schemes.
Such a rule would have made the bulk of the initial charges in the Princeton/Newport case more difficult to bring, legal experts said. At the time of the Princeton/Newport indictment, Mr. Giuliani said that using the mail fraud laws in tax cases was permitted under RICO.
''Criticism of the Princeton/Newport case lies behind this,'' said Gerard Lynch, a professor at the Columbia University School of Law. ''And it does so in a way that would impose a greater burden of justification on a United States Attorney in bringing that indictment.''
 
Doubts on Application
Justice Department officials did not return calls yesterday seeking comment on the memorandums.

HEADLINE: Let the Dollar Drift

 BODY:
One reason the financial markets are jittery is the increasing tension between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve over the value of the dollar. The Treasury wants to push the dollar down and thus push exports up. The Federal Reserve resists. 
On balance, the Fed position is safer. In the wake of the recent stock market shock, there's good reason for the Treasury to give ground and give financial markets a clear, consistent signal about U.S. policy.
Aside from the market plunge, the dollar keeps rising, despite a stubbornly high trade imbalance. Exactly why is unclear. Perhaps the rise is an irrational ''bubble'' inflated by speculative whim. Or perhaps the U.S. continues to serve as a safe haven for foreign investors scared by political turmoil. Whatever the reason, experts agree that the higher dollar will greatly widen the trade deficit.
The dollar's volatility is undesirable. First it falls, making U.S. exports less expensive. The nation's export industries expand. Then the dollar rises. After considerable delay, export industries shrink and workers are wrenched back and forth painfully. The economy would be better off if these ups and down were eliminated.
But attempts to control the dollar can do serious economic harm. Merely buying and selling foreign currencies - a decision the Treasury dictates - does little to offset strong market forces, as recent events resoundingly prove. To lower the value of the dollar effectively, the Fed must pump up the money supply in order to lower domestic interest rates. That way, investors will turn away from dollars to other currencies.
What is the risk? Higher inflation. The Fed says no to this distortion of its monetary policy because its primary task is to stifle inflation.
One way to choose between two policies is to ask what happens when worse comes to worst. If the Fed's hands-off policy prevails, the dollar will likely rise and the deficit worsen. Eventually, these trends may reverse themselves with short-term dislocations to export and import industries. But while these dislocations may fan protectionist fires, the economic costs might not be large. The nation's trade deficit has recently fallen by more than 40 percent without noticeable misfortune.
If the Treasury policy prevails, however, the nation could be subjected to an inflationary surge. The public knows the costs of that. The Fed would eventually have to clamp down, forcing a recession with a prolonged rise in unemployment and drop in output. The 1982-83 recession offered a harsh demonstration of just how damaging the Fed's anti-inflationary policies can be.
The Fed might decide, as a reaction to another stock market plunge or for other reasons unrelated to the dollar, that a sluggish domestic economy needs a charge in the form of lower interest rates. But until that judgment is made, the Fed would be wise to stick to its current monetary policy. Let the dollar drift. There's much less danger in no action than in overreaction.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
How to Embarrass Americans

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The plain truth is that it is getting a little embarrassing for an American to talk to foreigners.
That is something new, at least for me. You know how it is - usually when you travel abroad or talk to people at the United Nations, say, you have a tendency to jump in and defend the United States Government against criticism.
There is so much criticism and so much is so ignorant or self-righteous that you get sick of it. Sometimes we find ourselves in prickly defense of people and policies that we are not all that wild about. When I lived in India many years ago, to listen to me you would think I thought John Foster Dulles was God's gift to diplomacy when actually I thought that sometimes he was bonkers. 
But now they ask you questions, about the President of the United States and his vision of morality, that you do not want to answer, anyway not among people who are not members of the family.
They ask you if the President of the United States really means it when he says a poor girl raped by her father should not be helped to get an abortion, or if he really believes that the United States should not contribute a few dollars to help deal with the population explosion that is suffocating countries around the world, or if he really thinks it is all right to sell semiautomatic assault weapons across the counter, just as long as they are American-made.
When Ronald Reagan said things like that you could say all right, I don't agree but that is what Ronald Reagan really believes. That was why he was so often so effective -what you saw was what he was and everybody knew it.
What makes the questions so embarrassing to answer for me is that I find it impossible to believe that George Bush means what he says about abortion for rape and incest, about boycotting birth control, and about allowing the sale of the weapons of the drug-gang killers.
After all, it was only eight years ago that Mr. Bush let it be known that although he was against Federal funds for abortion he would not fight Federal aid in the case of rape or incest. I cannot think of a single thing that would have made him change his mind except political opportunism.
If opportunism were a crime we would all wear jail clothes one time or another. But it does not sit right in the stomach for a President to change his mind about that issue, to say that now he believes that Federal aid can go to everybody from ballet dancers to hog raisers, but not to a young woman without money carrying her father's baby.
Next to food and water, what dozens of countries in this world need most is birth control. To withhold it, to insist that their thin gruel be divided into more and more bowls, no end in sight, is cruelty. It is also racial and economic discrimination of a particularly evil sort.
Most Western countries can afford to give their people the basic education about their bodies essential to a birth control system. If they do not, that is their choice - and their people's loss.
But many nations in Asia, Latin America and Africa need help in population control. It is ugly for this country, where birth control is accepted and practiced by most of the people, to deny it to others because they are both non-American and poor.
A man as traveled and sophisticated as George Bush knows the importance of population control. So do his friends and relatives.
But he announces that he will veto any Congressional effort to restore the paltry United States contribution to the United Nations population fund, because of some cockamamie excuse that some of the money may help abortion in China - which it will not.
Guns: The Bush stand on semiautomatic weapons would have the makings of a comedy routine if it came from a less intelligent man. Ban semis made abroad but for Heaven's sake, not those made in the good old U.S. of A. Die American!
Does he honestly believe this makes sense? When he is alone with his wife, or with himself? It cannot be. So, it is sad to feel that the President is saying things he cannot believe.
But the country is way ahead of him on abortion for rape, population control and the stupidity of selling weapons designed to spray murder in the streets.
Since he is part of the country, maybe one day Mr. Bush will catch up and allow his heart and mouth to be in harmony. Then we can all travel without embarrassment, and be just as prickly about America as usual.

HEADLINE: Solidarity Struggles - With Democracy

BYLINE: By David K. Shipler; David K. Shipler is senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
It's a thrill to watch former political prisoners and underground Solidarity activists sitting in the august chamber of Poland's new Parliament, debating budget bills and tax legislation. This is the Communist world's most dramatic revolution so far. It is also sobering to see how difficult the construction of a democratic system of government is proving to be, mechanically and psychologically.
More than four decades with a rubber-stamp Parliament left Poland without an effective legislative branch. Many new legislators, immersed for years in the moral certitudes of the dissident opposition, have found themselves unprepared for the compromises of democratic politics. 
''The underground is a bad school for learning democracy,'' said Henryk Wujec, a Solidarity member of Parliament who spent time in prison. ''In the underground, you can't vote on anything. I decide, that's it. Now our movement is not so tolerant as in '80-'81,'' before it was driven underground by martial law.
As a result, some Solidarity leaders are demanding unwavering support from their legislators, he said, and many legislators are overreacting by resisting any party discipline at all.
''They think that in a democratic system you have to debate and vote on everything,'' Mr. Wujec lamented. ''If all the time you have many debates and voting, it is a caricature of a democratic system.'' This and the risk that Poland will fail to recover economically could discredit democracy, he fears. ''People will think it's not a good system and will want a demagogic system.''
Party discipline is an essential goal for Bronislaw Geremek, a former political prisoner who is Solidarity's floor leader in the Sejm, the lower house, where his party holds only 35 percent of the seats. ''In our parliamentary group,'' he said, ''we have no discipline. Everyone votes as he wants to. When we introduced the idea of discipline, everybody said no, that's the old Communist system.''
So strong is the association of bloc voting with Bolshevik authoritarianism that some Solidarity legislators were shocked to learn in a recent seminar that such discipline is often a feature of Western democracies.
Parliament also faces logistical difficulties. Most members have no offices, desks and telephones. They crowd several to an office, rotating from one desk to another. ''We are trying to organize to give one room for three or four senators,'' said Andrzej Wielowieyski, Solidarity leader in the Senate, the newly created upper house. ''I do not even have one room for every committee.''
The legislators have no staff to speak of, nothing like the full-time aides on whom Congressmen in Washington depend to help write and analyze legislation and keep in touch with constituents' concerns.
Since there is no budget yet for staff, the 260 members from Solidarity and other coalition parties who have organized into a caucus called the Citizens Parliamentary Club are tithing, in effect, by contributing one-tenth of their $10 a month salaries to pay for secretaries.
Many secretaries worked with Solidarity in its underground days, then moved to Parliament, at first as unpaid volunteers. This has given the club's small suite of offices the same unpretentious, frenetic atmosphere as a strike headquarters. It has also drawn high-caliber people such as Teresa Ogrodzinska, who has given up her profession as a drama critic to be a secretary, explaining: ''It is fascinating work.''
This is not such an odd place for a drama critic. Many new legislators feel a bit miscast. ''We are amateurs,'' said Andrzej Stelmachowski, a Solidarity lawyer who has become speaker of the Senate. ''This is something new for me. It seems like a dream. I feel I am playing a strange role in a theater.''
Others seem to wear power as uncomfortably as Jacek Kuron wears his ill-fitting suit. Mr. Kuron, the gravelly voiced Solidarity theorist who has become Labor Minister, took the rostrum recently to respond to demands from the lower house that he apologize for long delays in pension payments to some workers. This was not his doing, since he inherited his ministry in mid-September, when the new Government was formed.
He did not look happy as he faced fellow legislators. He wriggled. He shifted from foot to foot. He bellowed, ''It's a great idea to find whoever is responsible for this'' - he started to say ''bordello'' and got half the word out when he remembered where he was. The chamber exploded in laughter and applause. ''We can apologize,'' he continued, ''but that is not enough. If I start to apologize by mail, that would be the end of our postal system!''
Democracy is proving to be tough work. Mr. Kuron and his colleagues understand that pretty soon they are going to be held accountable.

HEADLINE: The Welfare War Between the States

BYLINE: By Joe Strohl; Joe Strohl, a Democrat, is majority leader of the Wisconsin state senate.

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis.

 BODY:
Much has been written about the wars waged between states to attract new jobs. A similar war is being waged in welfare reform. Some states keep welfare benefits low so that some of their residents will move to more socially responsible states. 
This is the case between Wisconsin and Illinois. Wisconsin pays a family of three $517 monthly in Aid for Families with Dependent Children welfare benefits; Illinois pays $342.
Studies have shown that since 1986 nearly one-third of new welfare cases in Wisconsin recently moved here from other states. Of the total number of new welfare recipients who moved to Wisconsin in the past three years, almost 30 percent were from neighboring Illinois. Most settle in the southeast part of the state, in five counties near the Illinois border.
Higher benefits are not the only reason people move to Wisconsin, but it is a major factor. And we are suffering the consequences.
As more new residents go on welfare, our work and training programs are increasingly strained. Wisconsin is also experiencing a growing strain on its schools and juvenile correction facilities, an increase in gang-related crime and housing shortages. There also is an increased demand for already overextended social service programs such as out-patient treatment for alcohol and drug abuse.
But who's really to blame for Wisconsin's predicament? The United States Congress.
When Congress passed the Family Support Act of 1987, many viewed it as the first major overhaul of the nation's welfare system in 25 years, one that would result in welfare recipients leaving the welfare roles for meaningful employment. Congress, however, ignored one of the major problems with the Aid for Families with Dependent Children program -it does nothing to correct the disparities in state benefit levels.
In an effort to resolve this situation, I have proposed state legislation to set Aid for Familes with Dependent Children benefits for new residents at the level granted in their home state for their first six months in Wisconsin. Wisconsin benefit levels would apply after the person had resided in Wisconsin for six months.
Opponents of this two-tier system argue that Wisconsin is not a welfare magnet and further suggest that such a system will hurt the poor. I disagree on both charges.
First, it is unrealistic and insulting to Aid for Familes with Dependent Children recipients to suggest that they do not weigh the economic advantages of relocating their families. This is a basic consideration for anybody making a move.
Second, my proposal is not designed to hurt anyone. We will treat people as their home state did.
Those who oppose my proposal to set welfare payments for new residents at the level they received in their home state should focus their efforts on increasing benefits in states like Mississippi and Alabama. There, Aid for Families with Dependent Children benefits are so low - $120 and $118 respectively - that a family cannot even afford basic necessities.
In addition, they should apply pressure at the Federal level to establish uniform benefit levels for each state. Low benefit states must accept responsibility, as Wisconsin has, for building social programs to enable people to rise out of poverty.

HEADLINE: Courter and Florio Contrast Most Over Social Issues

SERIES: Courter and Florio On the Issues - Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The two candidates running for governor of New Jersey appear in starkest contrast when they speak about social questions facing the state, like how to fight crime, drugs and AIDS, and whether government should place new restrictions on abortions.
Both the Democrat, Representative James J. Florio, and the Republican, Representative Jim Courter, agree on a commonplace of politics today: the level of street crime is intolerable and has to be fought with increased arrests and tougher laws. Both candidates say behind the rise in crime and AIDS stands a drug epidemic, a problem that the state has to attack as a priority.
Mr. Florio differs from Mr. Courter by seeing a solution in more active and effective government. Among his priorities, Mr. Florio says, are a ban on assault rifles to limit drug dealers' armories and programs to create jobs, housing and hope in cities. 
''There are certain settings out of which crime breeds,'' Mr. Florio said. ''Some of us get accused of being sort of syrupy or we're not macho enough, because you start talking about the environment, that causes crime.''
Mr. Courter, by contrast, sees the triple-headed scourge of crime, drugs and AIDS as growing out of an era of flawed values in which people were no longer held ere accountable for their actions. In Mr. Courter's view, it was an era in which criminals were able to tempt almost everyone with drugs at prices that anyone could afford.
In the long run, Mr. Courter said, Americans will overcome the drug plague with the strength and good judgment they have demonstrated in past crises. In the meantime, he added, government can help, within the limits of its budgets, by providing added law enforcement, drug treatment and education, and by helping AIDS patients receive expensive new drugs to battle the disease.
''You know,'' Mr. Courter said, ''we in American society have suffered through and gone through extraordinary tests -war. We have suffered through depressions, and we've gone through civil wars. We've gone through world wars, and we're going through a drug war. This society is resilient. It recognizes the potential risks.'' The candidates presented their views on those and other issues last week in separate inteviews with reporters of The New York Times.
On abortion, the candidates said they believed the state should not impose any more restrictions than now exist. But how they reached their positions and the reasons are strikingly different.
Mr. Florio said he had supported restrictions on abortions until the mid-70's, when he read Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court decision that overturned anti-abortion laws in 1972. Mr. Florio said the heart of the issue was the right to privacy.
''I was just so struck by the obvious wisdom of a constitutionally protected right to privacy,'' he said. ''I'm very much concerned, and in a whole lot of other areas, as well, about governmental intrusion, governmental growth, domination of people's private lives.''
Mr. Courter voted in favor of numerous bills to cut off Federal financing for abortion in his 10 years in Congress. He said he still opposed abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or where the life of the mother was endangered. But, he said, he respects protections of the right to abortion in the State Constitution and would not support an effort to change it.
 
Importance of Approaches
''There is no consensus in the State of New Jersey to change that Constitution whatsoever,'' Mr. Courter said. ''It's a dead issue. I'm not going to impose my views on the people of the state.''
With polls finding that crime and drugs are top concerns among voters here and with New Jersey cities having the highest rates of AIDS infection in the nation, voters and political experts said the candidates' approaches to those problems will play a vital role in the outcome of the election and the future of the state.
The positions on specific issues often differ greatly. But the responses on social issues appear to represent dramatically divergent views of human nature, of social problems and of what government can do to address them.
At one point, the candidates were asked why drug abuse is so rampant.
''You're talking about people being alienated,'' Mr. Florio said. The pace of life, the diminished roles of the church and family had deprived people of sources of support, he said. Government can begin to provide a solution in the schools, not only by educating against drug use, but also by teaching values.
Fighting drugs, Mr. Florio said, also involves creating employment for young people in poor neighborhoods, to provide them with an alternative to the drug trade. To Mr. Courter, the blame lays with criminals who market drugs and with a society that grew permissive.
''It's a sophisticated international cartel that does have the supply, that's No. 1,'' Mr. Courter said. ''No. 2, it's caused to a degree by a change in society, in the attitude that people can do things without personal consequences whatever and that whatever they do it's someone else's fault.''
 
Movies and Penalties
To fight drugs, Mr. Courter said, he favored showing films in schools that dramatically demonstrate the physical damage of drug use and imposing stiffer penalties on users. Both approaches, he said, would make users more aware of the consequences of their actions.
As governor, Mr. Florio and Mr. Courter said they would press for increased arrests and expansions of jails, prisons, education and and treatment. Neither candidate provided specific goals for the programs or said what they might cost.
Mr. Florio said he would try to pay for expanding publicly financed treatment programs by requiring health insurers to cover drug treatment, as well as alcohol treatment. Although many addicts in public treatment are unemployed and have no insurance, Mr. Florio said, he believed enough did have insurance to provide the state with significant new money.
 
To List Makes of Weapons
Mr. Courter said he hoped to employ additional doctors in private practice in drug treatment, possibly using Medicaid for the poor to offset the cost. But the expansion of treatment, he said, would depend on state revenues.
On crime, Mr. Florio listed as his first priority the banning of all assault rifles. He said he would sign a measure now in the Legislature, the Graves bill, that would ban the public sale of assualt rifles.
Mr. Courter said he supported the ban in principle, but opposed the bill as ''poorly crafted.'' He said he would prefer a ban that would specifically list the makes of weapons. He said a priority for his administration would be overturning rules that prevent prosecutors from presenting evidence in criminal cases that the police had illegally seized. ''I think people are just walking out scot free on a technicality, which I loathe,'' Mr. Courter said.
On AIDS, Mr. Florio said his administration would try to coordinate programs dispersed among many agencies. ''We don't have a battle plan dealing with AIDS, as other states do,'' Mr. Florio said. ''New Jersey is dealing with it piece by piece.''
Mr. Courter said he would stress educating the public on how AIDS is transmitted and would encourage people to be tested for the HIV virus by insuring the confidentiality of the results. Within the limitations of budgets, he said, he would like to assist giving expensive treatments to patients.
 
Comparing Their Answers
In separate interviews this month, The New York Times asked the two candidates for governor of New Jersey to discuss the problems facing the state and how to deal with them. This is the second of three articles comparing their responses. These are excerpts from the interviews.

In the life of Melanie Rodriguez, there are few cheers for being a 16-year-old mother, a high school student and an aspiring physician.
Instead, when she strolls the streets of the Bronx in her hospital uniform, young people sometimes jeer her, because a starched uniform is simply not ''cool,'' she says, ''After I had my baby, some of my friends avoided me,'' she said. ''They told me my chances were limited. My mother, she keeps pushing me. I'm going to be the first doctor in my family.'' 
Ms. Rodriguez, who wants to work in forensic medicine, is one of 34 students from Herbert H. Lehman and De Witt Clinton High Schools in the Bronx who spend two days a week in medical school. The Clinton 11th grader is enrolled at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in a program for poor and minority students interested in careers in medicine.
 
Studies and Job Experience
The program teaches study skills and offers courses in science, mathematics, the language arts and cultural awareness, in addition to practical experience in Einstein laboratories and local hospitals. Ms. Rodriguez, for example, has worked with elderly patients at the Montefiore Medical Center as a nurse's helper.
The Einstein program is one of a number of efforts to offset the slow pace at which minorities nationwide are entering medical schools. The number of such students has remained virtually stagnant in the last decade, says Dr. Herbert Nickens of the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington.
Dr. Nickens said that from 1978 to 1988, the percentage of black, American Indian, Mexican and Puerto Rican first-year medical students went from 8.7 percent of overall enrollment to 10.1 percent. Yet blacks alone represent 15 percent of the age group that usually enrolls in college, he said.
Of the 126 medical schools in the nation, one-third have programs to encourage minority and economically disadvantaged students. In New York City, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the New York University School of Medicine and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons are among schools with programs similar to Einstein's.
At Einstein most students are poor black and Hispanic people from the Bronx. All are interested in careers in medicine. They are picked by counselors at Lehman and Clinton High Schools. The students, mostly junior and seniors, are tutored by minority medical students at Einstein, who also provide a window on the rigors of medical schools.
Perhaps beyond anything else, students learn that they can be successful even if no one else in their family or community is. ''I have learned a lot, especially about myself,'' said Talib Saafir, a 16-year-old junior at Clinton who is interested in becoming a brain surgeon. ''Everybody helps everybody else. I was thinking about starting a hospital in a minority neighborhood when I get up there.''
Mr. Saafir said his dream was to enter Harvard Medical School, but he has been told by some of his peers that blacks who enter top medical schools like that somehow turn their backs on their people. Others, like Ashley Singh, a junior at Lehman, said she always felt that she could not make it.
 
'Helped Me Reach the Top'
''This program helped me reach the top,'' said Ms. Singh. She is 16 years old and wants to be a nurse who works with children. ''I never thought I could do anything. I was going through a rough time in my life. I did a lot of things I wasn't supposed to do.''
The Einstein program is in the final year of a three-year pilot program sponsored by the Associated Medical Schools of New York. Thirteen of the 14 medical schools in the state belong to Associated Medical Schools and they offer programs similar to the one at Einstein. Funds for the effort come from the State Department of Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
''Our premise is they wouldn't have the exposure if it wasn't for us,'' said Henryne Green, program officer for the Science and Technology Entry Program at Associated Medical Schools. ''This year we are doing a formal evaluation of the program. This is our last year of funding from the state.''
 
Most Continue Studies
Ms. Green said 85 percent of 154 youngsters in New York State who had graduated from the program had pursued higher education. Of those, 85 percent are pre-medical or science majors.
The Einstein program is not for the lethargic. Students must show up on time and ready to work two days a week from 3:30 to 5:30 P.M. They receive homework from their classes and must keep a journal of their personal observations and academic progress.
Louis Shing, the coordinator of the program, said many students are the first in their families to pursue a medical degree or even go to college. He said families sometimes resisted the idea of their children entering the medical profession, often to shield them from what they fear will be certain failure in mainstream society.
And, as in the case of Melanie Rodriguez, peers sometimes tease the Einstein high school students for being too bookish. Those attitudes are as difficult to overcome as any academic deficiencies or lack of funds for medical school, Mr. Shing said.
''Once we get the students here, we show how it is possible,'' he said. ''They meet medical students who look like them. They go into the laboratories and participate in experiments. They learn they can do more than they ever dreamed possible.''

HEADLINE: The California Quake;
A Crippling Blow for Oakland's Poor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 23

 BODY:
When Jeanette Blackmon moved into her single room at the Oaks Hotel on 15th Street five weeks ago, she thought she had finally arrived.
Months on the mean streets of Oakland and in shelters sometimes less safe than the streets had worn her down. The newly renovated Oaks, with its new buzzer security system and its green false marble facade, was a jewel in Oakland's brave but faltering effort to redevelop its downtown section.
The hotel, built in 1913 and renovated in 1986, was the East Bay's first nonprofit residential hotel for the poor. There were community kitchens, tenants' meetings and a social worker to help people who lived there look for work and keep their lives in order. 
But the earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area on Tuesday ravaged 15th Street, crippling not only the Oaks but also its ugly duckling neighbor, the Danziel Apartments, and even Oakland's ornate City Hall.
 
Damage Put at $1.5 Billion
Mayor Lionel Wilson and his City Hall staff had to evacuate. And about 300 residents of 15th Street, including Mrs. Blackmon, who is 52 years old, were out on the street.
Mayor Wilson said today that earthquake damage to businesses and buildings in Oakland might approach $1.5 billion. Damage assessors for the Red Cross said that property of 3,721 families in Oakland had sustained damage and that 13 apartment buildings and 57 private homes were destroyed.
The Red Cross said Sunday that 681 people were being housed in five Oakland shelters.
Today's heavy rain exacerbated ground shifts caused by the quake. Red Cross officials were scrambling to find shelter for the more than 100 people left homeless in the last 24 hours.
 
'Qualified for Disaster Relief'
The number of people the quake left homeless in Oakland is not high compared with that in San Francisco or the communities near Santa Cruz. But, unlike the well-to-do residents of San Franciso's hardest hit neighborhood, the Marina district, most of Oakland's quake victims lived in decrepit, crime-ridden housing projects, and they lack friends to take them in. insurance brokers and rental agents.
Like many of his neighbors in the Oaks Hotel and the Danziel Apartments, Roy Martinez, 52, took refuge at the Red Cross shelter at the Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School on 10th Street in west Oakland.
Wearing a donated ''Saratoga Nautical'' T-shirt and chinos, Mr. Martinez, who was unemployed before the quake, spent much of his time last week mopping and sweeping the shelter. ''Us here, we should have qualified for disaster relief before the quake,'' he said, only partly joking.
At the 10th Street shelter there are free clothes, medical care and what seems like round-the-clock hot meals. But it is hard to sleep at night because of the crowding, and there are occasional squabbles over an especially coveted item of donated clothing.
 
A Cat Lands on Its Feet
Dorothy Williams, 59, who lived on 15th Steet before the quake, does not mind the shelter now that she knows that Ezee, her black and white cat with the beauty mark on its face, is safe.
The cat, which fled Mrs. Williams's apartment when the building started to shake early Tuesday evening, was found by a neighbor two days later burrowed in a pile of clothes in a closet. Mrs. Williams said she used her last $10 to take Ezee to the Alameda pet hospital, where the cat is now living comfortably. ''At least one of us is living in the lap of luxury,'' she added.
Benjamin Tiger, a marine machinist at the Port of Oakland, lived in a quake-damaged building on 15th Street that was condemned after being ransacked by looters who even tried to chip away the fake marble panels in the lobby.
Mr. Tiger and his wife, Carol, worry that they will never be able to get together the first and last month's rent, security and a utility deposit to get another apartment. And the Tigers fear that only people on welfare will get grants for new housing.
 
Some Practical Problems
Those ''on the Government,'' like Jeannette Blackmon, Dorothy Williams and Roy Martinez, fear it will take months for aid to come through.
And there were practical problems: Where would the checks be sent to those who are homeless? How would they apply for disaster relief?
On Sunday the former residents of the Oaks Hotel got some good news: city building inspectors determined that there was no structural damage to the Oaks and that renovation would start soon.
But later in the day the authorities decided to move the 10th Street shelter to the nearby Lowell Middle School on 14th Street.
Mrs. Blackmon knows only that she is sick of moving. ''I just want a little cottage, get me a dog, a little garden and watch soap operas,'' she said, ''and forget any of this happened.''

HEADLINE: The California Quake;
House Panel Votes $2.85 Billion in Quake Relief

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The House Appropriations Committee approved a $2.85 billion aid package today to help earthquake recovery efforts in the San Francisco Bay Area. The legislation would provide low-interest loans and grants to rebuild homes, businesses and highways in the devastated area.
The spending plan, approved in a voice vote, contains less money than the $3.84 billion sought by members of Congress from California. But the plan provides more than the $2 billion to $2.5 billion suggested today by the Bush Administration, an amount that Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said was ''manageable and can be accommodated'' within the budget. 
The aid package, which is attached to a spending measure moving swiftly through Congress, now goes to the House floor, where passage is considered likely. If approved, the Senate is expected to act quickly and send the measure to President Bush for his signature before the end of the week.
''We're not attempting to put in here all the money it's going to take,'' said Representative Jamie L. Whitten, a Mississippi Democrat who is chairman of the committee. ''My whole pitch is to do something now, straighten it out later and don't waste any money in the meantime.''
 
Breakdown of Relief Package
Under the proposal approved today, $1.1 billion would be provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for direct relief efforts in of grants for housing assistance and other emergency needs. Another $1 billion would be provided to the Federal Highway Administration Emergency Fund for immediate highway repairs.
In addition, the plan provides $500 million to the Small Business Administration for low-interest disaster loans and $250 million to the Presidential discretionary fund for repairs of Federal buildings, veterans hospitals and airport property.
In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian said today that he would convene a special session of the Legislature within two weeks to come up with an earthquake relief package. He said the amount of aid would be at least as much as the $90 million provided after the Whittier earthquake in Southern California in 1987.
Members of California's Congressional delegation expressed disappointment today that they were unable to obtain a bigger aid package, but they said the additional money would help.
''The amount approved does not, of course, meet all our needs, but it's a significant step in the right directions,'' said Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat who led efforts to obtain more funds.
 
Optimism Over Quick Approval
While the Administration and some lawmakers disagreed over specific aid proposals, spokesmen for both side said their differences were not as great as it appeared and expressed optimism that a compromise relief package could be approved quickly.
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared upbeat after a meeting on disaster relief this afternoon with Mr. Whitten and Republican leaders on the House Appropriations Commmittee.
''Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster that we've got to address,'' Mr. Darman said. ''We're trying to do it as best we can on the merits on a bipartisan basis. I would hope very much that we wouldn't end up in the kind of situation where we have a bidding war and then a veto threat.''
The Administration plan proposed spending $1 billion from existing programs, including funds authorized to assist the victims of Hurricane Hugo, Mr. Fitzwater said. In addition, the Administration proposed seeking an additional $1.5 bilion in an emergency spending request from Congress that would not require new taxes.

HEADLINE: Problems Loom in Effort to Control Use of Chemicals for Illicit Drugs

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
FRUSTRATED by the failure to stop the flood of drugs into the country, leaders of America's battle against drugs are seeking to restrict supplies of key ingredients and processing chemicals required to make illegal substances. But many experts believe the effort is doomed to failure by the seemingly endless alternative methods of synthesizing drugs that technically skilled criminals have devised.
Chemists point out that all drugs, including those usually derived from plants, can be synthesized in a laboratory. Economic considerations dictate which drugs are most profitable to make, and chemists say that if coca leaves should ever be in short supply, cocaine could be made entirely synthetically. In any case, illicit laboratories continue to develop new and ever more powerful drugs.
Since March the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency has been phasing in new regulations governing the sale, distribution and exportation of chemicals that can be used to make illegal drugs. Last year the United States also signed, with 79 other nations, an international treaty containing rules about chemicals used in the processing or making of drugs. 
Under the new D.E.A. rules, which will be fully in place by the end of this month, transactions involving these chemicals must be recorded by sellers. Records must be open to Government inspection, and if a seller suspects the intentions of a buyer, he must report his suspicions to the Drug Enforcement Agency. Government officials have suggested to sellers that they should be suspicious when they are asked to deliver chemicals in unusual ways. The law does not restrict the sale of any chemicals but, by requiring that all transactions be recorded, it is intended to deter criminals from acquiring chemicals and to make it easier to pursue them after a purchase.
Government administrators say the new regulations imposed by the Anti-drug Abuse Act of 1988 will significantly hamper criminals who manufacture drugs in warehouses, private homes, vans and other temporary locations. But many chemists and pharmacologists believe that the raw materials and processes that can be used for making drugs are practically limitless and that when one illicit process is disrupted, others spring up to replace it.
''Take alcohol, for example,'' said a chemist who asked not to be named. ''You might decide to curb the sale of corn, which can be fermented to make moonshine. But the bootlegger would merely switch to barley or prunes or any of the thousands of natural substances containing carbohydrates. Curbing the precursors of many drugs involves similar problems.''
The chemicals needed to manufacture drugs are so common, moreover, that controlling them poses almost insurmountable difficulties. Cocaine, currently the chief target of Federal drug agents, typifies the problem.
Besides the coca leaves themselves, the criminal needs only a modest variety of cheap chemicals to make pure cocaine. All of these chemicals are used in large amounts for legitimate purposes and are widely available. According to Government and private technical publications that describe the clandestine manufacture of cocaine, the required chemicals are kerosene; ammonia, commonly used to make cleaning agents, fertilizers and synthetic fibers; lime, used to make bricks and mortar; sodium carbonate, used in glass, soap and cleansers; sulfuric acid, used in automobile batteries; potassium permanganate, used in tanning leather and purifying water, ethyl ether, a common solvent, and hydrochloric acid, used for cleaning metal and preparing food products.
The new law provides for regulation of 12 complex substances, or ''precursor chemicals,'' that can be built up into drugs or modified to produce drugs. The law also regulates eight substances, or ''essential chemicals,'' most of them solvents - liquid chemicals in which reactions can take place or from which dissolved substances can be crystallized in pure form.
 
Law Covers Common Solvents
The law now regulates transactions involving several common solvents used for making cocaine, heroin and dozens of other street drugs. The new regulations apply to ethyl ether; acetone, the chemical in nail-polish remover; methyl ethyl ketone, found in rubber cement, and toluene, used in paint thinners.
The law does not apply to domestic sales of less than 50 gallons a month and foreign sales of less than 500 gallons, unless they seem suspicious to the dealer.
But critics say the solvents are manufactured and sold in such immense quantities that it would be practically impossible to detect all small transactions by drug makers.
''In this country alone, 6 billion pounds of toluene and 2 billion pounds of acetone are sold each year,'' said R. Garrity Baker, director of international affairs for the Chemical Manufacturers Association in Washington. ''Our 170 members, which produce more than 90 percent of the basic chemicals made in the United States, will keep the sales and distribution records required under the new law. But it will be up to the D.E.A. to make use of those records in tracking down illicit drugs, and it will be no easy task.''
 
Chemists Are Critical>
Most chemists avoid making public statements critical of the new regulations. ''Not to go along with the patriotic anti-drug bandwagon can place a chemist under suspicion of being soft on drug dealers,'' one said. ''The truth is, nearly all of us are against drugs, but a lot of us feel the current regulatory efforts are as self-defeating as Prohibition was in the 20's.''
Even if heroin and cocaine were successfully suppressed, new drugs that have entered the street market could become the drugs of choice, some experts say. Some of these substances, which require no natural base like coca leaves in cocaine, are far more dangerous than either cocaine or heroin.
Dr. Gary L. Henderson, a chemist whose expert testimony is frequently sought by prosecutors who also use his expertise in tracking down illicit drug operations, believes that in some cases, anti-drug enforcement may drive illicit producers into switching to exceptionally dangerous substances. Dr. Henderson, an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of California at Davis, coined the phrase ''designer drugs'' to describe potent new psychoactive substances created by criminal chemists to skirt existing laws.
''Dangers increase drastically whenever people start concentrating drugs or consuming them in new ways, to increase their potency and value,'' he said. ''Alcohol in the form of beer or wine probably did relatively little harm before we learned how to distill it. People in the Andean region of South America have chewed coca leaves for thousands of years without major ill effects, but now that the drug is being refined as pure cocaine or converted into crack, it causes great harm.''
One such drug, 3-methylfentanyl is a depressant that is roughly 1,000 times more potent than heroin, for which it was mistaken when the first overdose cases showed up in hospital emergency rooms. Dr. Henderson testified at one trial that the defendant, an industrial chemist, had made enough fentanyl in a single, relatively simple laboratory synthesis for up to 10 million doses. The synthesis had required only a few pounds of starting materials, the most essential of which was purchased in a retail store.
Another fentanyl case in which Dr. Henderson testified involved a chemist, Dr. Michael C. Hovey, who had been employed in Delaware by the E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. He pleaded guilty in 1986 to Federal drug charges, but after he had spent a year in prison, the charges were dropped because fentanyl was not illegal when he was arrested. After his release Delaware brought its own charges against the chemist, and last month, a state trooper shot Dr. Hovey dead as he was trying to flee from arrest, the state police said.
An official of the D.E.A., who declined to speak for attribution by name, acknowledged that powerful synthetic drugs made in clandestine laboratories may eventually create large social and public health problems. ''If supplies of cocaine and heroin ever dry up,'' he said, ''some of the new synthetic substances might replace them. Even if the drug lords decide to stay with cocaine and heroin, these substances can be chemically synthesized from scratch, and the day may come when the drug merchants can get along without the natural raw materials, coca and opium. But for the time being, the economics are against it. Coca and opium are still cheap and much too widely available to bother with synthesis.''
 
Drugs Easy to Produce
Meanwhile, illicit laboratories pour new drugs into the pipeline, and most of these drugs are easy to synthesize, chemists say.
One that has been described in recent regulatory bulletins and in High Times, a monthly magazine read by many drug users, is ketamine, a legal anesthetic with effects are similar to those of heroin. Experts describe ketamine, which is also called ''Vitamin K,'' as a cult drug consumed mainly in the Western states. Since it is not classed as among the most closely monitored drugs that have no approved medical use, it is easier to obtain than heroin.
Another new drug, ''Eu4ia'' (pronounced euphoria), is an amphetamine-like stimulant made from materials found in some legal pharmaceuticals, notably diet aids. Eu4ia might gain a foothold as a cocaine substitute if cocaine should ever become scarce, Dr. Henderson said.
A new drug that has caused particular concern in Hawaii and a few Western states is a form of methamphetamine produced as large crystals that can be smoked. The new drug, dubbed ''ice,'' produces violent symptoms that are sometimes indistinguishable from those of acute paranoid schizophrenia.
Chemists say that all the methamphetamine drugs can be synthesized using the common drug ephedrine, an ingredient in many over-the-counter cold remedies.
 
Criticism of New Law
The new Federal law makes ephedrine a regulated chemical, bulk sales of which must be recorded. But some public officials believe the law will have little practical effect.
Representative Vic Fazio, Democrat of California, recently complained about the ephedrine situation to William K. Bennett, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. ''Unfortunately it appears the new Federal law will have little impact in California, which has far more stringent restrictions already in place,'' Mr. Fazio wrote. Despite these restrictions, he said, there has been a proliferation of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in Sacramento. Since neighboring states exercise no control over ephedrine sales, he said, criminals in California merely buy what they need over the state line.
In many countries abroad, drug makers use over-the-counter remedies as starting materials for potent drugs. In New Zealand, for example, criminals have devised a chemical technique for extracting the codeine from a popular brand of cold tablets and converting it into a crude form of heroin.
Chemical experts agree that the laboratory synthesis of potent drugs requires relatively little technical education.
''If you have to devise a synthesis method from scratch, you have to go into the chemical literature available from libraries and know what you're doing,'' a chemist said. ''But you don't need to know much if you're just following a recipe. You can buy recipes for almost anything you want to make, just as you can buy precursor chemicals on the black market.''
Phencyclidine, or ''angel dust,'' is made by mixing ingredients in three buckets, he said, and the mixing process, which produces fumes, has to continue for several hours. The procedure is often carried out in the back of a rented van that is kept moving to disperse the fumes and to avoid notice. Because practitioners must constantly pour chemicals from one bucket to another, they have become known as ''bucket chemists.''
Difficult as it is for the United States to curb drug manufacture at home, it is still harder to affect drug production abroad. A treaty aimed at restraining international drug traffic, including chemical used in producing drugs, was signed in 1988 by 80 nations, but it has yet to be ratified by most of them.
Robert T. Angarola, a Washington lawyer and former White House counsel on drug abuse, said he believed most nations would finally ratify at least parts of the treaty. But he acknowledged that some nations with large international chemical industries, notably Switzerland, may remain aloof from the effort. Increased regulation increases the manufacturing costs and reduces competitive advantage. The giant Swiss companies are reluctant to accept such burdens. ''The real problem drug enforcers face is one of economics,'' a chemist said. ''As long as it is possible to become rich by carrying out a simple laboratory operation - perhaps just doing it once or twice in a lifetime - there will be temptation. Very few chemists betray their profession. But I'm afraid the drug dealers will always be able to hire enough professional talent to keep business booming.''

HEADLINE: British TV on Eve of Competitive Era

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
On the eve of legislation to change the face of British television by 1992, viewers, critics and broadcasters are debating whether more commercial competition will lead to lower standards on the air.
An outrage against the BBC? The people who made ''Brideshead Revisited,'' ''The Jewel in the Crown,'' ''Upstairs, Downstairs''? No - the BBC did not produce any of these memorable series; British commercial television did.
 
Many Co-productions
''The Jewel in the Crown,'' the series about the end of the British raj, came from Granada Television, which also was a co-producer of ''Brideshead Revisited'' with WNET, the public television station for New York City, and a West German network. ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' came from London Weekend Television. Granada, WGBH in Boston and Dune Television of France co-produced ''A Tale of Two Cities,'' to be broadcast on PBS on ''Masterpiece Theater'' beginning Nov. 19. 
The BBC has commissioned its share of memorable programs: ''A Perfect Spy,'' the series made from the John le Carre novel; ''All Creatures Great and Small,'' the James Herriot tales of a rural English veterinarian, and many more.
But superb programs are not the monopoly of noncommercial television in Britain; they have as often been produced by the 16 commercial companies that make up the tightly regulated independent ITV network.
Many critics here say that high-quality programs are just as conspicuous amid the routine fare on both British commercial and noncommercial networks as they are on ABC, NBC and CBS in the United States, but mercifully without the frequent interruptions for advertisements.
 
American Style Is Debated
Comparison with American television is the first weapon that both advocates and detractors of the British system reach for, since it is commonly assumed that what Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government wants is American-style television: lots of channels, commercials and cheap entertainment.
Not so, the Government says: more competition will produce more choice, not less. Anyway, the Government's argument goes, as the entire European television market expands and becomes more competitive, British television will have to change with it. With cable television and satellite broadcasting like Rupert Murdoch's Sky Channel already competing for advertising and viewer attention, the days of the BBC's and ITV's ''comfortable duopoly,'' as the blue-ribbon Peacock Committee called it in 1986, are clearly numbered.
Last November, the Government revealed its prescription for change: at least one and possibly two more commercially financed broadcast channels, stiffer competition among bidders for ITV franchises, and a move away from the system of mandatory viewer-license fees that pay for BBC-1 and BBC-2.
Since 1946, BBC television has been financed by mandatory annual license fees levied on set owners. A license for a color television set now costs 66 ($105), and the BBC runs no commercials. The ITV companies share broadcasting time on Channel 3, which has commercials. So does Channel 4, which is owned by the public authority that controls ITV and financed by advertising revenue from ITV's regional companies.
Eventually, the Government said, the BBC should be offered as cable television is, to subscribers who pay for it. More immediately, it proposed changing the way the Independent Broadcasting Authority awards commercial franchises for ITV, saying they should go to the highest bidders.
In June, bowing to criticism about the possible effect on quality, the Government agreed to draft legislation to ensure that no winner would be allowed to broadcast substandard programming or skimp on public-interest programs.
How good is British television? ''It isn't all 'Brideshead'; far from it,'' said Alasdair Milne, the BBC's former programming director. ''But on the general level, because we and ITV were competing for the attention of the audience instead of for advertising dollars, we produced peaks that are unmatched in the rest of the world.''
Paul Johnson, a leading critic, disagreed recently, writing in the conservative magazine The Spectator: ''Most of what the duopoly produces is of revoltingly inferior confection -endless quiz-shows and sport, cheap imports (often, nowadays, pap from Australia), lackluster situation comedies and old B-movies without end. There is often virtually no choice. By contrast, U.S. (including cable) is rich in both quality and variety.''
Auberon Waugh, in the same magazine, dismissed American television as ''appalling, like American beer.''
Daphne Lockyer, in Mr. Murdoch's tabloid Today, recently wrote: ''You can knock American TV as much as you like, and you can sound off endlessly about 'quality' British television. But the truth is that the four best series on British TV at the moment are all American imports - 'L.A. Law,' 'Thirtysomething,' 'Cheers' and 'Roseanne.' ''
In fact, recent ratings showed ''M*A*S*H'' among the top-drawing shows on BBC-2; on Channel 4, ''Golden Girls,'' ''Lost in Space,'' ''The Waltons,'' ''St. Elsewhere'' and ''Oprah Winfrey'' were in the top 20.
At the very top on BBC-1 and ITV are soap operas: ''Eastenders,'' a Cockney saga, and ''Neighbors'' on BBC-1, and ''Coronation Street,'' the British antithesis of ''Dallas,'' on ITV. No one would argue that British soap operas are on the same level as ''Brideshead,'' which, Mr. Johnson wrote, ''is the only kind of British program ever seen by American East Coast intellectuals, who assume they are typical, and so endorse the 'best television in the world' nonsense.''
Cheryl Markosky, a journalist, said: ''The reason why there are so few quality programs is money; it's hard to get the money for ambitious, expensive productions, and the BBC is being particularly squeezed.''
 
Licenses Tied to Inflation
To force the BBC to keep costs down, the Government is tying license increases to the inflation rate, now slightly below 8 percent a year.
Last year, BBC television earned $1.26 billion, mostly from the license fees, while ITV made $2.28 billion from advertising, the BBC said.
Producing an hour of drama for television costs about $800,000, Mr. Milne said; light entertainment costs $640,000 an hour, and documentaries $400,000. ''The problem remains that the BBC, having committed itself to 20 major films a year, can't really afford to make them,'' a critic wrote recently in the newspaper The Guardian, arguing that independent television nowadays could not either.
Mr. Milne and others say that the uncertainty created by the Government's plans to auction off ITV franchises after 1991 has frightened the leading companies, like Granada, out of undertaking anything as ambitious as ''The Jewel in the Crown'' until their fate is clear. The BBC's present charter expires in 1996.
 
Blanket Coverage Is Rare
British television's approach to the news also differs from that of American television. Only elections or the annual political conventions get special blanket coverage. Most other major news events are covered, for the most part, during the regular news times on the four networks, at 6, 7, 9 and 10 P.M. on weekdays. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited Britain in April, neither the BBC nor ITV interrupted its regular coverage for more than short news bulletins.
The BBC, from its inception as a radio service under Lord Reith in 1927, has always striven for a high standard that some might find elitist. ''He who prides himself on giving what he thinks the people want is creating a fictitious demand for lower standards which he will then satisfy,'' Lord Reith said. Mr. Murdoch, by contrast, said in a speech in Edinburgh last summer, ''Anybody who, within the law of the land, provides a service which the public wants at a price it can afford is providing a public service.''

HEADLINE: Savings Outflow In August

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23

 BODY:
The savings industry lost billions of dollars in deposits in August as the tough new capital requirements set by the savings and loan rescue forced executives to shrink the size of their institutions, the Office of Thrift Supervision said today.
The agency, known as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board before the bailout legislation, reported that deposits at the nation's savings and loan associations fell by $5.1 billion in August, a dramatic reversal from July, when deposits actually rose by $54 million. That increase, however, was the only one this year and reflected the drop in interest rates that made deposits at savings institutions competitive with rates paid by money market funds.
''Institutions know they have to meet higher capital requirements, and the easiest way to do that is to shrink,'' said James Barth, chief economist for the thrift office, adding that the shrinkage process ''is not going to go away for a while.'' 
 
Confidence Not Big Factor
Mr. Barth added that he saw little indication that the loss of deposits was the result of a lack of confidence by customers.
Indeed, while the loss of $5.1 billion is large, it is only half the losses posted by the industry in January, when depositors fled savings and loan institutions, fearing a possible tax on their deposits as a way to finance an industry bailout, in favor of higher rates paid by money market funds.
But even though the erosion of customer confidence appears to have been stanched, the industry has still lost almost $62 billion of deposits in the last year.
The industry is coping with requirements under the bailout bill that force executives to retain much higher levels of cash and cash-type holdings as capital, or a cushion against losses. The bailout, passed by Congress in August, will provide $159 billion to close down almost 700 sick savings institutions over the next 10 years.
 
Requirements Doubled
While the industry for years was permitted to operate at capital levels between 1 and 3 percent of assets, the bailout bill has more than doubled those requirements. Some analysts predict the industry could be forced to raise more than $30 billion in new capital through stock offerings and cash infusions from mergers with outside investors.
But a much easier way to increase capital levels is by shrinking the size of the overall institution, while keeping the amount of capital constant. This, according to Mr. Barth and other industry experts, was what the industry began to do in August.
Moreover, Mr. Barth added, almost half of the shrinkage was concentrated at five very large California institutions that needed to raise their capital levels.
The thrift office added that the numbers included the outflow of deposits from 264 sick institutions under the control of the Government.
''The surest way to meet higher capital requirements is by letting your deposits run off and selling assets so that you have a smaller base,'' said James W. Christian, chief economist for the United States League of Savings Institutions.
 
Interest Rates Are Lowered
Mr. Christian noted that in August, while interest rates essentially held steady, many California savings institutions were lowering the rates they paid on deposits, which is the easiest way to pare deposits and ''a clear signal that it was deliberate.''
''What is interesting is that we are seeing a very quick and dramatic impact'' of the bailout legislation, said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va.
But Mr. Barth said that some of the loss of deposits was not intentional. August tends to be a heavy spending month for families. ''Getting ready for back to school, parents shell out money for tuition, clothing and suppliers,'' he said.
Accompanying the loss of deposits, which do not include the crediting of interest, was an even larger shrinkage in the industry's total assets. For August, the total fell by $13.4 billion, to $1.318 trillion, the thrift office said.
Most of that was accounted for by the sale of $8.3 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $3.5 billion in non-mortgage securities held by the industry, the Government said. These assets tend to be much easier to liquidate than individual home mortgages and other direct real estate holdings, which fell $3 billion.
Besides not offering competitive rates on deposits, which encourages customers to go elsewhere, the industry paid off large amounts of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks, the agency said.

HEADLINE: Japan's Maneuvering For a Big Global Voice

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct 23

 BODY:
Japan, the world's biggest creditor and provider of financial assistance, is quietly building its influence in global finance institutions long dominated by the United States and Western Europe. Having gained the appointment of a Japanese official to the top ranks of the World Bank, Japan is moving to promote a candidate to run the International Monetary Fund when the term of its managing director expires in January 1992.
After the United States, Japan is now the second-largest stockholder in the World Bank, a Washington-based institution that provides more than $20 billion a year, mostly in long-term loans, to help third-world countries strengthen their economies.
The bank is headed by former Representative Barber B. Conable Jr. of upstate New York, who is a friend of President Bush. Newly appointed as one of two executive vice presidents is Yoshio Terazawa, former executive vice president of Nomura Securities in Tokyo, the world's biggest brokerage house. Sir William S. Ryrie of Britain is the other appointee. 
 
Behind-the-Scenes Maneuvers
Now Japan is seeking a larger voice in the International Monetary Fund, which oversees currency developments and offers conditional loans to help countries balance their international accounts.
American and foreign officials say that behind the scenes, Japan is positioning Toyoo Gyohten, a well-known official in international financial circles, as a candidate to succeed Michel Camdessus of France as managing director of the I.M.F.
Mr. Gyohten, Japan's former vice minister of finance, served for much of the 1980's as Japan's chief spokesman on international monetary matters. He was a Fulbright scholar at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University during the 1950's and an I.M.F. economist in Washington in the 1960's. He is a graduate of Tokyo University.
Mr. Gyohten, an avid golfer, is now a finance ministry adviser. As such, he speaks for Japan in opinion-shaping international economic seminars, where he gives presentations and meets with academics and journalists.
Articulate in English, Mr. Gyohten, 58 years old, has a reputation for wit and grace.
 
Far-Reaching Changes Seen
He declines to comment on any ambitions he may have. But at one recent gathering he said, ''Changes that have taken place in Japan's role in the world have been so rapid and far-reaching that it requires a very substantial effort to be made for political leaders to catch up and understand what has happened.''
Most international officials are sympathetic to Japan's ambitions to increase the nation's voice in the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
Mr. Camdessus has said there are ''great talents'' in Japan, adding, ''I do not see any legal reasons not to have Japanese talents managing these institutions.''
But Tokyo still faces a tough fight, chiefly against Europeans, to place its man in Mr. Camdessus's chair.
The post has historically gone to a European, just as Americans have always held the presidency of the World Bank. The institutions were established in the wreckage of World War II as pillars of a postwar economic system.
 
Others Interested
Mr. Camdessus, who headed France's central bank before going to Washington to take over the I.M.F. post, has given no indication that he wants to return to Paris. And should he step down, there are several European hats in the ring, including that of the Dutch Finance Minister, H. Onno Ruding, and the president of West Germany's central bank, Karl Otto Pohl.
Japan is the fifth-largest stockholder in the fund, behind the United States, Britain, West Germany and France. It wants to become No. 2.
Although voting strength in the organization is linked to economic position, national prestige is at stake as well. Britain, whose Lord Keynes provided most of the intellectual stimulus for the fund's creation, is reluctant to cede to the Japanese.
Tokyo had hoped to sew up the No. 2 position at the I.M.F. at the annual meeting of the bank and fund last month in Washington, but Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer blocked the move.
 
U.S. Position Awaited
Washington's role is crucial, and American officials have yet to tip their hand. Should the United States tilt toward Japan, Europeans could be angered. If it appears to favor Europe, Japan could be hurt. Last year, American intervention secured the bank's executive vice presidency for Mr. Terazawa, who was competing with several Europeans.
Voting strength would be reconfigured as part of efforts to provide new capital to the I.M.F., which has $120 billion in resources.
Although the United States has yet to approve the capital increase, Treasury officials are sympathetic to Japan's desire to move to the No. 2 position, once new resources are agreed upon.
One possible compromise is to give Japan and West Germany the same number of shares, making them co-equals behind the United States, and to give France and Britain the same number of fewer shares, making them co-equals in a No. 3 position.
Of more than 6,340 employees at the bank, only 83 are Japanese, representing a little more than 1 percent. Along with Mr. Terazawa, Tokyo earlier this year obtained a bank vice presidential slot for a finance ministry official, Koji Kashiwaya, who is now the second-highest-ranking Japanese at the bank.
Of the I.M.F.'s 1,855 employees, only 26 are Japanese.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
The Turnaround Of the H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
MOST health maintenance organizations did well this year, recovering from two years of heavy losses. Industry experts said most of the prepaid health plans should remain profitable at least through 1990, when the cycle may turn down again.
The H.M.O. industry lost $900 million in 1987 and again in 1988, said Joel J. Menges, director of analytical services at American International Healthcare Inc., a unit of the American International Group, a multinational insurer. It has recouped its losses by aggressively raising the monthly premiums charged to employers and individuals. 
''Two-thirds of all H.M.O.'s in the country had losses last year,'' said Peter J. Grua, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore. Now most publicly owned H.M.O.'s are profitable, he said. ''Even some of the smaller companies are back on the track.'' Stock prices of many large H.M.O.'s have more than doubled this year, he said.
The turnaround came as insurers were forced to stanch losses they took while covering soaring medical costs. The insurers raised their rates as much as 50 percent for traditional fee-for-service health plans in 1989, while H.M.O.'s increased theirs by 12 percent to 20 percent.
For 1990, Mr. Grua said, insurers are seeking increases of 25 percent or more, which means H.M.O.'s can stay ahead of inflation, remain competitive and still show a profit if they raise rates by 12 percent to 15 percent. Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, an industry giant with 6.2 million members, has announced rate increases averaging 19.2 percent for 1990. Increases averaged 11.2 percent in 1989 and under 5 percent in the three preceding years. Kaiser did not report losses. H.M.O.'s charge a fixed monthly prepaid fee for each patient. Thus, hospitals and doctors have an incentive to keep costs down by offering checkups and other preventive measures to keep patients healthy and by minimizing expensive services.
''H.M.O.'s have truly been able to control their costs better than an insurance company,'' said Larry Greenberg, manager of the Fidelity Select Medical Delivery Fund in Boston. A few tightly managed H.M.O.'s like Pacificare Healthcare Systems Inc., based in Cypress, Calif., pass along only a set share of the per-patient premiums to hospitals and doctors, adding to the pressure to keep costs down. FHP International, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., owns a hospital and employs its own doctors. Humana Inc., the hospital chain based in Louisville, Ky., owns H.M.O.'s with more than one million members. Todd Richter, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the H.M.O.'s were providing 17 percent of Humana's patients.
Analysts predict that insurers may start cutting prices again in 1991. ''When pricing turns negative, the H.M.O.'s will still be able to make profits in the downturn,'' Mr Greenberg said. But Seth H. Shaw, at Prudential-Bache Securities, is less sanguine. ''Next year political problems will emerge,'' he said. As pressure grows to hold the line on prices, he added, ''H.M.O.'s that raise rates by 20 percent will not be part of the solution.''
The prepaid health plans had 32.6 million members enrolled at the beginning of the year, up 3.3 million from Jan. 1, 1988, according to the Group Health Association of America, an H.M.O. trade group in Washington. James F. Doherty, the group's president, predicted an additional 3.3 million members will be added in 1989.
But some H.M.O.'s have lost members as companies required employees to help pay for rising premiums. ''We realized we couldn't hold the line on the premiums,'' said Alan Peres, benefit planning manager at American Information Technologies, the Chicago-based regional telephone company.
In the 1990 sign-up period now under way, employees at Ameritech's Illinois Bell unit are being asked to pay $42.83 to $62.23 a month for family coverage in Chicago and more in downstate Illinois, said Bill Watson, Illinois Bell's director of benefits. The company will pay the remaining portion of the premiums, which range as high as $320 a month in Chicago. Illinois Bell pays the full H.M.O. premium for single employees, who are less likely than family groups to use hospitals and doctors.
H.M.O. membership among Illinois Bell active employees fell from 7,418 in 1987 to 6,659 last year, when the payroll deductions for H.M.O.'s started, Mr. Watson said, and he expects a further decline at the company's five H.M.O.'s in 1990 because ''employees are voting with their pocketbooks.''
''The H.M.O's were caught up in the hysteria of trying to attract and retain members, but there has been a clear change in mentality,'' Mr. Menges said at American International Healthcare. ''Now they are willing to lose members to get on their feet financially.''

The announcement came after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in Qintex's shares because the company had not answered an exchange question about the extent of its loans, investments and deposits in relation to Qintex Entertainment Inc., an affiliate based in Beverly Hills, Calif., that filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on Friday.
Qintex Australia, a Sydney-based operator of resorts and television stations, plans to sell its remaining 51 percent stake in Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii, Christopher Skase, its chairman, said. No buyer was identified but in March Qintex sold a combined 49 percent stake in the three Mirage resorts to the Nippon Shinpan Company and Mitsui & Company. 
 
Faster Sales Planned
Mr. Skase said in a news release that the company would also speed up plans to sell its Adelaide television station and two regional stations in Queensland. The sales are expected to generate a cash inflow, reduce interest costs and eliminate other financial liabilities, Mr. Skase said. Qintex intends to retain a long-term management contract on the resorts to generate fee income.
The planned restructuring involves the merger of Qintex Australia with Qintex Ltd., which owns 55 percent of Qintex Australia. Mr. Skase said this move would ''significantly reduce administrative costs.''
Before trading was suspended, Qintex Australia shares had plunged to 16 Australian cents (12 American cents), half their Friday value. The shares had traded at around $1.50 (Australian), or $1.15, in March, when Qintex announced the bid for MGM/ UA, which is 80 percent owned by Kirk Kekorian, the financier, through the Tracinda Corporation.
 
Four Problems Cited
Mr. Skase said in the news release today that ''group cash flow has been negatively impacted by an excess of $200 million (Australian)'' ($154 million) because of four recent problems - the termination by MGM/UA of the acquisition pact and the ''consequential impact on Qintex Entertainment,'' which was denied access to banking facilities after the deal dissolved; high Australian interest rates; a strike by domestic airline pilots that is affecting resort attendance, and the deferral of a settlement in a previously announced sale of two Queensland regional TV stations.
The announcement today came in response to the stock exchange's question about Qintex's exposure to Qintex Entertainment, which is 43 percent owned by the Australian company. The American affiliate owes Qintex Australia $38.1 million in loans that are not secured by specific assets. Qintex Australia said it had a further investment of $83.3 million in Qintex Entertainment shares.
''Qintex Australia will complete an evaluation of this investment and provide a follow-up report on completion,'' Mr. Skase said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Session Lower As Traders Await U.S. Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower in lackluster trading yesterday as currency markets around the world awaited direction from United States economic reports scheduled for release this week.
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367 an ounce, down 30 cents from Friday's settlement. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a 4 P.M. gold bid of $366.25 an ounce, 25 cents lower than Friday's late bid.
Dealers at home and abroad reported that there had recently been reluctance to establish significant positions in dollars until a clearer economic picture emerged.
 
Trading in Narrow Range
The reluctance has kept the dollar trading in a narrow range against other major currencies.
A report on orders for durable goods is due today from the Commerce Department, followed Thursday by the department's first estimate of third-quarter growth in the gross national product, the Government's broadest measure of economic health.
The dollar has also been weighed down by speculation that United States interest rates might recede in the near future. Lower rates would reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to lessen demand for dollars.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 141.90 yen, down from 142.43 yen on Friday. A pound cost $1.6030, compared with $1.5885 on Friday.
 
Late New York Rates
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.8470 West German marks, down from 1.8578; 1.6190 Swiss francs, down from 1.6285; 6.2740 French francs, down from 6.3105; 1.1704 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1741, and 1,356.00 Italian lire, down from 1,367.00.
Silver barely budged in quiet dealings and closed unchanged. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.089 an ounce, the same as late Friday.

HEADLINE: Possibility of a Reunited Germany Is No Cause for Alarm, Bush Says

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he did not share the worries of some European leaders about the possibility of German reunification, and he predicted major changes in Germany's status in the next decade.
Speaking on the morning after at least 150,000 people marched through the streets of Leipzig pressing for political reform, Mr. Bush asserted that Egon Krenz, East Germany's new leader, ''can't turn the clock back,'' because ''the change is too inexorable.''
The President also expressed confidence after a telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany on Monday that Bonn would not develop neutralist tendencies.
''And yet I don't think we ought to be out pushing the concept of reunification, or setting timetables, or coming from across the Atlantic over here making a lot of new pronouncements on this subject,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview in the Oval Office. [Excerpts, page A12.] ''It takes time,'' he added. ''It takes a prudent evolution. It takes work between them. And understanding between the French and the Germans and the Brits and the Germans on all this. But the subject is so much more front and center because of the rapid changes that are taking place in East Germany.'' 
 
Europeans Voice Fears
Leaders of European countries that fought Germany in two world wars -Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and President Francois Mitterrand of France prominent among them - have privately expressed concern about German reunification, and commentators on both sides of the Atlantic have voiced their anxieties in public. The Soviet Union, which suffered the greatest losses in World War II and which is committed to maintaining two Germanys, has criticized those advocating reunification, something it views with great apprehension.
But Mr. Bush, who was in relaxed and spirited form throughout the 30-minute talk, said, ''There's a lot written on the fear of reunification that I personally don't share.''
At the end of the interview, after the White House stenographer and other aides had left, the President motioned to his interviewer and to his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, to stay behind, and he turned to the subject of his leadership on foreign policy.
''These changes we're seeing in Eastern Europe are absolutely extraordinary, but I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Democrats on Capitol Hill have been calling me 'timid.' I have other, better words, like 'cautious,' 'diplomatic,' 'prudent.' We have a good team, well seasoned. We're unified.''
Mr. Sununu interjected: ''It's like hooking a 20-pound fish on a two-pound-test line. React too precipitously, jerk the rod, and the fish will swim away. You have to play him carefully, keep a steady tension on the line.''
The President, apparently reacting to Democratic leaders who have accused him of offering only niggardly aid to Eastern Europe, commented bitterly that he was tired of ''taking hits'' from ''people who found Poland on the globe about three weeks ago.''
On Panama, where the United States declined to intervene militarily to aid an attempted coup this month against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, President Bush rejected suggestions that the failure of the coup would make it harder for General Noriega's opponents in the Panamanian Defense Forces to rise against him again in the near future.
''I think any time you have somebody that is as demonstrably evil as Noriega and who is frustrating the will of the people, as he continues to do, there's bound to be an upheaval,'' he said.
''His response post-coup, in my view, has just shaken to the core the professionals in the P.D.F. That does not enhance his standing there or guarantee that they'll put up with him forever.''
 
Lessons of the Coup Episode
While maintaining that nothing he has learned since would have changed his decision not to involve American forces, the President conceded that ''I've learned'' from the coup episode.
''I think maybe we can improve communications so that it's all across the bureaucracy,'' he explained, adding that there was ''a disconnect'' - a misunderstanding - over whether the rebels would or would not, should or should not, hand over General Noriega to the United States for prosecution.
Mr. Bush saved his sharpest partisan thrusts for the battle over the budget, which has led to automatic across-the-board spending cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. The principal culprits in all this, the President insisted, were the Congressional Democrats, and especially their leaders.
''The perception out there is that it's the fault of the Congress,'' he added. ''And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people.''
 
Economic Situation 'Not Urgent'
Although he conceded that some Americans felt frustration over ''this strange way of governing'' and blamed everyone in Washington, Mr. Bush said most were not alarmed, because the ''economy keeps moving reasonably well, the percentage of Gross National Product in terms of the deficit is moving generally in the right direction.''
''If you had a more difficult economic situation,'' the President said, ''then I think you'd have a more urgent feeling. Today it's not urgent.''
Recalling that he had campaigned for a capital gains tax cut in 1988, he accused the Democrats of resorting ''to this old gambit - this man's trying to help the rich and hurt the poor'' - to prevent approval of a measure that he said the American people had endorsed by electing him, the House of Representatives had passed despite its Democratic majority and the Senate would pass if allowed to by its Democratic leadership.
''The votes are there in the Senate for it,'' the President said. Missed Opportunities? Mr. Bush was asked later whether he felt that he was missing chances during the first two years of his Presidency, which historians consider the most propititious for new initiatives, because of financial strictures. He acknowledged that he felt somewhat ''boxed in'' in such areas as the war against drugs, aid to earthquake and hurricane victims and foreign economic aid, but he offered no suggestion that he would be willing at any point to raise taxes to get more money.
''I don't want to leave you the wrong impression - that if we just had tons more federal money, we could solve everything,'' the President said. ''I don't think that's the case.''
Asked to explain, once and for all, his choice last year of Dan Quayle as his running mate, Mr. Bush demurred. But he vehemently defended Mr. Quayle's performance as Vice President, said the former Senator had ''gone the extra mile to help me'' and disclosed that he still kept in a file some of the newspaper articles mocking his Vice Presidency under Ronald Reagan.
''You're talking to a guy that took it for eight years,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Urban Jobless Joined to Suburban Jobs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Tenants of a Chicago public housing project last week joined the nation's growing ranks of low-income, long-distance commuters, riding a new bus service designed to connect inner city people unable to find jobs with suburban employers who cannot find enough workers.
Like similar projects in about 25 cities across the nation, the commuter van serving the LeClaire Court housing project here crosses city and cultural borders in an attempt to restore balance to an urban landscape where jobs and opportunity are badly out of sync.
While many suburbs have been overwhelmed by an explosion of growth, which compounded their congestion and fostered labor shortages, the poorest neighborhoods within the cities have been afflicted by rising unemployment and despair.
Ruth Banks, a mother of five who lives in LeClaire Court, now knows both of those worlds. The 40-minute trip from the low-income housing development on the city's Southwest Side to her new job as a maid at a hotel in suburban DuPage County means an opportunity to make $5.85 an hour, nearly $2 more than she was earning as a part-time worker in the city, plus full health coverage and other fringe benefits. 
 
Service Expects to Grow
''It's better all the way around,'' said Ms. Banks, as she boarded the maroon and gray van one day last week along with five other tenants of LeClaire Court.''It's a real job.''
Another eight tenants are scheduled to start their suburban jobs next week, and organizers of the van service expect to be carrying 90 commuters back and forth in two vans within a year, said Teresa Prim, the operations manager of the service.
Mark Alan Hughes, an assistant professor of geography, public affairs and urban planning at Princeton University, said that as urban areas become more decentralized it is becoming more important to provide mobility for inner city poor people. They are increasingly isolated from the new jobs in suburbs because suburbs are not well served by public transportation.
At issue is the larger question of black unemployment, which in many urban areas is about twice the rate of whites. In the draft of a report that Professor Hughes has written on behalf of the National League of Cities, he says transportation must be considered in framing antipoverty policy, along with job training, child care and crime prevention.
Such a strategy will be pay immediate benefits, he says, because it does not make the fortunes of inner city residents dependent on whether central cities and their blue-collar economies can be rebuilt, nor on creating affordable housing in suburbs, both of which are politically complex and expensive propositions.
 
Both Sides Benefit
Professor Hughes said at least 53 programs have been organized since 1985 in 25 metropolitan areas to transport city workers to suburban jobs.
More than 500 people are traveling in vans each day out from Milwaukee in an experiment for which the Wisconsin Department of Transportation set aside $200,000. In Washington and Philadelphia, nonprofit community groups have organized similar bus lines, and another Chicago group, Just Jobs, has been carrying 300 people since 1987 from four inner city neighborhoods to temporary jobs in the suburbs.
The Federal Urban Mass Transit Association, working with the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, has provided more than $1.8 million in planning grants in last three years for reverse-commuting projects in 18 cities, including St. Louis, Camden and Jersey City in New Jersey and Boston. The grants pay for job training, recruiting and transporation plans.
Scholars gathered at Northwestern University at a conference on urban poverty last week agreed that changes in the economy that have chased jobs from the city to the suburbs are an important factor in black unemployment.
But they also insisted it is not the sole cause. They cited other factors like racial and cultural stereotyping among employers, the low skills of many young minority applicants and the absence of effective networks of information about available jobs in poor neighborhoods.
 
Transportation Comes First
But at LeClaire Court, the other factors will come later. For now, the transportation problem is being confronted with the van service, which is financed by employer contributions and Government subsidies. The daily service is intended to operate at a profit eventually and to expand to connect other low-income neighborhoods in the city to suburban employers.
Although the jobs at the other end of the ride tend to be entry-level unskilled service positions in stores or hotels, the shortage of labor in these areas has driven up the wages that employers are willing to pay.
William Banks was making the minimum wage, $3.35 an hour, at a Chicago restaurant when he heard about the commuter program. Now the 19-year-old has been hired by Stouffer's Hotel in suburban Itasca, where he will be making $5.85 for work with the hotel's banquet staff.
''I heard there were good jobs in the suburbs, but until now, I didn't know how to get out there,'' Mr. Banks said.
According to statistics from the Illinois Department of Labor, unemployment among blacks in Chicago in 1988 was 12.7 percent. Among LeClaire Court's tenants the situation is worse; more than 60 percent are not working, and an even higher percentage receive some form of welfare.
 
Imbalance Is Seen As Continuing
In contrast, the unemployment rate in DuPage County is only 3.4 percent. One study projected the county would have 100,000 more jobs than it does residents in the next 20 years.
Using a $90,000 grant from the Urban Mass Transit Authority, LeClaire Court not only organized the van service, but also recruits prospective employers and helps provide job training for tenants. The training includes classroom instruction on the work ethic and job discipline, and includes subjects like dressing properly and getting to work on time.
''It's culture shock to take a bunch of minority people into a lily-white environment like DuPage County,'' said Stanley Horn, who is the executive director of the Clarence Darrow Community Center, which provides social services at LeClaire.
Another big obstacle is the reluctance of many public housing tenants to take jobs, because their rent is fixed at 30 percent of their income.
''We are talking with people about jobs, and they are calculating that it's sometimes best for them to stay on welfare rather than work, because their rent will go up with their income,'' Mr. Horn said. The rent figure is set by law, and Mr. Horn has joined other housing officials here in pressing Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish some sort of flexible rent ceiling, so people with jobs will not be pushed out of public housing.
 
Pay From $5.50 to $9 an Hour
So far, about a dozen businesses in DuPage County have agreed to use workers from LeClaire. They include two large hotels, a nursing home chain and a cleaner. Hourly pay is $5.50 to $9.
Businesses are asked to share the cost of the bus service by paying $2 a day per employee. The workers pay an additional $2 a day for the door-to-door commuting service, which is less than it would cost them to travel the same distance on public transportation.
The bus service is operated by the LeClaire Service Corporation, which is the profit-making arm of the LeClaire Court Resident Management Corporation, the tenant group that has been managing day-to-day operations for the 3,500 residents of the housing project since May.
The residents also operate their own laundry and a catering business that supplies 1,000 meals daily to child care centers in the Chicago area.
Like some other residents of the housing project, Mildred Allen said she had been looking for a job when she saw the leaflets advertising the commuter service. ''This is a great opportunity,'' said Ms. Allen, who will work as a telephone operator at a suburban hotel for nearly $6 an hour. It is her first job since 1979.
Nearby, Mr. Horn watched nervously as the first group of LeClaire residents boarded the bus. ''This is kind of an emotional moment,'' he said, as the bus pulled away. ''Like watching your kids on their first day of school.''

HEADLINE: HOMOSEXUALS GAIN MORE ACCEPTANCE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
Public tolerance of homosexual relations between consenting adults has increased, returning to a level that existed in 1982 before public concern over the spread of AIDS caused a backlash against homosexuals, according to the latest Gallup Poll.
Forty-seven percent of the 1,227 people interviewed Oct. 12-15 said homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal, while 36 percent said they should not be. The remainder had no opinion. 
In the most recent previous poll, in 1987, only 33 percent said homosexua relations should be legal, while 55 percent said they should not.
The new national telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
While 45 percent of those polled in 1982 said homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal, the public became more negative in polls in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
Larry Hugick, vice president of the Gallup Organization, offered this interpration: ''Tolerance of homosexuals fell when Americans first started worrying about getting AIDS. But as people's fear of getting AIDS themselves has diminished, tolerance of homosexuals has rebounded to previous levels.''
 
Equal Job Opportunities
Support has also grown for equal job opportunities for homosexuals, with 71 percent saying homosexuals should have ''equal rights in terms of job opportunities,'' up from 59 percent in 1982 and 56 percent in 1977, the only other years in which the question was asked.
But many people distinguish among occupations as appropriate for homosexuals. In the latest poll 79 percent said homosexuals would be appropriate in sales work, but only 60 percent expressed themselves that way regarding the military and 56 percent regarding doctors.
Only a minority said homosexuals were appropriate high school teachers (47 percent), members of the clergy (44 percent) and elementary school teachers (42 percent).
Such differences about employing homosexuals have persisted since Gallup began tracking the six occupations in 1977, but support for equal job opportunity for homosexuals has gradually increased since 1977 for all six.

HEADLINE: How C.I.A. Concocts Soviet Defense Numbers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Russians Are Still Coming'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 9), Richard Pipes argues that the Soviet Union has not become a more peace-loving nation as many believe; rather, it is as aggressive as ever, but has learned to disguise its true intentions. Among other things, Professor Pipes asks:
''How genuine is the change in Soviet foreign policy? Take defense expenditures. Moscow has finally released what it claims to be its true military budget. The 77 billion ruble figure announced earlier this year is about half of what U.S. experts believe to be actual defense appropriations.'' 
Professor Pipes has too much faith in the United States experts. The Central Intelligence Agency, which puts out our official estimates of Soviet defense expenditures, is considered by national security specialists to be our most reliable estimator. Yet, over the last 15 years, the C.I.A.'s estimates have been riddled with errors and misrepresentations, all making Soviet defense expenditures appear larger than they actually are.
From 1975 through 1983, the C.I.A. said Soviet military spending was increasing 4 percent to 5 percent a year. In 1984, the agency acknowledged that it had been wrong - that the increase since 1975 had been only 2 percent a year. After conceding its error, however, the C.I.A. failed to make the appropriate adjustments in its Soviet military spending figures.
In 1982, the Soviets instituted a wide-ranging price reform, the first in 15 years. In 1986, the C.I.A. switched its estimates of Soviet defense spending, which had been in 1970 ruble prices, into the new 1982 ruble prices. Soviet defense spending took a large leap upward because, according to the C.I.A., prices of weapons had increased much faster than prices of civilian goods between 1970 and 1982. But this was all guesswork.
In November, 1987, the agency conceded that it had been unable to obtain 1982 weapons prices and, further, that there was reason to believe that weapons prices had risen more slowly than prices of civilian goods. Yet the new and much higher figures for Soviet defense expenditures were never rescinded.
In 1986, the C.I.A. made another change in established practice. Without explanation or warning, it began to include in its single estimate of Soviet military spending a number of civilian activities that are not included in estimates of United States military spending (such as civilian defense, internal security forces and civilian space activities). This made Soviet defense appear still larger relative to United States defense than it should have been.
When the C.I.A.'s estimate of Soviet military spending is corrected for these errors and misrepresentations, it turns out to be very close to the 77 billion ruble figure announced by Mikhail S. Gorbachev on May 30 -much lower than the C.I.A. estimate and also about one-third lower than United States defense expenditures. Since then, President Gorbachev has announced sharp cuts in Soviet defense spending for 1990 and 1991. Despite Mr. Pipes's fears, there are good reasons to believe President Gorbachev will reduce defense spending. It is to be hoped that President Bush will soon follow suit.

HEADLINE: How C.I.A. Concocts Soviet Defense Numbers;
Exchanges Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am sure many readers will applaud your editorial proposal of Oct. 18 (''Help Who?'') to expand academic exchanges with the Soviet Union as a way of helping the Soviet restructuring program of perestroika. They would be distressed to know, however, that 35 Soviet research scholars who are at American universities this year participating in the longstanding intergovernment exchange program administered by the International Research & Exchange Board will have to be sent home early because of insufficient Federal funds. Even the modest traditional quota of 50 participants - which was supposed to go up to more than 100 in 1989-90 - has not been met for many years because of fund shortfalls. 
Many of the leading reformers in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are graduates of these exchanges, which we managed to sustain for more than 30 years, even during the worst East-West tensions. Our Soviet alumni include such key figures as Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, the Politburo member who oversees foreign policy; Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the upper chamber of the Soviet parliament; Tatyana I. Zaslavskaya, the sociologist and public-opinion institute director, and the economist Nikolai P. Shmelev.
In Eastern Europe, to cite only Hungary, alumni include the minister of justice, the minister of culture, the president of the new Hungarian Socialist Party and the prime minister. Exchanges work: much of the conceptual framework for the new thinking in the region has come from scholars whose American experiences were pivotal.
So you are right to call for an expansion, not only for Soviet scholars but also for the growing number of American researchers who need access to the Soviet Union. But unfunded enthusiasm isn't enough. It would be better not to raise hopes unless the United States is prepared to deliver.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
After the Dawn, a New Day

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
In two recent speeches, Secretary of State James Baker showed that the Bush Administration had at last grasped some sense of the vast, historic changes taking place in the Communist East.
That is certainly an advance over earlier incredulity that Mikhail Gorbachev was serious about new policies, and then supposing his failure would restore the Moscow status quo.
Mr. Baker now says sensibly that ''any uncertainty about the fate of reform in the Soviet Union is all the more reason, not less, for us to seize the present opportunity'' for arms control agreements. ''For the works of our labor - a diminished Soviet threat and effectively verifiable agreements - can endure even if perestroika does not.'' And he pointed out that ''with agreements in place, any attempt to break out of treaties'' would alert the world. 
But this recognition that America's interests are indeed served by new Soviet policies, including the policy of allowing Eastern European reformers to break their Communist parties' monopoly of power, is still reactive. It doesn't represent thinking ahead in Washington, any effort to shape events rather than submit to them.
A check of major allied capitals indicates that no government, except perhaps Italy, is seriously looking beyond the immediate problems of the East's struggle to get out of the wreckage its Communist regimes have imposed. The West is acting as though the only choice were to revert to the structure of Europe between the two World Wars.
But if that were possible, and in many ways it is not, it would be disastrous. The task of leaders now is to foresee new forms of organizing relations so as not to let the vacuum be filled by incoherent pressures.
Some think tanks are starting to talk about the future ''European architecture,'' a broad notion seeking to outline various ways that new East-West relations could be framed. People involved stress that the effective tool of power is becoming economic might, no longer military force. New economic patterns must be devised.
Italy's Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, is preparing to attend a ground-breaking meeting in Budapest later this month with the Foreign Ministers of Austria, Yugoslavia and Hungary to discuss what kind of regional cooperation might be developed in Central Europe.
These are urgent issues because as the Eastern countries break out of the rigid post-World War II mold, they need some chart of where to go so as not to risk floundering in the crises of the Stalinist legacy.
The West, both Western Europe and the U.S., has to accept intellectual responsibility for creating a new design, as it did for half of Europe in the wake of victory. The new leaders in the East are overwhelmed with the enormously difficult tasks of discarding their heritage. They cannot sit back and think longer-term.
Even the strictly military issues of arms control require more than conventional approaches focusing on parity, verification, minimum defense. It was pointed out at the conference of the Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt last weekend, for example, that European arms reductions can create serious new problems in the burgeoning third-world arms race.
As weapons procurement is cut back, military producers in East and West will be tempted to expand other markets. So this question should be included in talks to provide some kind of agreed restraint on increased sales outside Europe.
It is not enough to move toward demilitarizing East-West relations if the effect is to encourage militarization of other international relations. India has developed both long- and short-range missiles, apparently by diverting foreign help on space technology, and this will accelerate military rivalries in Asia.
Mr. Baker did say the Administration wished to broaden the arms control agenda with Moscow ''far wider than its traditional East-West nuclear focus.'' That is necessary, and it has begun in talks on banning chemical weapons and some show of concern for the spread of missilery. Attention should also start being paid to promoting third-world arms reductions.
The ''German question'' is coming to the fore in worried talk about reunification. It is time to start thinking about what conditions would finally make it acceptable to negotiate a German peace treaty. This has never been possible because the East insists that a treaty must validate partition, and the West refuses.
Saluting the dawn of a new era is only a beginning. Washington must do much more than watch if it wishes to influence the coming day.

HEADLINE: Deficit Reduction: A Love Story;
We Made A Commitment

BYLINE: By Phil Gramm and Warren B. Rudman; Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, and Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, are members of the Senate budget committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Those who call the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law a bad law because deficit targets have been missed and accounting gimmicks have been used to avoid tough decisions would probably also suggest that religion is a failure because there are so few saints in the world.
Sure, the balanced budget law is not functioning perfectly from an accounting standpoint, but that misses the point. Critics fail to comprehend the purpose or effect of the law.
They focus on mechanism and minutiae when, in fact, the law represents a continuing commitment to deficit reduction. And the fact is that both the Federal budget deficit and Federal spending are lower than they would have been without Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. 
Before the balanced budget law, the budget deficit for fiscal year 1986 was projected to exceed $230 billion and Federal spending policies had the country on the way to $300 billion deficits by the end of the decade. The law, however, immediately cut nearly $11.7 billion from the 1986 deficit.
Currently, the ''great failure'' of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings is to reduce the deficit below $117 billion -half of what the deficit was when we began. Moreover, the deficit, when measured against gross national product - which many economists consider to be more important than the actual dollar number - will be 60 percent lower in 1990 than it was in 1986.
Average annual real growth in Federal spending has dropped from 4 percent in the years preceding Gramm-Rudman-Hollings to 1.6 percent since.
In late 1985, most economists and many businessmen believed that a recession within the next four years was unavoidable. That recession has yet to materialize; the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings inspired change in Federal fiscal policy is at least partially responsible.
Too, the balanced budget law has dramatically affected specific legislative proposals which would have raised the deficit. This fall the Senate passed an amendment increasing anti-drug funding by $3.2 billion over the amounts previously agreed. That additional funding was fully offset with spending cuts in other areas. Can anyone imagine that happening before Gramm-Rudman-Hollings?
In 1986, during an election year, the Senate killed a $1 billion farm credit bill on a point of order created by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. That same year, Congress enacted a revenue neutral tax reform law - something most Washington pundits had thought was impossible.
Finally, the defense budget, when measured in real terms, has declined in each of the last four fiscal years. Incidentally, both of us would have preferred somewhat higher spending on defense.
All of these actions are direct results of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
It is certainly true, albeit regrettable, that Congress and the Administration have resorted to budget trickery in order to avoid some hard decisions. And, while gimmicks to hide the true cost of Federal programs have existed for many years, we concede that the willingness of the two branches to resort to such tricks has increased somewhat this year.
Yet, even with the gimmicks, the deficit is projected to continue on its downward path in 1990.
If the across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect last week stick, Congress and the President will have failed in their work on the budget, but the deficit will go down.
If the necessary deficit reduction steps are taken to void the cuts, both the budget process and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings will be working. And it is noteworthy that, for all the concern expressed about the across-the-board cuts, nobody is talking about waiving them.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law is a statement about our will and determination to confrong the most serious economic problem facing our country - the Federal budget deficit.
Just as we don't judge the success of religion by the number of saints but by whether or not the world is better off, so should we judge Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Silence on Fiscal Squeeze

SERIES: COURTER AND FLORIO ON THE ISSUES - LAST OF THREE ARTICLES

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 24

 BODY:
Unlike any other issue in New Jersey, the issue of raising taxes or cutting government programs brings out a certain reticence in the two candidates running for governor.
With the state facing a slack economy and growing budget troubles, many fiscal experts say the next governor will have to raise taxes or cut services. But both the Democrat, Representative James J. Florio, and the Republican, Representative Jim Courter, refuse to talk about doing either.
The candidates often speak about encouraging economic growth while protecting the environment. But they appear to prefer not to offer specific - and, most likely, unpopular - answers on how they would balance the state budget until after the election. 
In separate interviews last week, Mr. Florio and Mr. Courter presented their views on taxes and a wide range of other issues to reporters of The New York Times.
Mr. Florio, who proposes an array of initiatives and a vision of a more active state government, said he would pay for new programs by increasing efficiency. But before he can pinpoint the waste involved, Mr. Florio said, he has to conduct an audit. And, he said, he has to wait for its results before specifying where he will find most of the new revenue and where he will make cuts.
''I do not foresee any new taxes,'' Mr. Florio said. ''I think it's responsible, before anybody talks about any new resources, to find out where the resources went that have been coming in.''
Mr. Courter's stand on taxes is based on his belief that social good grows out of economic growth and that government can often do the most good by just getting out of the way. Accordingly, he has pledged not to raise taxes, and he will try to institute a cap on state spending and offer the elderly a freeze on their property taxes.
But Mr. Courter will not say what he would do if budget problems worsen or what programs or employees he would shed. ''I'm going to make tough decisions,'' Mr. Courter said.
Both candidates are aware that taxes, cutbacks and calls for tax changes are likely to be the main subjects of discussion next year for the new governor and Legislature.
After seven years of thundering economic growth and a doubling of the size of state government under Gov. Thomas H. Kean, New Jersey faces lackluster growth in at least the near future and a shortfall in revenues for next year's budget. Experts estimate the shortfall could grow to more than $500 million.
The State Constitution requires a balanced budget. This year Mr. Kean slashed programs and speeded the payments from some taxes to balance the $12 billion budget.
The Office of Legislative Services, the fiscal arm of the Legislature, and Laurence S. Weiss, Democratic of Perth Amboy and chairman of the State Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, have said revenues from the sales, business and income taxes will not be enough to support even modest growth in next year's budget.
In addition, suburban homeowners have grown furious in the last year, as their property taxes have jumped. Poor cities have complained that the system, which makes them reliant on their dwindling property-tax base, drives businesses and residents to the suburbs.
 
Under Eye of Court
The new governor is also expected to be confronted with a ruling by the State Supreme Court that could require a revision or overhaul of the tax system. The court is considering a suit that contends the system of paying for public education violates the State Constitution because it has not eliminated disparities in financing between affluent suburban districts and those in poor cities. School districts rely on property taxes for the major shares of their budgets.
The last time the court ruled on the issue, in 1973, it forced the Legislature to establish the first income tax for the state and to enact a law that increased state aid to local districts.
When questioned about the looming pressures, Mr. Florio repeatedly harkened back to what he described as the failure of the Kean administration to keep track of its spending.
''We have seen in the last eight years an increase that is beyond description,'' Mr. Florio said. ''There is nobody in the business community that I've talked to who said that you can go and pump as much money into this state government as we have pumped into it in this relatively short period of time and have any degree of confidence that it was spent correctly.''
 
Community Psychiatric Centers
As an example of mismanagement, Mr. Florio pointed to the Joint Underwriting Association, which was created to provide automobile insurance to motorists with bad driving records. The agency is more than $3 billion in debt. He also pointed to a scandal in the Human Services Department, in which a midlevel executive dispensed $32 million in unauthorized funds.
Using an audit by consultants, Mr. Florio said, he would search for duplicated services or ways services could be improved at less expense. He said if proper community treatment centers existed, he would release 610 people now in psychiatric hospitals to such centers, where their care would cost half the $70,000 a year a patient that the public pays today.
Mr. Florio said he hoped to provide added aid to municipalities to relieve the burden of property taxes. But, he said, he cannot be sure where that money would come from until his audit.
For Mr. Courter, a central theme of his campaign has been his promise not to raise taxes, which he dramatized this month by signing what he called a no-tax pledge. Mr. Courter has said on many occasions that in the long run taxes stifle economic growth, in turn limiting tax revenues.
 
Proposal for a Freeze
To relieve a burden on elderly people, who often live on fixed incomes, Mr. Courter proposed allowing people at the age of 65 to apply for a freeze on their property taxes. The state would receive a lien on the taxpayer's house and collect the unpaid taxes when the person died.
When asked about predictions of a shortage of revenues to balance the budget next year, Mr. Courter expressed optimism that revenues would increase and that cuts would not be necessary. He declined to say what programs he would be most likely to trim first.
On aid to education, Mr. Courter said he would like to help increase financing, but stressed that money alone would not solve the problems of public schools. The state has spent more than $8 billion on education in the last 10 years, Mr. Courter said, the most spending per student in the nation.
''Money is important, but it is certainly not the only thing,'' Mr. Courter said. ''If money made for perfect education, the children in the State of New Jersey would be the best in the United States of America.''
 
Comparing Their Answers
In separate interviews this month, The New York Times asked the two candidates for governor of New Jersey to discuss the problems facing the state and how to deal with them. This is the last of three articles comparing their responses. These are excerpts from the interviews.
