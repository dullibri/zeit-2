HEADLINE: Market Place;
Adding Appeal To Savings Bonds

BYLINE: By Alison Leigh Cowan

 BODY:
THE Senate took a big step last week to help parents finance their children's college education with Federal savings bonds, and the measure is now part of the joint tax bill expected to be submitted to President Bush in the next 10 days.
But a group of Wall Street professionals and local and state government officials known as the Saving for College Coalition is working behind the scenes to kill the measure. These purveyors of investment products like exotic bank certificates of deposit, prepaid tuition plans and municipal bonds would have the most to lose if the measure became law and they had to compete with the deep pockets of the Federal Government for parents' scarce investment dollars. 
 The tax provision would enable the interest income on Government savings bonds to be exempt from Federal taxes if it is spent on higher education. Since 1990, savings bonds have been free of all state and local taxes, but the Federal exemption has been available only to holders with adjusted gross incomes below certain levels in the year of redemption.
Savings bonds are already one of this year's hottest investments. They carry a 5.58 percent interest rate and can be held for as long as 30 years, but can yield far more because of the Government's longstanding promise to pay anyone who holds them for five years or more a minimum of 6 percent.
Despite the bonds' strong sales, some Senate aides and Treasury officials say the program is not benefiting as many people as it should because of the complex rules governing their tax-exempt status. "If you buy a bond now, you're essentially guessing that 5 or 10 years down the line you'll be under the income limits, and most people tend to be optimistic about their future," one Senate aide explained.
"The present program is very confusing to people," said William Deaver, the Treasury Department official who heads the division that has to market the bonds.
Still, the critics -- mutual funds, brokerage houses, state and local government finance officers and others -- have some excellent arguments against the proposal. That is despite the fact that they are in the awkward position of having to attack a tax bill with some notable attractions, like one that would allow investors to use tax-favored individual retirement accounts to pay for a variety of medical and educational expenses that are now disallowed.
One of their chief complaints is that Congress is vastly understating the cost of the proposed savings bond tax exemption. According to the Senate's latest estimates, the Government would lose $7 million -- yes, million -- in taxes over the next five years if the provision becomes law. But that ignores that the costs will balloon once people begin cashing in their bonds 10 to 15 years from now.
"The reality is, it will cost the Government a fortune," said Robert C. Pozen, the general counsel of Fidelity Investments, a huge mutual fund that supports the tax bill even though it opposes loosening the income limits on Government savings bonds.
Mr. Pozen and other members of the Wall Street coalition also believe that the lost taxes would be chicken feed next to the higher borrowing costs that the Treasury would incur if the sales of savings bonds skyrocketed. One conservative estimate places the cost at $60 million a month or $720 million a year, based on the difference between the 5.2 percent that the Government would otherwise pay on five-year Treasuries versus the 6 percent it would have to pay investors who held their savings bonds for five years or more.
The Government can theoretically adjust the 6 percent floor, but is obliged by law to peg the savings bonds' nominal rate to a basket of taxable, five-year Treasuries.
A far more subtle concern involves the impact that a highly tax-favored Government bond might have on the municipal bond market as state and local governments are forced to pay more to investors to try to match the after-tax proceeds of savings bonds.
"What Congress is doing is causing this formerly taxable bond to be tax-exempt," said Peter A. Roberts, the president of the College Savings Bank in Princeton, N.J., which offers federally insured certificates of deposit designed to keep pace with the spiraling costs of a college education.
Mr. Roberts's bank, which estimates that the cost of a four-year private college education in 2010 will be $350,000, is expected to be among the big losers if the legislation passes. "You're going to have a pre-emptive Federal product in the market," he said, "a product that will dominate the market and crowd out all other competition."
Because lower- and middle-income people already qualify for the full tax benefits of savings bonds, Mr. Roberts, for one, contends the latest initiative is "clearly a rich person's tax incentive."
But the bill's architects have been largely unmoved by the counterarguments. "Everyone benefits from this except the vested interests," one Senate aide said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finishes Day Higher After Some Early Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday on a day when the world's stock markets dipped and swayed.
Paul Ferley, the assistant chief economist at the Toronto branch of the Bank of Montreal, said the United States dollar had some choppy trading early in the day because of the unresolved turmoil concerning European currencies, but was strengthened later by the release of figures on American auto sales. 
 Domestic auto sales were down six-tenths of 1 percent in late September, about what analysts were expecting.
"That helped the dollar," said Mr. Ferley, who added that it was seen as a sign that the American economy was not as weak as thought.
The volatility of the stock markets -- the Dow Jones industrial average fell 105 points in the morning before ending the day with a loss of 21.61 points -- did not seem to have an effect on the dollar.
"For the moment" the dollar seemed above the fray, Mr. Ferley said.
The dollar rose to 119.75 Japanese yen in New York, compared with 119.35 late Friday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing of 119.25 yen, down from 119.40 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 119.55 yen.
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.7135, compared with $1.7285 late Friday. In London, the pound fell to $1.6960, from $1.7265 late Friday.
The pound continued to come under pressure against other European currencies, closing at 2.3942 German marks, compared with 2.4361 on Friday.
Dealers said the pound was affected by fears that the British Government has failed to come up with an alternative economic strategy after the pound was removed from Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism on Sept. 16.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.4170 marks, up from 1.4095; 1.2365 Swiss francs, up from 1.2320; 4.8165 French francs, up from 4.7700; 1,319.5 Italian lire, up from 1,250.0, and 1.24645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.25065.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, were: 1.4030 German marks, down from 1.4110; 1.2245 Swiss francs, down from 1.2370; 4.7775 French francs, up from 4.7725; 1.5815 Dutch guilders, down from 1.5884; 1,315.50 Italian lire, up from 1,247; 1.2463 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2542.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Big Plunge in Stocks Is Felt In Cattle and Gold Markets

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market's plunge yesterday sent ripples of worry through the commodity markets, where the reactions ranged from a sharp drop in cattle futures prices to a strong gain for gold.
On other commodity markets, natural gas futures crumbled; oil futures fell, and most grain and soybean futures retreated. 
 Much of the early trading in commodities was dominated by pessimism about the economy as stocks plunged, then regained most of the ground.
In the cattle trading pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, "traders got jittery," said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago.
Live cattle for October delivery ended 0.55 cent lower at 75.37 cents a pound after trading as low as 74.95 early in the session. The more heavily traded December live cattle contract settled 0.95 cent lower at 73.12 cents a pound.
 
Russian Buying Expected
 Selling of hog futures was offset by expectations that Russia would buy pork with some of the American loan guarantees it was granted for purchases of American farm goods in the fourth quarter, Mr. Levitt said.
October live hogs ended 0.20 cent higher at 43.25 cents a pound, and February frozen pork bellies fell 0.57 cent, to 39.30 cents a pound.
Gold and silver futures rallied moderately on New York's Commodity Exchange as investors sought the perceived safety of precious metals, said Tom Griffo, metals analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
October gold rose $2.40, to $350.50 a troy ounce; October silver climbed 1.5 cents, to $3.749 a troy ounce.
Natural gas futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Oklahoma Legislature voted Friday to increase the amount of permitted natural gas production in that state.
Natural gas for November delivery plunged 12.3 cents, to $2.382 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Light sweet crude oil for November delivery fell 15 cents, to $21.77 a barrel; November heating oil fell 0.32 cent, to 63.53 cents a gallon, and November unleaded gasoline fell 0.22 cent, to 58.28 a gallon.
Most grain futures fell on the Chicago Board of Trade as the advancing corn and soybean harvest kept pressure on prices.

HEADLINE: Add Weakening Market To Recipe for a Rate Cut

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Today's stock market adds some piquant spice to the stew of factors that the Federal Reserve's chief policy-making committee will consider when it meets Tuesday. On balance, economists said, the market's weakness made an interest-rate cut more likely.
Fed officials, already concerned about the fragile state of the economy, cannot turn a blind eye to the volatile situation on Wall Street. What is more, Fed officials concede their anxiety about the economy's enduring weakness, even as they have already cut rates many times to spur the economy. 
 Still, many Fed watchers predict the central bank will cut rates further in light of poor economic statistics, including last week's unimpressive unemployment report.
"I am one who predicts that the Fed will cut rates," said Albert M. Wojnilower, senior economist at the First Boston Asset Management Corporation. "Whether they do it this week or after the election, I don't know. Clearly if the stock market performs very poorly, that will be an additional influence for a rate cut."
 
But Maybe Not
 Still, it would be dangerous to assume that Wall Street's woes guarantee that the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-member committee that meets Tuesday, will decide to cut rates.
The committee will undoubtedly be mindful of the dollar's weakness. In recent days, the dollar has fallen to record lows against the Japanese yen and continued to hover just above its historic lows against the German mark. Market watchers agree that a new Fed rate cut would undercut the dollar, by pushing money managers to turn away from American investments in favor of higher-yielding assets abroad. Some analysts fear a rate cut might turn the dollar's slide into a rout, which could roil the nation's stock and bond markets.
Talking about a rate cut, Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities Ltd., said, "it could absolutely clobber the dollar, which would create more turmoil."
While a rate cut might be aimed at undergirding Wall Street, it could well undermine Europe's equity markets. Nervous about Europe's currency crisis, stock markets fell sharply today in London, Paris and Frankfurt. A Fed rate cut could well aggravate Europe's currency tensions by strengthening the German mark. This would increase the strains on the French franc, Italian lira, British pound and other European currencies.
"You wouldn't cut the rate right in the middle of a market crisis," Mr. Wojnilower said. "If the Fed is deterred from cutting rates, I'd say the major reason is they would have been asked by the Europeans not to do something that would worsen the upset in European currency markets."
Fed watchers said the central bank pumped some additional liquidity into the financial system today to bring the rate that banks lend each other money overnight back down to 3 percent, the rate the Fed set Sept. 4. Late last week, this rate, known as the Federal funds rate, drifted up to about 33/16 . Economists speculated that the Fed did not move last week to bring the Federal Funds rate back down because it was concerned that its move would be misinterpreted as a rate cut.
 
No Crisis Meetings
 Administration officials said there were no crisis meetings this morning after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 105 points, before ending the day down 21.61. There were phone calls, however, between the Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission and other departments, and officials said they were pleased with how circuit-breakers -- techniques developed to steady the system -- worked today.
Some analysts said the best possible move to reassure markets would be a coordinated rate cut by the United States, Germany and Japan. Such a concerted move, they said, could be done without increasing pressures on the dollar and on Europe's monetary system.
"What we have is an absence of coordination," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities house. "It would be great if someone could step up to the plate and take a leadership role."

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Mexico Cheered by Support Of Clinton for Trade Accord

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The Mexican Government voiced confidence today that Gov. Bill Clinton's qualified endorsement of a North American Free Trade Agreement had cleared the path to its approval.
Mexican business leaders who support the accord were openly euphoric. After a week of steady increases, values on the Mexico City stock exchange leaped 64.63 points, or 4.65 percent, on the news, closing at 1,454.35. It was the market's second-largest gain this year. 
 With the stronger backing of Democrats in the United States, senior Mexican officials predicted that they could find solutions to any remaining concerns in Congress without renegotiating the agreement to form a free trade zone of the two countries and Canada.
"We can now affirm that the two most important political forces of the United States agree on the advantageousness of having a trilateral free trade agreement," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told businessmen in Mexico City this morning. "In Mexico as in the other two countries, there is now broad national consensus that confirms that the free trade agreement is on a very good road toward its legislative stage and its later enactment."
Despite the uncertainty about what adjustments Mr. Clinton had in mind, his new stance seems likely to end what became almost a national obsession in Mexico with the outcome of the Presidential race in the United States. Next month's vote has been widely seen here as a referendum on the country's economic future.
While Mexican officials have been typically careful not to make their sympathies public, they have made little secret in private of their hope that Mr. Bush would be re-elected. Beyond his support for the trade agreement, aides to Mr. Salinas said they felt that Mr. Bush was personally committed to elevating Mexico's importance in Washington's foreign policy and that this view permeated his Administration.
In the minds of some Democrats, Mr. Salinas even loomed as a potential player in the American Presidential race insofar as he might praise Mr. Bush for backing the agreement and put pressure on Mr. Clinton indirectly to do the same. Envoys of the Governor underscored that perception by arguing to Mexican officials in a series of recent private meetings that a Democratic President could more easily win support for the agreement from a Democratic Congress.
On Sunday, Representative Robert Matsui of California hinted that Mr. Clinton's new position made this argument somewhat more than hypothetical. Mr. Matsui, a Democrat who sits on the House Ways and Means Committee's international trade subcommittee, said he would support an agreement only under a Clinton Presidency because he felt that Mr. Bush would not deal adequately with the labor and environmental issues that would arise.

HEADLINE: House Approves Energy Legislation

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The House today overwhelmingly approved compromise energy legislation that would encourage the use of alternative fuels and streamline licensing of nuclear power plants. But a filibuster threat in the Senate left final passage in some doubt.
Two years of backroom skirmishing and parliamentary delays have already torn out of the legislation the provisions that would have done the most to reduce American dependence on foreign oil. One would have permitted oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; the other would have required automobile fuel efficiency. 
 The bill is in jeopardy now because of a provision that would help clear the way to the establishment of a nuclear-waste dump in the Nevada desert. As the House debated and voted, the real battle was across the Capitol, where Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the powerful Democratic committee chairman from Louisiana, who was the principal Senate author of the bill, and Senator Richard H. Bryan, the freshman Democrat from Nevada who has crusaded to stop the waste dump, dueled each other and the clock.
Mr. Bryan is threatening a filibuster, on the hope that not enough members will want to return to Washington Wednesday night or Thursday after a recess for the Yom Kippur holiday, to amass the 60 votes necessary to cut it off.
"It's an uphill struggle," said Mr. Bryan, who is trying to make common cause with lawmakers who oppose $2.6 billion in tax increases included in the bill and others upset that strong provisions prohibiting offshore drilling were cut from the bill. "Many of our colleagues are responding that 'if they can give you folks in Nevada the shaft, we could be next,' " he said.
Even in reduced form, the legislation would affect the way almost all Americans consume energy. Homebuyers will receive lower interest rates on mortgages for better-insulated homes. Government and large private fleets will be phased in with vehicles run on natural gas, methane or batteries. Industries will be obliged to make more efficient plumbing fixtures, air conditioning and heating units, and light bulbs. All told, sponsors say the bill would conserve 5 to 7 million barrels of oil a day.
The widest reaching provision would rewrite 1935 utility regulations, lowering electricity prices by increasing competition between power generating utilities and removing restrictions on smaller power companies from using power lines controlled by larger utilities. By opening transmission access to small energy firms, lawmakers hope to give a major push to developers of wind, solar, geothermal and other alternative energy sources.
The House passed the bill by a vote of 363 to 60, with 239 Democrats joining 123 Republicans and one independent in supporting the measure. Voting no were 20 Democrats and 40 Republicans.
"We have broken the gridlock in Washington on this issue," said Representative Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana and on the House side one of the legislation's primary authors. "This bill is a giant step toward efficiency and conservation."
The legislation would block the Interior Department from strip mining in national parks and forests for one year. And though the Administration had wanted the opportunity to conduct such mining, President Bush has indicated he will sign the legislation. The White House supports several provisions in the bill, particularly one that combines the procedures for licensing construction and operation of new nuclear power plants into a one-step process.
In the House debate, the loudest opposition came from Nevada's two representatives, over a last-minute provision to ease radiation standards for testing at the proposed nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich, Republican of Nevada, said the decision to strip much of the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to set radiation dose standards and grant it to the National Academy of Sciences, a private group, represented a "cavalier indifference for the public's health and safety."
Representative James H. Bilbray, Democrat of Nevada, charged that Senator Johnston was willing to "fit the standards whatever they find at Yucca Mountain." He predicted that over 10,000 years, "you'll have 3 million fatal cancers in the area."
In the Senate, Mr. Bryan was pressing on with his efforts to derail the bill, though they appeared to lose some steam this afternoon, when two powerful potential allies were appeased by a tax that would protect the health insurance of thousands of retired coal miners. Both West Virginia Senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, had a keen interest in the provision.

Relative Calm Displayed by Bonds

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The stock market's selloff and snap-back produced less a flight to quality than a crawl yesterday, with most Treasury securities barely ahead and the 30-year bond down.
As the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 100 points, then recovered most of that, the five-year note rose half a point, then retreated, to stand at 10114/32 , up just 4/32 in late trading. 
 That issue was the Treasury market's strongest performer, as few investors had enough confidence to bet on the longer term.
 
Staying Away From Risk
 "You have defensive money that hides up front, whether you're a five-year player who buys two-year notes, or a 10-year player who buys five-year notes," said Patrick Rothstein, a Merrill Lynch managing director in charge of trading. "Quality does not include 30-year securities. Too long, too dicey."
The 30-year bond fell 6/32 (about $2 on a face value of $1,000), to 9828/32 , in late trading, yielding 7.34 percent. The spread over the two-year note stood at a record 3.67 percentage points.
Such records have become routine. "All the action was in intermediates," said Daniel Chapple, a senior trader at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The bond has been lagging every day."
The 30-year bond has been responding as much to political doubts as to short-term predictions about interest rates. Mr. Chapple pointed to expectations that the next President, whoever he may be, will stimulate the economy, which could cause interest rates to rise.
Some traders trembled at unconfirmed rumors that the Federal funds rate, for overnight lending among banks, would be lowered half a percentage point. "There's a general fear that the Fed will overdo it in the end," Mr. Chapple said.
 
Off the Roller-Coaster
 Compared with their colleagues on the equity desks, bond strategists seemed fairly placid, as if they were merely standing by watching others on the roller-coaster ride.
"It really wasn't until the stock market was down more than 50 points that you saw any response in the credit market," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
Many traders have shied away from making major bets until after Federal Reserve policy makers meet today. A decision to ease monetary policy has been widely expected, and bond prices rose last week in anticipation.
The Treasury's weekly three- and six-month bill auctions drew strong demand yesterday, with yields falling to their lowest levels in 30 years. The three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 2.67 percent and the six-month bill at 2.78 percent. Each maturity attracted more than $33 billion in bids for $10.2 billion in bills.
"In the environment we're in," said Joel D. Kazis, managing director of government sales and trading at UBS Securities, "there's always going to be good demand at the short end."
 
7-Year Notes at 5.79%
 In the when-issued market, the new seven-year notes to be auctioned tomorrow traded at a price to yield 5.79 percent.
Some strategists wonder whether the money flooding into short- and medium-term Government issues could just as easily rush out. Commercial banks have been among the major buyers of this debt in recent years.
Thomas W. Synnott 3d, chief economist at the United States Trust Company of New York, warns that new banking regulations would restrict banks' purchases, and in his view raise interest rates and harm the health of banks.
Under a 1991 law, banks with heavy holdings of Treasury securities would be judged less sound unless they set aside more capital, he said in an article for Standard & Poor's Creditweek.
Following are the results of yesterday's sale of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Guns or Butter? Labor Ambivalent

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to putting pressure on military contractors to stop making warplanes and guns and start making subway cars or electric autos, no group is more ambivalent than the nation's labor unions. "We take the high road," said Mark Roberts, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. official. "We are for shifting resources from weaponry to civilian goods." But unions are still lobbying Congress for more money to build more fighter planes and more submarines.
Behind this contradictory behavior is jobs. With the military budget shrinking in the post-cold-war era, thousands of jobs in weapons factories are disappearing, and the workers involved are demanding that their unions do something. 
 "We are trying to protect the jobs of our skilled people, and how do you do that? Yes, by lobbying for warplanes and other weapons to keep people working," said Richard Michalski, director of legislative action for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The machinists' union and the United Auto Workers, which between them have more than 200,000 members still employed by weapons companies, are under particular pressure.
"Once a month our locals have a membership meeting, and when you have a lot of laid-off people, they attend," said James Coakley, a U.A.W. official who deals with the General Dynamics division that makes tanks and other armored vehicles. "They want to know what the union is doing to get their jobs back or to get them early retirement pay. That is more important to them than conversion, which they see as a long way off; something for someone else."
Still, the unions push conversion, convinced that weapons-making jobs will continue to disappear, and conversion holds out the hope of saving some jobs. The unions are trying to help military contractors switch to civilian production, sometimes joining them as business associates. They are pushing for the manufacture of products that governments will buy, like subway cars, or that the Federal Government has ordered companies to acquire, like double-hulled oil tankers to protect against oil spills at sea.
And they are trying to get Congress to authorize Federal income support for workers who do not survive the transition period. In place of unemployment insurance, a laid-off worker would get 70 percent of his last salary for at least one year. "They haven't enough money to support themselves while they retrain," said Mark Baldwin, an economist for the United Automobile Workers. "So they end up taking the first available job, rather than seeking the best job."
So far, the unions have made little progress toward any of their goals. But the conflicting pressures on them produce some eye-catching activity. The U.A.W., for example, visits members of Congress hand-in-hand with General Dynamics executives, lobbying for money to build more tanks at the company's plants in the Midwest. But in the purchase contract, the U.A.W. wants the Pentagon to include a provision requiring General Dynamics to pay early pensions to laid-off workers over age 55. The company objects.
Similarly, the machinists lobbied hard this summer to help win President Bush's approval for the sale of 222 fighter planes to Taiwan and Saudi Arabia -- planes to be made by union members at General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas. And they want Congress to reverse its decision to halt production of the F-117 Stealth fighter, once made by Lockheed in Southern California.
But while the machinists fight for more weapons-making jobs, they are also asking the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission to promote conversion in selecting the prime contractor for a new rapid-transit system that is to cost taxpayers $130 billion over a decade. Whoever is finally chosen as prime contractor -- the candidates include Morrison Knudsen, Bombardier and Siemens -- the machinists want the city to insist that the contractor purchase parts and supplies in Southern California, preferably from aerospace companies that lost military work.
"We feel our people have the necessary skills," said Don Nakamoto, research director of Machinists District 727, which had 7,000 active members in 1990 and now has 2,400. "It is a matter of insisting that the prime contractor use local suppliers."
The leverage, of course, is taxpayer money. Just as Pentagon spending created and sustained the giant military industry, so government is being asked to finance the conversion to civilian production. The unions count on this support, and so do military contractors, to the extent that they get involved in conversion at all.
Certainly Mr. Nakamoto counts on it. His union is still lobbying Congress for money to restart F-117 production. And he is lobbying Los Angeles County on the local-supplier issue for the rail transit project. "There is no point in retraining people and sending them out to look for jobs," he said. "In Southern California there are no good jobs. The marketplace is not working now."

Wave of Mergers Is Ahead, But Not Like the 1980's Kind

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A SIGNIFICANT new round of agency mergers and acquisitions seems imminent, although it will be far different from the wave of buy-ups and buyouts that roiled the industry in the boom years of the 1980's.
The primary differences are that unlike many of the 80's transactions, which were motivated by growth for growth's sake and occurred at spectacularly high prices, the next spate of deals will be impelled by much more practical purposes and will be reasonably priced. 
 Among the considerations behind the forthcoming transactions are factors like needing to bolster international capabilities, improving service in important markets like Los Angeles and New York and paying down debt taken on during the 80's growth binge.
"If you want to identify the deals of five years ago as components of empire-building," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York, "these tend to be strategic or symbiotic on an operating level."
Among the impending and expected transactions (subject, of course, to the usual derailments over price, power and client conflict) are these:
* BBDO Worldwide in New York acquiring the Ross Roy Group in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The two agencies share a major client, the Chrysler Corporation, which is believed to be considering a reduction in the number of agencies on its roster.
* Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston buying a New York-based shop to strengthen its own New York office, which has lagged behind other large agencies' operations here.
* Ketchum Communications in Pittsburgh and New York and Ayer Inc. in New York merging, combining an agency company that is stronger domestically (Ketchum) with one stronger internationally (Ayer).
* The Lowe Group in London acquiring Scali, McCabe, Sloves Inc. in New York from the WPP Group P.L.C. in London, which has been under financial pressure from an extensive and expensive series of deals made in the 80's.
Susan L. Decker, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco, said the transactions seemed "more mutually beneficial this time around," to clients as well as to agencies.
For instance, she added, agencies realize that "they need more geographic breadth" as "clients expand into other markets."
The backdrop for the new round oftransactions is the industry's continuing recession, now entering its third year.
"When the business is lousy, anything's possible," said James D. Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest U.S.A. in New York. "I didn't make it up, but necessity is the mother of invention."
"It's obviously a highly fragmented business that is always amply populated," he added. "Some of those agencies find it possible to make a go of things in this climate. Some don't."
Mr. Gottesman said that several of the anticipated mergers were recession-related; he characterized them as "two guys who figure if they lean against each other, they'd stand up under the wind better."
Mr. Dougherty thought it telling that two likely acquisitions would involve two huge agency companies, the Omnicom Group in New York, owner of BBDO, and the Interpublic Group of Companies, owner of Lowe.
"Essentially, there are two agency groups that have money," he said, "so they have a constant stream of suitors."
In all the transactions, Mr. Dougherty added, "there are none where the principals will walk off with substantial fortunes," which happened during the 80's, with, for instance, the acquisition of the Ted Bates agency by Saatchi & Saatchi.
Mr. Gottesman said that because "financing was available then and it isn't now, some of the deals, if they happen, will be mergers with no interchange of money."
If there is a silver lining, it might be that clients, who were mightily irked when executives at their agencies pocketed robust fortunes during the 80's takeovers, will feel better about today's transactions.

Amid It All, Madonna
As the fashion flock landed here over the weekend to begin a three-week viewing of European ready-to-wear collections for spring, the main topics of conversation were the economy, the strikes, the weather and Madonna -- not necessarily in that order. The Material Girl's decision to attend a Dolce & Gabbana show on Sunday meant that guests, including major magazine editors and retailers' representatives, had their cars stopped and their invitations scrutinized by the police and private security guards.
Then there is the party that Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are giving for her tonight at Le Cinema at the same time as Giorgio Armani's party at Rolling Stone for his Emporio line. He had thought Madonna would be at his party. 
 But after all, that's a Dolce & Gabbana design she's wearing on the cover of this month's Vogue magazine. Short skirts, long skirts -- who cares? The talk here is not of hemlines, but of her.
 
Outwitting the Economy?
 Those who are buying or selling the latest fashions are more concerned about the economy. The recent drop in the value of the lira may mean that Italian clothes will cost a little less in the United States, but it also means the Italian economy is in sad shape.
This situation, combined with labor strikes and day after day of torrential rain, has dampenedsome spirits.
"The Italian market is terrible," said Aldo Pinto, the chairman of Krizia. "The Italians were always optimistic. The market was always extremely reliable. Now it's not performing. People are worried, scared, nervous."
Because the feeling is that high-priced lines cannot grow in this economy, manufacturers are concentrating on their secondary, less expensive lines. Every designer has at least one. Armani has Le Collezioni and A/X Armani Exchange. Gianfranco Ferre has Studio 000.1. Laura Biagiotti has Laurapiu and Risposte. Gianni Versace has Signatures, Istante and Versus. And then there are the licensees for jeans, men's wear, sunglasses, perfumes and on and on.
"You have to diversify," said Mr. Pinto, who licensed low-priced men's and women's lines to Hartmarx in the United States and has just signed a license for a low-priced collection to be sold in Japan. "Business is not as easy as it used to be. You have to know what you're doing. If we had only our top line, we'd be in trouble. We're lucky we started second, third and fourth lines."
None of that has stopped designers from hiring supermodels like Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell, who charge $9,000 a show. It's worth it, the designers say, for the publicity generated. Pictures of the top models are picked up by newspapers worldwide.
 
Calendar Change for 1993
 Next year should see some changes in the scheduling of the twice-a-year shows in Europe, which have traditionally been held first in Milan, then London, then Paris. The French are planning to show their fall 1993 collections in late February, a week before the Milan shows.
Some of the French designers who show couture collections in January are not pleased, saying it won't give them enough time to finish their ready-to-wear. The Italians don't intend to change their dates.
"I'm not going to fight about when to show," Franco Moschino said. "That's politics. I give my blood to make my collection, not to make war."
Aldo Pinto shrugged a typically Italian shrug. "When we show before Paris, we always say the French take ideas from Italy," he said. "Now they can say Italy takes ideas from France."
But that's what the French have always said.

Doctor Criminale
By Malcolm Bradbury
344 pages. Viking. $22.
Francis Jay, the hero of Malcolm Bradbury's latest novel, has a lot in common with the author's earlier protagonists: Henry Babbacombe, the feckless scholar turned television writer in "Cuts"; the hapless professor of linguistics, Dr. Angus Petworth, in "Rates of Exchange," and Stuart Treece, the bumbling English teacher in "Eating People Is Wrong." Though he has left academia for the world of literary journalism, Francis isn't terribly sophisticated about the workings of the world at large; still in his 20's, he tends to look at people and relationships as texts waiting to be analyzed and deconstructed. 
 When he's suddenly hired by a television company to research the life of the world-famous philosopher Dr. Bazlo Criminale, Francis's placid, emotionally attenuated life undergoes a permanent change.
As depicted by Mr. Bradbury, the fictitious Dr. Criminale initially emerges as a tantalizing figure, as forceful and enigmatic as one of those charismatic wise men who keep popping up in Iris Murdoch's novels. Dr. Criminale, Francis tells us, is known as "the Lukacs of the 90's," "one of the superpowers of contemporary thought." His novella, "Homeless: A Tale of the Modern Age," has been hailed by Graham Greene as "the finest single work of the second half of the 20th century," and his economic and political essays have been published, republished and passionately discussed in both the West and the former Soviet bloc. He has been photographed with everyone from Umberto Eco to Arnold Schwarzenegger to Pol Pot.
A charming polymath, Criminale is a magnet for admiring students, colleagues and unattached women. He is brilliant, erudite, respected and, as Francis soon learns, thoroughly enigmatic. "He knew everybody," Francis observes, "everybody knew him; he was Dr. Criminale. But ask where he came from, who paid him, how he lived so well, which institution he was attached to, and things grew more obscure. He was just that vague and placeless creature, the European intellectual."
His date of birth is given, variously, as 1921, 1926 and 1929; his citizenship as Hungarian, German, Austrian, Bulgarian, American. Sometimes he is described as a strict Marxist; other times as a liberal dissident.
Francis's producer, Lavinia, tells him she isn't interested in what Criminale thinks. She wants "a plot, a life, a person." "Honey," she says, "I want life and loves. I want friends and enemies. I want flesh and bones."
Though he's not terribly optimistic about the outcome, Francis dutifully sets off to dig up some facts about Criminale. His quest takes him to Vienna, Budapest and a writer's conference in the Italian countryside; and it introduces him to an assortment of Criminale scholars, lovers and hangers-on.
When Francis finally makes the acquaintance of Criminale himself, he is simultaneously mystified and entranced. One minute, Criminale and his bossy wife seem "like some semi-geriatric couple, two fond old-timers on a holiday cruise"; the next minute, Criminale seems like a youthful satyr, cavorting naked with a beautiful young woman.
Francis and Criminale's editor, a Hungarian woman named Ildiko, follow the philosopher to another conference in Switzerland, and the ambiguities proliferate. Ildiko reveals that she used to be one of Criminale's lovers, and she implies somewhat darkly that Criminale has been "a little flexible" in his dealings with people and politics.
Eventually, Francis travels to two other conferences in search of Criminale, conferences delineated with Mr. Bradbury's usual satiric wit, his practiced eye for the absurdities of scholarship and scholars. At these intellectual powwows, Francis learns more about his elusive quarry. The philosopher's ex-wife, Gertla, tells him that Criminale was once a hard-line Stalinist who allowed his girlfriend to be killed by the Soviets during their 1956 invasion of Hungary. And a German financial expert by the name of Cosima suggests that both Criminale and Ildiko were involved in smuggling Communist money to the West.
Like "Rates of Exchange," "Doctor Criminale" is an ambitious novel about large, unwieldy ideas. Mr. Bradbury raises questions about Criminale's past to examine the meaning of political commitment, the relationship between moral responsibility and esthetic principles, and the consequences of ethical pragmatism in an individual's public and private lives.
Who was Bazlo Criminale? A philosopher for our times? A representative man? A slippery intellectual con artist? A monster disguised as a genius? A weak man who used his wits to survive in a perilous world?
Whoever Criminale is, Francis emerges as his alter ego, a historical innocent unversed in the complexities of the world. His fashionable schooling in structuralism and deconstruction has not prepared him to grapple with the large moral and political questions raised by Criminale's life; his provincial experiences in Margaret Thatcher's England have not prepared him to understand the convulsions of history that shook the Continent during the earlier years of the century.
Though Mr. Bradbury's writing is, as always, nimble, intelligent and acute, "Doctor Criminale" struggles to find a tone, lumbering awkwardly back and forth between the serious and the satiric, between the meditative and the farcical. So much time is spent establishing the contradictions in Criminale's life and then amplifying the ambiguities of his past, that the reader's attention begins to wander. By the time we finally meet him, he seems more like an inspired idea for a symbolic figure than a full-fledged character. The resulting novel is provocative and smart but also somehow bloodless.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Plan First Joint Space Crews

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 5

 BODY:
American and Russian officials signed a joint agreement today that will put Russian astronauts on an American space shuttle and an American astronaut on the Mir space station in the next three years.
The United States and Soviet Union cooperated on the manned Apollo-Soyuz space flight in 1975, in which spacecraft from the two countries docked in orbit. But Russians and Americans have never flown as crew members aboard the other's spacecraft. 
 "Space offers inspiration, hope, opportunity and peace for the people of this world," said Daniel S. Goldin, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Mr. Goldin signed the agreement with his Russian counterpart, Yuri Koptev.
The accord calls for placing a Russian astronaut aboard a United States space shuttle in November 1993 and an American astronaut aboard the Mir space station for a 90-day mission in 1995.
 
Plan for Docking
 A United States shuttle carrying American and Russian astronauts would then dock with the Mir, depositing the Russians on the space station and retrieving the American and Russians from the Mir.
"Our nations are learning to work together and we're trying to disarm and rid ourselves of the weapons of war," Mr. Goldin said.
The agreement was worked out by Presidents Bush and Boris N. Yeltsin during their June summit in Washington. Mr. Goldin estimated that the United States' share of the missions would cost more than $100 million. Mr. Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency, offered no estimate of Russian costs.
Mr. Koptev expressed hope that the agreement could pave the way for further cooperation, as well as leading to the launching of American commercial payloads by Russian rockets.
Mr. Goldin said that despite Russia's current economic problems, Mr. Yeltsin and other top officials understood the potential that space exploration held. "Russia is committed to the future," Mr. Goldin said, "and Russia is committed to space."
Mr. Goldin also dismissed suggestions that greater American-Russian cooperation in space and tight budgets in both countries argued against both having their own space stations.
 
A U.S. Space Station
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is making plans for the American space station Freedom. He said the Russian and American space stations would have different capabilities and missions.
"I believe if we can do that, it will accelerate the pace at which we understand planet Earth, its environment, the human effects on that environment, and it will accelerate the pace at which we can explore the Moon and then onto Mars in our solar system," he said.
Mr. Goldin said NASA had not yet selected an astronaut for the Mir mission.
The Russians have chosen two veteran astronauts, Sergei Krikalev and Vladimir Titov, to train to fly aboard the American shuttle, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
Mr. Krikalev, 34 years old, has already flown in space with French and British astronauts aboard the Mir.
Mr. Titov, 45, has also logged many months in space, including a 366-day mission aboard the Mir in 1987-88.

Craft to Plunge Into Venus
 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Oct. 5 (AP) -- The Pioneer Venus orbiter ran out of thruster propellant Saturday after circling Venus for 14 years and is expected to plunge toward the planet this week, a NASA spokesman said.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration learned of the orbiter's imminent demise when its thruster failed to fire, said Peter Waller, spokesman for NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
He said Pioneer would plummet through Venus's atmosphere and lose communication this week. Pioneer, which is expected to burn up in the Venusian atmosphere, was the first American spacecraft to circle Venus. Over the years, the 810-pound spacecraft used a crude radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds and map more than 90 percent of its surface.

Can't Anybody Here Enjoy This Game?

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
Major league baseball has always had an amazing capacity to produce brilliant playoffs and stellar World Series when a cleansing effect is needed to erase off-field disasters. Witness the four amazing division races of 1982 that drew fans back just one season after a disillusioning 50-day strike.
If such dramatics are good for what ails, then baseball needs a set of playoffs from Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Oakland and Toronto to erase the horrible taste of the cantankerous season that was. For territorial disputes, unrepentant displays of greed, xenophobia, realignment-related revolts, courtroom dramas, cross-country tugs-of-war over teams, and, ultimately, the sacking of Commissioner Fay Vincent badly overshadowed the games on the field, attaching themselves to baseball like so many leeches. 
So numerous were baseball's internecine spats that neither the best race of the season (in the American League East) nor the pursuits of 3,000 hits by Robin Yount of the Brewers and George Brett of the Royals could compete.
The public's response to the game's extraordinary number of self-inflicted wounds came at the gate, as 18 of the 26 clubs saw attendance fall. Only record numbers in Toronto (4,028,318) and the boosts of over or close to a million in Baltimore and Atlanta saved the game even greater embarrassment.
These are not the trends baseball would want to carry into what could be a disturbing winter (Dec. 11 is when management or the players must decide whether to reopen the labor agreement).
But that decision, and a possible long lockout next spring, are merely hypothetical. Baseball offered enough reality to already have rendered this an extraordinarily bumpy year. Consider the following:
*The Dodgers, the Red Sox, the Mets and the Yankees, far from saved by their big bankrolls and big-name players, hit bottom in their respective divisions or came dangerously close. The calamities on the field, which mixed all too well with the recession in California and the Northeast, caused Dodger attendance to drop by an alarming 874,904 and that of the fifth-place Mets to fall by 504,950.
Only amazing attendance gains in Atlanta (up 937,183) and Montreal (up 734,385) kept the National League from utter disaster. As it was, the 12-team league dipped 585,037 at the gate. The American League, bolstered by the record-setting Blue Jays and the raging success of Baltimore's new ball park, still slipped by 327,235.
*Teams scooped up $260 million before the ink dried on the bank loans arranged by Vincent's office. The bailouts were just patches on a wound that still bleeds. Even as panicky owners worry about their pocketbooks and envision breaking the players' union, they inch closer to an inevitable and even more intriguing fight between the have-nots, like Milwaukee and Minnesota, and the haves, like the Yankees and Mets.
*The Giants' owner, Bob Lurie, seeking to divorce his team from San Francisco, which is indifferent to his demands for a new ball park, struck a deal with franchise-hungry suitors in Tampa and St. Petersburg, Fla. But when the National League president, Bill White, declared that bidders from San Francisco could preempt such a move, the saga of the Giants grew even sadder, not to mention murkier. Whatever happens, it's bound to be ugly and probably litigious.
*Vincent put more weight on geography than ratings. Thus did he order the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds, which are in the Eastern time zone, out of the N.L. West and told the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs, in the Central time zone, to go to the N.L. West. Ten N.L. teams agreed; six even asked Vincent to act in defiance of the league constitution that permitted the balking Cubs to veto the move.
But the Cubs, you see, are owned by the Tribune Company, which also owns WGN-TV in Chicago, the superstation that televises Cubs games nationwide. The Cubs not only considered their veto rights inviolable, but they also insisted on their right to keep their large number of prime-time games intact. So the Cubs sued. More important, they helped bring together an unprecedented alliance, as all seven major league teams affiliated with Tribune stations around the nation joined in opposition to Vincent.
Ultimately, a mixed bag of dissidents joined in bringing down Vincent. These ranged from a Yankees team looking for payback in the wake of Vincent's ban of George Steinbrenner, to the Braves, another team backed by a powerful superstation of the sort Vincent had begun to publicly question as the influence of television spread.
Owners who resented Vincent's public presence and independent nature, who viewed him as arrogant and, of all things, too beholden to the fans, also joined in. So did those who were angered by Vincent's conciliatory nature with the umpires' and players' unions and by his refusal to waive his right to act in labor matters.
In the end, the opposition numbered 18 owners, enough to force Vincent's resignation, which of all times came on Labor Day.
In the wake of Vincent's overthrow, baseball has agreed to leave the Cubs and Cards alone, and undoubtedly superstations, too. There already is talk of realignment of the sort Vincent never envisioned, with three divisions instead of two leagues, plus another tier of playoffs -- televised playoffs. That is but one scenario looming in a game now being run by an executive council of owners, a game in which players and umpires stand on war-footing against management, a game in which confused fans turned into disinterested masses.
As always, baseball will ask the doubters and the discontented to never fear, but rather wait till next year. But will there even be a next year? Not if the game remains in character and decides to deal yet another blow to its already battered image.

HEADLINE: PERIPHERALS;
Numerous Ways to Handle Numbers

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON

 BODY:
COMPUTERS were invented to manipulate numbers, although more people use them today to write letters and reports or play games. Here are three programs for the home or business number cruncher.
The first, Hi, Finance, is available in a new version for Windows 3.0 or later. There are six modules in the program. All take advantage of Windows's easy-to-use menus and icons, on a 386 or higher computer with at least four megabytes of working memory, a hard disk and a mouse. 
 The Financial Calculator can calculate the following just by filling in the blanks: present value, future value and rate required (lump sum or annuity); payment amount required; number of payments required, and effect of inflation.
The Loan Calculation and Amortization module does just what its name says. The Investment Analysis module indicates the attractiveness of an investment, and the Personal Financial Planning module helps you calculate where you stand and where you want to go. The Random Number Generator might be used to select invoice or lottery numbers. The Business Assistant provides a handful of little programs, for things like markups and sales taxes.
On-line help is always available, and each module includes example files. The Loan Calculation and Amortization example is a 10-year loan of $100,000, at 9 percent interest, paid monthly. It reveals, among other things, the disquieting fact that the interest amounts to $52,010.92.
The principal author of the program, Roger C. Hoover, the president of Brightridge Solutions, is a certified public accountant and M.B.A. Hi, Finance is marketed as shareware; that is, you can get a copy from a friend, a users' group or an electronic bulletin board and try it before you pay for it. You can buy it directly from Brightridge, for $59 plus $5 for shipping and handling, by calling (800) 241-7203 or (615) 246-3337.
Incidentally, be sure to get Hi, Finance version 2.08 or later; earlier incarnations had a number of what software publishers like to call "undocumented features," or bugs.
 
A Script for Figures

A similar program, Per%Sense 2, can be installed on a Windows-based computer, but does not require one, and will even work in a limited way on a machine without a hard drive. Per%Sense was discussed here when an earlier version was published by Timeslips as PercentEdge. Now its programmer, Joshua Mitteldorf, is publishing it through his company, Ones and Zeros, in Philadelphia.
There are modules for investment and actuarial analysis, loans and more kinds of money matters than this financial babe in the woods knew existed. People like us can work from a script, which means that the program asks for the information it needs. Alternatively, you can select one of the more than 30 examples, substituting your own numbers. More sophisticated users can enter the numbers into a one-screen data sheet. When it has enough of them, the program calculates the answers. There are also a calculator, calendar and bare-bones word processor.
If your system has enough memory and storage capacity, Per%Sense may be installed as a memory-resident program, one that can be popped up on the screen while you are doing something else.
Per%Sense 2 is $99.95 and can be ordered from the publisher by calling (800) 882-2764. There is also a more advanced version, Per%Sense Pro; you can call (215) 248-1010 for information about that, or for network arrangements.
 
Two-Faced Calculator

Windows comes with an on-screen calculator that has two faces: a simple, standard decimal calculator and a scientific calculator for more complicated tasks. Calc+, from Abbott Systems, of Pleasantville, N.Y., also has two personalities. One is a decimal calculator with about the same functions as the "official" one. The other is intended for desktop publishing. Calculations can be done in picas and points, feet and inches and centimeters, and converted instantly. The electronic tapes can be saved on a disk, edited and printed on a laser printer in any available font and size.
Calc+ requires a computer running Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later, a 3.5-inch disk drive and a mouse. It should be available at software stores or through mail-order catalogues. The suggested retail price is $79, although it generally sells for much less.

HEADLINE: Free Trade, but With Time Bombs

 BODY:
Finally, Gov. Bill Clinton has given his long-awaited answer on free trade and it is ambivalent. Does he support the North American Free Trade Agreement? Yes, but.
He would accept provisions negotiated so skillfully by the Bush Administration with Mexico and Canada. But he wouldn't approve an accord unless it included eight new conditions, two of which would be substantially different from anything the three countries have agreed on during a year of intensive negotiations. 
 Does Mr. Clinton mean to booby trap the accord with time bombs? Certainly not, judging from his lofty free-trade oratory. But the vaguely worded conditions could explode, forcing Mr. Clinton to reject an accord that is vital to the pro-reform Mexican Government and helpful to the U.S. economy. Any such rejection would constitute an economic mistake and a diplomatic catastrophe.
In his declaration, Mr. Clinton did face down powerful special interests within his party that are out to negotiate a better deal for themselves or scuttle the agreement. By accepting an industry-specific tariff and other commercial schedules, Mr. Clinton in effect told auto workers, glass blowers, movie studios and everyone else that he would entertain no unraveling. So far, so good.
But then come his eight conditions. Some sound innocent. For example, he wants to spend more than Mr. Bush has so far proposed for training and assisting workers displaced by N.A.F.T.A.
Other conditions, however, are troublesome. For instance, Mr. Clinton calls for tighter pesticide standards. Yet the accord already provides unprecedented protection for Federal and state environmental regulations against challenge by Mexico and Canada.
Most disturbing, Mr. Clinton throws up two barriers to ratification that are not unilateral but would require new negotiations with Mexico and Canada. He calls for appointment of special commissions on labor standards and the environment that could compel Mexico to enforce its working conditions and environmental regulations.
Here, Mr. Clinton departs from the proposed accord. N.A.F.T.A. as a trade pact limits sanctions to violations of trade rules. To bring in working conditions and environmental enforcement makes questionable economic sense and raises profound questions of sovereignty.
There are grounds for stiffening N.A.F.T.A.'s enforcement procedures. There is even reason to believe that the three countries could hammer out tougher sanctions. But if they can't do so soon, Mr. Clinton promises to reject this historic agreement, even though it would simultaneously propel Mexico's pro-market reforms forward and raise living standards for U.S. consumers.
As Bill Clinton understands, free trade benefits all -- but only if it is free of incendiary conditions.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Clinton Doctrine

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The campaign of 1992, so long a desert of tedium and cynicism, has finally produced what the country has needed for too many dry years -- a lucid, warm adult statement of principle about what the United States can give to the world, and gain from it.
Of the hundreds of campaign speeches, a talk by Governor Clinton in Milwaukee on Oct. 1 is likely to be remembered longest. It was meant for Americans but will be studied intently in the rest of the world. 
 If he is elected, the speech will be recalled constantly during his Presidency to see if under pressure Mr. Clinton will be strong and faithful to the philosophy he put forward that day.
If he loses, or as President should give way under test, then at least the speech and its doctrine will be remembered as what democratic leadership could have been.
Governor Clinton spoke of the critical importance to this country of following a policy of democratic realism at home and abroad. He did not use the phrase, but it sums up the beliefs of those who, like Mr. Clinton, understand the moral, political and economic strength of political freedom.
Democratic realism is one of the two competing, internationalist philosophies in the West. The other is realpolitik, which assumes that all that really counts in the world is tangible power and the ability to maneuver with it.
Realpoliticians believe democracy may be nice enough if you have it, but to make democratic interests and values part of international decisions ranges from irrelevance to dangerous sentimentality.
The differences between realpolitik and democratic realism can be the difference between war and peace.
Governor Clinton has spelled out the root beliefs of democratic realism and its value to Americans:
Democracies do not go to war with one another. They do not sponsor international terrorism. They do not threaten to destroy other nations with weapons of mass destruction. Democracy abroad helps protect economic and security interests at home. Democracy makes for more reliable diplomatic and environmental partners than dictatorships.
So, he said, the choice for America is not either/or, as many politicians tell us. Tending to our economy and backing democracy abroad must go together -- the collapse of one could bring down the other.
Once that needed no saying to Americans. In the past half-century, every President managed to deal with the country's economy and foreign policy without whining that he could only handle one at a time.
But Mr. Bush tells us that having been a wild success abroad he now is at last able to devote himself to the economy. Mr. Bush's promise may be unnerving. But at least he is beginning to take a smidgen of the responsibility. That is a good step in character development.
But, as Governor Clinton pointed out, the Bush foreign record is not thrilling. Time and again, Mr. Bush acted as if he thought the interests of democrats against dictatorships were a plain nuisance.
When the Soviet Union was within a breath of death, he fought to help Mikhail Gorbachev resuscitate it. Mr. Clinton mentioned that and other Bush-Baker triumphs.
Promises broken to Kurds. Baltic independence snubbed. Bosnia. Vetoes of every Congressional bill to make Communist China pay any economic price for its slave labor camps.
In the Mideast, Bush-Baker accomplished two of the grossest stupidities in American history -- first arming Saddam Hussein, so he had to be fought and defeated, then letting him stay in power. Both mistakes were against democratic interests, therefore against American interests.
Initiating the Israeli-Arab peace talks could become a real Bush-Baker accomplishment. But Governor Clinton made an interesting point -- this Administration thinks of the Arab-Israeli conflict as one more quarrel between two religions or nations, rather than a struggle involving the survival of a democratic ally.
So could we hold the negotiation celebrations a moment or two? Just in case we get the chance to see what a second-term Bush would do about Israel and its neighbors?
Democracy has always been America's "perfecting impulse," said Mr. Clinton, and "now the cynical calculus of pure power politics does not compute." That is essential democratic realism -- and essential country values.

HEADLINE: Observer;
Down With Sacrifice

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
I have reconsidered my position on sacrifice. Last week I was all for it. My policy was: plenty of sacrifice for all hands. That was what the nation needed, I thought. How wrong I was.
My new policy is toleration. Let those who want to sacrifice go to it. Let's be tolerant. Let's not deny the individual right to sacrifice. Just leave me out of it, please, and you, too, if you like. 
 My original passion for sacrifice was the result of thinking in slogans instead of in dollars and cents. One of the catchier slogans now in circulation is: "What this country needs is a good bout of sacrifice."
Doesn't that sound wonderful? Heroic? Romantic? Kennedyesque? ("Ask not what your country . . .") Patriotic? Makes you want to take to your rocking chair, wrap up in your shawl and tell the young 'uns how it was in World War II, having your gasoline ration held to three gallons a week. Or was it a month? Old heroes forget.
Ross Perot's first campaign exploited this patriotic yen for pain. Its economic program called for wringing money out of one and all, including the struggling classes. Whether Perot remains devoted to Draconian economics in Campaign II is still unclear, but his big show in Dallas the other day didn't dispel my suspicion that he is still foursquare for heroism.
Perot was a big reason for my change of policy. The poet Virgil said, "Beware the Greeks bearing gifts," which has no bearing here except to introduce my Uncle Charlie, who said, "Beware the millionaire calling for sacrifice." Uncle Charlie flourished back in the Depression before the billionaire was invented, but his wisdom remains just as applicable to Ross Perot as it once was to Rockefellers.
Uncle Charlie was no cynical left-winger either. He was a Republican free enterpriser who detested Franklin Roosevelt and admired the natural rapacity that enables a luckily endowed few to corner the bulk of life's money.
He had none of their talent, alas. He was a philosopher. The philosophical mind enabled him to enjoy life without bitterness despite a decade of Depression unemployment, which he survived by hunkering down like the rest of us with the only family member who had a job.
He earned his keep by preaching the good old Republican wisdom to a foolishly New Deal household. He believed that fools brought misfortune on themselves and so deserved it. Anyone heeding a millionaire's call for sacrifice was such a high-test fool that he deserved to have his wallet rifled by the ruthless.
In addition to the wisdom of Uncle Charlie, a couple of economists lent academic authority to support my policy reversal. They assured me that a policy of sacrifice during hard times is bad economic policy since it will probably deepen a recession by further reducing consumption.
Not only that, it may also be a cunning device for redistributing the wealth from the pinched classes to the bloated. I suspected these economists of harboring Keynesian economic views loathsome to Republican true believers. They may even be outright Democrats, but the heart of their message -- beware the rich preaching sacrifice -- was too close to Uncle Charlie's sound Republican wisdom to be ignored.
Moreover I needed some scholarly justification for abandoning a policy as noble as sacrifice, and having some economists with me was comforting.
Whenever you're opposing something that sounds morally unassailable, arm yourself with a respectable academic argument to lean on. As triumphant Republican conservatives have repeatedly illustrated these past 12 years, an arsenal of academic mumbo-jumbo equips you to dismiss any inconvenient moralizers as intellectually shallow sentimentalists, if not downright boobs.
Everything I hear from the recession front suggests there is already a great deal of sacrifice going on: bankrupts being taken in by relatives, grown children coming back to live with parents, sometimes bringing families with them. In short, the ghost of Uncle Charlie is abroad.
Families, friends and lovers are already doing the sacrificing, as is proper. The sensible thing is for government to encourage them, not scourge them with a Federal Sacrifice Act. Politicians preaching sacrifice right now are just grandstanding, as I was. It's generosity we need, not posturing.

HEADLINE: Stock Markets Plummet Overseas, But Prices Recover on Wall Street

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The world's stock markets plunged yesterday, as investors reacted to the political uncertainties of the American election and the continued monetary turmoil in Europe.
But Wall Street, unlike the European and Japanese markets, managed to reverse direction and recover nearly 80 percent of its morning losses by the closing bell. 
 In the first two and a half hours of heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled nearly 105 points, or more than 3 percent. But that attracted bargain hunters, and by the close of trading the Dow had lost only 21.61 points to close at 3,179.00 in heavy trading.
 
Selling Begun in Europe
 Sell orders swept across the Atlantic early yesterday, as investors continued the selling wave begun in Europe, where market averages fell by more than 4 percent in London and Paris and almost that much in Frankfurt. Earlier in Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average ended down 222.57 points, or 1.28 percent, at 17,101.50. The Nikkei closed today up 166.6 points, or 0.97 percent, at 17,268.1
Battered by a currency crisis and the belief that high German interest rates would prolong or worsen their recession, European investors are in a pessimistic mood. [Page D6.]
That pessimism was abetted on Wall Street by computer-generated sell programs initiated soon after trading began. The market's volatility could prove unnerving to individual investors who shifted money into stocks from low-yielding C.D.'s, money market funds and similar holdings. [Page D1.]
For a time, the waves of selling seemed to accentuate fears among traditionally conservative institutional investors about a possible Clinton victory in next month's Presidential election, as well as concern about continuing economic weakness.
During the morning, "sellers scared the market," said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a financial consulting firm in New York.
"People who might have been disposed to do something said wait a minute," Mr. Birinyi said. "Then when things settled down a little bit, they took another look, realized that most of this was mechanical, and realized some stocks had become fundamentally attractive."
Other stock market strategists said they were impressed with the market's resilience, and predicted that prices would move higher in coming months.
"In every election year we have almost always had a correction between Sept. 1 and the election, no matter who wins," said Bryon R. Wien, a managing director and investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "But when the incumbent loses, the correction is the most severe. The market has moved from being fairly valued to undervalued."
 
Circuit Breakers Activated
 The New York Stock Exchange invoked its circuit breaker rules restricting computer-driven trading at 10:20 A.M. yesterday, after the Dow had dropped 50 points.
The rule remained in effect until just six minutes before the 4 P.M. close, but traders and analysts said the rules had little to do with the market's turnaround.
"I don't think the circuit breakers worked at all, because we went lower immediately after they were imposed," said Eugene Peroni, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "The market regained its equilibrium on its own. This had been feared to be another October Blue Monday," he said, referring to the market crash of 1987. "But it could well turn out to be an important low."
The Dow and broader market averages hit their lows at around 11:30 A.M. Mr. Peroni said that the mood turned to buying shortly after the Dow pierced the 3,100-point level.
Broader market indexes, which fell sharply along with the Dow, also recovered, although not so much as the market's most closely watched barometer.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 2.90 points, to 407.57; the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues fell 6.42 points, to 565.21, and the Russell 2,000 index declined by 3.19 points, to 186.30.
By the close of trading, losing stocks outnumbered gainers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1, and the Dow's close of 3,179.00 was its lowest since Jan. 2, although it was well above the day's low of 3,095.79. At 286.6 million shares, volume was the heaviest since Jan. 17.
Mr. Birinyi said that much of the afternoon buying, like most of the morning selling, was done by large institutions. And representatives of two large retail brokerage concerns said that most small investors were not shaken by the morning's developments.
Jeanette Akers, a spokeswoman for Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, said there was "very little" asset shifting between Fidelity funds and that redemptions were flat.
Ms. Akers said Fidelity's brokerage unit was reporting that buy orders from customers were running ahead of sales by a ratio of about six to four.
Mark Thompson, a vice president at Charles Schwab & Company, the discount brokerage house, said, "Individual investors didn't have to sell heavily today because they were doing so in September."
Mr. Thompson added that after the sharp declines, purchases of stocks that had been put on "call" -- an order to buy at a given price -- by individual investors rose by about 50 percent.
Trading in stock index futures, a proxy for computer-driven buying and selling, was hectic.
Volume in the S.& P. 500 stock index futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was estimated at 86,000 contracts, more than 70 percent above average daily volume since the stock market crash nearly five years ago.
On the Big Board, highly capitalized stocks topped the most active list at the end of the dizzying day.
Merck & Company, the drug company, was the most active, closing at 42 3/4, down 1/4. Home Depot Inc., which traded as low as 49, finished at 53 1/2, down 1/8. I.B.M. gained 1/4, to 78 3/4, after falling as low as 75 1/2. And Pfizer, another big drug company, rose by 7/8, to 74 1/4. At the peak of the selloff, Pfizer traded as low as 69 1/2.
Among over-the-counter issues, Apple Computer closed at 43 1/2, down 1/4.

A front-page article yesterday about Monday's stock market trading misstated the duration of the opening slump in the Dow Jones industrial average. The decline lasted about two hours. In addition, charts on the front page and in Business Day showing the movement of the Dow misstated the time the market hit bottom, because of incorrect data supplied by Knight-Ridder Tradecenter. It was 11:30.

HEADLINE: $1.2 Billion For Traffic At Hudson

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Oct. 5

 BODY:
For years Hudson County officials have known what it would take to relieve traffic congestion at the Hudson River: money and lots of it. And today they celebrated the fact that the money is finally coming their way.
Between now and 1997 a total of $1.2 billion is to be spent in Hudson County on projects to improve local roads, consolidate rail service from outlying counties into Penn Station in Manhattan, build a light rail line along the waterfront and separate traffic bound for the waterfront from the flow of commuters to New York before the two streams congeal at the mouths of the Lincoln and Holland tunnels. 
 Officials here say the projects will also help the county meet its Federal clean air requirements, provide thousands of construction and permanent jobs and make Hudson County more competitive with New York City for business.
"We expect to make New York increasingly nervous over the next few years," said Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County Executive, at a news conference today. "We already have lower commercial rental costs and lower corporate and individual taxes than New York, but the problem always was, how do you get in and out of here?"
 
Beneficiary of Federal Law
 "The missing piece always was some way to improve an overloaded transportation system," he said. "This should help solve that piece of the puzzle."
The money for the projects comes from a major Federal transportation bill passed earlier this year, and from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New Jersey Department of Transportation.
New Jersey is a major beneficiary of the Federal law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act, which allocates $152 billion for transportation, much of it available for mass transit.
Christine M. Johnson, Assistant State Transportation Commissioner for Policy and Planning, said New Jersey, which is expected to get $5.6 billion over five years, benefited from the fact that the transportation bill was sponsored by Representative Robert A. Roe, Democrat of Passaic, the chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee.
 
Various Stages of Planning
 The state is expecting $2.4 billion for highways, $1.5 billion for mass transit, $700 million for for bridges and more than $1 billion for transit and highway demonstration projects.
Mr. Janiszewski said that in addition to providing thousands of construction jobs that should help reduce the county's 11 percent unemployment rate, the transportation improvements were expected to revive stalled riverfront projects that could provide 34 million square feet of new commercial space, 35,000 living units and 75,000 permanent jobs.
The improvements Mr. Janiszewski is banking on are in various stages of planning. Al Harf, Assistant Executive Director for Planning for New Jersey Transit, the state's public transportation agency, said that the $60 million Kearny Connection in the Meadowlands, which will enable trains on the Morris and Essex lines to connect with Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line for a direct run into New York, is almost ready to begin construction and could be operating by mid-1995. At present the lines bring commuters into Hoboken for connection with PATH.
The Secaucus Transfer, a new station to be constructed in another part of the Meadowlands for about $350 million, is in the design and engineering stage. The transfer station will allow passengers from the Newark Division, which includes the North Jersey Coast Line, and from Rockland County, N.Y., and Bergen County, N.J., to switch to trains heading into New York
 
Plans for Traffic Control
 Plans also call for building a light rail line that will run about 15 miles from the park-and-ride lot near the Vince Lombardi rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike near Ridgefield Park in Bergen County, through a Conrail freight tunnel in Weehawken to the Hudson County riverfront. The line would then run south through Hoboken and Jersey City and west along existing freight line right-of-way to the former site of Roosevelt Stadium on Newark Bay.
Mr. Harf said the project would be done in stages with the first piece running from the Roosevelt Stadium site through Jersey City to Hoboken.
Barring complications, Mr. Harf said, the project could be ready for the start of construction early next year. Because the line will take many years to build, the transit agency's five-year plan includes only $190 million for the project. Officials said it could cost about $900 million before it is completed .
Mr. Janiszewski said he was also hoping to win approval of the North Jersey Transportation Coordinating Council for converting part of the Weehawken freight tunnel to a road, which could remove waterfront-bound traffic from the approaches to the Lincoln Tunnel, and for putting a road through the Bergen Arches, an unused rail tunnel near Route 1 and 9 in Jersey City, to siphon off local car traffic from commuters using the Holland Tunnel.

HEADLINE: Mexico Politician Out; Chief Set Back

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 6

 BODY:
In a political setback for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a state Governor from the governing party stepped down today after months of protests by leftists who asserted that he had won by fraud.
The departure of the official, Eduardo Villasenor, came three weeks after he was sworn in as Governor of the western state of Michoacan, the left's most important stronghold, as Mr. Salinas sat smiling on the dais beside him. 
 It also came just a day before Mr. Salinas is to travel to San Antonio, Tex., to join President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada as their trade ministers initial a final text of the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Bush will attend in part to show support for the agreement, which has become an issue in the presidential campaign.
Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, endorsed the pact on Monday but said it had "omissions" that needed to be corrected for it to benefit American workers.
Since negotiations for the agreement began last year, the Salinas Government has also been increasingly sensitive to criticism of Mexico's political system in the United States. But it was not immediately clear what role if any his planned trip this week to San Antonio, Washington and New York may have played in Mr. Villasenor's decision to step down.
 
Interim Leader Chosen
 This afternoon, state legislators of the ruling party named a party leader and former state official, Ausencio Chavez, as interim Governor.
Government officials said that even after Mr. Salinas had made a strong showing of his support for the new Governor, the leftist party's protest rallies and takeovers of Government buildings across the state created a stark choice between political chaos and the use of force.
"You have to look at these things not only in terms of what they cause, but what they avoid," a senior political official said. "Massive repression in Michoacan could have had very serious political consequences."
Although Mr. Villasenor technically took a leave of absence, Government officials said he had no intention of returning to office and that Mr. Chavez would replace him. Leaders of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, however, said they would insist on a new vote.
 
Move Is Criticized
 Even if the ruling party retained control of the Michoacan government, many political analysts said the opposition would still have won a big victory at a moment when the strength of its protests seemed to be waning.
"The P.R.D. has salvaged something out of nothing," Federico Estevez, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said, referring to the leftist party by its initials in Spanish. "When they have to elect a Governor again, it will be with a very different electoral system, with rules that are much more fair, and the P.R.D. will have a chance to win."
In the end, Dr. Estevez and other analysts said, the leftists were unable to clearly prove their allegations that fraud in the Michoacan vote had been decisive in the outcome. Moreover, even as Mr. Villasenor left office today, the president of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Genaro Borrego, sharply criticized the move and continued to insist that his party had won.
But before and after the July 12 vote in Michaocan, the leftist party focused its criticism less on the stuffing of ballot boxes than on the broader iniquities of political competition. More than ever, P.R.D. leaders asserted, the ruling party engineered its victory by channeling vast state resources in its campaign, controlling the local media and stacking the state election boards with its partisans.
And today, P.R.D. officials argued the protests they were able to organize against Mr. Villasenor had proven the need for more fundamental changes in Mexico's political system.
"This Government has to understand that it cannot move forward with an economic opening of the country without a political opening as well," Porfirio Munoz Ledo, one of the party's two senators, said in an interview.
"We have to get to the bottom of this issue," Mr. Munoz Ledo went on. "We need independent electoral bodies, valid voter rolls, legitimate voter-registration cards, limits to campaign spending and we need the Government to stop supporting its party with state resources. And we need equal access to the communications media to present our views."
After a first round of talks between Government officials and P.R.D. representatives led by Mr. Munoz Ledo, the two sides issued a statement agreeing on the importance of such guarantees in future elections.

HEADLINE: Another Gap for Europe to Close

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Ever since the pound sterling and the Italian lira were forced out of the European monetary system three weeks ago, politicians, led by President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, have been insisting that Europe's plans for a single currency by 1999 remain intact. But, with disgust with the political class now running as high as in the United States, their attempt to save face and reassure markets has failed.
In Germany, the problem has become known as the demokratishes Defizit. The phrase refers to the "democratic deficit" between what European politicians say and what their electorates believe. This credibility gap, aggravated by the upheaval on currency markets last month, now appears certain to block any rapid return to financial stability in Europe. 
 "The markets and people generally have completely lost faith in European politicians and the monetary union process," said Richard Davidson, a European equity strategist for Morgan Stanley in London. "Uncertainty is going to continue, and that in turn will delay any economic upturn."
 
Sources of Disappointment
 Several factors have contributed to the chasm now dividing European politicians from citizens and markets. Promises of an economic upturn and new jobs have been repeatedly broken in the last two years. The Maastricht treaty, signed with scant prior consultation last year, has proved unrealistic in a way that makes Europe's leaders seem simply foolish. And, in recent weeks, political bungling has begun to look like an epidemic.
So it is perhaps not surprising that in an atmosphere described today by the leading French newspaper Le Monde as one of "growing economic mistrust of political leaders," Europe's instability has shown no sign of abating. This week the pound and the lira came under pressure again and have now fallen 20 percent against the Deutsche mark since mid-September.
Within what is left of the European monetary system, weaker currencies such as the Spanish peseta and Irish punt remain acutely vulnerable, and even the French franc, backed by a solid economy, is being sustained only at the cost of interest rates that are ruinously high for industry. At the same time, stock markets have plunged as the economic outlook has darkened.
At the root of this instability lies the new perception that the Maastricht treaty, which Europe's leaders signed last year and laid out the 12-nation European Community's plans for monetary union, amounted to what Werner Becker, an assistant vice president of Deutsche Bank, called "a giant fiction invented by politicians."
 
Premises Now Questioned
 Simply put, this fiction was that European economies were firmly set on a converging course that would eventually allow a single currency to be introduced by the end of the century. That is what the leaders effectively declared in the treaty. The cornerstone of the process was to be the European monetary system, created in 1979 and obliging members to keep currencies broadly stable within narrow exchange-rate bands.
In fact, the substantial differences in economic efficiency between countries like Germany and Italy, or France and Britain, finally led to last month's breakup of the European monetary system.
"Politicians wanted us to believe you could operate a fixed exchange rate in Europe with widely differing economic performances," said Melissa Carrington, an economist for Hoare Gavett. "Well, the markets did not believe them and they still don't."
When, for example, inflation rates vary substantially between two countries but the countries maintain fixed exchange rates, it is difficult for the high-inflation country to remain competitive in export markets. The pressure of such distortions was increased this year by high German interest rates, which made it virtually impossible for weaker European economies to apply lower rates to stimulate a recovery.
For many months, however, politicians sought to ignore such realities. Now the politicians look either rash or incompetent.
For example, it was on July 10, just two months before the British currency crashed out of Europe's monetary system, that Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, declared that sterling would stay in the system because "we know from bitter experience that devaluation doesn't work for Britain." He added that "the way to success is to adjust your costs to your exchange rate, not the other way round."
Since then, Britain has been furiously adjusting its exchange rate rather than its costs amid a policy void that Mr. Becker of Deutsche Bank described as "astonishngly vague."
 
Maneuvers on Rates
 In a similar political about-face, Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy of France has allowed interest rates to soar to defend the franc after suggesting last month that rates might fall if France voted in favor of the Maastricht treaty. The country did narrowly approve the treaty on Sept. 20.
Such abrupt switches inevitably undermine confidence and credibility. Their effect has been more powerful because moroseness and skepticism are rampant in Europe. People are angry because repeated political promises that an economic upturn was imminent in Europe have proved empty.
The latest promise was that the second half of this year would bring the long-awaited economic rebound. This, however, has not materialized. Instead, after last month's currency upheaval, economists are revising their forecasts downward.
A senior official at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the organization had lowered its growth forecast for the industrialized world this year to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent three months ago and 2.2 percent at the beginning of the year. "The pickup in activity is just not happening," he said.
 
Another Forecast Lowered
 Mr. Becker of Deutsche Bank said "the uncertainty in currency markets is still huge and that is impacting substantially on business." As a result, he said, the bank had just lowered its growth forecast for Germany in 1993 to 1.5 percent from 2 percent.
H. Jorg Fehmer, the treasurer for Ford of Europe, which is based in Cologne, Germany, said the currency instability was having a severe impact. "It is very difficult to hedge at the moment," he said.
This uncertainty is the new reality of Europe, and it flies in the face of the statements of politicians. Therefore people do not believe what they hear from their leaders.
What they believe, rather, is that another realignment of European currencies is quite likely and that only a decision from the Bundesbank to lower German interest rates could bring a measure of stability to the European monetary system and a glimmer of optimism to industry.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The Man Who Kept a Client Who Wants to Be President

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Not every advertising executive has a client who decides to run for President. Yet Dennis McClain, who is heading the ad consortium creating commercials for Ross Perot, says that relationship is not why he agreed to work on the maverick billionaire's campaign.
"I think of him in terms of having the background to deal with some of the economic hurdles we have in front of us," said Mr. McClain, who is president at Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., and president of the ad consortium, called the 270 Group. 
 "Someone as familiar with government as Mr. Perot," he said in a telephone interview yesterday, "and at the same time, whose foundation is the fundamentals of American business -- that perspective is what we need to chart the course."
 
The Economy Is the Message
 With an estimated $425 million in billings, Temerlin McClain is the largest shop in the Southwest. Mr. McClain, 44 years old, joined the agency as president in 1985 from a local rival, the Bloom Agency in Dallas.
Temerlin McClain's blue-chip clients include American Airlines, J. C. Penney and the Perot Group, which is Mr. Perot's company that sells computer services.
Mr. McClain, whose shop's creations have included the "Something special in the air" theme for American, said the Perot campaign's message would be, "He's the right candidate to solve the economic issues that face the country."
Mr. McClain added: "We look at the economy as the primary issue from which the other issues flow. That will be the focal point of the advertising we run."
Mr. Perot's commercials will be positive, Mr. McClain said, eschewing the negative aspects of many spots that have been produced on behalf of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton.
"We're not going to do any of that," he asserted. "Just focusing on issues is what our plan is."
The Perot campaign will purchase a mix of time slots, Mr. McClain said. There will be 30-minute commercials, which began running last night with a half-hour on CBS that cost $380,000. And despite Mr. Perot's well-known disdain for short political ads, there will also be 30-second and 60-second spots, which are scheduled to begin running tomorrow.
As for Mr. Perot's total spending, Mr. McClain said he was "not at liberty to discuss that; Mr. Perot wants us to keep our strategy under our hat." He added, though, that "the amount of money will be similar" to the estimated $40 million apiece to be spent by the Bush and Clinton campaigns.
Mr. McClain took issue with reports this week that the 270 Group was formed in mid-September as a stalking horse for the resumption of Mr. Perot's candidacy. "I can tell you we haven't been formed for three weeks," he said. "We put this together six or seven days ago -- eight days at the outside."
Only after Mr. Perot decided to resume his campaign were the purse strings loosened, Mr. McClain said. "We were not given the go-ahead to do anything of substance until after that," he said. "He didn't, of course, want to spend the money unless he was going to move forward."
That comment evoked memories of widespread reports in July that a fundamental reason for the initial withdrawal by Mr. Perot was his reluctance to spend the money needed to wage the airwave warfare of a national Presidential campaign.
"Like any of us who haven't had experience with advertising campaigns on a major scale," Mr. McClain said, "some costs are hard to wrap your mind around at first.
"Mr. Perot, like any of us, is a prudent business person. He wants people to work within parameters that'll minimize the amount of money going into production, and wants to put as much money as possible into media to get his message across to people -- which is consistent with the vast majority of my clients."
Mr. McClain also disputed reports that the 270 Group would use previously shot commercials disparaged by Ed Rollins, the former Perot campaign manager, as "a farce." Those spots were produced by Murphy Martin, a former local television anchor who is the liaison between the 270 Group and the Perot campaign organization. This week, Newsweek magazine quoted Mr. Rollins as calling Mr. Martin "this 1964-style TV guy."
Mr. Rollins's choice to create the Perot ad campaign had been Hal Riney, a creator of the "Morning in America" spots for the 1984 Reagan re-election effort. But Mr. Perot dismissed Mr. Riney in favor of Mr. Martin, who said he could produce spots for less money.
"There's no plan to run them," Mr. McClain said of the Martin spots, adding that the commercials he intends to run "are all virtually created from scratch."
Temerlin McClain was formerly the Dallas-area office of Bozell Inc. It was renamed in May, when it became an independently managed shop as part of a Bozell reorganization.
There are close ties between Temerlin McClain and the 270 Group, named for the number of electoral votes needed to win the Presidency. It is as coyly named as the November Company, the organization producing President Bush's advertising. The Democrats' ad group has a more prosaic title, the Clinton/Gore Creative Team.
The 270 Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Temerlin McClain, Mr. McClain said, adding that about 15 of the 22 to 30 people working for the 270 Group came from the agency. And, he continued, the 270 Group is occupying what was vacant space on the second floor of the agency's office.
Still, Mr. McClain said, it is by no means an in-house agency. "We wanted to be sure our employees had the opportunity to be involved or not be involved."

HEADLINE: World Stock Prices Stabilize; Dow Off 0.81

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The world's major stock markets stabilized yesterday following Monday's sharp gyrations.
Prices on European exchanges recovered some but not all the big losses of a day earlier, inspired in part by the impressive recovery on the New York Stock Exchange Monday afternoon. Analysts said a renewed hope that the Bundesbank might cut interest rates also helped shore up prices. 
 The key index on the London Stock Exchange rose 1.72 percent and the Paris exchange's most closely watched index rose 0.09 percent. The key German stock index, however, lost 0.29 percent.
Meanwhile, stocks in the United States were little changed in active trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 0.81, to 3,178.19, on volume of 203.5 million shares.
 
Broader Gains
 Broader-based market averages did somewhat better, and gainers outnumbered stocks that lost value by a ratio of 10 to 7.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped by 0.39, to 407.18, but the Russell 2000 index rose by 1.32, to 187.82.
In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index rose by 5.34 points, to 570.55.
"The mini-panic sparked by computer-driven stock-derivative products appears to be over," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company.
In fact, Mr. Metz and other analysts said the symptoms often associated with a market free fall were not currently in evidence despite a big drop in stock prices on Friday and the dizzying downward spiral on Monday, when the Dow plunged nearly 105 points in the first two hours but regained nearly 80 percent by the close.
"I don't see the ingredients for a big decline," said Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
For that to occur, "investor optimism has to be up, cash positions at mutual funds have to be lower and interest rates have to be moving higher," he said. "This could be the first shot across the bow, but I don't think any of those conditions are likely to be seen for the next few months."
A signal from the Federal Reserve Board that it had not eased short-term interest rates upset the bond markets yesterday, but the Fed's signal had little impact on stock prices.
The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee met yesterday to consider whether lower interest rates were needed to stimulate the economy.
A number of analysts said it would be unwise for stock traders to expect another round of easing by the Fed.
"There is not much more the Fed can do" to help the economy through easier monetary policy, Mr. Metz said. "Unfortunately, we are hostage to the Bundesbank, just as Europe is."
 
Strength in Airlines
 Airline stocks were among the pockets of strength in yesterday's session, with carriers like UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines helping push up the Dow's transportation index by 13.49 points, to 1,253.80. United and American Airlines said Monday that they would increase some fares starting Friday. And United, American and Delta all reported higher September traffic yesterday.
Computer and semiconductor stocks also posted good gains yesterday.
The most active issue on the Big Board was Marriott, which announced on Monday that it was spinning off its heavily indebted real estate operations from its hotel management business. Marriott shares fell by 1/8, to 19 1/8.
Among over-the-counter issues, Magna International slumped by 2 3/8, to 20 3/4, after the auto parts manufacturer said its chief financial officer and two other senior executives planned to leave the company.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Marriott Bonds Reflecting Doubt

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
THE Marriott Corporation's bonds continued to slide yesterday, as debt holders' negative reaction to the company's restructuring plan persisted.
Charles Bishop, a bond analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said, "They just kept widening," referring to the spread between Marriott bonds and Treasury bonds of comparable maturity. The increased spread signifies the increased risk seen by investors in owning Marriott bonds. 
 On Monday, Marriott said it planned to split into two separate public companies by mid-1993. One company, Marriott International Inc., would focus on managing hotels, while the other, to be called the Host Marriott Corporation, would inherit the company's portfolio of property and a $2.9 billion debt load.
Mr. Bishop said part of the reason for the continued decline of Marriott bonds yesterday might have been technical. Many investors cannot hold junk bonds in their portfolios. Yesterday, Moody's Investor Services downgraded some Marriott bonds to the speculative, or junk-bond level.
Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing Marriott's bonds for possible downgrading to "mid-speculative," or junk, rating.
Robert Nelson, a bond analyst at Standard & Poor's, said that the strength of Marriott's hotel management operations had supported the investment grade rating to date.
"They are stripping away a very stable business," he said. "Host Marriott will have a lot less cash flow available to service their debt."
A bond trader who asked not to be identified said that several issues of Marriott's medium-term bonds dropped by three to four points each yesterday.
Host Marriott's ability to pay interest on its debts in a timely fashion will affect the value of both companies, analysts said, since Marriott International has pledged to provide a $600 million line of credit, if needed, to Host Marriott.
"The more comfortable people are that Host can finance itself, without having to go to International, that will help the valuations of both companies," said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
The stock market's warm embrace of the Marriott restructuring plan faded a bit yesterday, but equity analysts still believe that Marriott will be worth more in two parts. Marriott's stock price fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $19.125, after jumping 12 percent on Monday.
"This enhances shareholder value in the near term and the long term," said Steven A. Rockwell, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons.
Most analysts suggest that after the split takes place next year, that the two pieces combined will be worth from $22 to $27 a share.
Most of the value resides in the hotel management company, analysts said.
"There is a very bullish story in the making," said Mark Manson, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Marriott is the world's leading operator of hotels. Many other hotel operators have been weakened by the poor economy, giving Marriott an opportunity to pick up lucrative new management contracts.
Marriott must receive a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the split will be tax-free to shareholders for the deal to take place. The company must also unravel the complex partnerships that it put together to build some of its hotels.
Mr. Manson and other analysts cautioned that the deal was a complex one and still seven to nine months from completion. Mr. Manson said investors must take into account the risk that the transaction would not be carried out at all. "There are a lot of legal issues," he said. "I can't assess that risk. If I was sure that the transaction was going to be consummated, I would probably be recommending purchase of the stock much more aggressively."
But most of the questions surround the real estate company. "The sticky part of this is trying to figure out the Host Marriott piece," said Mr. Mueller of Montgomery Securities.
Most market professionals say Host Marriott will be worth from nothing to $3 a share.
One benefit of the restructuring, said Caroline Levy, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, is that it will attract real estate investors, rather than hotel investors, to Marriott. Those investors, she said, may be more willing to recognize the asset value of the hotels in the portfolio, even if they currently are not generating profits. "You have brought in a whole new investor base," she said.
Still, most institutional investors are expected to sell their Host Marriott shares quickly. "In general, in situations like this, most institutions feel more comfortable holding equity securities that produce earnings," Mr. Manson said.
John J. Rohs of Wertheim Schroder added: "It's basically a very good deal for equity holders. I'm not addressing bondholders."

HEADLINE: Presidential Candidates Ignore Banking Problem

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Six weeks after the November elections, a new banking law will go into effect that will force the President to confront what will certainly be one of the most unpleasant challenges of his Administration: the plight of the nation's banks.
The insurance fund that protects deposits is already $5.5 billion in the red and is supposed to stand behind $3 trillion worth of deposits. It will be called upon to protect thousands of depositors at hundreds of institutions expected to collapse next year. Yet the Presidential contenders have barely mentioned the issue. 
 The omission illustrates a classic political calculation: there is no percentage in offering voters a choice between pain and agony.
 
Against the Grain of Politics
 "The art of politics is ostentatious giving and surreptitious taking," said Roger J. Vaughan, an economist who was an adviser to Hugh L. Carey when Mr. Carey was Governor of New York. "Banking reform is ostentatious taking and surreptitious giving."
On Monday, Mr. Vaughan and Edward W. Hill, an associate professor at Cleveland State University, made public their two-year study of the banking industry. It paints a bleak picture. Even less pessimistic experts concur that the industry's precarious condition will be one of the first huge problems confronting the next Administration.
It is a puzzle to which all the solutions hurt someone. To limit taxpayers' liability by reducing Federal insurance coverage is to expose depositors in weak banks to greater losses. To impose tighter Government supervision of banks is to discourage them from lending, thus further depressing the weak economy. To loosen regulation could mean more bank failures and bailouts -- at considerable cost to taxpayers.
The new banking law requires regulators to protect depositors by seizing weak banks, which as the Federal Reserve noted in internal documents six months ago will put regulators "under considerable strain" in 1993. The old law permitted the regulators to wait until the banks went insolvent.
Financial issues in this election year have taken on an almost radioactive aura. Congress is expected to adjourn without providing any new money for the savings and loan bailout, which stalled after its spending authority expired in April. Nor has the White House done any meaningful lobbying for the program. The delay is expected to raise costs by hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
Why the Issue Is Ignored
 Lawmakers, bankers and industry experts give these reasons that the banking problem has been off the Presidential candidates' agendas:
*The banks in the gravest conditions are in states that hold the largest number of electoral votes -- California, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Bankers from many of those states have lobbied Washington hard to ease up on regulations that would force them to write off bad loans.
*Further limiting deposit insurance would reduce the Government's overall liability, but the idea has never gained serious political consideration because insurance, like Social Security, is viewed as an entitlement.
*The banking industry is deeply divided between strong, profitable institutions and weak ones. Aggregate earnings suggest that the industry is far stronger than it really is, since the collapse of only one or a handful of large institutions could be calamitous.
*For politicians, banking changes are never a winning issue. They involve complex, technical issues that few voters understand, and since virtually all depositors have so far been protected by deposit insurance, most voters have not felt the crisis directly.
*Both political parties have argued for measures to encourage more corporate lending to fight recession. Those measures are often at odds with tighter banking regulations.
 
Both Candidates Are Vulnerable
 Furthermore, the Bush and Clinton camps both have Achilles' heels. President Bush's Administration woefully underestimated the magnitude of the savings and loan debacle, and his aides wrote the inadequate 1989 savings and loan law. His son Neil was a director of one of the largest failed institutions.
Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have business ties to a failed Arkansas savings association that she represented before a state regulator appointed by her husband. And four of the so-called Keating Five senators, who were investigated by an ethics panel for intervening on behalf of a corrupt savings and loan executive, were Democrats.
As of June, the bank insurance fund was $5.5 billion in deficit, battered by more than 1,000 failures over the last five years, and it is too early to measure the ultimate costs of a banking crisis with further failures.
The study of the banking industry by Mr. Vaughan and Professor Hill concludes startlingly that protecting depositors could cost taxpayers $100 billion over the next decade. The study, published by the Washington Post Company Briefing Books, estimates that one-sixth of the nation's banks are already effectively insolvent.

Dollar Mixed in New York While Gold Prices Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned mixed in uneventful domestic dealings yesterday after rising overseas.
Gold prices declined after putting in a mixed performance in foreign markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $350.10 a troy ounce, off 40 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell 50 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $350.00 an ounce. 
 Analysts said the dollar had a firmer tone, especially in foreign markets. But most of its strength was attributed to dealers' taking their profits by selling German marks, said Marc Chandler, an analyst at the advisory firm IDEA.
The mark has benefited substantially from the currency chaos that has characterized foreign-exchange trading in the last month. But rumors have begun circulating that Germany's Bundesbank may soon cut interest rates, undermining the mark's appeal.
High rates are a lure to investors and generally serve to strengthen a country's currency.
The British pound and Italian lira, which were pounded during the crisis, were the main beneficiaries as traders bought these currencies after selling their marks.
Stock prices appeared to stabilize on Wall Street, dimming prospects that the Federal Reserve would be forced to trim interest rates at home, which further served to support the dollar.
"The tone is mildly constructive for the dollar," Mr. Chandler said. "There have been reports of corporations and fund managers buying dollars over the past few days."
But he cautioned that a good portion of the dollar's strength resulted from plays involving key European currencies.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 119.79 Japanese yen, from 119.25 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, the dollar rose further to 119.80 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 119.70 yen, down from 119.75 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7115, from $1.7065 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.7135 to buy one pound, unchanged from Monday.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields Are Off Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit eroded a bit more this week, according to new rates to take effect today. The slide is a continuation of a downward trend in yields that began with the last interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in July.
Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida publication that tracks interest rates, said the week's decline in yields was slightly steeper than in the previous week, and that last Friday's employment report, which underlined the weakness in the recovery, might have set the stage for another cut in rates. 
 Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said the stronger decline in yields this week could be an indication that banks were expecting a cut in interest rates by the Fed.
 
Treasuries Decline
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills Monday, average discount rates fell to their lowest levels since 1962. The auction is often regarded as a barometer of how banks will set deposit rates in the weeks ahead.
The average rate at the auction for three-month bills was down 6 basis points from the week before, to 2.67 percent, while the six-month bill fell 7 basis points, to 2.78 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The average yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit in the New York area in the latest reporting week fell more sharply than in the previous week.

HEADLINE: Rockefeller U. Opens A New Research Center

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
After the ribbon was cut on a new $100 million research center at Rockefeller University, a group of young scientists and students in white laboratory coats were invited to enter ahead of waiting dignitaries.
The significance of the gesture was not lost on many of the people who attended the ceremony recently inaugurating the John D. Rockefeller Jr. and David Rockefeller Research Building. The university, with its new 14-story research center, is giving high visibility to a new generation of scientists in an effort to maintain its pre-eminence in research. 
 "There are fresh new winds blowing at the university," said Torsten Wiesel, a Nobel Prize-winning neurobiologist and the university's president.
Since its inception in 1901, Rockefeller University has been in the forefront of medical research in the country. But over the years, other institutions, particularly in California and Texas, have been gaining ground.
 
Focus on Youth
 To regain its luster, the university plans to increase its recruitment of young scientists, including more women and minorities.
Already, six scientists have been added to the faculty, one of them Mary Elizabeth Hatten, a 42-year-old neurobiologist, who is the fifth woman appointed as a tenured professor in the university's 91-year history. She is one of 42 tenured professors. The other scientists recently recruited range in age from 28 to 35.
"It's time for a change and I fit in with the current of change," said Dr. Hatten, who said she was convinced the university was moving toward broader cultural and intellectual diversity.
To help in recruiting younger scientists, the university plans to add a day-care center to go with its nursery school and kindergarten.
But undoubtedly the most substantial extra inducement being offered is the new research building, which was opened during a four-day celebration.
The center should help buoy spirits about the city's future, said Richard M. Furlaud, chairman of the university's trustees.
 
Benefits Seen for New York
 "In an era when many people are thinking about leaving the city," he said, "we attract annually numerous young scientists who come to study and many of them decide to make New York City their permanent home and go on to enrich it culturally and economically during the course of their careers."
The research center, an Alabama limestone and glass tower perched overlooking the East River esplanade at 68th Street, offers 100,000 square feet of laboratory space for studies in cell and molecular biology, immunology, chemistry and the neurosciences.
The tower took eight years to compete, and was financed by a $30 million contribution from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which will occupy four floors, revenue from a $50 million bond issue, and gifts from corporations, foundations and individuals. The Hughes institute also will finance the work of the 11 scientists who will be the building's first occupants.
But with the rising costs of supporting research, "this may be the last time we see a research building of this capacity built entirely with private funds," said Dr. Walter E. Massey, director of the National Science Foundation. He added, "Somebody else has to buy the furniture for half of the floors in this building."
 
A Family Matter
 The university began after John D. Rockefeller acquired the Schermerhorn farm as the site for an Institute for Medical Research. Over the years, other scientific disciplines were added.
Mr. Rockefeller induced his father, John D. Rockefeller Sr., to make the the first gift, of $1 million. Since then, there have been many gifts from other family members -- most recently, $20 million from David Rockefeller, who is chairman of the university board's executive committee. A younger generation of Rockefellers also maintain links to the university.
"In a family with a tendency of members to go their own ways, this institution represents five generations' support," observed David Rockefeller Jr., who formerly was on the university board. His brother, Dr. Richard Rockefeller, a physician, and sister, Dr. Neva Goodwin, an economist at Tufts University, now serve on the board.
The opening of the research building comes after a year of strain and controversy at the university. Dr. David Baltimore, a noted molecular biologist, resigned as the university's president in November 1991 after a bitter debate in which he vigorously defended a collaborator on a scientific paper against charges that she had fabricated data.
Dr. Baltimore is returning to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Wiesel was named to a three-year term in February.

HEADLINE: New Cash Subsidies Help Trenton Lure Businesses

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The cross-border battle that lured the First Chicago Trust Company's 1,000 jobs out of lower Manhattan last month was a showcase for an aggressive new program that allows New Jersey to become a patient, generous, nonprofit landlord for companies that agree to move to the state.
The state was lucky that a developer had a new building with the kind of floor plan the trust company was looking for standing empty here on the Hudson waterfront, its owners all but begging for a tenant. New York had no such space available in a financially stable building. 
 According to people involved in the transaction, however, what clinched the company's decision to leave Manhattan was a last-minute offer from New Jersey to pay about $6 million to complete, furnish and equip 240,000 square feet of office space for First Chicago.
In return for paying these expenses, most of which are normally the landlord's responsibility, New Jersey will become a partner in Newport Tower with The Limited Inc., owners of the building. The state plans to offer other potential tenants in the 36-story, million-square-foot structure terms similar to those given First Chicago.
First Chicago signed a 15-year lease on Sept. 24 and will begin moving its business, handling stockholder relations for about 400 corporations, from 30 West Broadway next summer. The company's Manhattan lease expires at the end of 1994.
New Jersey's decision to use direct cash subsidies to attract out-of-state companies represents an escalation in the office war it has waged with New York City ever since a kind of Manhattan office suburb began growing here a decade ago.
The money to help First Chicago came from the state Economic Development Authority's two-week-old, $224 million Economic Recovery Fund. The fund, which Gov. Jim Florio refers to as "our secret weapon," will be used to take New Jersey far beyond the arm's-length approach other states use in promoting private investment.
New York City's Industrial Development Agency, a typical example, sells bonds to buy or build factories, then leases the space back to businesses. But New York tailors each bond issue to a deal and requires the business that benefits from the deal to line up buyers for the bonds, which are paid back from rent on the space.
New Jersey's Economic Recovery Fund operates like a bank, said Anthony Coscia, chairman of the Economic Development Authority. It lends money to small businesses that commercial banks will not deal with, underwrites bonds for other companies and even becomes an investor and partner in such ventures as Newport Tower.
The long-term nature of the fund means that the state can make riskier investments and wait much longer for a return than conventional development funds could.
 
Bottom Line Is Jobs
 Moreover, the state's participation reduces the risk for other investors, Mr. Coscia said, thus reducing interest costs. And since the state need not make a profit so long as tax revenues eventually cover investment, prices can be pushed still lower.
"We're not looking to be the most profitable bank in America," Mr. Coscia said. "We're looking to save jobs. Even if we break even, we consider that quite successful, because our real bottom line is the number of jobs created."
The money in the development fund comes from bonds, and the carrying cost of the bonds are to be repaid with the $14 million the state receives each year as its share of income from the World Trade Center, which it owns with New York State through the Port Authority.
Outside the Economic Recovery Fund, New Jersey has invested $120 million in more conventional development projects, including the construction of an $80-million aerospace engineering studio for General Electric in Camden. In the last two years, Mr. Coscia said, the projects have saved or brought to New Jersey 20,000 jobs.
 
A Break on Rent
 Although no one would spell out the terms of First Chicago's lease, those involved in the negotiations said the annual rent would be about $12 to $13 a square foot, including taxes of about $2 a square foot. The best the company could have done in a Manhattan site of similar quality would have been about $20 a square foot, according to Manhattan real estate operators. They estimated that First Chicago may now pay more than $30 a square foot at 30 West Broadway.
New York development officials said last month that it would have cost $50 million in incentives, or $50,000 for each job saved, to match the New Jersey incentive package, although Lorn H. Price, president of First Chicago, said in an interview that the city was exaggerating the distance between the two sides.
An official familiar with the negotiations maintained that the difference was so great because Newport Tower, a distressed, vacant building, cut rents to the bone to get a first tenant, and the state's participation pushed the rents still lower.
Judging by New York's past performance, as demonstrated in a recent deal to keep Prudential Insurance in Manhattan, the city would probably have been willing to spend $20,000 a job in incentives to win a 20-year lease.
 
Special Enterprise Incentives
 In contrast, Mr. Coscia put the cost of all incentives to New Jersey at about $12 million, or $12,000 for each First Chicago employee, over the company's 15-year lease.
Aside from the $6 million grant to complete the interior and furnish and equip First Chicago's space, Mr. Coscia said, the company received only the normal relocation incentives available to any concern moving into the Urban Enterprise Zone in Jersey City. Among such incentives are these:
*A 15-year exemption from sales taxes on almost all equipment and services bought for the company, from computers to pencils, which Jersey City officials estimate will be worth about $1 million a year.
*A real estate tax of about half the normal rate fixed for about 15 years.
*An electric rate reduction of 25 percent offered for one year by Public Service Electric and Gas to the first tenants in an empty building in an urban enterprise zone.
*Public Service's normal area development rate, an additional 7 to 10 percent cut in electric costs for seven years. It is available only in one of the state's 14 urban enterprise zones.
Steven Kuken, general manager for area development at Public Service, said the value of these incentives could not be calculated until consumption levels were established.
In addition, Jersey City has no income tax on residents or commuters, as New York City has, and New Jersey state taxes are lower than those in New York.
Jersey City's waterfront, aided by the PATH connection to Manhattan, has added about 3.4 million square feet of office space since 1986, with most of the tenants former New York companies. Among them are Merrill Lynch Securities, which moved 2,500 back-office jobs to Jersey City this year, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which moved 600 jobs to Harborside Financial Center last year.

HEADLINE: Gay Students Seek a Ban on Campus Military Recruiters

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Connecticut's one-year-old gay rights law is facing its first major court test here in a lawsuit filed by gay students who want military recruiters banned from the University of Connecticut law school campus.
Connecticut is one of only seven states that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. But the state also has on its books an older statute that is aimed at protecting military recruiters. 
 "The presence of military recruiters seeking to interview students on the campus of the University of Connecticut does not only not violate the law, it is required by law," said Paul M. Shapiro, an assistant attorney general, in arguments today in Hartford Superior Court.
Legal experts said that dozens of universities and law schools around the country have voluntarily prohibited recruiters for the military because it bans homosexuals from enlistment. But they said the Connecticut case might be the first in the nation in which a state judge bans the military outright as a violator of state discrimination laws.
And today, Superior Court Judge Frances Allen indicated from the bench that she just might do that. After sharply questioning state attorneys, she asked them to postpone a visit by Navy recruiters, scheduled for this Friday, until she could issue a final decision next week.
If Judge Allen does grant an injunction, the order would not affect any other campus or state institution, but would almost certainly be used as a precedent in future cases, said Ruth E. Harlow, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the students.
In New York last year, the state Division of Human Rights ordered the State University center at Buffalo to bar military recruiters from campus because homosexuals cannot serve in the armed forces. But a few hours later, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called the order unenforceable because it conflicted with a state law that lets the military recruit anywhere that private employers do.
In the Connecticut case, the law school's dean, Hugh C. Macgill, has openly sided with the students and said the state is wrong. In a letter introduced into evidence by the students, Mr. Macgill said the military clearly violates the school's longstanding policy banning employers who discriminate, and that the gay rights bill would appear to have superseded the earlier law protecting the military.
 
A Legal Tangle
 However, he said, given the interpretation issued by state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, "It is not possible for me to bar military recruiters from the law school campus without, in effect, throwing the school itself into a posture of civil disobedience."
Under state law, the students' group must prove that continued military recruitment on the campus would cause "irreparable harm." Today the co-chairman of the Gay and Lesbian Law Students Association, Joseph Steffan, offered two central arguments in support of that point: he said that the recruiters caused emotional pain by fostering an environment of discrimination on campus, and that in a tight economy the on-campus recruiting gave state-sanctioned advantages to one group of students over another in searching for jobs.
Mr. Steffan has firsthand experience with the military. He testified today that he was one month shy of graduating from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1987 when the Navy dismissed him for being gay. He said that seeing recruiters on campus is "like someone kicking you in the stomach." Mr. Steffan has also filed a separate Federal lawsuit challenging his dismissal.
Maj. Michael J. Tuohy, the general counsel to the Connecticut National Guard, testified that the military also refuses to consider the enlistment of people with physical or mental disabilities, or those who are simply too old. He said that all military lawyers must be "combat ready," and able to be called at any moment to give legal advice to field commanders in war situations. Female law school recruits are allowed in those roles, he said, but homosexuals are not.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Pulse -- New Jersey;
For Old Republican Reasons, New Jersey Leans to Clinton

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Oct. 4

 BODY:
In the 1950's and 1960's, hundreds of thousands of city dwellers, mostly white and mostly working class or lower middle class, left the turbulence of New York or Philadelphia behind, crossed the Hudson or the Delaware and settled in the clusters of suburbs that sprang up in New Jersey.
Many were Democrats who continued to vote for their party's candidates in state and local contests but who in Presidential elections supported Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan and George Bush, with their promises to get tough on crime. They have been the main reason New Jersey, a place with a diverse ethnic mix and a lusty and unpredictable political past that is still a swing state for most purposes, has backed the Republican Presidential nominee six times in a row -- as steady a record as that of prim and proper Utah. 
 Now they are one of the main reasons Bill Clinton stands a good chance of breaking the Republican stranglehold on New Jersey's electoral votes (15 this time, the ninth-largest block). The Democrats smell success, although such events as the near-defeat two years ago of their seemingly untouchable Senator, Bill Bradley, have made them extremely cautious.
 
No Longer Insulated
 "Something big seems to have changed," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat whose district includes Hackensack and much of Bergen County. "For a long time people sat on their suburban porches, looked back to where they came from, moaned about the crime in the streets there and the bad schools and the drugs, and voted Republican for President.
"Now more and more sense that all of those social ills have followed them out here, they see this economic trouble, and suddenly the Democratic party's message means something to them again."
A few theorists, including no less a student of the game than Mr. Nixon, who lives in Park Ridge, have suggested that suburban discontent might benefit Ross Perot's recently revivified independent candidacy, and it is true that there are more independents than Republicans or Democrats in New Jersey.
But not a single one of the dozen or so practical politicians interviewed for this article, nor any of the purportedly impartial experts consulted, gave Mr. Perot a chance to make a significant showing here or to affect the outcome.
Mr. Perot's volunteer organization is even shakier here than in most states, the original chairman having been dismissed last month by Dallas headquarters. Besides that, argued Mr. Torricelli, who is a fairly hard-boiled man himself, "Jersey people are too cynical to believe in Ross Perot" after his withdrawal from the race in July.
A poll taken late last month by Political Media Research, before Mr. Perot's announcement but well after speculation about his re-entry began, gave Mr. Clinton a 12-point lead in the state, 43 percent to 31, with 11 percent backing Mr. Perot and 15 percent undecided. A total of 823 likely voters were surveyed, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
It is not necessary to read polls to sense that the tides are running strongly against the President in this state.
Noting that New Jersey has a tradition of electoral volatility, and that Gerald R. Ford, among others, had come from far behind to carry it, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a moderate Republican who is now the president of Drew University, nevertheless termed Mr. Bush's situation "very serious."
"The President doesn't seem to be able to make any inroads with two groups we've had in the past and don't have now," he said. "On the one hand, you've got the Reagan Democrats, and on the other you've got the white-collar suburban women. They've always been disturbed by the President's stand on abortion, and they're doubly disturbed by the meanness, the real nastiness, that they saw in the rhetoric at our convention."
 
Convention 'Very Scary'
 Mr. Kean was one of the small band of governors from the Northeast who wanted to challenge the platform's absolute prohibition of abortion, but he was persuaded by the party hierarchy to desist.
Hazel Frank Gluck, a former State Transportation Commissioner who attended the convention as an alternate, said: "I found it very scary. They blew the election right there, I'm afraid, with all that exclusionary stuff about family values and traditional families. I'm divorced. I have a daughter who, unfortunately, is divorced. Who are they to tell either of us that we lack proper family values?
" 'Let's not embarrass the President,' they said. Well, frankly, it's a lot better to embarrass him then instead of later."
She expressed pessimism about her party's immediate future.
"The Bush people have embraced their base, and their base isn't what most of the country is about," she said. "The extreme right, those religious zealots, are going to do to us what the extreme left did to the Democrats for years until Bill Clinton came along."
If the Bush high command in Washington has decided to play down abortion and family values and other issues that have turned many voters, especially women, against the President, it chose a strange and rather clumsy way to send that signal to the voters of New Jersey.
On one of his many campaign-season visits to the state, Mr. Bush spoke on Sept. 18 at the headquarters of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in Basking Ridge. He attacked the compulsory family-leave bill passed by Congress, saying he would veto it because it might prompt employers to discriminate against pregnant women and because it would hurt the economy.
A principal sponsor of the bill, Representative Marge Roukema, a Republican whose district covers the most northerly strip of New Jersey, boycotted the event. That was bad enough political symbolism, but there was much more.
New Jersey has for several years had a family leave law identical to the one the President has opposed. It was sponsored by Donald T. Di Francesco, the Republican leader of the State Senate, it was signed into law by Mr. Kean, and it has so far had no noticeable adverse side effects. A.T.&T. executives say they have found it quite workable.
"He probably should have picked Idaho to make that speech," said Mr. Di Francesco, a Bush loyalist who still thinks the President has a chance to make a comeback. "Very foolish to do it here."
The Republicans are trying their best to get the comeback under way by linking Mr. Clinton to Gov. James J. Florio, the Democrat whose tax increases have left him badly wounded. Richard N. Bond, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, visited the state last week, called Mr. Florio "the worst Governor in the country" and asserted that he and Mr. Clinton were nothing but "tax-and-spend Siamese twins."
But it is Mr. Florio and Mr. Bush whom voters here tend to blame for their economic troubles, said Michael Aron, the political correspondent for New Jersey public television, because they have been in office during the years when the state's great boom of the early 80's has turned to ashes. One of the reasons voters are so irritated, he suggested, is that neither of the two seems willing to accept any responsibility.
"Florio always talks about the national recession, as if it's all beyond his control," Mr. Aron said, "just the way the President talks about the global recession."
Carl Van Horn, the acting director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Florio had suffered from the fact that "the crash and burn of the local economy has been so deep and so prolonged, which makes people feel powerless and angry."
Only a few years after the boom days that saw the development of a new residential and commercial Gold Coast across from Manhattan, New Jersey now has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country (9 percent, as against the national rate of 7.5 percent) and a devastated industrial base.
Partly as a result, a number of wealthy businessmen who normally contribute heavily to the Republicans are giving big money to Mr. Clinton this year. Among them, according to officials of both parties, are 10 or so who attended a $50,000-a-head cocktail party given by Finn Casperson of the Beneficial Management Corporation last month, including Allen Bildner, the founder of Kings Super Markets Inc., and Ray Chambers, a former partner of the financier William E. Simon, who was Mr. Ford's Treasury Secretary.
Mr. Florio would almost certainly lose if he were seeking re-election this year. But unfortunately for the Republicans, it is Mr. Bush, not Mr. Florio, who is on the November ballot, and an Eagleton Institute poll in mid-September indicated that a solid majority of the people of New Jersey do not want to see the President re-elected.

Chart: "A State of Diversity"
 New Jersey is a complicated stae for a national politician trying to tailor a message4. Its topography ranges from seashore to mountains, its communities range from urban blight to farming hamlets and its population ranges from brand-new immigrants to old-line aristocracy. It has two Democratic Senators and a Democratic Governor. New Jersey now has 14 Representatives - eight Democrats and six Republicans - but will lose one seat because of reapportionment.

In the End, Congress Winds Down to the Prosaic

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
On what was supposed to be the last morning of the 102d Congress, House members walked the aisles of their vaulted chamber with bags under their eyes and plastic bags of cookies hanging from their pockets. More than a few legislators sunk into their chairs, asleep.
It was a Congress that opened with a lofty debate on whether to go to war, devolved into a pie-throwing contest over perks and finally sputtered to an end with an all-nighter devoted to unextraordinary matters like a tax bill that few thought would have more than a modest effect on the economy. 
 "Sometimes it is hard to get excited at 3 o'clock in the morning about a tax bill," said Representative Clay E. Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, in a passionless speech that captured the general level of enthusiasm of the end of the session. Representative J. J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas, managed a more compelling defense of the bill's merits before it passed the House by six votes, saying, "This stops payments to dead people."
 
Grasping for Credit
 One custom of Congressional adjournments is that each party's leadership holds a news conference to boast of accomplishments, which would, of course, have been greater if only the other party hadn't played politics.
The comments began today with Speaker Thomas S. Foley's characterization of the session as "solid, substantial and constructive." He was followed to the microphone by the majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, who agreed but added, "Much more could have been done but for the President's unwise and excessive use of the veto."
Then came the Republicans, with Representative Robert H. Michel's saying the session was "long on politics and short on legislation."
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said even if Congress had not passed much worthy legislation, the "Democrats achieved their primary objective, which was bashing President Bush."
There was one factor missing from the end-of-of-the-session news conferences: a clear idea about when the session would end.
 
Dishevelment Indicator
 Although Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, looked exhausted after conducting a 15-hour filibuster that brought the Senate to a standstill, he appeared as fresh as a breeze off Long Island Sound compared to Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn as he lumbered off the House floor this morning following an all-nighter shepherding a carjacking bill. Mr. Schumer sniffled from a cold and carried a United States Open tennis tote bag in one hand and a can of diet cola in the other. As he pushed open the chamber door, Mr. Schumer grumbled to the doorkeeper, "I was reminded by Pat Schroeder that I didn't comb my hair this morning."
Disheveled hair did not stop Mr. Schumer from stopping a moment to talk with a reporter and philosophize a bit about the 102d Congress. "It was the most roller-coaster session I've ever been through," said the six-term Democrat. He said that after all the scandals and gridlock "we're going out like lambs with little rancor."
Now I'm going back to the office," Mr. Schumer said, "to put some goop in my hair."
 
No Ringers Allowed
 The outnumbered Republicans won few battles in the 102d Congress, but they proudly displayed a three-foot-high glistening trophy on the House floor this morning to evoke memories of their recent 11-to-7 thrashing of the House Democrats at baseball.
"It shows you baseball is not like life at all," sighed Tony Blankley, press secretary to Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip.
Less gracious Republicans noted that they would have won by much more had Representative Jim Bunning of Kentucky, the man who threw two no-hitters in the major leagues, pitched. But Mr. Bunning was disqualified from playing in a deal with the Democrats that prohibited Representative Tom McMillen of Maryland, a National Basketball Association forward in his former profession, from playing in the basketball matchup.
 
Dumped Legislation
 Usually, the House passes bills and sends them to the Senate. On Sunday it passed bills and sent them to the landfill.
As House Clerk Donnald K. Anderson told it, a box of approved bills was sitting in the enrolling clerk's office early in the morning when a cleaning crew went through and took it off to a compactor. "A cleaner apparently mistook the contents for trash," Mr. Anderson said.
The lost legislation included a $2.3 billion legislative-appropriations measure, leading Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, to say the cleaner's action did not seem strange to him. A constant critic of how Democrats run the House, Mr. Gingrich said, "I think he probably looked at it and said, 'This looks like trash to me.' "
While the Senate waited for legislation to arrive, Mr. Anderson and colleagues in pin-striped suits raked through a mess at a collection point on Capitol Hill. They opened bales of trash to see whether they could find the missing bills, which also included the Freedom Support Act, a measure passed on Saturday to provide foreign aid for Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union.
Alas, the legislation was already on the road to a landfill in Richmond and had to be reconstructed from committee files and copies kept in one office or another. The House solemnly passed a resolution declaring the reconstructed material to be the real thing.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton and Gore Return to the Call-In

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore returned to the television talk-show circuit Monday night and today, moving their joint campaign from the old-fashioned handshaking of a bus trip to the newfangled discourse of viewer call-ins.
Often, as was the case on "Larry King Live" on Monday night, the occasion was comfortable: Mr. Gore wore blue jeans, Mr. Clinton's mother called to say hello from Las Vegas, Nev., the broadcast originated from a livestock arena. 
 Other times the candidates, who are looking for what Mr. Clinton called the "unfiltered" forum of live television, stumbled into lively encounters. For example, Mr. Clinton entered the ring today with Phil Donahue, sparring with the talk-show host in the pattern of heated exchange that the two perfected during a spring appearance on the show.
 
Clinton Challenged
 They talked about health care and jobs policy and free trade. But Mr. Clinton, who completed a bus tour in Florida before flying here this afternoon, grew most lively and irritated when Mr. Donahue or viewers of the call-in portions of the program challenged him on his his military history, opposition to the Vietnam War and his arms-length relationship with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
"I don't think you can judge me just on how many meetings I've had with Reverend Jackson," Mr. Clinton said, adding that he had talked to him twice recently on the telephone.
When Mr. Donahue continued to press the point that his relationship with Mr. Jackson was strained, Mr. Clinton shot back, "Are you his booking agent?"
Mr. Clinton was also dismissive and succinct when a viewer asked him how he could serve as Commander in Chief if he worked to avoid military service during the Vietnam War.
 
Anti-War Activities
 "If you don't want to vote for me because of that, that's fine with me," he said. "But that's not going to have anything to do with the way you're going to live the day after the election."
At another point, asked about his anti-war activities during his days as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Mr. Clinton said, "You are wrong to ignore my entire public life, as you and a lot of others have done, and to make up your own characterization on this so that you can once again divert people from the discussion of things that will affect their lives."
In recent days, questions about Mr. Clinton's actions during his student years in the late 1960's have cropped up once again as Representative Robert K. Dornan, Republican of California, has used the House floor to challenge Mr. Clinton's accounting of his anti-war activities.
Mr. Clinton said today that he was "proud" of his opposition to the Vietnam War but that he was "not a big organizer of anti-war activities."
The "Donahue" program was broadcast from Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee to accommodate the campaign's desire to showcase workers from a defunct textile plant that moved to El Salvador with Government help.
The Democratic nominees sought to draw attention to a State Department program that attacks poverty by encouraging American businesses to create jobs in poor nations. It was envisioned as a twist on standard foreign aid programs, which give food and cash directly to foreign governments that may or may not use them wisely. But labor unions complained bitterly this fall that the jobs the program created in developing nations too often were taken from American workers.
For example, an El Salvador foundation used State Department money to advertise in American trade journals, noting that textile workers in that nation could be hired for as little as 33 cents an hour. One textile union has asserted that Federal officials assured American companies that their Central American factories would be union-free, and even helped compile a "blacklist" of labor organizers in Honduras.
Officials with the Agency for International Development, the State Department office that runs the program, have denied that they seek to "export" American jobs overseas. In fact, they argue that the program creates American jobs by stimulating the economies of poorer trading partners.
After they taped the Donahue program, the Democratic nominees met with several people who were formerly employed at the Decatursville, Tenn., textile plant that moved to El Salvador. Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore accused the Bush Administration of actively working to drive American jobs overseas.
"There are textile companies in America making money," Mr. Clinton said. "It is not true that we can just throw all these jobs away."
Mr. Gore said: "George Bush has personally supported this program and steered more tax dollars into it. And it is just flat wrong."
Mr. Gore also used the Donahue program to renew his accusations that the Bush Administration provided aid to Iraq long after it knew that Saddam Hussein was preparing for war.
"Bush called the fire department, but he set the blaze with his policies leading up to the invasion of Kuwait," Mr. Gore said. "Once the blaze is set, you don't stand by and let it burn out of control."

HEADLINE: New Wave of Cubans Sails to Florida Illegally

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla., Oct. 6

 BODY:
For the first time since the Mariel boat lift brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States in 1980, refugees desperate to flee the dictatorship of Fidel Castro are arriving here steadily in large groups aboard Cuban vessels, in defiance of American and Cuban restrictions.
The authorities say nearly 1,000 refugees have arrived in the last two months, nearly half the number for all of last year. 
 The authorities say that in contrast to the Cubans who arrived here in the last decade, mainly in family groups or mostly in small numbers aboard makeshift rafts, the latest influx includes larger groups of people transported on commercial or private boats. The vessels leave the refugees just offshore, on uninhabited islands or near lighthouses.
 
Up to the Main Beach
 On Monday a Cuban fishing trawler pulled up to the main downtown beach here just before dawn and let 19 people wade ashore. The refugees included Oscar Mestril Ramirez, 49 years old, who said the group sailed out of a harbor near Havana on Sunday night.
"We made a deal, an arrangement through an intermediary," Mr. Mestril said. "They told us when and where they would pick us up and where they would leave us off."
Under United States immigration laws Cubans are allowed to apply for and be given legal residence more quickly than any other national group. The Supreme Court agreed this week to consider the Bush Administration's policy of forcing refugees from neighboring Haiti to return to their homeland when picked up on the high seas. But rulings on those cases will not affect Cubans.
The Bush Administration argues that Cubans are political refugees and that an overwhelming majority of Haitians are primarily fleeing harsh economic conditions.
The new movement from Cuba poses a challenge to Washington, which said after the Mariel boat lift it would never again allow Mr. Castro to dictate American immigration policy, and the Bush Administration has repeated that.
Coast Guard officials here say they are not equipped to contain the flow, and Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said budget restrictions limit their ability to process the newcomers.
In contrast to the Mariel boat lift, the movement this year is a trickle, not a flood, and it appears to be organized more for profit than for humanitarian purposes. Cuban exile groups here say that in interviews the arrivals describe a growing smuggling network of a character and scope that could function only with the connivance of the Cuban authorities. Indeed, the refugees say, the Government is increasingly desperate for cash since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of $5 billion a year in subsidies.
The reports about refugee smuggling are emerging as a record influx of Cubans seeks asylum in the United States. Officials say that 485 Cubans risked their lives to cross the shark-infested Straits of Florida in August and that 468 made the 90-mile journey last month. The officials say 2,203 Cuban refugees arrived last year.
 
Cross-Section of Cuban Society
 Usually the flow of rafts peaks in the summer and diminishes after Labor Day because of changes in wind patterns, sea currents and water temperatures that make the trip more difficult and dangerous. But September was a record month, and Coast Guard officials said they expected the movement to continue.
"All indications are that we don't see an end to this." Steven Kabick of the guard said. "It's a rare occasion that we don't have rafters coming in. It's become an everyday thing, and we are trying to work with what we've got."
Taken as a whole the arrivals offer a cross-section of Cuban society. The people who arrived on Monday included electricians, stevedores, mechanics, farm workers and solderers as well as an architect, a pharmacist, a fashion model, a boxer, a sculptor and a dancer. In interviews they have said they left because of increasing political repression and economic privation.
 
Released to Relatives
 A vast majority of the applicants for asylum are being processed in this isolated resort of 25,000 residents because the I.N.S. is no longer transporting them to Miami and holding them at the Krome Detention Center, as was its policy until the summer.
Now, Cubans who arrive by sea are being inspected and turned over to relatives, friends or volunteer groups that assist refugees in a remarkably compressed period of time. The reasons for the change, the I.N.S. district director in Miami, Carol D. Chasse, said, were "budgetary, and also a consideration of what the Federal Government role should properly be."
News of that streamlining, which meant that the 19 who landed on Monday were released to relatives within six hours of their arrival, has filtered back to Cuba, where there is a backlog of 100,000 requests to apply for visas at the American Interests Section.
"We are not going to get in a state of panic," Mayor Dennis Wardlow of Key West said on Monday. "If we have to we'll handle this just like Mariel. We have the volunteers to do it. There's certainly a traffic out there on the seas, but as far as the city goes, our resources have not yet been strained."
 
'Tatters and Scars'
 Cuban-Americans working for refugee-relief groups said many of the people being counted by the authorities as riding rafts recently may actually be customers of the smugglers. The relief workers said they suspected that Cuban boats were taking refugees to areas outside American territorial waters and leaving the people to float on inner tubes, certain that the Coast Guard will soon spot and rescue them.
"Normally when someone comes over in a raft, they are severely sunburned and dehydrated, with their clothing in tatters and scars or blisters all over their hands from days of paddling," said Arturo Cobo, a Bay of Pigs veteran who is coordinator of a new refugee center operated by the White Street Baptist Church here. "In the last couple of months we have begun seeing rafters who do not present those conditions."
 
Denial by Cuban Spokesman
 A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, Ariel Ricardo, denied that his Government had encouraged, tolerated or profited from any refugee smuggling. "The Cuban Government doesn't have any interest in promoting illegal immigration," he said. "If we have proof that any boat captain has committed this act, there will be a trial."
Mr. Ricardo also said his Government was even less capable than the United States to control the refugees' movement. "Look at the map and you will see that Cuba has thousands of kilometers of coast line, with hundreds of small keys and little islands," he said. "This is a relatively difficult situation to control, and people do have the right to go fishing."
 
Decrease Expected in Weeks
 A State Department official who insisted on anonymity said today that although "things are getting worse in Cuba and people in positions of authority may be more amenable to a little bribery and looking the other way," there is no reason to believe that an influx of the size of the Mariel immigration wave is likely.
In contrast to the Coast Guard spokesman's expectation, he said he expected the numbers to start going down in the coming weeks, adding, "Even if the total is even 25 percent above last year, I don't think that is a significant departure or trend."
Mr. Mestril, the passenger who arrived on Monday, said the passage cost each member of the group 5,000 pesos, payable in advance. At the official rate of exchange, that would amount to $5,000. But at black market rates, it is the equivalent of just under $150.
Mr. Mestril arrived with his stepdaughter Ana Maria, his son-in-law Angel and his 2-year-old granddaughter, Rosa. He said he planned to rejoin his wife, mother and brother in Miami.
Another passenger, Heber Frias Cutino, 16, said that he was on deck with the captain of the vessel as she left the harbor and that he heard seven or eight shots being fired at the group by security authorities. He became frightened, he said, but the captain laughed and assured him, " 'We have nothing to worry about.' "
"You mean the security people were deliberately firing over your heads?" Mr. Cobo asked.
"That's it," the youth replied.
"In other words, all of that was for show, so that if anyone asked, they could say they had tried to stop you," Mr. Cobo said.
The youth agreed.
 
Burden on Volunteer Groups
 A spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, Duke Austin, said that although it is illegal to smuggle foreigners into the United States, that fact will not affect the Cubans' chances for asylum. "It doesn't change the eligibility of the alien if he pays somebody to smuggle him here," Mr. Austin said. "Under our laws the smuggler is guilty. But you can't prosecute the alien just because his presence is the product of an illegal activity."
Because of recent changes in I.N.S. policy, the burden of processing and caring for Cuban refugees has fallen largely on volunteer agencies and Cuban-Americans in southern Florida. Those groups, however, are trying to deal with increased demands for their services as a result of Hurricane Andrew, which also led the Federal Bureau of Prisons to transfer some prisoners from damaged jails to the I.N.S. detention center in Miami.

HEADLINE: In Family-Leave Debate, A Profound Ambivalence

SERIES: The Good Mother -- Last of four articles: Searching for a Policy

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Mary Wendy Roberts, the labor commissioner of Oregon, set out in 1988 to guarantee most of the state's work force -- 47 percent of which is women -- the right to 12 weeks' unpaid leave when they give birth, adopt a child or need to care for a sick relative. Her strategy: show lawmakers that their own families or friends had a stake.
"We'd say: 'You've got grandkids. Was your daughter able to take time off?' " Ms. Roberts recalled. "The work force has changed so dramatically that people making decisions can't close themselves off from it. Someone, either in their family or among people they knew, would be coming to them and saying, 'Hey, I need that.' " 
 In Oregon, the politics of the personal worked. In other states, like Florida, with its high proportion of elderly citizens or Utah, despite having one of the highest proportions of working mothers in the nation, mandated family leave has been a nonstarter.
 
Deep Ambivalence
 The fate of this issue, debated for a decade from county office buildings to the White House, reflects Americans' deep ambivalence as they grapple with new patterns of motherhood.
As the ranks of working mothers grow, personal doubts about how best to raise small children have multiplied. This uncertainty has its parallel in the often hesitant responses of government to what many working mothers or single parents say are pressing needs.
In the Presidential campaign, image-makers for both Democrats and Republicans have stumbled while trying to figure out which maternal symbol -- often, which dimension of which political wife -- best fits the national fancy.
Meanwhile, around the country, a more fundamental debate is going on: whether the new realities of mothers and work, which reflect deep economic and social trends, warrant revising the social contract between government, businesses and families.
 
Enter Politics
 "We've never had the Federal or state support that's necessary to make the new American family work properly," said Edward F. Zigler, professor of psychology at Yale University and a leading authority on child development. Dr. Zigler and many other students of the changing family favor generous leave policies, national efforts to make higher-quality child care more widely accessible and encouragement of more flexible working arrangements for parents. But conservative opponents say measures like these are often best left to the marketplace.
Early in the Presidential campaign, Republicans presented themselves as champions of traditional family values. At the convention, speakers went out of their way to praise mothers who stayed home with the kids.
When it came to the practical question of family leave, though, President Bush, vetoed a comparatively mild bill that, in principle, would have helped some mothers do just that. The bill required only companies with 50 or more employees to give new mothers 12 weeks of unpaid leave. It was his second veto of such a measure.
Mr. Bush, who says he supports the concept of leave, said he thought it was wrong to impose another government mandate on business and proposed an alternative plan built on tax credits for cooperative employers.
Proposals like the most recent legislation have had mixed success, embraced by some counties and states and shunned by others despite the vast increase of working mothers. Nearly 60 percent of mothers with children under age 6 worked in 1990, according to the 1990 census, as did 75 percent of mothers with children age 6 to 17.
In insecure economic times, Mr. Bush may not pay much of a political price for vetoing a generally popular measure like the Family and Medical Care Leave Act. In a New York Times/CBS News poll earlier this week, 57 percent of those queried said that Mr. Bush should have signed the bill. Another 36 percent said he did the right thing by vetoing it.
"Part of the background for this has always been that family issues are outside of the government domain," said Barbara Willer, Public Affairs Director of the National Association for the Education of Young Children. "As a family member, it's your responsibility to work that out on your own. That's made it more difficult in terms of mobilizing action around this issue."
 
Women Struggle To Define Interests
 As working women drift toward a new status as an interest group, they are struggling to define where their interests lie -- when they have time to look beyond the next item on the "To Do" list. Researchers say that, while many would cherish the right to 12 weeks leave, some could not afford to go that long without a paycheck anyway. But proposals to require paid maternity leave, common in many other industrial countries with different social and economic traditions, got nowhere.
And not all mothers agree with the proposition that government ought to mandate family leave. "Family accommodation is crucial," said Merrie Spaeth, a free-market conservative and former aide to President Ronald Reagan who now has a public-relations business in Dallas. "But mandated family leave is a catastrophe to small business. It hurts women and minority-owned businesses most."
Many of those who could benefit most from the law have the least time to push for it. "The very people who are desperate for a national policy to deal with their struggles in juggling family and work responsibilities are the least able to become major advocates," said Judith Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. "They don't have the time or the energy. They're struggling to keep their heads above water."
Dr. Zigler said the sheer numbers of women in the workplace had produced new support from another quarter: older men, whose daughters are likely to be working. "It's certainly true in the business community," he said. "These people are being educated. In the case of many business leaders, their wives never worked. But daughters are turning a lot of these people around."
Dr. Zigler, who has pushed for family leave guarantees for 30 years, is puzzled that the United States remains the only industrial democracy without mandated family leave. He marvels at the resistance even to unpaid leaves, when Japan and many European counties offer full or partial salaries.
"Part of it," he said, "has been this tremendous ambivalence in the country. There is a strong, forceful group very unhappy about women in the out-of-home work force," he added, referring to conservative ministers like the Rev. Pat Robertson.
But the more visible opposition to family leave proposals has come from business, often represented by the Chamber of Commerce. Their view is that many larger employers covered in the proposals -- most of which exempt businesses with fewer than 50 employees -- already do enough, and that smaller businesses have less flexibility and often cannot bear the financial burden.
In a 1991 survey of Oregon, Rhode Island, Minnesota and Wisconsin, all states with new leave laws, the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in New York, found that 83 percent of employers had offered at least some disability leave to new mothers even before the law was passed. More than half of 583 employers surveyed found that implementation of the laws was "extremely easy" (33 percent) or "moderately easy" (19 percent). Still, up to 4 percent of working mothers surveyed in those states reported that in previous years they had lost their jobs after taking maternity leave.
Twenty-five states have enacted parental or family leave bills, but seven cover only state or public employees, according to the institute.
In the nation's capital, large majorities of both houses of Congress have passed family leave measures twice, only to see them vetoed. "In any place that gets family leave legislation passed, there's a history of it being introduced and defeated and introduced and defeated and then they eventually win," said Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work Institute.
National day-care legislation that eventually became part of the Child Care Development Block Grant in 1990 followed a similar pattern. It began with a 1971 proposal for a Child Development program vetoed by President Richard M. Nixon, who endorsed the goals but said the legislation promised "fiscal instability" and included "family-weakening implications."
When President Bush signed it into law in a compromise with Congress, the measure funneled $2.5 billion to the states over three years, designating it as aid to working parents -- in most cases low-income working parents -- to subsidize child care. Nationwide about 750,000 children, and their parents, are expected to benefit.
But it remains hard, researchers have found, for many middle-class parents to find child care that is affordable and of high quality. In many day-care centers, staff turnover is high, for example, in part because wages are barely above poverty level. Improving day care on a large scale will be costly, either for parents, government or business.
 
Assessing Models From Overseas
 It is probably no coincidence that many states first passed family leave laws in the late 1980's, when for the first time more than half of all women went back to work inside one year of giving birth.
From 1975 to 1985 the percentage of women who were working or looking for a job rose from 46 percent to 58 percent, according to Federal data, and now, women account for nearly half of all workers in the labor force.
The last time American women flooded into the work force was during World War II, when Rosie the Riveter became a role model. In 1944, 16 million women composed one-third of the nation's work force, according to Meryl Frank and Robyn Lipner of Yale's Infant Care Project. The Federal government opened 3,000 day-care centers for the 1.5 million children of these working women. In 1945, it closed 2,800 of them.
In Europe, social policy took a different route after the war, often oriented toward helping working parents stay home after the birth of a child. Sheila B. Kamerman, a professor at Columbia University's School of Social Work, notes that most European countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Sweden and Finland, now provide paid, job-protected leaves of at least five months. Some offer a year or more. Many give women the right to work part time for a limited period after the maternity leave ends.
Not all observers feel this country needs to follow Europe's lead. "I'm not sure if I like the European model for America," said Burton Y. Pines, director of the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research. "If you say we're being different from Europe, I'd say, 'Good.' We've always had a looser employee system here in America.A conservative would say family leave is between employer and employee."
 
Not All Women Press for Leave
 Women themselves are not all marching shoulder to shoulder with family leave banners waving. When Dade County, the only jurisdiction in Florida with a family leave ordinance, approved the measure -- requiring businesses with 50 or more employees to offer 12 weeks' unpaid leave, but exempting higher-paid and executive employees -- the only woman on the nine-member county board cast the only "nay" vote.
In the few months since the Dade County ordinance took effect, only three complaints have been filed, said Toni Margulies-Eisner, Chairwoman of Dade County's Equal Opportunity Board. Ms. Margulies-Eisner said she believed this is a sign the ordinance is working.
To some extent, lobbyists for women's groups have taken up family issues like these.
But Ms. Margulies-Eisner said she was not sure how family leave fits in the priorities lists of some women's groups. "I would hope that women as mothers -- as opposed to feminists -- could be a rallying point," she said. "But we trip over our own best interests for stupid reasons. We ask 'Is it a politically correct thing to do? Is it a feminist activity? Am I aligning myself with the right people?' "
Judith Lichtman of the Women's Legal Defense Fund said: "Women understand that this affects them and that they deserve family leave. But we now have to translate that into the feeling that yes, we not only need it and deserve it -- but we can get it, if we hold politicians accountable."

HEADLINE: Bean Nostalgia

 BODY:
To The Living Section:
Eben Shapiro's article on the thrifty bean, "Food Industry Views the Thrifty Bean With New Admiration" [Sept. 2], evoked a rush of nostalgia for my childhood in North Carolina during the Great Depression. 
 My father was lucky to be employed during those bleak years. His job as a chauffeur and general handyman for a wealthy family consisted of a six-and-a-half-day, 72-hour-plus week for which he was paid the munificent sum of $15. Since dried beans cost about 5 cents a pound, it is easy to see why they appeared on our dinner table with great frequency.
My mother, after removing the small rocks which were found in all beans in those days, would cover them with water, add a slab of fat back (salt pork to you Northerners), salt and pepper and let them simmer for hours on a wood-burning stove. We ate a variety of beans, including pintos, white beans (navy beans), butter beans (dried limas) and black-eyed peas. I discovered black beans when I came to New York, and they are now my favorites.
I occasionally cook a pot of beans, but I am a bit more adventurous than was my mother. First, I combine a couple of ham hocks with chopped onion and garlic, a couple of bay leaves and thyme. This is simmered until the meat falls off the bone. I remove the small amount of lean meat from the hocks and discard the rest. The lean is shopped coarsely and set aside. After de-fatting the broth, I add the beans (never pre-soaked) and simmer until done. The cooking time depends on how soft you like your beans. When the beans are done, I add the chopped lean meat and let them sit for several minutes to warm the meat. They are now ready to eat with homemade biscuits or corn bread and a glass of cold beer.
A more exotic taste can be created by adding other herbs and spices to your taste. I like to add cumin, coriander, cardamom and turmeric. If the idea of cooking from scratch seems too forbidding, don't despair. Beans can be bought in cans and heated up with any additions one wishes to make. Since one advantage of dried beans is their economy, I would avoid those fancy packages. Why pay $3.40 for a 9-ounce box (37 cents an ounce) when they can be bought for 80 cents a pound (5 cents an ounce)? I don't keep Basmati rice on hand, but I am sure it would be cheaper to buy separately. I still have dried chili peppers I bought over a year ago. I don't remember what I paid for them, but it couldn't have been more than $1.50 and they are still going strong.
Incidentally, cooking from scratch is not as time-consuming as it seems. Practically no attention is required. Let them simmer over low heat, checking occasionally to see if more water should be added.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Independent;
Perot Charts Poor Economy in 30-Minute TV Talk

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Using an unusual purchase of 30 minutes of television time, Ross Perot took viewers on a graphic tour of America's faltering economy tonight and asked them to choose a President "who will do it, not just talk about it."
Armed with more than two dozen charts and a metal pointer, Mr. Perot used virtually his entire presentation to dissect the causes of the recession. The independent Presidential candidate heaped scorn on both political parties, contended that government had lost touch with the people, and blamed short-sighted policies for the country's indebtedness. 
 "We got into trickle-down economics and it didn't trickle," Mr. Perot said.
Throughout the taped presentation, the camera never veered from Mr. Perot, who was seated at a desk backed by a simple bookcase. While conventional campaign advertisements often use poignant visuals or indignant charges to capture attention, Mr. Perot relied on his most dependable political asset -- his gift for plain talk and homespun anecdotes.
 
Solution to Come Later
 Government leaders, he said, "assume we are major dumb." In the 1980's, "we were just like little boys playing with money," he said.
At one point, Mr. Perot said that his "wonderful wife came to bed crying" one night after watching a television report about a steelworker who had lost his job.
Mr. Perot did not discuss his proposed solutions to the country's economic problems, saying he would do that in later presentations. He also encouraged viewers to read his best-selling book, "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country," (Hyperion) which prescribes a number of harsh deficit-reduction measures.
Mr. Perot's speech, titled "Jobs, Debt and the Washington Mess," appeared from 8 to 8:30 P.M. Eastern Time on CBS, immediately before the opening game of the National League pennant series. It pre-empted "Rescue 911" in most television markets.
The lengthy speech was the first episode in a planned series of Perot television presentations. Since Mr. Perot entered the Presidential race last Thursday, after announcing in July that he would not be a candidate, the public has seen him only on television.
With $380,000 out of his own deep pockets, the Texas billionaire bought 30 minutes of prime time so he could deliver his message without the filter of journalistic analysis.
Presumably to prevent reporters from interpreting Mr. Perot's words before they were heard by the public, Perot campaign officials refused to screen the presentation in advance. They did, however, release a two-minute excerpt to television networks -- just enough to let the networks promote the program on their evening news shows but not enough to enable an advance critique.
Mr. Perot has bought 30 minutes of time on ABC on Friday night at a cost of $620,000 to broadcast a second program. Campaign aides said today that he would begin airing 30-second and 60-second advertisements on Thursday.
All the advertising is being produced by the 270 Group, a Dallas agency formed to run Mr. Perot's media campaign. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Temerlin McClain, a prominent Irving, Tex., advertising company with clients ranging from American Air Lines to J. C. Penney. Dennis D. McClain, the company's president, said the group now includes about 22 executives, most from Dallas but some from Los Angeles.
Mr. Perot and his running mate, James B. Stockdale, also plan to participate in a series of four Presidential and Vice Presidential debates that begin on Sunday. The Perot campaign today formally accepted an invitation from the Bush-Quayle and Clinton-Gore campaigns to join the debates.
 
Nearly Unprecedented
 Experts on political advertising said it was virtually unprecedented for a Presidential candidate to spend 30 minutes of paid television time speaking directly into the camera. Some questioned whether many viewers had reached for the remote control after the first few minutes of Mr. Perot's speech, particularly given his low ratings in recent polls.
Darrell West, a political scientist at Brown University, predicted that an audience accustomed to conflict and action would find Mr. Perot's format boring. "They're going to tune out," he said.
Although it may seem counterintuitive in the context of conventional politics, the Perot campaign may have wanted to convey precisely that sober image. Like former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts in this year's Democratic primaries and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona in 1988, Mr. Perot fancies himself as an Un-candidate, an outsider committed to prescribing bitter medicine in an unadorned package.
In his presentation, Mr. Perot flipped through one chart after the next, quantifying everything from the increase in the national debt to patterns of Federal spending to international gasoline prices. As he described each trend, Mr. Perot veritably sneered in disgust.
"We used to have the world's greatest economic engine," he said. "We let it slip away and with it went millions of jobs and taxpayers.
 
Front-Runners Not Mentioned
 By focusing on the country's economic ills, Mr. Perot may well have done Gov. Bill Clinton's bidding. But he never mentioned either President Bush or Mr. Clinton by name, choosing instead to emphasize the gridlock between the Republican President and the Democratic Congress.
"The American people are good," he said. "And yet over time we have created a country that's a mess. We have a situation in which our President blames Congress, Congress blames the President, the Democrats and Republicans blame each other. Nobody steps up to the plate and accepts responsibility for anything."
Mr. Perot also denounced the practice of government officials profiting from their political connections by becoming lobbyists, particularly for foreign countries. Although Mr. Perot did not mention names, several of President Bush's top campaign aides are lobbyists whose companies have contracts with foreign countries.
"This is like a general switching armies in the middle of a war," Mr. Perot said. "They should come to serve and go home, not cash in."

HEADLINE: Show and Tell, Perot-Style

 BODY:
Ross Perot demolished his own credibility as the candidate of candor. After his tawdry exit in July and his unconvincing reappearance in October, only one voter in a hundred thinks he has any chance to win, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. Seven in 10 voters think he should never have returned to the race.
On policy questions, however, voters think better of him. When asked which candidate was tough enough to make unpopular decisions to reduce the Federal deficit, voters put Mr. Perot first. Therein lies Mr. Perot's chance to turn his quixotic adventure into a useful exercise. 
 In fact, he started last night in a half-hour campaign telecast full of charts and graphs that mercilessly indicted the Bush Administration's economic policies. Indictment, however, is the easy part. Mr. Perot could now salvage his reputation by offering his ideas for change -- while forcing President Bush and Governor Clinton to declare and defend theirs.
So far, Mr. Perot has not put his economic ideas to a true political test. They remain between the covers of a little book called "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country." He likes to wave the book at TV audiences, as though show and tell could create policy by osmosis.
How good is his program? The first fact to grasp is that it's a deficit-reduction strategy, not a coherent policy for long-term growth. "Our first priority," he says, "is to balance the budget." That's clear, decisive and wrong. The Government's first priority is to promote growth through higher private and public investment.
True, the deficit is staggeringly large, the $4 trillion national debt a disgraceful burden. And reducing the deficit can encourage productive private investment. But if deficit reduction goes too far and too fast, and at the expense of public investment, it could have disastrous effects.
Mr. Perot wants to remove the deficit in five years. To that end, he calls for annual tax increases of $85 billion or so and annual spending cuts of $100 billion -- including an across-the-board 15 percent cut in discretionary Federal programs.
Consider just that 15 percent cut. It could deal a paralyzing blow to a wide range of essential activities -- air-traffic control, meat inspection, the F.B.I. Mr. Perot offers no priorities, nor any analysis of the consequences. And he scarcely mentions the need for public investment in programs like mass transit, worker training and education -- the core of Mr. Clinton's strategy.
Mr. Perot proposes several first-rate ideas. He would trim the defense budget more expeditiously than Mr. Bush. He would limit employers' deductions for health-care insurance premiums -- a revenue-raising idea that would also help control runaway medical costs. He would impose a hefty gas tax, another revenue-raiser that also happens to be excellent environmental policy.
Scaled back and phased in with recovery, Mr. Perot's show-and-tell program could become a realistic approach to the deficit. If linked to a vision, like Mr. Clinton's, for useful public investment, it could be a program worth fighting for.

HEADLINE: How to Keep Businesses Without Incentives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is a good thing that New York City and New York State did not, as your Sept. 26 report states, choose to pay more than $50,000 per job in tax benefits to keep First Chicago Corporation in the city.
Inducing a company to remain in business in New York City only makes the cost of doing business here higher for every other taxpayer. As you report, the city offered Prudential Securities $20,000 per job in August, and the company took it. The practice of subsidizing some profitable companies encourages all nonsubsidized businesses to look outside the city for a better deal. Only last week, New York City lost CARE. 
 As president of a company that owns and manages 2 million square feet of real estate in New York City, I know that tax incentives only help the few economically powerful companies and create ill will with every other taxpaying business that has not chosen to leave. I know my tenants are leaving, and we all know why.
Steven Craig, in articles in The City Journal, published quarterly by the Manhattan Institute, shows that New York City and State governments spend much more per capita than any other municipality or state in the country; for example, $5,473 in New York versus $4,090 in California, the next highest. Stephen Kagann shows in an article in the autumn City Journal how the city and state tax burden went from 8.3 percent in 1951 to 17.1 percent today, while the national average is 9.5 percent. New York City taxes alone rose from 2.4 percent to 7.6 percent -- that's more than triple.
These sums reflect not only social services, but also the cost of selective tax incentives.
The city for decades has tried to do more for the less fortunate than any other political jurisdiction in the country. The cost of this good will and noble objective is clearly too high for businesses that have to compete in a world market. The city needs an economic program that lowers taxes and encourages business to locate and stay in New York.
Let's get back to basics: good municipal services that allow the city's economy to thrive. Less is more for all.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shipyards Cost Too Much

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The United States shipbuilding industry is a sad example of an American industry that has failed to remain internationally competitive. United States yards were unable to compete in the worldwide shipbuilding surge of the 1970's, and now as the world prepares to spend billions on a new generation of double-hull tankers and on renewing commercial cargo fleets, United States yards are preoccupied seeking a law to bar ships built in subsidized foreign yards from trading in United States ports until the shipowners repay the subsidies.
Chevron Shipping is among the companies building ships in foreign yards. We have a major fleet-renewal program and would consider placing contracts with United States shipyards if we could obtain ships of equivalent quality at prices comparable to those offered by foreign yards. However, each year we compare United States and foreign construction costs, and consistently find that United States prices are about double overseas prices for similar vessels. 
 Last May, at the request of Congress, the International Trade Commission reported on the economic effects of the proposed law. The report found that eliminating the subsidies would increase prices of foreign-built ships less than 10 percent. The commission also found domestic yards inefficient, with quotations for commercial vessels averaging 96 percent more than those by foreign yards for similar vessels. United States yards have not produced a single commercial ship for a non-United States owner trading internationally since 1960, and the proposed law would not affect the ability of our yards to compete. The fundamental cause of this malaise, particularly in larger yards, is a lethargy resulting from years of relying on Navy ship construction and repair work, plus depending on the protection of the Jones Act, which bars foreign-built ships from trading between United States ports.
United States yards should stop pacing the halls of Congress, whining for protective legislation. Eliminating foreign subsidies will not restore the competitiveness of United States yards. United States yards must assess their deficiencies and improve product quality and productivity. We would like to see our yards back in the race and competing internationally, but Government intervention is not the answer.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Debates;
CANDIDATES TRAIN FOR A KEY DEBATE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Nearing what advisers concede is his best remaining chance to pull close to Gov. Bill Clinton, President Bush has summoned three of his party's most caustic and quick-witted figures to help prepare for Sunday's Presidential debate against Mr. Clinton and Ross Perot.
Aides said today that the President planned to stage a mock debate on Saturday against Republican stand-ins for his two rivals, with his budget director, Richard G. Darman, playing the part of Mr. Clinton and his onetime chief of staff, John H. Sununu, masquerading as Mr. Perot. 
 And Roger Ailes, a New York media expert who helped execute the blistering attacks that propelled Mr. Bush to victory over Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, will critique the President's performance, the aides said.
 
A Shot for Clinton
 Meanwhile, in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Clinton received an allergy shot and rested his voice today after a recurrence of the hoarseness that hindered his stump speaking last winter and now threatens to crimp his debating style. Aides said he, like Mr. Bush, was studying briefing books and working on oratorical weak spots like a well-known tendency toward wordiness.
Both camps also pushed the view that Ross Perot's presence will serve largely as a sideshow to the match between the two political parties' candidates. But neither was willing to dismiss the importance of that sideshow, or even to predict whether it would help the Democrats or the Republicans.
Mr. Perot stayed out of sight today, and aides said he was also readying himself for the debates.
"He is studying feverishly," said Orson Swindle, the executive director of United We Stand, America, Mr. Perot's political organization.
On both the Democratic and Republican sides, aides and strategists earnestly turned today to the traditional task of shaping the expectations for the debate. That is, they followed the hoary strategy of expressing confidence that their man would do well, while at the same time arguing that their fellow was a bit of an underdog and therefore even an average performance would rank as a win.
 
Drawing to Victory?
 "All we need to do is have a draw in the debate and we win," said one senior Clinton adviser. "We have to stand next to Bush and show that we are a contender and not make any major errors."
Another adviser added, "I don't think we have to crush anybody."
Said one ranking Bush aide: "I don't think this first debate is the be-all and end-all of the election. We've got four chances to get our message out there in the next week. It's the whole that counts."
Mr. Clinton will spend most of the next few days in Kansas City, Mo., preparing for the debate, while Mr. Bush planned to begin full-time preparations on Friday at the White House.
The Clinton campaign's communications director, George Stephanopoulos, said Mr. Clinton would hammer away at two points on Sunday: "Make sure people understand Governor Clinton's plans for the country. Make sure they understand the truth about the Bush record on the economy."
The Bush campaign's political director, Mary Matalin, said that suited Mr. Bush fine.
"The President needs to talk about what's on his economic agenda," she said. "And if people actually watch what each of these three guys say, we win. Because I know when it's explained, they prefer our policies."
Bush and Clinton aides alike called it probable that Mr. Perot would use the forum to berate Mr. Bush's economic policies more than to criticize Mr. Clinton, and some Bush advisers expressed concern today that the Sunday session would devolve into a steady "pinging on the President," as one put it.
But that same senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also claimed to see a potential upside in Mr. Perot's appearance: "Having the three of them on the same stage, and with Perot as strange as he is, it does sort of underscore who's President," he said.
 
Stealing Rival's Thunder
 It was clear that Mr. Bush's campaign is looking hard for upsides these days, and that the three Presidential debates and the one Vice-Presidential session are being viewed almost as last-grasp opportunities to steal the momentum of the race away from Mr. Clinton.
"If he lands punches on two of three nights, we're back in the game," said a Republican strategist who is advising the Bush campaign. "Obviously, we need a shift of about eight points out of the debates if we're going to be competitive."
A senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said: "Sunday is his best shot at breaking through. If Bush doesn't open up an avenue that Quayle can pick up on Tuesday and that we can pursue again on Thursday, we've got trouble."
The official was referring to the second scheduled Presidential debate, on Thursday, and to Tuesday's planned debate between Vice President Quayle, Mr. Clinton's running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, and retired Vice Adm. James B. Stockdale, the former Vietnam prisoner of war who is Mr. Perot's choice for Vice President.
Mr. Bush's advisers suggested their boss's debate preparation had been desultory so far. The President has met once or twice for briefings with top policy and political aides, including his chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d; Mr. Baker's chief policy adviser, Robert Zoellick; the campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, and Mr. Darman, the budget director. His studies beyond that have been limited to reading papers in spare time, aides said.
Aides declined to say who chose Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu for the President's mock debate opponents. But they noted that Mr. Darman took a similar role in 1988, playing Mr. Dukakis in practice rounds. And they said that Mr. Sununu volunteered for the Perot role.
The two are unlikely to go easy on the President. Both are identified in countless newspaper articles with the adjectives "brainy" and "imperious," and stories of their scorched-earth management styles are legendary in Washington.
For its own practice debate, the Clinton campaign has recruited Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer, to play the role of George Bush and Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, to stand in for Mr. Perot.
Two other lawyers are supervising the debate preparations for Mr. Clinton. They are Thomas Donilon, who worked for Mr. Dukakis in 1988, and Victoria Raad, who helped manage Mr. Clinton's Vice Presidential selection process this summer.
Unlike his rivals, Mr. Perot will limit his debate preparation to reading, not practicing with stand-ins for his opponents, Mr. Swindle said. "He's doing it without spin doctors, without preparation," he said. "He did not go home to rest his voice like Mr. Clinton. He's not being rehearsed by mock Bill Clinton and George Bushes."
In Mr. Gore's practice rounds for Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Representative Dennis E. Eckart of Ohio will stand in for Vice President Dan Quayle, Clinton campaign officials said.
Mr. Quayle is asking Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire to play Mr. Gore, and Kenneth Adelman, an arms-control negotiator in the Reagan Administration, to stand in for Mr. Stockdale.
Late today, officials in the campaigns were said to be close to agreeing on a panel of journalists to ask questions at Sunday's debate, a process one aide wearily complained had become "more elaborate than selecting a pope."
"They submit a list. We submit a list. They submit a list. We submit a list. We find common names and they keep getting whittled down until you get the panelists," that aide said.

HEADLINE: Saudi Clergymen Seek Tighter Islamic Rule

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 7

 BODY:
For the second time in two years a large group of militant fundamentalist clergymen in Saudi Arabia has submitted a petition to King Fahd criticizing virtually every aspect of domestic and foreign policy in the kingdom and demanding a more rigorous application of Islamic law in a country that already ranks as one of the world's most conservative Muslim societies.
The 46-page document was delivered to the Saudi Government's senior religious leader, Sheik Abdelaziz Bin Baz, who administers the kingdom's religious affairs. It demanded revision of the nation's defense and foreign policies and the prohibition of dealings with Western financial and cultural institutions, such as banks and television and entertainment companies. 
 The document, signed by 107 religious officials from various Government-financed Muslim universities and institutions around the kingdom, denounced the Government's "containment" of religious activities and the arrests of some religious firebrands who have made inflammatory speeches at Friday prayers.
It also severely criticized Saudi Arabia's payments, totaling $26 billion, to Iraq during its war against Iran from 1980 to 1988 and to other "non-Islamic governments," including Syria, Russia, Jordan, Algeria and Egypt. It asked the King to refrain from inviting foreign "atheist" troops to defend Saudi Arabia ever again, as he did in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait.
The petition, a copy of which was faxed to The New York Times by a militant Islamic organization, was bolder and more defiant than a similar document drafted in May 1991 by some of the same people, and contained more than twice as many signatures.
The official press agency denounced the petition as "misguided" and "divisive," full of errors and aimed at "sowing confusion" while "overlooking the good deeds of Government."
Several Saudi liberals dismissed the document as a manifestation of the insecurity of Islamic militants about the fast pace of modernization in Saudi Arabia. They said it was probably prompted by the King's decision in February to establish a 60-member consultative council.
The memorandum demands that religious programming, already commanding well over 50 percent of the time and space available on radio and television and most newspapers, be increased further. It calls on the King to direct Saudi Government television to stop running programs that "glorify decadent Western life styles."
The Saudi ruling establishment, the royal princes and businessmen who favor a liberal economic policy and steady modernization of political and social institutions, has run into increasing resistance from religious militants. The religious right has opposed Middle East peace talks, which the King supports, and the Saudi alliance with the United States.
 
Religious Censorship Sought
 The petitioners asked that Muslim religious scholars be allowed to vastly expand their freedom of expression "on any subject they see fit" without seeking approval from elder religious leaders affiliated with the Government. It also sought permission for the fundamentalists to set up their own privately financed press and broadcast companies and a supreme consultative council of religious figures to review all written and broadcast material before it is presented to the public.
The document sharply criticizes waste in military spending, saying that there is a wide discrepancy between the amounts spent on purchasing arms and expertise in the past 20 years, which exceed $150 billion, and the size and power of the Saudi Army which, it said, is too weak to defend the country against aggressors.
It also criticizes the failure of the Saudi military to render assistance to fellow Muslims "or in fighting the Jews," in an allusion to Bosnia and Israel. The petition asked for the creation of an army of a half a million Saudis (in a country with a population of about 10 million), the establishment of compulsory military service and the creation of a reserve corps "as is the case with the Jewish enemy."

HEADLINE: U.S. Keeps Eye on Haiti, but Action Is Scant

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 7

 BODY:
United States diplomats have seemed to be at pains recently to demonstrate that they remain hard at work seeking the restoration of Haiti's first elected President.
Washington's representative at the Organization of American States, Luigi R. Einaudi, angrily told a meeting of that body's permanent council at the beginning of the month that reports that the United States had softened its stance toward Haiti's military-backed Government were "flat lies." Rumors of an impending end to United States economic sanctions were equally baseless, he said. 
 The White House went so far as to issue a statement last week declaring that Haiti's failure to return to democratic rule threatened the security of the United States.
But if Washington was struggling to maintain an air of credibility for the stalled efforts to restore democracy in Haiti, it was also struggling to contain its anger toward the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and what diplomats describe as his tendency toward ingratitude.
Even as they defended Washington's efforts on Father Aristide's behalf, these officials have testily denounced assertions by advisers to Father Aristide that the United States masterminded the coup that unseated him a year ago. The officials have also protested statements by Father Aristide urging his supporters not to support President Bush in the elections.
"Not only do we not see him doing anything constructive, but he is convinced that Clinton will win and that will change everything for him, so he just waits," one official said.
If public signs of exasperation are new, the frictions that have fed a profound ambivalence between the Haitian leader and policy makers in Washington have been mounting for months.
When Washington thought it had helped to broker an agreement that would have returned Father Aristide to power last February in exchange for a general amnesty for members of Haiti's Army, the populist priest went on United States television to restate his determination that the military leadership be punished. The deal collapsed.
Since then, Washington has played an increasingly passive role, deferring to the Organization of American States even though many United States officials agree that there is only a remote likelihood that the group's diplomatic efforts, backed by a porous embargo against Haiti, will eventually lead to Father Aristide's return.
A similar conclusion has led critics of American policy to urge the United States to again take a front-line role in the country's crisis. Many Haitians recall that in January 1990, the Haitian military ruler, Gen. Prosper Avril, was peacefully coaxed into exile by the Pentagon and the United States Ambassador, Alvin P. Adams Jr.
But given the perceived antipathy in Washington toward Father Aristide, few say they expect such energetic efforts on his behalf.
 
'A Sad Commentary'
 "Once the Bush Administration pushed the refugee issue off the table, they felt they had little incentive to do anything much for Aristide," said Michael Barnes, a former United States Congressman who now advises the Haitian leader, referring to the large flow of boat people out of Haiti earlier this year. "That is a sad commentary on their commitment to democracy in the hemisphere."
But even defenders of Father Aristide acknowledge that he has repeatedly crippled his own cause.
Although he would need Security Council approval for a large United Nations role in his country, Father Aristide recently visited Taiwan, antagonizing China at a critical moment. Similarly, many observers said his speech before the United Nations last week, in which he cried "Democracy or death!" and repeated his call for punishment of the military leadership, only reinforced a view of him as an inflexible and vindictive crusader.
"If things continues like this with him, I don't see how he'll ever convince the people he needs to work for his return," said a French-speaking diplomat who follows Haitian affairs closely. "We have an expression that says, 'Any clumsier and you die.' "

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN WATCH;
Campaigns Do Their Best to Beat, Not Meet, Press

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Television reporters can be so annoying! And these days, who needs them?
For under $500,000, a Presidential candidate can now buy his own program. If that is out of reach, he can appear on "Larry King Live" to answer questions from his mom. And if worst comes to worst, he can beat the press with his running mate on "Donahue." 
 All season long, the Presidential candidates have been avoiding traditional political programs like CBS's "Face the Nation" or ABC's "This Week" in favor of what might be called less-challenging formats. If the hosts of the more traditional programs believed that in the final phase of the campaign the candidates would return to the fold, it has become apparent that the belief was misplaced.
In the last week, President Bush has appeared twice with Larry King, but not once with the likes of David Brinkley or Sam Donaldson. Gov. Bill Clinton has appeared once with Mr. King and once with Phil Donahue. And Ross Perot has appeared all by himself.
In the contest to reach the largest number of potential voters with the least amount of interference from reporters, Mr. Perot was the week's obvious winner. His half-hour program Tuesday night, which cost $380,000 and featured only him, attracted a surprisingly wide audience, the second largest in its time slot, beating out NBC's "Quantum Leap."
With its hand-held graphs and its choppy cuts, Mr. Perot's program had all the vitality of a low-budget corporate training film. But it made curiously compelling viewing nevertheless.
Facing directly into the camera, Mr. Perot chronicled what he called the decline and potential fall of the American economy, keeping up a steady stream of hortatives as he went along. "Let's just raise the hood and go to work!" he said. "Let's just link arms and go do it!"
When it came to outlining solutions, he came up short -- Out of time! But he promised to get to those in the next episode.
While the President did not quite manage to avoid the press altogether, he did do the next best thing: he put in two appearances with the ever-gracious Mr. King.
On Sunday night, Mr. Bush was on a special edition of Mr. King's show taped at the White House. Introducing the President, Mr. King made it clear that he did not intend to ask any awkward questions.
"We're broadcasting from a very special place that not many Americans get to see," he said. "We are in the east sitting hall of the White House residence, upstairs in the first family's private quarters, right next-door to the Lincoln bedroom. And we've been invited by the current occupants to spend the next hour with them, and it's our great pleasure to be here."
Among the more penetrating questions Mr. King asked the President were: Did think he was getting a "bum rap?" (Yes, he did.) And were his advertisements against Mr. Clinton misleading? ("Phooey!" he said.)
Mr. Clinton, too, knows a good thing when he sees it, and he could be seen chatting it up with Mr. King on Monday night, then answering telephone calls from the audience. The second call came from Las Vegas, Nev. It was Virginia Kelley, Mr. Clinton's mother.
"I want to say 'Hello' to my son," she said.
"Hi, Mother!" Governor Clinton said. "What are you doing there?"
"I'm here with Governor Bob Miller and a world of Clinton supporters," she said. "And I want to thank you very much for this opportunity. Thank you, Larry."
On Tuesday, the Governor and his running mate, Senator Al Gore, made what passes this election year for a bold move and appeared live with Mr. Donahue. Throughout the program, Mr. Donahue tried to provoke the Democratic candidates by asking a series of confrontational questions. At one point he accused Mr. Clinton of ducking his more straight-laced colleagues in the "mainstream" press.
"You're not available to the press as much as you'd think a guy with a 47-to-35 lead would be," he said. "You have not been on 'Meet the Press.' You've not been on 'Face the Nation.' You've not been on 'This Week' with David Brinkley. For a guy this far ahead, you seem to be walking a wide circle around the mainstream people."
Mr. Clinton refused to rise to the bait.
"If you'll forgive me," he said, "I think going on a bus tour to Florida is more mainstream than going on 'Meet the Press' or 'Face the Nation.' " And with that, the audience gave a lusty cheer.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Perot Ready to Start Using Short TV Commercials

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Ross Perot will begin broadcasting three sober 60-second advertisements on Thursday in an effort to focus attention on the economic challenges posed by joblessness and the national debt.
Mr. Perot does not appear in any of the three commercials. Nor do they mention either of his opponents, President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton. Only at the end of the advertisements is Mr. Perot's name even mentioned. 
 As with a 30-minute presentation televised by Mr. Perot on Tuesday night, the commercials focus on the country's economic problems but do not mention his austere proposals for solving them. Those prescriptions, including higher tax rates and deep cuts in Federal entitlements, may be the subject of a second 30-minute program to be shown on Friday night, Perot aides said.
The new 60-second commercials will be shown on seven cable channels, including CNN and ESPN, during both daytime and prime time from Thursday to Sunday, said Sharon Holman, Mr. Perot's press secretary. She said they also would run on network television at some point. She would not disclose how much the campaign would spend to buy the broadcast time.
Produced by a Dallas-based advertising consortium formed to run Mr. Perot's media campaign, the advertisements are simple but sophisticated. In each one, white-lettered text rolls up the screen over an appropriate backdrop as the words are spoken by a deep, somber voice.
Perhaps the most effective is titled "Red Flag." Against the backdrop of a rippling red flag and the sound of an almost funereal drumroll, the text reads: "While the Cold War is ending another war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams."
A second spot shows the faces of children fading into each other in black and white. "What would they say to us if they knew that by the year 2000, we will have left them with a national debt of $8 trillion?" the narrator asks.
The third advertisement shows the face and sound of a ticking watch. "It is a time when the threat of unemployment is greater than the threat of war," the narrator says. "It is a time when the national debt demands as much attention as the national security."
Each of the three commercials explains that voters have the chance, in the words of the red flag spot, to vote for "a candidate who is not a business-as-usual politician, but a business leader with the know-how to expand the tax base, reduce the national debt and restore the meaning of 'Made in the U.S.A.' The issue is leadership. The candidate is Ross Perot."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Play Now, Fly Later

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IF British Airways will not play fair at home, should it be allowed to buy its way into the American game? Economists, in contrast to politicians, generally put consumers' interests ahead of producers'. And in the case of the proposed alliance between the high-flying British carrier and money-hemorrhaging (and now strike-bound) USAir, it requires tortured logic to construct a story in which American travelers would not come out ahead from the added competition.
But it may yet be possible to have it both ways. If pushed hard enough by Washington, economists predict that Britain will open its own skies in return for broader horizons in America. 
 USAir badly needs capital, full-fare passengers and a way to shake off its image as the carrier of choice to Appalachia. For its part, British Airways wants an American affiliate to feed its lucrative, cartel-controlled trans-Atlantic routes and, perhaps later on, a full-fledged American subsidiary.
But American law, like that of most other countries, prohibits foreign control of domestic airlines. So the two carriers worked out a deal that gives the United States Transportation Department a fig leaf to approve the near-acquisition of USAir, if it is so inclined.
For $750 million, USAir would sell just a minority interest to British Airways. But the two carriers would coordinate their American and trans-Atlantic operations, with British Air having enough say to erase any doubts about who was really running the shop. The two would also share flight codes in the travel agents' reservation systems, allowing them to sell a single ticket from anywhere USAir flies to anywhere British Airways goes.
But there is more to the deal than a wad of cash for USAir, a speculative investment for British Airways and a marketing gimmick for both. The dream, notes Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, is "seamless service to Europe and parts beyond," with synchronized schedules, Euro-chic service and perhaps even the Union Jack logo on USAir tails.
More Americans would have better airline service at home and abroad. Both carriers would still rely heavily on aircraft made in America. USAir flights would still be piloted and serviced by American workers. What is not to like?
Plenty, if you are an American airline executive who is itching to fly from city to city within Europe and cannot buy the right for all the marks in the Bundesbank. Led by Robert L. Crandall, the fire-breathing chairman of American Airlines, the big American carriers are demanding open skies abroad as British Airways' dowry in the proposed marriage to USAir.
Mr. Stelzer notes that the Crandall demand cannot possibly be met since Britain has no right to negotiate on the European Community's behalf. He would ask for more air access to and within Britain, but believes that the British Air deal is worth blessing, even if the concession proves to be unilateral. And negotiating from this perspective, he acknowledged, would be "like pointing a gun at your foot and threatening to shoot."
But other economists believe tough bargaining is the order of the day. Daniel Kasper at the Harbridge House consulting firm in Boston thinks "the risk is not large" that the British would turn Washington down flat on proposals to give American carriers a better toehold in Britain: British Airways has too much to lose. And since USAir admits there is no immediate threat to its survival if the deal falls through, a hard line from Washington would be credible.
Michael Levine, an executive vice president of Northwest Airlines, notes that more is at stake than a few more gates at London's Heathrow Airport or landing rights at a few more British cities. If Washington could work out a mutually attractive bargain in which British Air gained access to the huge domestic American market, he reasons that Air France, Lufthansa and Alitalia would no longer be able to take much comfort in Fortress Europe. Then they, too, would have strong incentives to support a grand bargain that opened both the American and European air markets to trans-Atlantic rivals.
Consider, too, the wheels within the negotiating wheels. British Airways may not relish the prospect of stiffer competition at home from Delta, American and United. But British concessions now would set a precedent for the Continent -- one that served British Airways' perceived long-term interest in unrestrained competition within Europe. "It's a win-win situation," concluded Mr. Kasper.
USAir is pressing for pre-election approval by the Bush Administration, which has veered from a hard line on foreign airline investment to a very soft one. But with high-volume opposition coming from American and Delta, which both have big payrolls in tightly contested Texas, the decision will probably be put off. And no matter who wins in November, the betting now is that Britain will have to give something to get what it wants.

HEADLINE: A Washington District That's a World Apart

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Like the wrong side of the tracks, the east side of the Anacostia River is viewed by many Washingtonians as a forbidding, fearsome place, a source of the drugs and crime that plague this city, the ghetto largely responsible for making Washington the murder capital of America.
A freeway bridge from downtown spans the river to the eastern bank where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, a street whose gutted storefronts, trash-strewn lots and groups of men and women clustered aimlessly on corners seem to confirm an outsider's worst fears. Those signs of hopelessness, the economic blight behind it all, and the violence and crime distress many of the people who live amid it, too. But the river divides the city psychologically as well as physically, often forming a barrier to understanding between those living across from each other.
 
Barry Vote Mystified Many
 The fact that residents in this area voted overwhelmingly in the Sept. 15 primary for former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., the convicted drug abuser and a pariah to many Washingtonians, to represent them on the City Council, a choice that mystified many people elsewhere in the capital and around the country.
On paper, the hilly, wedge-shaped neighborhood that voted for him, an area designated Ward 8 and consisting of the Anacostia and Congress Heights neighborhoods, is strikingly similar to Harlem, the Crenshaw area of South-Central Los Angeles or any one of several other big-city ghettos. Like them, Ward 8 is more than 80 percent black and the median family income is $16,692.
Nationally, the Census Bureau reported that in 1989 the median household income for blacks was $19,758 and for whites it was $31,435.
In Ward 8, over a third of the population is under 18 years old and only 30 percent of the area's students graduate from high school. Only about 13 percent of the houses are owned by the people living in them. The scarcity of jobs, affordable housing and social services are painfully apparent.
 
Beauty Beyond Destruction
 People from the other parts of town often make it a rule never to go east of the Anacostia River. So few residents outside Ward 8 realize that beyond its bleak thoroughfares, the crack houses and abandoned public housing projects are many leafy avenues, neat brick and stucco houses, flowering gardens and porch swings. Residents of Ward 8 know that their beautiful riverfront park is almost private, and that a bluff above the water is the best spot in town for watching fireworks on the Fourth of July.
In scores of interviews after the election, people here said frustration, anger and a feeling that the rest of Washington was ignoring and neglecting their economic and social problems drove them to seek radical change. Many of those said they believed their best hope for that was in the flamboyant and forceful leadership style of Mr. Barry, who was released from prison four months ago after being convicted of cocaine possession when he was in his 12th year as Mayor.
"Politicians don't want to come to this part of town, to see what's going on here," said Roy Easterling, a 26-year-old sidewalk T-shirt vendor, explaining his vote for Mr. Barry.
Mr. Easterling, who was born in Ward 8, went to the area's only high school, and still lives with his mother in his childhood home. He said he was trying to save money to open his own neighborhood store. It did not bother him that Mr. Barry moved to Ward 8 only last summer, in order to run for the City Council seat.
"Marion Barry lives here," he said. "I've seen him four or five times this summer. I voted for him because he's a good leader, he just got caught up with the wrong people. But I know he's rehabilitated, and he's going to do better for us."
Like everyone here, Mr. Easterling knows the neighborhood's primary need: "Jobs. We got to have jobs."
One of the largest employers of the area's residents is the Federal Government. Businesses are so scarce that the area does not have any restaurants, only fast-food outlets. There are no department stores and only one major supermarket for 72,000 people. The area does not even have a Little League baseball team.
Southeast Washington, once a relatively prosperous, racially mixed blue-collar neighborhood, began its decline after the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Paradoxically, the riots were briefer and less destructive in Ward 8 than in black neighborhoods west of the river.
 
Poorer Families Remained
 Still, "the riots scared a lot of white people out, and a lot of the young black professionals, too," said Dorn McGrath, professor of urban planning at George Washington University. Many businesses followed, taking jobs with them. "One of the largest furniture warehouses and retail outlets in the city had to close down because their customers were afraid to come there anymore."
The poorer black families who remained did not have the economic or political clout to benefit from the redevelopment in other parts of the city that came as a result of the riots. Rioters burned many buildings to the ground in areas closer to the Capitol. The city invested heavily there, even building government offices to encourage recovery. But development experts say little was done for Anacostia and Congress Heights.
In fact, by "the mid-1970's, Anacostia had to sue the city for parity in the provision of municipal services, like garbage, sewer, water, and tree maintenance," Mr. McGrath said.
The city did not do any better by the neighborhood in the 12 years that Mr. Barry was the Mayor. When Mr. Barry was asked about this in the campaign, he spoke instead about programs he had put into effect on youth employment and for the elderly.
Standing on a bluff in the ward with a commanding view of the river and the rest of Washington, Lottie Hudson waved her arm back towards the area and spoke with scorn in her voice as she mocked the city's political establishment.
"Now it's like, 'They're on that side, just leave them there,' " said Ms. Hudson, who lived in various Washington neighborhoods before settling in Ward 8 nearly 20 years ago. "Just do the minimum. But people are frustrated they can't get a job.
"I saw Marion Barry did a lot for youth jobs as Mayor, but I also saw him mess up," said Ms. Hudson, who describes herself as a recovered alcoholic working as a substance abuse counselor. She said she did not vote for Mr. Barry. "I forgave him as soon as he decided to do something about his problem, but I didn't forget.
 
'Barry Inspired Me'
 Enough people apparently felt more than forgiveness. Not only did Mr. Barry win a 3-to-1 victory over the 16-year incumbent, Wilhelmina Rolark, but he did it with unprecedented voter turnout in his Ward. He faces a Republican opponent in the November general election, but there are so few Republican voters in Ward 8 that Mr. Barry is virtually certain to win.
Geraldine McCarthur, 28 and unemployed, said: "Barry inspired me. He showed that you can pick yourself up."
In fact, that notion was Mr. Barry's central strategy, and his supporters say it had significant impact in a community where many people have experience with drugs and jails.
"A report recently showed 42 percent of Washington's African-American males between 18 and 35 were involved in the criminal justice system," said the Rev. Willie Wilson, a staunch Mr. Barry supporter.
"There's a bad label put on Southeast, and a lot of people are amazed at what they find when they come to this side of the river," Mr. Wilson said. "But this false label has also been a basis for insurance companies to have higher rates, for lenders to be unwilling to make capital investments here."
So investment comes from organizations like Action to Rehabilitate Community Housing, a nonprofit group that sells renovated houses to low-income families.

HEADLINE: Consumers Continue To Cut Debt

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
American consumers reduced their outstanding debt for the seventh consecutive month in August, improving their balance sheets by $959 million, the Government said today.
The decline translated into a 1.6 percent reduction at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, following a drop at a 1.8 percent rate in July, the Federal Reserve said. 
 Both consumers and businesses have been busy reducing huge debt burdens built up during the 1980's, and economists often cite that as one of the chief factors slowing the recovery.
But, in a speech to the Rotary Club of Washington, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson said high debt levels were among a number of temporary obstacles that the economy would soon surmount.
"These are by and large transitory factors that time and the inherent adaptability of the American economy will overcome," he said.
Economists believe paying down consumer debt will eventually create a healthier economy, but in the meantime it means consumer spending -- representing two-thirds of all economic activity -- has been extremely sluggish.
Consumers unnerved by lackluster income growth and weak job markets have been paying off their debts for more than a year and may continue doing so for another year, many analysts say.
August marked the 13th decline in credit outstanding in 16 months.
Revolving loans outstanding, which include credit cards, rose at a 2.8 percent annual rate in August. But automobile loans declined at a rate of two-tenths of 1 percent; other loans fell at an 8.3 percent rate. The other category includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations.
The various changes left total consumer debt not secured by real estate at $720.9 billion, the lowest total since April 1990.

HEADLINE: It All Started With Hemlines

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
It was October 1987 and a tense world waited to see whether the crash in the stock market would touch off a recession.
But James Annable, chief economist for the First National Bank of Chicago, was quickly reassured. Scrutinizing figures flowing daily from the bank's large credit card operation, he and his associates found customers continuing to rack up new debt rather than hunkering down and repaying the old. 
 "That was our first indication we were going to shrug it off," said Mr. Annable, who promptly helped spread the opportunistic word to bond traders, loan officers, customers and others.
Credit card postings are only one of the host of business and economic statistics occupying the vast territory between a handful of landmark indicators watched universally, like the Labor Department's monthly job figures, and whimsical attempts to make money by analyzing Super Bowl winners, sun spot activity or women's hemlines.
Few of these lesser-known indicators are new, though technology has made various of them far more complete and timely. While some are proprietary, others are available for the looking, perhaps in a nook known only to the savvy or in a form requiring expert massage.
A score of members attending the annual convention of the National Association of Business Economists in Dallas last month described some of their favorites:
 
Howard Keen
Consolidated Rail Corporation, Philadelphia.
Refining the traditional freight carloadings indicator, whose general popularity waned in the 1970's, Mr. Keen creates his gauge of American industry by excluding loadings of agricultural products, coal and goods in trailers and containers that are assumed to be mainly imported. He finds this series, when adjusted for seasonal variation and put on a four-week moving average, highly correlated to contemporary industrial production. With little movement for about a year, the current message is "a lack of a spark out there," Mr. Keen says.
 
Anthony Finizza
Atlantic Richfield Company, Los Angeles.
As an aid in marketing, Mr. Finizza keeps an eye on the number and demographic composition of people turning in California drivers' licenses when they seek new licenses in other states. Much of the recent out-migration, he said, is of older whites. ARCO pays particular attention to changes in the age and ethnic composition of the state since it aims at price-conscious customers with super-size, self-service stations that sell gasoline for several cents a gallon less than the competition.
 
Lynn O. Michaelis
Weyerhaeuser Company, Tacoma, Wash.
In addition to home sales and orders for wood products and lumber, Mr. Michaelis watches demand for corrugated boxes, a venerable indicator with predictive power based on the fact that so much material, manufacturing components as well as finished goods, is shipped in them. This gauge flattened during the summer following hefty year-over-year gains in the spring.
 
Jay N. Woodworth
Bankers Trust Company, New York.
A specialist in Japan who has made some 60 trips to the Far East, Mr. Woodworth calculates what he calls nonweekend-seating-densities in 747's bound for Tokyo, paying particular attention to first class. "When you hit an air pocket in the economy," Mr. Woodworth said, "it's amazing how fast passengers fall off." Recently the counts have been mediocre to poor.
 
Carolyn M. Scott
Sears, Roebuck & Company, Chicago.
To Ms. Scott, one of the very best indicators is the ratio of consumers' net credit change to disposable personal income, which answers the question "are they spending, paying off credit or saving?" Ms. Scott said. This gauge, which tends to show ever-smaller movements when approaching economic peaks and troughs, flashed caution signs in 1989, well before the onset of the latest recession, but has been moving higher since early 1992. Ms. Scott cautions against overreliance on indexes of consumer confidence, which now receive much attention, because they measure opinion that could prove fleeting: "Watch what they do, not what they say," she urged.
 
Wayne D. Gantt
Interstate/Johnson Lane, Atlanta.
One Gantt favorite, not always easy to obtain, is citations of companies by fire marshals for stacking unsold goods so high that they interfere with sprinkler systems. Another is the easily determined weight of The New York Times. "When it's nice and chubby I feel much better," Mr. Gantt said. "You know that demand is picking up."
 
James L. Cochrane
New York Stock Exchange.
When he worked for the Texas Commerce Bank, Mr. Cochrane routinely called retail-store customers from a range of outlets, from Wal-Mart to Neiman Marcus, to get daily cash-register receipts, a "primitive" exercise but startlingly accurate in gauging the economy. "People in the banking business have a leg up," Mr. Cochrane said. "Just use your imagination -- it's amazing the data your customers are sitting on."
 
James F. Smith
University of North Carolina.
Dr. Smith, a professor of finance, tracks the change in nonautomotive consumer credit, judging it a measure of mostly discretionary purchases and thus indicating willingness, as opposed to ability, to spend. Revolving credit fell a bit in July, the latest month for which the Federal Reserve has reported, but is trending up for the year. "Consumers are providing a steady underpinning to the economy, but there's no impending boom," Professor Smith said.
Sooner or later, of course, some indicators are bound to slip into disrepute. Geoffrey Carliner, executive director of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the nation's official designator of recessions and expansions, said he used to study yield spreads between top-quality and lesser-quality debt. But in recent years "that stuff has done terribly," he observed. Now, "the only one I look at is hemlines." Shorter skirts have sometimes been associated with economic booms.
Added John E. Silvia of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, "You can drive yourself nuts" chasing nontraditional indicators, some of which prove to be mere fads. Citing the current popularity of Johnson's Redbook, a weekly tabulation of store sales, Mr. Silvia said, "The half-life of these indicators is just so short."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Rise Is a Windfall To Little Rock

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 2

 BODY:
It remains to be seen what Bill Clinton can do for the nation's economy, but there's no question that basing his national campaign here has done wonders for Little Rock's.
From the constantly booked-up Capital Hotel to the crowds of Clinton aides who hit Doe's Eat Place after work to the female staff members who have adopted Yvonne Head of Jan's Salon as the semi-official Clinton campaign haircutter, Little Rock is benefiting economically from Mr. Clinton's unusual decision to base his Presidential campaign in a city that has never been confused with the nation's power centers. 
 "Downtown has really boomed because of the Clinton campaign," said Fleming Stockton, who along with his wife, Barbara, runs Your Mama's restaurant down the street from Clinton campaign headquarters. "They must account for 25 percent of our business."
David Watkins, Mr. Clinton's operations director and a boyhood friend, said the campaign has a monthly payroll of $1 million, which includes 369 staff members in Little Rock and 130 in field offices. The campaign plans to spend $55 million over three and a half months. About $3 million to $4 million is to be spent in Little Rock -- a drop in the bucket in Washington, where most Presidential campaigns are run from, but a substantial boost to a city of 175,000.
With 369 local employees, the Clinton campaign would be about the 30th- largest business in Little Rock were it a continuing enterprise. It is already the state's busiest telephone user, with about 25,000 incoming or outgoing calls a day. At Little Rock Regional Airport, boardings in August were 98,533, more than 6,000 above a year ago, although there was no way to tell how much of that had to do with the Clinton campaign.
But the economic impact goes well beyond direct spending. About 75 percent of the salaried Clinton staff comes from outside Arkansas, so they need lodging and in many cases even furniture rental. There are also the visiting politicos, vendors and journalists who fill up the hotels and eat at the restaurants.
The journalists in particular are so ubiquitous that The Arkansas Democrat Gazette recently ran a poem commenting on their presence: "They arrive from big cities asking who we all are/I see them downtown squeezed in five to a car . . . . "
Some of the beneficiaries are obvious. The 115-year-old Capital Hotel -- and its equally historic bar -- are having a banner year, with occupancy rates up from 76 percent to 82 percent. This week, as with most others recently, it was full.
"We're also doing very well with food and beverages, not necessarily in that order," said Jim Fayek, general manager.
The biggest single gainer may be Walter Hussman, publisher of The Arkansas Democrat Gazette, who won Little Rock's brutal newspaper war a year ago and now rents out the building that used to house the vanquished Gazette to the Clinton campaign.
But rental-car companies, computer dealers, printers and companies like Central Flying Services, which fuels and services the campaign jets are also getting a boost.
"Let me put it this way," said Kara Horton-Smith, vice president of Horton Brothers Printing, which produces books, posters and other printing for the campaign. "We can't handle any more."
Of course, there's a limit to how much the campaign can contribute. Much of downtown, particularly a largely vacant downtown mall opened with great fanfare a few years ago, remains moribund.
Some businesses say the Clinton workers, many of them college-age, aren't exactly big spenders.
"They're mostly small accounts," said Susan Gaito, assistant manager of Dixie Rents Furniture. "A lot of them just rent a bed. There's not a lot of money to be made in renting a bed."
Nor do profits necessarily stay in Little Rock.
"The No. 1 hotel in town, the Excelsior, is owned by the Japanese," said Gene G. McCoy, chairman of AdCraft of Arkansas, a graphic arts and printing company, "so when you pay a night's rent there, anything that's left over after they wash the sheets and towels, why, it goes to Tokyo."
And, since campaigns only seem to go on forever, this all ends in November.
Still, some business leaders see a lasting impact from thousands of visitors and untold publicity in a city that before the campaign was still best known for the uproar over the desegregation of Central High School in 1957.
"The Chamber of Commerce advertising budget for the next 20 years couldn't buy what we're getting now," said Paul Harvel, President of the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce.

HEADLINE: Effect of Trenton Layoffs Is Trickling Down and Far

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
With the dismissal of 1,500 state employees this week, the anticipated loss of 2,600 more through attrition over the next eight months and nearly 3,500 state workers taken off the payroll last year, New Jersey is in the process of paring nearly 10 percent of its work force in barely two years.
It is the biggest round of layoffs in state history and ends a decade of virtually unchecked growth as New Jersey became a national leader in providing services to its citizens -- from generous social programs to subsidies for the arts. 
 The pain will be most acute for those who are dependent on direct social services and welfare, but few among New Jersey's eight million residents will be unaffected.
The pinch will be felt by everyone from the elderly shut-in who depends on a "meals on wheels" program to the newborn child who will not be screened for developmental problems by state laboratory technicians.
 
Fall May Not Be Noticed
 "The quality of life in New Jersey will be reduced," said Henry J. Raimondo, an associate professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.
"But the sad part about it," he said, "is that in most cases the average New Jerseyan will not notice the cuts and will probably think this isn't so bad and that we should have done it sooner."
The 1,510 layoffs on Monday represented about 2 percent of the state work force, reducing the number of employees to 71,884, a state official said today.
Few services were eliminated entirely, but many have been scaled back sharply or are being provided by veteran workers who used their seniority to "bump" their way into unfamiliar jobs after receiving layoff notices.
"The impact of the layoffs could be as simple as litter being picked up less frequently on the New Jersey Turnpike to slower delivery of meals to a shut-in elderly person," Mr. Raimondo said.
Under public pressure, Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, and the Republican leaders in the Legislature agreed to restore to the budget enough money to avert possible layoffs in several areas that would have had a heavy impact on the middle class.
 
Squeaky Wheels at Inspections
 There was, for example, a well-publicized furor over long lines at motor vehicle inspection stations after budget cuts caused the elimination of evening and weekend service. Mr. Florio and the Republicans ultimately put aside their differences and found the money for extended hours. They also managed to find the funds to keep state parks open through Labor Day.
The Department of Human Services, the state's largest agency, with 20,500 employees before the layoffs, was not so lucky. More than a third of the layoffs -- 579 of them -- came from that department, which provides social and welfare services to about one million people, one out of eight New Jersey residents. Under a flood of new federally-financed programs, Human Services has grown steadily over the years. A spokeswoman, Winnie Comfort, said the cuts would mean more cases per worker and slower service in some instances, but no program cuts.
The impact is less apparent but no less worrisome at the Department of Health, where the furloughs and bumping caused turmoil in the medical laboratories.
"There are the same number of people working in the department, but five of the technicians are new and completely green, and the program is in jeopardy," said Katherine Black, a representative of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents 5,000 workers in the departments of health, environmental protection, labor, agriculture and commerce.
Ms. Black said the laboratories are responsible for screening every baby born in the state for six metabolic disorders, conducting about 125,000 tests a year, of which an average of 6,000 tests are positive.
"These are the kind of screenings which must occur within the first six days after birth," she said. "Medical intervention is frequently required immediately, and if it isn't the results are permanent mental retardation or death.
 
Worry About Neglected Tests
 "The professionals said it takes about six months to get up to speed on conducting these screenings," Ms. Black added. "We are worried about the disruption that the layoffs have caused and what it will mean to the work in the lab. Some positive results could slip through the cracks."
A spokeswoman for the Health Department, Darlene Weiner, said officials were confident that the layoffs would not cause the disruptions the union feared. "There will be no loss of services," she said. "We said that there will be a need for training, but we are confident that we will be able to avoid the kinds of delays that would affect public health."
The loss of about 151 jobs from the Department of the Treasury, mostly auditors' positions, might escape public attention. But, officials say, Wall Street, which was edgy even before the latest round of layoffs about the number of auditors overseeing the state's business, is likely to notice, a concern that could hurt the state's bond rating and the cost of borrowing money.
The most highly publicized shake-up resulting from the layoffs came in the Office of the Public Advocate, which had been one of the strongest ombudsmen agencies in the nation. The department saw 29 jobs eliminated, including every one in two of its most important and controversial sections: the Office of Citizen Complaints, which investigated other state agencies, and the Division of Public Interest Advocacy, which handled such legal issues as public housing, beach access and fees and environmental cases.
 
Public Advocate Devastated
 Allan Drake, a spokesman for the Public Advocate, said today that the former director of the Division of Public Interest Advocacy, David G. Sciarra, was still with the office and had assumed some of the duties of his old division. But Mr. Drake said the role of the Office of Citizen Complaints ended on Monday.
Mr. Raimondo, the Rutgers University professor, said a robust economy during the 1980's allowed New Jersey to increase its payroll and the scope of public services when many other states were tightening their belts.
Between 1960, when there were 28,363 state employees, and 1990, when the work force reached 78,362, the New Jersey payroll grew by an average of 1,500 workers a year. The peak came in 1988 under a Republican Governor, Thomas H. Kean, when the work force reached 80,300.
Mr. Florio came to office in 1990 vowing to reduce the size of the government. In his first year, he eliminated about 2,500 jobs through attrition; he laid off 971 workers in 1991. He had planned no layoffs for the 1993 budget year, which began on July 1, but had hoped to pare 2,500 jobs through attrition. That was before the Republicans wrested control of the Legislature nearly a year ago and cut $1.1 billion from a budget they approved over the Governor's veto.
"During the 1980's, New Jersey was among the fastest-growing states in terms of state and local spending per capita," said Mr. Raimondo. "Our economy always kept us riding above the national recession, and we were able to spend a ton of money on social services, education and corrections. But just as the state economies of Massachusetts, New York and California fell, ours has finally come crashing down."

HEADLINE: Rearranging the Population: Indonesia Weighs the Pluses and the Minuses

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEKANBARU, Indonesia

 BODY:
In the last quarter-century, more than five million impoverished Indonesians have been uprooted as part of a bold attempt by the Government to relieve severe population pressures on the island of Java, one of the most crowded places on earth.
Encouraged by the World Bank and other international relief organizations, the Government has paid for the resettlement of these millions in more remote and far-flung islands of this archipelago nation. The moves were voluntary, and the migrant families were given land and the material to build a new home. 
 But today the organizers of one of the world's most ambitious resettlement plans acknowledge that it has been a mixed success, and that it led to cruel mistakes. The Government is reforming the program, which is known as transmigration.
 
Several Criticisms
 The program continues to draw fire from human-rights advocates and environmentalists, who say it has contributed to the destruction of indigenous cultures and virgin lands.
Early migrants sometimes found themselves on remote islands where the soil was poor, or where there was inadequate water, or where there was malaria, or where there was no place for farmers to sell crops.
For some in the program, "it was like they had been banished to a faraway country," said Z. A. Maulani, secretary general of the Transmigration Ministry. "There may have been more concern about getting people out of Java" than in making sure their new homes were adequate, he said.
Among the critics has been the World Bank, which cut off most of its funding in the late 1980's after lending hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
Taking a Step Back
 The Government is scaling back the program but keeping it alive. The population problem has not gone away.
Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation, with 180 million people spread across 17,000 islands. Only China, India and the United States have more people. Indonesia's overcrowding problem is most severe on Java, which represents only 7 percent of the land but is home to 60 percent of the people.
The changes in the program appear to have had an effect. Government studies, described by diplomats as reliable, show that the vast majority of the migrants believe their lives are better.
In a report in January, the World Bank noted many of its earlier criticisms but said transmigration had "made an important contribution to Indonesia's long-term economic and social development."
 
'There Was No Future'
 "Of course I moved from Java," said Onih, a 20-year-old Javanese-born laborer who now lives on Sumatra and who, like many Indonesians, has only one name. "In Java, there was no future." Mrs. Onih and her husband seem pleased with their new home and the plot of land they have been given, the first land they have ever owned.
Barokah, a 47-year-old farmer, says she has no complaints. Like many of the migrants interviewed in the sprawling transmigration sites here on Sumatra, she says her life is undeniably better.
"I put everything I own into a plastic sack and came here in a big boat with my husband," said Barokah, who left her native Java last March.
"The land on Java was better for crops," Mrs. Barokah said as she used her thumb to push dried lentil beans from their pods, one of the first crops that she and her husband have managed to coax out of the dry red soil. "But on Java I worked on land owned by others. Here, I own the land."
 
The Grubstake
 Most homesteaders are Javanese farmers or laborers eager to tend land of their own. Under the program, each family receives about five acres of land, materials for a simple house, seed, pesticides, a supply of food and a set of clothes. They are moved to their new homes at Government expense.
Transmigration has been around in one form or another since the turn of the century, when the Dutch owners of coffee and rubber plantations forcibly moved thousands of laborers from Java to Sumatra.
The current, voluntary program dates back to 1969, when the Government decided it had to defuse a population time-bomb on Java. Indonesia was then, and remains today, one of the few nations to undertake a serious, voluntary effort at population control by redistribution.
 
'The Largest Colonization'
 During the Government's five-year planning cycle that began in 1979, 535,000 families were resettled. From 1984 to 1989, 750,000 families were moved.
As the numbers grew, so did the criticism. Environmentalists said settlements were being carved out of rain forests. Human rights groups worried about encroachments on tribal lands, especially in Irian Jaya, the Indonesian half of New Guinea, which is home to tribes barely out of the Stone Age.
Survival International, a human rights organization based in London, has described transmigration as "the largest colonization program in history" and said "tribal peoples have been pushed aside" for new migration sites.
Worried by the criticism, in the late 1980's the Government began to emphasize sending fewer families to better locations. Satellite imagery is being used to select sites with fertile soil where environmental damage can be contained.
The program hopes to move 60,000 families this year, less than half of its annual goal a few years ago. The decision to scale back has been attributed both to the need for change and to a drop in the Government's revenue from oil, a critical export. The cutbacks have quieted some, but not all, of the criticism.
According to the World Bank report, two-thirds of the migrants report that they have higher incomes as a result of joining the program, and most said they were satisfied with their lives.
"Just after I first arrived here in 1986, several families went home to Java because they were uncomfortable here and they found life as migrants too difficult," said Nani, a 38-year-old farmer who lives at a migration site in Sumatra. "Now, nobody talks about leaving. Even though I get homesick for Java and I think sometimes the life there was easier, we will stay."
While the population of Java continues to grow, the worst fears of demographers have not been realized. With industrialization and foreign investment, Indonesia has one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with Java the chief beneficiary.
Thus, transmigration has taken on a secondary purpose as an useful tool in creating a national identity in Indonesia, a nation that often seems in danger of fragmenting along fault lines of ethnicity, religion and social class.
Across Indonesia's 17,000 islands, from the Bay of Bengal to the northern tip of Australia, there are more than 300 ethnic groups speaking hundreds of languages. While most Indonesians are Muslims, millions worship Buddha, Christ, Shiva or local tribal gods. Separatist movements exist on a number of the islands, led by men and women who are willing to take up arms rather than allow themselves to be labeled as Indonesian.
"Transmigration is good for nation-building," said Mr. Maulani of the Transmigration Ministry.
Boenyamin, a transmigration director in Sumatra, said he wanted migrants "not to think of themselves as Javanese or Sumatran or whatever, but instead to think of themselves as Indonesians." Mr. Boenyamin was born in Java.
The Javanese dominate the political and social structure of Indonesia, and there has been some apprehension among Sumatrans and among the natives of other provinces that local cultures will be sacrificed with the arrival of so many Javanese.
Indonesian social scientists refer to the process as "Javanization," or Javanese colonialism. The Javanese have long faced a special suspicion in Sumatra, where the Indonesian Army has been entangled for years in a campaign to put down a separatist movement in Aceh province.
"There are differences between the Javanese and us," said Yahya, 63, the leader of a small Sumatra village outside one of the resettlement sites. "There are differences in our customs, in the way we live."
Still, he said, "We want to live in peace with the settlers. I have heard one or two people say, 'The Javanese are taking our land, Sumatran land,' but these people do not reflect the way the community feels."
 
The Good Soil of Sumatra
 The migrants get their choice of islands on which to settle. While they are encouraged to go to remote provinces the Government wants to develop, about half of those in the program this year will settle on Sumatra because of its proximity to Java and because it has better soil than many other islands.
"I was willing to wait to come here to Sumatra," said Bambang Sudiharjo, 40, an electrician who left Ngawi, in eastern Java, three years ago to travel here with 23 other Ngawi families. "There is more a future in this land."
The Ngawi families settled together in a 750-family site in Sei Pagar, where they tend to stubby oil palms. Each family gets a plot of trees within a large plantation, along with a separate two-acre plot for growing other crops that can be used or sold by the family.
While most of the migrants in Sei Pagar make clear that they are better off now, at least one family is discouraged and may soon go back to Java.
 
'I Miss Jakarta'
 Kartini, 31, left Jakarta three years ago with her husband, a cab driver, and says she often thinks giving up and returning home. "I miss the sights of Jakarta, and we have had so many troubles here," said Mrs. Kartini, who has three daughters. "We were given palm trees, but they are still not mature palm trees. And sometimes the palm trees are attacked by wild boars that eat the fruit."
In August, Mrs. Kartini and her family received only about 85,000 rupiah, or $42, from the sale of palm oil, and Mrs. Kartini said she has begun traveling outside the camp looking for work.
To encourage integration and to deal with local jealousy over the land and other benefits for migrants, a share of each settlement is set aside for local families. At Sei Pagar, 10 percent of the land goes to Sumatran farmers who agree to move onto the site.
"When I first saw this land, I wept because I was so frightened," said Mrs. Barokah, the Javanese farmer who arrived here last spring. "Now I think to myself that I will stay here forever."

HEADLINE: Net Up 5.1% At Raytheon

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Mass., Oct. 7

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company, which has been cutting jobs as military spending shrinks, said today that its profits rose 5.1 percent in the third quarter.
Raytheon said it earned $156.1 million, or $1.16 a share, for the three months ended Sept. 27, compared with $148.4 million, or $1.12 a share, in the similar 1991 quarter. Sales dropped slightly, to $2.21 billion, compared with $2.23 billion a year earlier. 
 Raytheon has cut thousands of jobs from its payroll in order to better compete for military contracts. The company currently employs 66,400 people, down by about 7,000 jobs over the last year. Earlier this month the company announced it had eliminated 268 jobs in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Tennessee.
The company said profits were lifted by strong showings in commercial segments like energy and environmental, aircraft products and major appliances. Dennis Picard, Raytheon's chairman and chief executive, said those areas showed improved profitability "despite the sluggish economy and the slip in receipt of foreign contracts."
The company's stock lost $1.625 today, closing at $41.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: Bundesbank Chief Is at Eye of Currency Storm

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 6

 BODY:
"Do right, though the heavens fall" could be the motto of the Bundesbank, the independent German central bank. It insists that it is doing right, and the heavens are indeed falling.
Not that Dr. Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, and his colleagues here do not admit to having made a few gaffes. His colleagues say that Dr. Schlesinger regretted public statements he made that started a run on the pound sterling in European currency markets last month, leading to three weeks of disarray in the financial markets as well as much public shouting and finger-pointing among European officials.
 
Just What He Wanted, Some Say
 Still, bank insiders say, the result was just what Dr. Schlesinger wanted: a realignment of European currencies that raised the value of the German mark against most of the others, to help the German central bank push inflation down. A revalued mark would make imports less costly and force German manufacturers to hold their prices down, too. 
 Conspiracy theorists in Britain and elsewhere have suggested that Dr. Schlesinger deliberately brought about the realignment, a suggestion his aides deny vigorously. And last Friday, Dr. Schlesinger denied speculation that he might be forced to retire before his term ends next September. "If the good Lord gives me my health, I shall stay in office" he told reporters.
He may even do more than that. Some Bundesbank officials here say that if the mark's new value does make inflation recede, as intended, the Bundesbank will be in a position to give the rest of the world what it has been clamoring for -- lower German interest rates.
But the path Dr. Schlesinger has set out on -- and his relentless determination to cut its 3.5 percent inflation rate, regardless of the hardships on Germany's neighbors -- has brought him some harsh criticism. He was particularly stung, bank officials say, by recent remarks by Norman Lamont, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, who fumed at the Germans for being disloyal.
But while such sniping may sting, conversations with bank officials make it clear that the pressures of politics and diplomacy, and the electoral needs of European or American politicians, are a long way off indeed from their central concern. The bank's mandate is simply to insure a sound German money supply. And this, at the moment, is why it refuses to reduce interest rates.
"We don't see interest rates the way many people in the United States or in Britain do, as a way of influencing unemployment or stimulating business activity," one bank official explained. "We see them as a tool we use to do what our statute requires us to do: to keep the money sound and the rate of inflation low."
The bank's decision over the weekend of Sept. 12 that it would cut a key interest rate by half a percentage point struck many as out of character, but the situation, too, was out of the ordinary.
Tension had begun to build a week earlier, amid growing nervousness in the financial markets about the Sept. 20 referendum in France on the treaty on European monetary union signed last year in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
 
Confrontation at Bankers' Session
 On Sept. 5, European Community finance ministers and central bank officials met in Bath, England. Mr. Lamont was desperate to find a way of reducing British rates without devaluing the pound against the mark, to try to get his country out of its longest recession since the 1930's. One German banker says Mr. Lamont banged his fist on the table and shouted at Dr. Schlesinger: "Twelve finance ministers are all sitting here demanding that you lower your interest rates. Why don't you do it?"
Dr. Schlesinger, who is 68 years old, was shaken, and wanted to walk out, the banker said. But the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, prevailed on him to stay and explained to Mr. Lamont once more about the inflationary dangers from German unification. Dr. Schlesinger said the bank saw no reason to raise rates, though, and Mr. Lamont later claimed that as a German pledge.
But the markets continued to chip away at the pound. One reason was that Dr. Schlesinger, who close associates say cannot let errors pass uncorrected, was asked whether he had also pledged to rule out a realignment of European currencies. He declined to answer, he said, because he had strong views that he did not want to make public.
By Sept. 11, with the bank being forced to buy billions of dollars' worth of Italian lire and British pounds on the currency markets to keep them from sinking below their minimum values allowed under the European currency system, Dr. Schlesinger asked Mr. Waigel and Chancellor Helmut Kohl to support a realignment, despite the objections of others, including the French.
The Chancellor and his Finance Minister came to Frankfurt that Friday and, a bank insider says, Dr. Schlesinger told Mr. Kohl that an upward revaluation of the German mark against the others would make it possible to reduce interest rates slightly. That would turn down the political heat on the Germans, in the bank's view.
But the British still refused to devalue the pound. And when Italy agreed to a 7 percent devaluation of the lira and the Bundesbank reduced its short-term lending rate by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 9.5 percent, it was not enough to stop the pressure against the pound.
In an interview with reporters of The Wall Street Journal and a German financial newspaper, Handelsblatt, on Sept. 15, German officials say, Dr. Schlesinger let slip a remark that he thought a broader realignment would have been more effective. Although he withdrew it from the version of the interview that he authorized both newspapers to use, Handelsblatt attributed the thought to him anyway.
 
Political Crisis in Britain
 It was published on Sept. 16, and it was all the confirmation the nervous currency markets needed that the British might yet be forced to devalue. Even the Bundesbank, with all its reserves, could not hold back the tide of selling that engulfed the pound that morning, and Prime Minister John Major suspended it from the currency system, plunging into his most serious political crisis since he took office nearly two years ago.
The pound's difficulties intensified again last week, after the publication of yet another statement by Dr. Schlesinger defending his actions in the earlier crisis -- although that time, officials of the bank and Government officials in Bonn say, it was not entirely Dr. Schlesinger's fault. The German Embassy in London, they say, had asked the bank to prepare a detailed rebuttal of increasingly furious British charges that it had deliberately sabotaged the pound.
Dr. Schlesinger approved a response that said, among other things, that the bank had spent the better part of $31.4 billion supporting the value of the pound before Britain left the system. People who know him say Dr. Schlesinger is constitutionally incapable of overlooking what he considers unfair or inaccurate information about the bank in newspapers, and he signed the statement himself. He also told Baron Hermann von Richthofen, the German Ambassador in London, to use it as he saw fit with British newspapers.
The Ambassador delivered the original statement to the British Foreign Office and then, for reasons that are not clear to officials in Chancellor Kohl's office or here at the bank, instead of using it as a "talking paper" with British reporters, he authorized the embassy to give most of it to The Financial Times. The Foreign Office angrily complained about a "wholly inappropriate" breach of confidentiality.
So is Dr. Schlesinger in the doghouse in Bonn? Not at all, say German officials who obviously share his view that the British were trying to blame German policy for underlying faults in their own economy. With the pound no longer tied to the mark, Mr. Lamont cut the basic British bank rate by a full percentage point, to 9 percent. If he had been willing to accept devaluation earlier, German officials say, he could have cut rates much sooner.
 
A Lesson From the Turmoil
 One lesson the Bundesbankers draw from the current turmoil is that there would be less turmoil on the European money markets if politicians did not resist periodic orderly adjustments in their value -- easy for Germans to say, since their currency always gains.
But fixed exchange rates will not work until there is a common European currency, Bundesbank officials say. They are not too sure that will be a workable idea any time soon, either, though the Maastricht treaty outlined a plan to institute one as early as 1997.
As for German nominal bank rates, the Bundesbank's governing council left them unchanged last week, and Dr. Schlesinger said they would stay there "for the time being." But bankers here and officials in Bonn point out that the real rates at which German companies are doing business are lower.
Yields on long-term German government bonds are now running about 7.5 percent, for example, and long-term money market rates have fallen to 8.9 percent. "The furor will pass," one confident banker said. "It isn't the first, and it won't be the last."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Behind the Scenes;
Once Friendly, Schoolmate Returns as Clinton Foe

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Oct. 2

 BODY:
There's an American tale worthy of John Steinbeck in the story of the two Oxford-educated golden boys from Arkansas, one within reach of being elected President, the other doing everything he can to stop it from happening.
The former is Bill Clinton. The latter is Cliff Jackson, who studied with Mr. Clinton at Oxford in 1969 and is now telling everyone who will listen that Mr. Clinton has lied about his draft history and is not fit to be President. 
 But though Mr. Jackson casts his story in terms of clear, "universal values" like truth and integrity -- not to be confused with the Republican family values campaign -- the further he goes the murkier it gets. Even Mr. Jackson seems to concede that if Mr. Clinton flunks his test for worthiness to be President, it is not clear if any current or recent candidate would pass.
For a time, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jackson, a tall, thin 46-year-old lawyer, seemed to be traveling on almost identical paths. Both were the consummate high school overachievers who grew up 20 miles apart, Mr. Clinton in Hot Springs, Mr. Jackson in Donaldson.
Both won scholarships, Mr. Clinton a Rhodes, Mr. Jackson a Fulbright, to study at Oxford, where in 1969 they played on the same campus basketball team and became friends. Both went on to law school and went home to Arkansas.
Both soon ran unsuccessfully for political office. Mr. Clinton lost a race for Congress in 1974. Mr. Jackson lost a bid for local prosecuting attorney in 1976.
From there, the paths diverged, and the gap between them has never stopped widening.
Mr. Clinton was elected Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas in 1976, then Governor in 1978 and now is reaching for the Presidency. Mr. Jackson never again sought elective office but continued on a contentious, often high-profile legal career that has often touched on political issues.
He has been in the public eye in Little Rock for lawsuits against a local utility in 1985, a successful challenge to a 1975 constitutional convention and even a 1986 legal brief written in rhyme and released to the press about a client filing a $2 million lawsuit over what she said was a maggot-infested candy bar.
 
Trying for a Year
 For the past year, much of his energy has gone into trying to get Mr. Clinton defeated. During the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Jackson was a leader of a local anti-Clinton group that spent $25,000 in advertisements critical of Mr. Clinton's economic record. And over the past months, Mr. Jackson, who has worked for the state Republican Party but considers himself an independent "new paradigmist" with views not far from Mr. Clinton's on many issues, has become the most persistent critic of Mr. Clinton's draft history.
In interviews and appearances on programs like "Larry King Live" on CNN, he cites letters he wrote in college about his efforts to help Mr. Clinton obtain an R.O.T.C. deferment and his feeling that Mr. Clinton "betrayed" him by using that help to avoid the draft.
"I think for me, the character of Bill Clinton is personified by the draft incident," he said. "He's not a man of conviction. He's not a man of principle."
Betsey Wright, a spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton, said Mr. Jackson was distorting history for political purposes.
"He's doing pretty much what the whole Bush-Quayle effort is doing, which is trying to divert the issues onto some sort of character assassination," she said.
She said that nothing in Mr. Jackson's assertions undercut Mr. Clinton's account that he gave up his deferment and put himself into the draft, where he drew a high number.
But Mr. Jackson's account has helped lead to the information that Mr. Clinton received a draft notice in 1969 and that efforts were made on his behalf to avoid induction.
Mr. Jackson said he has no vendetta against Mr. Clinton, only "a strong sense of right or wrong" and a frustration with what he sees as a decline in values common to political life and the Presidency.
"If I could write the epitaph on my tombstone," said Mr. Jackson, "it would be, 'He did what was right.' "
He paused a second and then added, "Or at least what I thought was right."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Nonpartisan Group Exhorts Women to Vote

 BODY:
A young woman rushes into an emergency room, clutching her baby to her chest. She begs for help for the child but meets with empty stares and curt answers. Frustrated, she sits down in an empty hall, rocking the baby as she waits.
A voice says: "This November, there is someone who has the power to change your life. Someone who will have a major impact on health care and poverty, education and unemployment. Someone who can make a differENCE . . . You." 
 The screen fades to black, and a statement appears: "Most politicians still think women should be seen and not heard." And then: "Make them listen. Vote."
This 30-second public service advertisement and a similar but longer one are the products of The Deciding Vote, a group of more than 50 women from advertising companies and news and entertainment organizations. The group was formed two months ago to produce a set of advertisements urging women to vote.
 
No Position on Issues
 The Deciding Vote is determinedly nonpartisan and has avoided taking positions on so-called women's issues, like abortion and sexual harassment, that have become flashpoints for the Democratic and Republican Parties. The group's message is simply to urge women to vote.
"There are so many women who don't feel that they have any influence or effect on the world around them or on their own lives or on their children's lives," said Jeanne Chinard, who is an executive vice president and senior creative director at Young and Rubicam in New York City and who came up with the idea for the advertisements. "But in fact they have tremendous power if they only use it."
According to The Deciding Vote, 39 million women who were eligible to vote did not do so in the last Presidential election. Of those, 9 million were registered.
Marcella Rosen, an executive vice president at Ayer Inc., founded the group after attending several fund-raising events for female candidates and organizations. She said that in what has become known as the "Year of the Woman," women had to be encouraged to vote for their own interests.
The result is a campaign that will run in coming weeks on the major networks, cable services and radio, in more than 30 magazines and two newspapers, and on billboards in 100 airports. Ms. Rosen said she expected the advertisements, which are run without charge, to receive the equivalent of $3 million to $4 million worth of space in the next month.
The nonpartisan nature of the campaign attracted women from a broad range of organizations.
"That's what made me feel good about supporting it," said Lisa Valk, publisher of Time, which will run the advertisements this month. "I don't think we should be in the position of telling women how to vote, just encouraging them to get out there."

HEADLINE: Study Says Bigger Hospitals Give Better Care

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Oct. 7

 BODY:
Large hospitals in big cities provide better care and have lower death rates than small rural hospitals, a study of more than 14,000 patients in five states has found.
Death rates in rural or suburban hospitals with fewer than 100 beds were 25 percent higher than in large, non-teaching hospitals in cities and 29 percent higher than in major teaching hospitals, the study's researchers said. The findings bolstered the link between hospital size and quality of care that had been found in previous studies. 
 "If I had a serious illness and it wasn't an emergency, these results would certainly make me think twice about going to the nearest hospital" with fewer than 100 beds, said the study's chief author, Emmett Keeler.
The study, published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, was carried out for the Federal agency that runs Medicare.
"More doctors and more equipment equals a lower mortality rate" at bigger hospitals, said David Langness, spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California, which represents hospitals that have 23 to 1,500 beds. But for people who are not as seriously ill, small hospitals "are close, they're accessible, they offer extremely personalized care, they're not as faceless and anonymous," Mr. Langness said.
The study used records and death rates of 14,008 elderly patients admitted to 297 hospitals in California, Florida, Texas, Indiana and Pennsylvania during 1981-82 and 1985-86.
The patients were admitted for five illnesses that frequently lead to death among the elderly: congestive heart failure, acute heart attack, pneumonia, stroke and hip fracture. The death rates were adjusted for differences in age and the degree of illness when each patient was hospitalized.
The percentage of elderly patients who died within 30 days of hospitalization was 18.5 percent at small non-urban hospitals; 14.8 percent at large, urban non-teaching hospitals, and 14.2 percent at major teaching hospitals.
The study also found that big-city public teaching hospitals were better organized in providing care than private hospitals.
The study was written by Mr. Keeler and seven other researchers from the Rand Corporation, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Sepulveda Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Los Angeles, and the California Association of Public Hospitals in Berkeley.
Previous studies have shown that big hospitals provide better care. But the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research institution, said the new study provided "the most comprehensive confirmation to date" of the link between hospital size and quality.

HEADLINE: A Proposal: Videos of Fed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, wants the Federal Reserve officials who devise the nation's monetary policy to videotape their closed-door meetings and release the tape 60 days later.
Presumably, Wall Street analysts and Washington policy aficionados could then view the proceedings on C-SPAN, the cable television network that broadcasts Congressional hearings and other Washington events. 
 The policy makers on the central bank's 12-member Federal Open Market Committee meet eight times a year to discuss economic growth, inflation, the money supply and the proper level of interest rates. The group last met on Tuesday.
The panel publicly releases its directives about six weeks after each meeting, but Mr. Gonzalez complained that the releases did not provide enough detail on how individual members voted or why.
"Those voting on the nation's money supply must be fully accountable for their actions to the American public," Mr. Gonzalez said in a statement. "The Federal Reserve must shed its traditional policy of secrecy."
Fed officials have resisted calls for greater openness, saying it would hamper their ability to make changes in monetary policy without roiling financial markets.

HEADLINE: Old Idea Gains New Respect: Spending Way Out of Slump

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Slowly, with many misgivings, Federal spending on public works is gaining a new respectability among economists, Wall Street traders and some corporate executives as a last-resort formula for generating jobs and ending the nation's economic stagnation.
In their view, other prescriptions have failed, and now with unemployment remaining stubbornly at 7.5 percent or more, they are concerned that the recovery may not take place without special help from the Government. 
 The new adherents are, in effect, putting aside years of opposition to increased public spending as unaffordable because it would add to the already huge Federal budget deficit and drive up the inflation rate, hurting the economy rather than helping it.
The position seems closer to that of the Democratic candidate for President, Bill Clinton, who has said some Government investment is needed to help the economy, than it is to that of President Bush, who is counting on the economy to pick up without extra Government spending.
The link between at least a temporary shot of more spending -- on highways, transit systems, education and the like -- and adding to the deficits has not changed. But an extensive range of interviews in recent days reveals a developing new attitude that says a rising deficit is a lesser evil until the weak economy can be revived -- though those who have adopted it insist that the deficit be retackled later.
"The basic view that is emerging is, 'don't just stand there, do something,' " said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Dreyfus Inc. He said he had opposed extra Government spending because of the deficit but now believes, like many other recent converts, that because the economy is so weak the deficit can rise without pushing up the inflation rate.
Mr. Hoey said he was not certain that more public spending would produce the desired recovery. But particularly in view of the persistent unemployment, he said he came to the conclusion that it was worth a try.
Some, like Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, said they came painfully and reluctantly over the last few months to the position that the economy would not begin to grow again without Government spending.
"People are missing the boat," Mr. Giordano said. "If I were a policy maker, I would definitely have short-term fiscal stimulus, but I would couple this with a program that assured that the deficit expansion would be reversed later on, when the economy was stronger."
Some economists continue to believe that even a temporary spending increase is harmful, among them Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Charles L. Schultze, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a top economist in the Carter Adminstraiton.
But the unmistakable trend is toward greater tolerance. Henry Kaufman, an economist and Wall Street money manager, said he believed the economy was so weak that even bond-market traders, who are hurt by inflation, were finally willing to tolerate some deficit spending. The threat of inflation eating away at the value of investments has been a principal objection to budget deficits.
Others, like Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns, said they were adjusting to the possibility that Bill Clinton might be elected President, as the public opinion polls now suggest, and will be under pressure to engage in public-works spending because job and wage stagnation are so widespread.
Mr. Kudlow, a conservative Republican and a Reagan Administration official, had made television appearances as recently as the Republican convention in August in which he called for rapid deficit reduction as a cure for the economy. Now he said that while he would still prefer to stimulate the economy through tax incentives like an investment tax credit or a lower capital gains tax, he was bowing to circumstances and supports deficit public spending as an acceptable policy for the moment.
 
Changing Hats
 "The public pressure for economic growth will lead Clinton to activist risk taking," Mr. Kudlow said. "I don't think the Government money is going to be well spent. I would prefer targeted tax credits. But I am a realist and I see that Clinton will be elected, and I am coming to grips with it. I am taking off my economist hat, and my ideological hat, and putting myself in the shoes of the frustrated American voter who wants change."
The Clinton camp, however, generally avoids the subject of deficit spending as an economic pump-priming device, fearful of the Republican charge that Democrats are chronic spenders. President Bush has been campaigning for deficit reduction through tax and spending cuts. Mr. Bush also publicly endorses the view of the Federal Reserve, and others, that the economy will recover on its own in 1993, once individuals and companies reduce their debts and spend again. Mr. Clinton neither attacks nor endorses this proposition.
"Governor Clinton is going to have to balance the need for action to get the economy moving against the need to also send strong signals of fiscal responsibility and commitment to reduce the deficit," said Gene Sperling, the campaign's economic coordinator.
 
Perot's Position
 Ross Perot, the third Presidential candidate, favored rapid deficit reduction originally but has since hedged this view. John P. White, a Kodak executive who wrote Mr. Perot's deficit reduction plan, in a television appearance Sunday endorsed temporary deficit spending to accelerate the economy. Mr. White also endorsed Mr. Clinton this week.
Some economists, like Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, who until last spring opposed added spending, are now developing theories and strategies to justify it. "It is hard now to find many economists who would not say that to kick-start the economy you need spending," Mr. Gordon said. He argued that without greater demand for products -- a demand supplied temporarily by Government spending -- investment and production would remain weak among manufacturers.
Virtually all economists, whether they favor or oppose public spending, agree on one point: When such spending or tax cuts fail to drive up the deficit, they are not much of a stimulant for the economy. The problem is that shifting spending from one area to another to avoid deficits generally fails to provide many new jobs.
If Federal funds are taken from weapons making, for example, and spent on highway construction, the net number of new jobs is often marginal at best, economists say. Similarly, if money is taken from one family's pockets through higher taxes and given to another as unemployment pay, the net increase in consumer spending is thought to be negligible.
Only through deficit spending -- the creation, in effect, of new money -- is fresh economic activity created without canceling what already exists, economists say. That trade-off to achieve economic growth was considered acceptable in the post-World War II period. But a huge increase in the deficit from $74 billion in 1980 to more than $380 billion now has made the problem especially difficult.
The great concern was that injecting new money into the economy -- even for such much-needed items as waste disposal or to fix deteriorating bridges -- would raise the risk of higher inflation and a weaker dollar, and also of saddling coming generations with an intolerable debt to repay.
For these reasons, Mr. Kaufman, who through most of the 1980's was the much-admired chief economist at Salomon Brothers, was an outspoken opponent of deficit spending. But more than three years of recession or weak economic growth altered his view in late summer. The nation's bond markets "might be willing to tolerate a modest public-spending program, with strict sunset provisions, to encourage a somewhat faster recovery," he said in a recent speech.
Others on Wall Street are also changing their views, largely because the Federal Reserve's repeated reductions in interest rates have failed to reawaken the economy. "There is a shift in Wall Street that says we must give the economy a boost before we worry again about cutting the deficit," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond trading house. Mr. Jones lists himself among the recent converts.
In general, corporate America remains more cautious. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, says his members are not ready for deficit spending yet. "Business continues to be scared to death about a big fiscal package that would worsen the deficit," Mr. Jasinowski said, adding, however, that executives were debating the issue.
But some have, in effect, joined the Government spenders. Allen Henry, president of the Harris Corporation's electronics systems sector, for example, endorses the spending indirectly.
He and other military contractors argue that a transition to the production of civilian products is difficult to make in a weak economy unless the Federal Government is the main customer. The Government, in effect, must finance the transition while also maintaining a high level of military purchases.
"You cannot diversify that quickly on your own and be profitable," Mr. Henry said. His company simultaneously makes electronic equipment for warplanes and a $1.7 billion air traffic control system for the Federal Aviation Administration.
The impetus for the attitude change on the deficit came in March, when two Nobel laureates in economics, Robert Solow and James Tobin, collected more than 90 signatures of prominent economists on a petition that called for $50 billion a year in Federal assistance to state and local governments, the money to be used primarily for public works. Later, the petition said, when economic recovery was under way, the deficit could be cut through military spending cutbacks and higher taxes.

HEADLINE: In Redrawn District, Tone Is Bitter in Congress Race

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Oct. 6

 BODY:
Patrick J. Roma, a Republican candidate for Congress, held a news conference at his headquarters here on Monday and did what he has done almost every day for the last four months: assail his opponent, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, as the epitome of the "bloated, out-of-control, out-of-touch Congress."
The specific charge of the day was that Mr. Torricelli, a five-term incumbent, has not one but two political action committees: one state and one Federal. 
 "It is one more example," Mr. Roma said in a voice strained by weeks of nonstop oral assaults, "one more example of what is wrong with Congress."
 
A Quick Response
 Mr. Torricelli, just back from Washington and campaigning elsewhere in the district, quickly fired off a response.
"Mr. Roma," he said, "is trying desperately to divert attention in this campaign from his extremist views against gun control and legalized abortion, and is willing to go to any length to avoid the real economic issues that legitimate candidates are debating nationwide."
So it has gone in the redrawn Ninth Congressional District in the Hackensack River Valley, anchored by Hackensack, the Meadowlands Sports Complex and a string of older ethnic towns like Rutherford.
Assemblyman Roma, a former Palisades Park Borough Council president who is in his third term in the Legislature, is running as much against the Congress as an institution as against Mr. Torricelli, whom he calls "the poster child for Congressional abuse."
Mr. Roma and his campaign staff routinely pass out checks made of rubber that are drawn on the "Bouncy Savings & Loan" to focus attention on Mr. Torricelli's record with the House Bank -- 27 overdrafts totaling $11,608 over 39 months.
They point to Mr. Torricelli's use of the House free-postage provision to mail $250,000 worth of letters to voters over the last 15 months, some of them to people in his new district. The courts subsequently told members of Congress that the free postage could not be used this way, to communicate with voters who are not yet constitutuents. And they point out that Mr. Torricelli voted to preserve the full free-mailing privilege when Congress was considering turning some of the money involved over to a fund for crack-addicted babies. Mr. Torricelli has rejected Mr. Roma's demand that he return the postage money.
Mr. Roma also points out repeatedly that Mr. Torricelli voted last year to raise the pay of members of Congress and was one of the chief supporters in the House of former Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, who resigned amid charges of corruption.
Echoing attacks that have been used against incumbents around the country, Mr. Roma says, all of this amounts to "a pattern of arrogance and abuse."
For his part, Mr. Torricelli has made good use of his imcumbency, putting $1.3 million in his campaign war chest, 10 times the $125,000 Mr. Roma has been able to raise.
When the candidates debate on Oct. 19 and 25, Mr. Torricelli will likely pursue two themes that have been central to his campaign: a charge of "waffling" because Mr. Roma changed his stand on abortion, and an accusation of "extremism," asserting that Mr. Roma catered to the politically powerful gun lobby by voting in the Legislature to repeal Gov. Jim Florio's ban on military-style semiautomatic firearms.
In his 1989 Assembly race, Mr. Roma filled out two questionnaires on abortion, saying in one that he was opposed to it, but in the other that he supported a woman's right to choose.
He has said that he simply changed his mind between questionnaires and that he now feels that abortion is "a woman's individual decision."
Despite the vigor of Mr. Roma's attacks on Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Roma's press secretary, Patrick Morrissey, acknowledges that Mr. Roma is trailing the incumbent, but maintains he is "within striking distance" of overtaking him by Election Day, Nov. 3.
Republican strategists are not so optimistic about the chances of their 43-year-old candidate, a lawyer and a former prosecutor in Fairview and Palisades Park. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, they cite the advantages of incumbency -- 98 percent of incumbents are re-elected -- and say the 41-year-old Congressman's $1.3 million bankroll gives an enormous advantage to Mr. Torricelli, a lawyer who has spent most of his life in politics and government, as an aide to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne and later as counsel to Vice President Walter F. Mondale.
Mr. Torricelli said he would use some of the money in coming weeks for a television advertising campaign attacking Mr. Roma on the abortion issue, support from pro-gun forces and his vote to repeal an increase in the state minimum wage. "Up until now," the Congressman said, "we have been doing positive ads."

HEADLINE: An Ideological Divide;
Concern Over Jobs Drives the Debate On North American Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
With President Bush overseeing today's initialing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in San Antonio, and with Gov. Bill Clinton cautiously endorsing the pact, its eventual approval by Congress would seem assured, were not nearly 10 million Americans out of work.
The approval of Congress, while still likely, is uncertain because of a chorus of increasingly blunt calls for the United States to pursue its self-interest more narrowly in all its trade and foreign aid policies. "I am all for helping poor nations develop their economies, but not at the expense of workers in Ohio and the rest of the United States," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio. 
 At the heart of the issue lies a deep ideological divide over whether affluence abroad means prosperity at home. The critical question, never resolved and seldom directly addressed, is whether constructing new factories overseas and lowering American customs duties on imports destroy more American jobs than they create.
Technology, managerial skills and investment money have become increasingly mobile, and this has facilitated building factories in countries with abundant supplies of cheap labor. The Bush Administration contends that economic development in Mexico and other poor countries, coupled with expanded trade, results in more American exports and a net job gain.
But some Rust Belt members of Congress contend that the result may be a net loss. Mr. Clinton has chosen a middle path, saying essentially that the effect on jobs depends on the details of how foreign aid and trade rules are written.
The current entanglement of employment, trade and foreign aid issues is not new. But the issues have become increasingly politicized as persistently high unemployment has coincided with Presidential and Congressional campaigns.
 Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican fighting for re-election, paralyzed the Senate for 15 hours on Monday and Tuesday with an unsuccessful filibuster aimed at raising import taxes so as to prevent the loss to Mexico of 875 typewriter manufacturing jobs at the Smith Corona plant in Cortland, N.Y. And the House and Senate passed legislation this week barring the nation's main foreign aid agency from bankrolling projects that may result in more American factories moving overseas.
The North American Free Trade Agreement has prompted the most bitter quarrels. Labor Secretary Lynn Martin inflamed the issue a month ago by disclosing at a Senate Finance Committee hearing that her department was bracing for the loss of up to 150,000 jobs because of the pact.
Ms. Martin and Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, also cite academic studies predicting that the agreement will create as many as 325,000 jobs. But labor unions charge that the pact will cost the livelihoods of 500,000 workers while creating very little, if any, new employment.
Mrs. Hills complained to several reporters on Monday that because it was difficult to review economic studies predicting job gains, "We have the wrong side of the sound bite -- it's easy to say it will cost jobs."
Mrs. Hills has tried to blunt the damage from Ms. Martin's remarks with two claims: that the 150,000 jobs would disappear over 10 years rather than immediately, and that the job losses would consist of jobs not being created rather than layoffs.
But Gary C. Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics here who wrote much of the study projecting the loss of 150,000 jobs and the gain of 325,000, said that he disagreed with both of Mrs. Hills's assertions. Mr. Hufbauer said that the 150,000 jobs would be layoffs spread over six or seven years.
The debate over job losses has frustrated many economists who have not weighed in with economic studies on either side. Most economists believe that a country's level of unemployment mainly reflects such variables as Government budget deficits, growth in the money supply, consumer confidence and the percentage of the nation's economic output that is reinvested.
As a result, these economists contend that the figures for net job losses or net job gains simply indicate changes in the number of people in export- and import-related industries, not the total number of people employed in the United States.
People who lose their jobs because of a surge in imports after the United States lowers tariffs are not likely to be unemployed for the rest of their lives. The question to ask is whether they find better-or worse-paying jobs.
Democrats have contended that people who lose manufacturing jobs tend to end up in the service sector earning less. Mrs. Hills cites a study by her aides that export-related jobs pay 17 percent more than the national average, while jobs protected by tariffs tend to be low-paying. She also says that American exports to developing countries grew six times as fast as exports to rich countries last year, and consisted mostly of manufactured goods.
A landmark study of more than 40,000 people in North Carolina affected by mass layoffs since 1986 found that they tended to find better-paying jobs after their periods of unemployment than they had before. People laid off by the low-paying apparel industry have done particularly well in their new jobs, said Alfred J. Field, a professor of economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is jointly overseeing the study with state government officials.
 
 
Caution on Study
 But North Carolina has a below-average unemployment rate, making it easier to find new jobs than in other states, Mr. Field cautioned. The average time needed to find a job has lengthened during the nation's recent economic stagnation, and it is unclear whether the increased wages after unemployment are enough to offset those lost during unemployment, he added.
Largely forgotten in the current American debate are the three billion people in very poor countries whose living standards are far below those of even unemployed Americans.
"It's one of those classic cases of a political conflict between moral commitments that are widely recognized -- and urgent, practical problems that are close to home," said Charles R. Beitz, the dean of academic affairs for Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me., and an author on issues of international justice. "The argument of justice is an argument for trade and foreign aid policies that lead to improvements in income levels and employment levels in less well-off societies."

Bond Prices Stage Sharp Retreat

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Bond prices plummeted yesterday, sending interest rates soaring, after the Federal Reserve dashed hopes for an expected rate cut.
There was speculation the Fed may now put off any further cut until after the election. 
 After the stock market recovered from a dizzying drop on Monday, the Fed may have felt easing was less critical.
"I think they will wait until after the election," said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw Hill.
The benchmark 30-year United States Treasury bond was down nearly a full point, and its yield shot up to 7.48 percent, from 7.40 percent on Tuesday.
 
Trigger for the Selloff
 The trigger for the selloff was the Fed's signal that it did not seek to lower interest rates and instead kept its key Federal funds target unchanged at 3 percent.
"They will probably sit through October and see what November brings," said Robert DiClemente, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers. "I don't see what would push them over the edge at this point if they haven't been persuaded so far."
Some economists criticized the Fed's failure to lower rates, even though the discount rate is already at a 30-year low of 3 percent.
"I think the Fed has generally been behind in easing," Mr. Wyss said. But with rates already so low, the Fed may feel that "they are in the position of the gunslinger with only three bullets," he said.
A disastrous reception for the Treasury's new $9.75 billion of seven-year notes also depressed the market, traders said.
"It is quite clear there are some negative after-effects from the Fed's failure to ease policy," said William Sullivan, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
"The market had priced itself for a 2.5 percent discount rate. When the Fed failed to cut the rate, it was almost complete information the Fed did not want to cut rates. The market had to re-price itself," he said.
Among short-term Treasury bills and notes, the two-year note was down 8/32 at 1007/32 , yielding 3.88 percent.
Rates on the three-month bill rose eight-hundredths of 1 percent, to 2.87 percent; the six-month rate rose six-hundredths of 1 percent, to 2.99 percent, and the one-year bill rate rose seven-hundredths , to 3.11 percent.

Problems Emerge in U.S.-Japan Auto Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Nine months after President Bush declared that his trade mission to Tokyo had yielded a milestone agreement to sell 20,000 more American cars in Japan every year, one major deal to implement the accord appears to have gone off track.
A deal between the world's two largest car makers, under which Toyota would sell General Motors cars to the Japanese public, had been hailed by Mr. Bush's aides during the ill-fated January trip as a prime example of how the Administration was coming home with what the President had termed "jobs, jobs, jobs" for Americans. 
 For most Americans, the content of what Mr. Bush called "agreements" -- for different reasons, both Japanese and American industry officials said later that they were not really agreements at all -- were lost amid various distractions. The most vivid was Mr. Bush's collapse at a state dinner, but there was also the much-criticized performance of his traveling companions, the highly paid chief executives of Detroit's Big Three auto makers facing off against their more modestly compensated Japanese counterparts.
In the ensuing nine months the "action plans" adopted during the visit have yielded mixed results. While sales of the Big Three's cars in Japan seem unchanged this year, American auto-parts makers have said that they are encouraged by a tremendous increase in the number of inquiries from Japanese makers, particularly Toyota.
Moreover, the number of American-made cars shipped to Japan is rising -- though not the cars Mr. Bush had in mind when he began the visit-turned-trade mission here. Most are Japanese-name cars produced in the North American plants of Japan's biggest auto companies and shipped back to Japanese consumers. Honda seems likely to sell more than 20,000 American-made Accords in Japan this year, and Toyota said recently that it would sell 700 American-made Camrys a month in the Japanese market.
"Legally, Japanese-badged cars made in America contribute to the goal in the action plan," said an American official dealing with Japanese trade issues. "But politically, they don't contribute much."
Indeed, the symbolic centerpiece of the effort was expected to be an arrangement between General Motors and Toyota that would have given G.M. access to the largest car sales network in Japan. Earlier, Toyota officials had talked of selling 5,000 G.M. cars a year.
But this week Tatsuro Toyoda, the company's president, said that "talks with G.M. regarding the sales of G.M. cars have not made progress."
Mr. Toyoda, a member of the firm's founding family, blamed G.M. for backing away from the effort in recent months because it did not want to undercut Yanase & Company, the importing agent it has used in Japan for 70 years.
"In consideration for the company," Mr. Toyoda was quoted by Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily, as saying, "G.M. is avoiding establishing another sales channel." But he said that Toyota still remained interested in "helping any way we can" and noted that it had put on a large exhibition of G.M. cars in Tokyo this summer.
A spokesman for General Motors' Asian headquarters here, David G. Bodkin, said today that "the discussions haven't stopped," but acknowledged that G.M. did not want to undercut Yanase.
"We are similar to the Japanese, and we value our long-term relationships," he said. Though it has been criticized in the past for not selling General Motors cars aggressively enough, Yanase has recently shown new signs of life: it will soon import Opels, made by G.M.'s European subsidiary.
Still, G.M. estimates that its sales in Japan this year will be about what they were last year, hovering around 10,000, a tiny sliver of a market of more than 7 million new cars a year. Mr. Bodkin did say, however, that the company expected about a 10 percent increase in sales of car parts here, a business that has grown rapidly for a decade.
 
Japan Has Its Own Problems
 Even if the General Motors-Toyota sales effort had gone ahead, it was highly doubtful that the American car makers would have seen the kind of advances Mr. Bush and Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, talked about in January.
Sales of all cars and trucks in Japan are down more than 6 percent, an effect of the enormous slowdown in the Japanese economy and a new conservatism among once free-spending Japanese consumers. Unless those figures change dramatically, which seems unlikely, this year will mark the first time since the end of World War II that Japanese car sales decreased for two consecutive years.
There are some signs of progress, however. The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation is reportedly talking to Chrysler about selling the American company's new LH models here. Ford, meanwhile, has purchased a larger share of its distributor here, Autorama, and seems to be paving the way for greater exports to Japan.
And all three of the American car makers have vowed to make the change that most embarrassed the President's aides: the failure of the Big Three to manufacture right-hand drive vehicles for export to Japan, where motorists drive on the left of the road.

Dollar Advances on Shifts In European Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday, partly in reaction to European shifts in interest rates and a drop in the United States bond market.
Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery rose 90 cents an ounce, to $351. The Republic National Bank said gold rose 60 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $350.60. 
 John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at ABN-Amro Bank N.V. in New York, said the dollar traded in a narrow band as traders waited vainly for moves by the Federal Reserve Bank and the German central bank to lower interest rates.
The key event of the day came later, Mr. McCarthy said, as the Dutch lowered an important short-term interest rate and the Swiss lowered a mortgage rate.
That kicked off selling of the Swiss franc against the dollar and the German mark, Mr. McCarthy said.
"That propelled the dollar higher," Mr. McCarthy said. With the Treasury bond market slumping, the dollar was helped even further, he said. When bond prices are lower, investors get higher yields.
"The dollar was purchased on the back" of those fluctuations, he added.
The dollar rose to 120.40 yen, up from 119.70 late Tuesday in New York. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a close of 119.78 yen from 119.79 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 120.05 yen.
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.7095, down from $1.7135 late Tuesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.7150, from $1.7115 late Tuesday.
 The pound rallied against other European currencies, closing at 2.4773 marks, compared with 2.4483 marks on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4490 marks, up from 1.4265; 1.2740 Swiss francs, up from 1.2465; 4.9170 French francs, up from 4.8400; 1,319.00 Italian lire, up from 1,311.50, and 1.2463 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2465.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Close to $1 a Pound And Expected to Go Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices sank closer to $1 a pound yesterday and analysts predicted that sluggish demand and rising supplies would soon push the price below that key psychological barrier.
On other commodity markets, oil futures rose, natural gas tumbled, and grains and soybeans as well as livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 A thin pool of traders in some markets because of the Yom Kippur holiday may have contributed to exaggerated price moves.
Copper for October delivery fell 0.85 cent, to $1.007 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, wiping out most of the gains posted earlier this week. The more heavily traded December contract also dropped 0.85 cent, to $1.017 a pound.
Copper last closed below $1 on May 6. The near-term delivery price peaked at $1.167 in mid-July, then began slipping as slowing economic activity reduced demand for the industrial metal.
"The market's been under siege as a result of the economic malaise we continue to be in on a global basis," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York.
The slide steepened in the last month; copper last traded above $1.10 on Sept. 8 and has gone "virtually straight down" since then, said Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
Platinum futures also fell, extending Tuesday's sharp drop amid increased pessimism about the economy. Platinum is used in car manufacturing.
October platinum deliveries fell $3.60, to $360 a troy ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Heating oil led petroleum futures higher on the New York Merc after a weekly American Petroleum Institute report released late Tuesday showed an unexpected decline in United States stocks of distillates, which include heating oil.
Natural gas fell sharply, extending the market's downward trend after prices reached a record high of $2.79 for 1,000 cubic feet last month on tight-supply fears.
Light sweet crude oil for November delivery rose 8 cents, to $21.89 a barrel. November heating oil rose 0.51 cent, to 63.83 cents a gallon. November unleaded gasoline rose 0.15 cent, to 58.61 cents a gallon. November natural gas fell 5 cents, to $2.39 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Wheat futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade on signs that China bought one million metric tons of Canadian wheat, sidestepping the United States market.
Corn and soybean futures ended unchanged ahead of today's monthly Agriculture Department crop report, which will contain new production estimates for those crops.
Wheat for December delivery settled 2 1/2 cents lower at $3.43 1/4 a bushel. December corn finished unchanged at $2.10 3/4 a bushel. December oats slipped 1/2 cent, to $1.33 1/4 a bushel. November soybeans were unchanged at $5.30 3/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Prudential (Britain) Sale

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The Prudential Corporation, Britain's largest insurance company, said today that it had agreed to sell its Canadian general insurance business to the British insurer General Accident P.L.C. for $132 million.
The sale is subject to Canadian regulatory approval, Prudential said in a statement. The company has no connection with the United States insurer. 
 Prudential said it was selling the unit because of plans to continue selling general insurance only where it complemented the company's life and pension activities.
General Accident said the purchase would make it the market leader in the Canadian general insurance market and also bring into the group businesses with a strong record and good prospects for further growth.
It said it believed there were opportunities to improve the profitability of the Canadian operations by reducing expenses through economies of scale but gave no further details. General Accident said it had businesses throughout Canada, with particular strength in Ontario.
The acquisition enhances activities in other parts of Canada, especially Quebec, it said.
Prudential's Canadian general insurance business had net premiums in 1991 of $240 million, ranking it 17th in the Canadian market with a market share of approximately 1.6 percent.
Prudential also has a life, health and pension business in Canada, with gross revenue premiums in 1991 of $450 million, which is unaffected by the sale.

HEADLINE: Trading Tips on Repairs

 BODY:
AN old building may possess charm, historical significance and fine workmanship. It also usually needs repairs.
Rehabitat, a convention and trade show devoted to the restoration and renovation of buildings, opens today and runs through Saturday at the Hyatt Regency in Miami. It is expected to attract 40 exhibitors, said Katherine Ann Cox, the show's manager. 
 Among the exhibitors will be artisans who specialize in techniques like gilding and decorative painting. Others will include makers of products ranging from reproduction doorknobs to a liquid epoxy that penetrates old wood and restrengthens it.
"Building restoration is here to stay, whether the economy is up or down," said Marsha Caporaso, the executive vice president of Abatron Inc., an exhibitor from Gilberts, Ill., that makes products like Wood Epox, which patches wood. "People aren't just restoring because they can't afford to buy a home," she said. "Restoration has a lot to do with how people feel about their communities, their identity with their community and their historical roots."
Jeff Greene, the president of Evergreene Painting Studios Inc. in Manhattan, specializes in decorative painting. In July, he was in Bophuthatswana, a nominally independent ethnic homeland in South Africa, where he painted murals and gilded ceilings and domes at the Palace of the Lost City, a new hotel.
In the United States, the preservation movement is growing, said Mr. Greene, whose company has done restoration work at the Alexander Hamilton Custom House in Manhattan. Mr. Greene, an exhibitor, said he would attend Rehabitat to learn new techniques, like how to go about reattaching damaged plaster.
Rehabitat is sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Information on the show is available by calling (305) 358-0594.

Petrovic Career as a Net May Not Go Past 1993

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
While they attempt to re-sign the free agent small forward, Chris Morris, and fill the vacancy created by the departure of Terry Mills, another financial and personnel crisis may be slowly developing for the New Jersey Nets.
After a workout at the Nets' practice facility in North Bergen, N.J. earlier this week, Drazen Petrovic, their leading scorer last season, said he has already received six preliminary offers from teams in Italy and Spain for next season. 
 "Two from Spain and four from Italy," said Petrovic, who said he has instructed his agent, Los Angeles-based Warren Legarie, to press the European teams for a sense of how much they would be willing to pay for the shooting guard, who will turn 28 later this month.
 
Friends Make Big Money
 He pointed out that his friends and teammates on the Croatian National Team, Dino Radja and Toni Kukoc, earn $3 million and $2.5 million a year playing in Italy.
Petrovic, who will be a restricted free agent following the coming season, will earn roughly $1.5 million for 1992-93. Given his popularity in Europe, where he played several seasons before joining the Portland Trail Blazers in 1989 and returned to lead Croatia to a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympics, Petrovic is certain to attract offers that would at least double his current income.
While it is highly probable that the Nets would be willing to pay him in the $3 million-a-year range, Petrovic added that he does not intend to use the European offers as leverage to force the Nets into extending his contract within the next few months because he doesn't yet know if he willwant to return.
"I wouldn't want to sign a three- or four-year deal with the Nets right now," he said. "I want to see how things work out this year.
"I'm not satisfied with being one of the 16 teams that makes the playoffs but then goes out in the first round. I'm committed to winning. I want it to be a situation where everyone is committed, where there's a work ethic and people work hard over the summer. If we are going to be building a championship caliber team with Chuck Daly, then I'd stay."
It seems unlikely that Petrovic, having established himself as an offensive force in the National Basketball Association and having recently obtained his green card, would prefer to play in Europe. But knowing that he could get equal compensation and be closer to his family in Zagreb will give him a powerful bargaining chip should he want to leave the Nets, who would have no right of first refusal if he signed with a team in Europe.
Petrovic's reluctance to commit long-term to the Nets is undoubtedly the aftertaste of the inner turmoil that gripped the Nets last season, when, among other blood feuds, there was some bitterness between Petrovic and some of the other Nets, like Morris and Derrick Coleman.
 
Playoff Frustrations
 Near the conclusion of the team's final playoff game against Cleveland, Petrovic and Morris had an angry exchange, after which, according to Sam Bowie, Petrovic refused to play the last couple of minutes. Petrovic denied benching himself, and instead blamed the frustration of the Nets having blown a large lead and a game that would have forced a Game 5 showdown.
His wait-and-see attitude on the coming season, nonetheless, reflects a concern about the ability of his younger teammates to eliminate the pettiness and focus solely on winning.
"Hopefully," said Petrovic, "he'll have more control and there won't be all that off-the-court stuff."
 
REBOUNDS
 CHUCKY BROWN, a 6-foot-8-inch, free-agent forward was signed yesterday by the Nets to a one-year contract. Brown, drafted in 1989 by Cleveland out of North Carolina State, has averaged 6.9 points and 2.8 rebounds in his N.B.A. career. The Cavaliers waived Brown in December, and he was picked up by the Los Angeles Lakers. "Chucky has been a good performer in his first three years and has experience as a starter," said General Manager WILLIS REED. "We are always looking to strengthen our team and improve our depth and Chucky can fill a role for us." The Nets did not announce terms of the deal.

Oh Canada, the Land of Major League Angst

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
The nice Canadian gent sat at his desk, jotting a note. Having just learned that his customer was a reporter in town for Toronto's almost annual American League playoff elimination, he dared ask the question that's undoubtedly on the minds of millions north of the border.
"What happens if the Blue Jays go to the World Series?" he said without looking up from his note pad. 
"What do you mean," the reporter replied, warily.
"Well," he explained, "won't the Americans be angry?"
Oh, dear. Oh, Canada. Oh, come now.
There is no reason for Canadians to fear an American backlash against a non-American team making it to the World Series for the first time. Unfortunately, that does not mean the sentiment is not real, even if the perception proves to be false. And, indeed, in a walk through conversations, in perusals of news clippings, the theme that Americans would care or even disapprove runs strong.
Even worse, all kinds of reasons abound about why the Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos will never be permitted to advance to baseball nirvana, some based on humor, others on a rather paranoid belief that the two teams have somehow been plotted against for a long, long time. Among the villains that would seem make-believe to others but very real here are the following:
*Major League Baseball and CBS. Xenophobia and fear of zero ratings fuel this theory. And baseball does possess both; just ask the Japanese and poor, poor CBS. By the way, just why has CBS bumped the Jays-A's games from prime time this weekend, but not the Pittsburgh Pirates against America's team,  the Atlanta Braves? Hmmm.
*Umpires. Former Blue Jays outfielder George Bell fueled this one by once accusing umpires of being both anti-Dominican and anti-Canadian after a call went against him. This doubled the paranoia for sure, since the Jays employ a great number of players from the Dominican Republic.
*The Mafia. (The argument: What red-blooded American would bet with his bookie in a World Series involving Canadians? But no one bets on baseball, anyway. Right?)
The questions, the suspicions, the angst sometimes land right in the lap of official baseball. For instance, just over a month ago, when the Expos and Blue Jays were very much involved in division races, Fay Vincent, who was then the commissioner, was asked during a news conference here what he would do if the two teams actually advanced to the World Series.
One expected a punch line, but when it went unspoken, Vincent assured the earnest questioner that he and the rest of baseball would merely be happy for two hard-working franchises. (What the 26 owners who now run baseball would have done remains a mystery, but that's a scene from another conspiracy.)
It's all such a shame, for three very good reasons. First, Canada truly seems to be a most beloved neighbor. After all, here it sits, on the other side of the longest unarmed border in the world, never hissing at us, never snubbing or embarrassing its friend and ally for the sake of embarrassment alone.
Patrick Buchanan has never suggested the United States build a big wall to keep Canadians out. How many other so-called friends of the United States have been described with so little acrimony in those quarters?
Canada, earning the everlasting gratitude of Americans, saved United States citizens in Teheran during the Iran hostage crisis. And if there's any doubt about which move touched Americans, just remember which episode inspired a made-for-TV movie. To the best of our knowledge, the networks aren't beating down George Bush's door to talk scripts about that hostage thing.
The most serious gripe in recent decades seemed to be a battle over beer. And since Canadian beer trucks are again being spotted south of the border, peace must have been restored.
The second reason Canadians should just stop worrying about Americans and concentrate on their Jays is this: Americans are probably not worrying about them at all, for the simple and unfortunate reason that a lot of Americans, having signed off on subjects like geography and social studies long ago, don't know enough about Canada to have an opinion.
At every turn this week, Canadians have shown an eagerness to discuss the coming Presidential race. That little drama occurs every four years and is not nearly as unprecedented as what is occurring in Canada. For Canada is on the verge of voting, in non-binding fashion, whether or not to let French-speaking Quebec be a distinct society.
A yes/oui vote in what is known as the Charlottetown Accord will mean Canadians approve; a no/non vote means all provinces remain equal. In the end, an evolution of any sort could signal the beginning of the end of the Canadian nation as it is known.
But do Americans know or even pay attention to such an important referendum? Apparently about as much as vox populi paid to the currency crisis and European Economic Community vote in France (wasn't there something close to an economic meltdown over there?)
Sad truth is, more attention has been paid stateside to whether Ross Perot and the New York Jets could win their respective races than to the yes and no votes in France and Canada.
Now that probably won't do much for any inferiority complexes Canadians might feel, which apparently exist if the words of former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson are any indication ("Look at us too long and we feel uncomfortable. Don't look at us at all and we will feel worse.")
But most of all, Canadians should just stop fretting for the third and most compelling reason: America has been bracing for years for one or even two World Series sites outside the United States. After all, the Astros and the Rangers could lasso this thing one day and take it to the Lone Star state of Texas.

Barry Bonds Is Not Yet Mr. October

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THE Pirates keep letting Barry Bonds down. They are not holding up to their end of the bargain. That is to say, his bargain.
Having already staggered through two dreadful league series the last two years, Bonds jokingly asked his teammates to carry him through this year's championships. But the Pirates botched it for the second straight time yesterday, by a 13-5 score, and Bonds did not help by failing to hit the cutoff man to accelerate a four-run inning and losing a blooper that opened a crushing five-run rally. 
 Bonds is having one of the classic extended fall staggers of any superior hitter. Even with his single touching off a belated four-run rally yesterday, Bonds is 1 for 6, which fits right in with his .167 in 1990 and his .148 in 1991.
"Barry Bonds is trying to hit a five-run homer," said Manager Jim Leyland. "Barry Bonds is trying to make unbelievable plays. He's pressing a bit."
"They all say that, man," Bonds said when he heard the manager's remarks. "We always play this way. We only press weights."
Bonds makes the point that he is not the only one. Andy Van Slyke, who hit .324 this season, is hitting .111 in this series to go along with his inelegant averages of .091 and .208 and .160 in three previous league series. But Van Slyke is set for years in Pittsburgh; Bonds is seeking an eight-digit contract somewhere next year, as a savior for a major-market team.
Ball players would not be ball players without sarcastic self-directed humor -- it is part of their charm -- but one can hardly imagine Ted Williams or Stan Musial or Henry Aaron using gallows humor about somebody else carrying the load for a while.
"I told them, 'I'll get you to the playoffs,' " Bonds recalled the other day. "Now they've got to get me through them and I'll see we win the World Series."
He had better not hold his fire too long. The Pirates are relying on a knuckleballing reformed first baseman, Tim Wakefield, to pull them out of the ditch tomorrow against a two-time 20-game winner, Tom Glavine.
One can feel the gloom gathering in Pittsburgh, already depressed by the national economy as well as a newspaper strike and a machinists walkout at USAir.
This team was put together intelligently with an excellent manager, but the city's financial problems may be crippling the Pirates short of the World Series.
There was not enough money to keep Bobby Bonilla after last season. Bonds is not shy about noting, "I've played 162 games and I've been pitched around a lot," which did not happen so much when Bobby Bo was hitting behind him.
Would a third October slump expose Bonds as a star not quite ready for the pressure of the biggest cities? Look what happened to Bonilla when he slumped and waffled in his hometown.
Bonds says he isn't worried about any slump, but he rudely walked away from a CBS interview yesterday when somebody mentioned the S-word. He is a man of contradictions, who 15 minutes later conducted an open seminar with scruffy newspaper types.
"I could care less," he said of the slump talk. "It ain't bothering me none. If it was just me, I'd pitch and catch and play first base and bat every time. But this isn't the Barry Bonds Show."
The statistics are a burden for a player who hit .301, .292 and .311 the last three seasons. The Pirates reportedly have offered him $60 million over the next 30 years, which wouldn't mean much if the dollar should go the way of the Italian lira or the Russian ruble, but somebody is going to pay a lot of up-front money for him.
Maybe it will even be Atlanta. Bonds was physically buddy-buddying it with Dave Justice and Terry Pendleton around the batting cage yesterday, and he admitted: "I could fit in with the Braves real easy. They've already got a .300 hitter in Terry Pendleton. They could have two."
Then he added: "Right now I'm a Pirate. I love my teammates and that's all that matters."
He relies on them enough to share the burden: "You know how guys talk. You try to put a positive influence on something. Lloyd McClendon was in a slump and he said, 'I'm not doing anything. I'm gonna carry this team,' and he hit a grand slam in New York. I just said, 'Get me past Atlanta.' I can do my job. I don't lack any confidence."
Who knows? Barry Bonds could be a potential Reggie Jackson, a Mr. Late October. He could be the next Brian Doyle or a latter-day Mark Lemke, a couple of mice who roared in the World Series. But Van Slyke and the rest had better get on the stick, or we will never know.

No More Hawks and Doves

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Bill Clinton is actually doing something important in this campaign. He is trying to replace the old hawk-dove divide by exploring new standards for U.S. military intervention. He is also groping for a new American internationalism for a messy new world where threats are largely economic and foreign and domestic matters have become inseparable.
But it is virtually impossible to get a debate going on these ideas. The Bush-Baker crowd, ever searching for an election-reversing glob of magical slime, chooses not to engage. In fact, President Bush has not devoted a speech to national security in months. Instead, he typically accuses Mr. Clinton of being a closet dove hiding behind waffling rhetoric. 
 Typically, the press sets off on the trail of this well-designed hare. Alas, the hare must then be cornered before the larger debate on future U.S. foreign policy can begin.
The press game of psycho-historical analysis starts just where the Bush-Baker crowd desires -- with Vietnam. Supposedly, old draft-dodger Clinton was so traumatized by that war that he lacks the guts and moral stature to send Americans off to fight.
What odd and hypocritical logic. Yes, many liberals were so traumatized. But no one was more chastened on the use of force than Vietnam hawks like Republican conservatives, right-wingers and the U.S military. Few put up stiffer resistance to military action in Iraq and Bosnia than Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell. Patrick Buchanan, the self-proclaimed tough guy, wanted no part of the gulf war.
To be sure, Mr. Clinton's initial position on Iraq was fuzzier than he subsequently claimed. He did struggle over what to do. But not much more than General Powell, who is still rightly revered.
It no longer makes any sense to speak of hawks and doves. Vietnam was Vietnam. The cold war was the cold war. The two old battlegrounds -- whether to send armed forces to fight "Soviet surrogates" in the third world and how much to spend on defense -- have largely vanished. Hawks like former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger opposed intervention against Iraq. Doves like former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance favor much tougher action against the Serbs than most traditional hawks will even contemplate.
The old hawks are regrouping around the classic isolationist standard: Use force only when U.S. interests and territory could be directly and militarily threatened. That yardstick allows most of them to advocate force against countries like Iraq that develop nuclear and long-range missile capabilities. But it shuts the door on responding to other kinds of threats or protecting other American values.
That narrowness troubles Mr. Clinton and the old doves. They too would respond to direct threats, but not automatically with force. And they also want to respond militarily in other cases. They would employ a small U.S. force to control civil violence in Somalia or southern Iraq, simply to feed people and save lives. They would use force in limited and specific ways in Bosnia both to stop the slaughter and to guard broader U.S. interests in Europe.
As they see it, Serbian violence in Bosnia drives refugees westward, putting undue pressure on West European economies and creating dangerous political instability in Germany. Also, failing to check the Serbs in Bosnia might invite them to move against Albanians in Kosovo. This could draw Turkey and Greece into a wider war. Such situations threaten all kinds of U.S. economic-strategic interests.
Mr. Clinton is working at these tough issues. Yet the Bush-Baker crowd dismisses serious churning as waffling. Perhaps they have lost the capacity to distinguish between waffling and thinking. Perhaps they are so stuck in old-think that they cannot see the need to redefine American interests -- at the very moment when narrow economic fears could drive the nation to a new form of isolationism.
There are few votes in these issues for either candidate. No banners will be raised to advance Mr. Bush's charges of Mr. Clinton's dovishness or to celebrate Mr. Clinton's thoughtfulness. Which makes it all the more troubling that George Bush and James Baker, who have much to contribute on national security matters, offer nothing but trivial slime.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers a Managed Health-Care Plan;
Not Pay or Play

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On Sept. 24, Gov. Bill Clinton addressed the nation's health care crisis and described his plan for comprehensive reform of the system. It was an impressive performance by a man concerned about the skyrocketing costs and diminishing accessibility of health care in the United States.
However, "Clinton Proposes Making Employers Cover Health Care," your Sept 25 front-page report on the speech, asserts that Governor Clinton's plan would allow employers "to enroll their workers in a public program" -- in other words, a pay-or-play system. 
 This is not the case. Governor Clinton's plan calls for mandatory purchase of health insurance by all employers for all employees. There is no payroll tax or buy-in to a public system option for employers in the Clinton plan.
For those relatively few businesses too small or too economically fragile to afford health insurance, a weaning-in period and fiscal incentives would help make certain that everyone gets access to care. Small businesses would join purchasing networks to increase their buying power. Health insurance purchases would be made through a private system, sustaining the way Americans are used to receiving care, with consumer choice of doctor and hospital.
What controls the cost of the system under Mr. Clinton's plan are national and state boards made up of consumers, doctors and business representatives. The boards would oversee a national and state-by-state budgeting process that would stop the upward cost spiral and determine a clear benefit package of covered health services, for both outpatients and inpatients.
For many in the health professions, the last 12 years have been a nightmare of growing bureaucracy, paperwork, government intrusion and prohibitive costs. All this has gone unchecked and unnoticed by President Bush until the 11th hour of this campaign season. It's no wonder he's lost credibility as a leader in this critical area. And that many health professionals are for the first time supporting a Democratic candidate for President.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Tight Race in Texas In a Sign of Vulnerability for Bush

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Underscoring the Republicans' vulnerability even in states they once counted on, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that President Bush is locked in a tight race with Gov. Bill Clinton in the critical state of Texas.
The poll shows Mr. Bush with a narrow edge in Texas, with the backing of 41 percent of the voters to 37 percent for Mr. Clinton, a lead that is within the poll's margin of sampling error. It also shows that Ross Perot, who was widely expected to be more popular in his home state of Texas than almost anywhere else, has the backing of a modest 11 percent. 
 Mr. Bush's standing in Texas is more comfortable than his standing in the nationwide polls, which this week showed him trailing Mr. Clinton by anywhere from 8 to 17 percentage points. But Texas, with its 32 electoral votes, is by almost any reckoning a must-have state for the Republicans if they hope to reach the 270 electoral votes necessary to win. The fact that Mr. Bush has yet to lock it up, 26 days before the election, is a grim omen.
 
Hurdles Facing Bush
 Other state polls compiled this week by the Hotline, a political newsletter in Washington, show Mr. Bush still scrambling to secure many of the states across the Sun Belt that have been reliable parts of a Republican majority for years. "It's too close in the base states," acknowledged Fred Steeper, a poll taker for the Bush campaign.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton retains a double-digit lead in California, which by itself provides one-fifth of the electoral votes needed to win. The Hotline compilation also shows Mr. Clinton with big margins across most of the Northeast, and substantial leads in some of the big battleground states of the Midwest.
In Illinois, for example, a Chicago Tribune poll conducted Sept. 26-28 showed Mr. Clinton with a 20-point margin; in Michigan, a Detroit News poll conducted Oct. 1-2 showed Mr. Clinton with a 13-point lead.
The electoral map, in short, suggests an even more daunting challenge for Mr. Bush than the national polls on the popular vote do. "It reinforces just how difficult this election is," said Neil Newhouse, a Republican poll taker. "The states on which we had traditionally depended for our 'electoral lock' simply aren't there this year or have moved into the competitive state category."
Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, argued that the Republican-leaning states would quickly firm up if the campaign could generate some momentum nationally and begin to shift the nationwide polls by five or six points.
"We'd definitely be in the game in the final days," Mr. Black said. "And Clinton's negatives are going up, which is a precursor of good things on the ballot."
But David Wilhelm, manager of the Clinton campaign, said: "The tables are completely turned from 1988; they have the thread-the-needle challenge at this point. It's not a good position to be in in politics to have to worry about your base with three weeks to go."
 
Crucial Role of Debates
 All of this highlights the importance of the Presidential debates that begin Sunday and that are widely seen as Mr. Bush's last chance to reopen the race.
The New York Times/CBS News Poll of Texas, conducted Monday through Wednesday, was based on telephone interviews with 1,227 registered voters and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Texas is always important in Presidential politics, but rarely more so than this year, when the Republicans badly need it to offset the Democrats' strength in California. It is a Republican-leaning state in Presidential elections: Four years ago, even with a native son, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, on the Democratic ticket as Michael S. Dukakis's running mate, Mr. Bush carried Texas with 56 percent of the vote, and Ronald Reagan carried it easily in 1980 and 1984.
But the new poll shows the same trends that are hurting Mr. Bush nationally are hurting him in his adopted state: Economic issues dominate the agenda in Texas; 75 percent of the voters in Texas said the economy was "bad" or "very bad," and just 23 percent approve of Mr. Bush's economic stewardship.
The poll also suggests that Mr. Perot may be draining support from Mr. Bush; in a two-man race, Mr. Bush had a six-point advantage, while in a three-man race, that lead shrank to four. Still, Mr. Perot seemed to be having only a slight effect in Texas, although the poll was largely conducted before his television advertising began.
In general, Mr. Perot's return to the campaign was greeted with only slightly more enthusiasm in Texas than it was nationally; only 13 percent of the registered voters in Texas had a favorable opinion of Mr. Perot, while 53 percent expressed an unfavorable view. And only 22 percent of the registered voters said Mr. Perot did the right thing in returning to the race, while 67 percent said he should have stayed out.
 
Florida as Battleground
 Aside from Texas, Florida, with its 25 electoral votes, is the other essential anchor for a Republican victory. A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted there a month ago showed a similarly tight race, and Mr. Clinton has campaigned heavily there in recent days, indicating the Democrats still see the state in competition.
Elsewhere in the South, which is ordinarily a Republican stronghold, polls in the important states of North Carolina (14 electoral votes) and Georgia (13 electoral votes) have shown Clinton leads in recent weeks.
In short, the Democrats now have the luxury of directing resources and time deep into Republican territory, while the Republican options for assembling a majority in the electoral college are growing more and more constrained.
"The fact that we are able to contemplate really putting Texas and Florida into play in the last three weeks is a situation we really didn't expect some months ago," Mr. Wilhelm said.
 
How the 2 Polls Were Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted last Friday through Sunday with 1,252 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Of those interviewed, 994 said they were registered voters.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
In addition, throughout the state of Texas interviews were conducted Monday through Wednesday with 1,568 adults, of whom 1,227 said they were registered voters. The sample of Texas telephone numbers was provided by Survey Sampling, Inc. of Fairfield, Conn. Respondents were interviewed in English or Spanish.
For both polls, one adult within each household was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results of each poll have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations relating to region, race, sex and age. The national poll was also weighted by education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points either way from what would have been obtained by seeking out all registered voters in the respective population.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for male voters in Texas it is plus or minus five percentage points, while for female voters in Texas it is plus or minus four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Vietnam War;
Campaign Focus on Vietnam Reviving Debates of the 60's

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY with DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
In the fall and winter of 1969, several important things happened in the life of a bright, ambitious young man named Bill Clinton.
After months of elaborate effort, he finally beat the draft for the Vietnam War, drawing a number high enough in the new national lottery that he would never be inducted. He became, in a small way, a figure within the antiwar movement, helping to organize one of the largest marches on Washington the movement ever produced and serving as a chief organizer of two small demonstrations in London. He took a trip through the Scandinavian countries, Russia and Czechoslovakia. 
 In later years, as Mr. Clinton charted the political course toward his childhood dream of the Presidency, he did not often publicly speak of the events of that year, and when he did, it was in vague and passive terms, as if he had been a sort of accidental tourist of his times.
 
'Just a Fluke'
 To hear Mr. Clinton bear reluctant witness to his past, it had been "just a fluke" that he was never drafted. Of peace demonstrations, he remembered only that he had "attended two or three, to hear the speeches."
Now, in the fall of 1992, with Mr. Clinton close to his goal, those who would stop him have turned their increasingly frightened attention to events 23 years ago, hoping to find in them something that will convince voters that a change from George Bush is not worth the risk of Bill Clinton.
The Bush campaign's effort to use episodes from Mr. Clinton's past to embarrass him began with accusations from surrogates and finally, this week, from the President himself. [Page A20.]
 
What the Story Shows
 The story, as far as it is clear, of Mr. Clinton's antiwar activities in 1969 and what he and the Republicans alike are saying about that in 1992 is illustrative of several points about that time and this one.
It shows, as Democrats are saying publicly and even some Republicans are saying privately, how desperate the Republicans have become. It shows, as Republicans like to say, how Mr. Clinton has tended to shade the edges of his life.
But above all, it shows how sharp the difference remains between Mr. Bush's world and Mr. Clinton's, between the clear moral absolutes of the generation of World War II and the muddied gropings of those who came of age during the Vietnam War.
The exact nature of Mr. Clinton's antiwar activities has been confused by both Republican exaggeration and Democratic obfuscation. But a basic outline seems clear.
Although Mr. Clinton has described his participation in peace demonstrations as limited to that almost of a curious passer-by, the candidate's previous statements and those of several friends and of antiwar protesters indicate a more substantial involvement. Mr. Clinton was a chief organizer of two London rallies in the fall of 1969 and also helped, to an apparently much lesser degree, organize the huge march on Washington on Oct. 15, 1969.
Yet, if Mr. Clinton appears to have minimized his activities, it also appears true that the Republicans are wrong to depict him, as they have in an escalating campaign that critics have called red-baiting, as a major antiwar organizer or Communist sympathizer.
No evidence has surfaced indicating that the young Mr. Clinton ever took part in any violent political actions or was an important antiwar organizer, or was ever radicalized in the process. And despite many Republican insinuations to the contrary, neither has evidence been produced to indicate that Mr. Clinton's 1969 trip to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia was financed or controlled by the Soviet Government.
Indeed, many of those involved with Mr. Clinton at the time recall him as something of a milquetoast by the fire-breathing standards of late 1960's radicalism, a young man driven by a desire to remake his country, not to reject it.
It is also clear that the actions of the 23-year-old Mr. Clinton -- in avoiding military induction, in demonstrating against the foreign policy of the United States, even in traveling to the Soviet Union -- were not unusual in the context of his generation. Indeed, they were almost prototypical of those who, like Mr. Clinton, were part of the intellectual elite of that generation.
 
A Generation Apart
 But if Mr. Clinton was typical of his class and time, the actions of that class and the tenor of that time was not at all typical of American history; no other generation has ever acted in quite the fashion as Mr. Clinton's did, nor stirred more unresolved passions. Now, in the person of Mr. Clinton, American voters face for the first time the possibility that a generation that once took to the streets to publicly denounce America will lead it.
What is unknown -- but will be known on Nov. 3 -- is whether it matters much anymore.
As Mr. Clinton pointed out today, "Mr. Bush in his Inaugural Address had a wonderful phrase about how the Vietnam War cleaves us still and it was time to put it behind us." He added, "And now, because he's behind, he's tried to raise all the challenges of that time."
The Republican campaign to paint Mr. Clinton as a man with a secretly militant history began on Sept. 18, the first night of eight in which a quartet of conservative Congressmen took to the deserted floor of the House of Representatives to denounce Mr. Clinton for the benefit of C-Span cameras.
The speeches of Representatives Robert K. Dornan, Randy (Duke) Cunningham and Duncan Hunter, all Republicans from California, and Sam Johnson, Republican of Texas, were extraordinary for a level of violent, hyperbolic accusations that echoed the red-baiting rhetoric of 40 years ago.
In nightly tirades, the speakers described Mr. Clinton as a "useful idiot" to the Soviet Government, as a man who, in other countries would have been "tried as a traitor or even shot," as a "full-time organizer for demonstrations against his country in a foreign country," as a man "directly responsible" for the deaths of American military men in Vietnam. They compared the Democratic Presidential nominee to Tokyo Rose, the anti-American radio propagandist of World War II, and to Ho Chi Minh, the Communist leader of North Vietnam.
On Wednesday, Mr. Bush himself picked up the brush.
"I cannot for the life of me understand mobilizing demonstrations and demonstrating against your own country, no matter how strongly you feel, when you are in a foreign land," Mr. Bush said, in an interview on the CNN program "Larry King Live." "Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but to go to a foreign country and demonstrate against your own country when your sons and daughters are dying halfway around the world, I am sorry but I think that is wrong."
 
Clinton Forced to Respond
 Mr. Clinton was forced to respond, and did so today, calling Mr. Bush "desperate" and saying he felt "really sad" for him.
Mr. Clinton said, as he has always said, that he had been an outspoken opponent of the war, but defended his activities in 1969 as innocent and minor. He said he "helped put together a teach-in at the University of London" and that had been "the only thing I ever helped put together." He acknowleged that he had "participated" in a demonstration at the American embassy.
Mr. Clinton's own words, included in a letter he wrote on Dec. 3, 1969, appear to belie the claim that he organized, or helped to organize, only one event, the teach-in.
"I have written and spoken and marched against the war," he wrote in a letter to the director of the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University of Arkansas, explaining why he had reneged on a commitment to join the program. "After I left Arkansas last summer, I went to Washington to work in the national headquarters of the Moratorium, then to England to organize the Americans here for demonstrations Oct. 15 and Nov. 16."
The "Moratorium" Mr. Clinton referred to was one of two enormous international antiwar protests of 1969, culminating in a huge protest march in Washington on "Vietnam Moratorium Day," Oct. 15.
David Mixner, a national co-chairman of the Moratorium, recalls Mr. Clinton as "not at all a major player in the antiwar movement" but as someone who helped, in a small way, in the summer of 1969 to organize the fall protests.
"He did some weeks of volunteer work that summer," said Mr. Mixner, who now runs a political consulting business in Los Angeles. "But he was not a full-time employee nor a full-time volunteer. He assisted, I remember that, but if you asked me how, I couldn't tell you. He might have been stuffing envelopes."
In the fall, Mr. Clinton returned to England for his second year in the Rhodes scholar program at Oxford. On Moratorium Day, about 300 people, mostly American students, demonstrated peacefully outside the American Embassy in London. The rally featured two well-known figures, the actor Paul Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward. It is apparently this rally that Mr. Clinton claims in his December 1969 letter to have organized.
Ira Magaziner, who was a fellow student at Oxford in 1969 and is now a senior economics adviser to the Clinton campaign, said he remembered the October rally but did not recall Mr. Clinton as an organizer. Like several of Mr. Clinton's friends of that time who were interviewed this week, he remembers the student from Arkansas as intensely interested in issues like the war and racism, but not as a radical.
 
'Very Conventional Group'
 "This was a very conventional group of people, not people who were burning flags or shouting 'pig' at the police," he said. "This was a group of people who had succeeded at school and were in the mainstream in their campuses and believed very much in solutions within the system."
On Nov. 15, in conjunction with the second major wave of protests in America, another demonstration was held in front of the American Embassy at Grosvenor Square. This rally, known as "the March of Death," was larger than the October rally, drawing about 1,500 people, who filed silently in front of the embassy. The marchers bore a coffin and, according to a contemporary account, carried cards with the names of servicemen who died in Vietnam. They walked to a megaphone in front of the embassy, called out the name and then dropped the card into a makeshift coffin.
Republicans have said Mr. Clinton took part in this demonstration and even helped negotiate with American Embassy officials to take the coffin inside. It is not clear if this is true.
What is clear, both by his own account and those of others present, is that Mr. Clinton played a role in organizing a related, but separate, demonstration on Nov. 16, which also took place at the American Embassy and across the square at St. Mark's Church.
That rally was peaceful, according to both witnesses and news accounts, but pointed in its message of disapproval of American conduct in the war. "We marched past the steps of the American Embassy," said Richard Stearns, a Rhodes scholar who is now a circuit court judge in Massachusetts. "I remember we all laid little white crosses on the steps, in silence, one by one, and then marched across the square to the church."
These same accounts -- and all verifiable accounts to date -- also argue strongly against Republican claims and insinuations that Mr. Clinton was either a major organizer of antiwar protests or a radical one.
In the case of the Nov. 16 rally, for instance, Mr. Clinton's friends recall that he wished to hold the rally a day later than the "March of Death" affair precisely because he thought the larger demonstration would be too radical.
Mr. Stearns said that while there were many radical and Communist-influenced groups involved in the antiwar protests in London at that time, Mr. Clinton shunned them. "They were pretty much over the edge of what Bill considered respectable," he said.
A second aspect of Mr. Clinton's activities that has come under heavy Republican assault is a 40-day trip in late 1969 and early 1970 to several Northern European and Eastern bloc countries, including the Soviet Union. Mr. Clinton has been vague about the details of the trip, and his New Year's Eve visit to Moscow in 1969 has been the subject of the most searing attacks by Republicans.
Mr. Bush elevated the attack on the issue on Wednesday evening. During an appearance on "Larry King Live" he asked about the trip. "I don't want to tell you what I really think," Mr. Bush said, adding, "To go to Moscow, one year after Russia crushed Czechoslovakia, not remember what you saw there."

HEADLINE: California to Decide if Doctors Can Aid in Suicide

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Losing a desperate battle against ovarian cancer, Darlena Risley died in the arms of her husband eight years ago after agonized discussions about his helping put her to death if the pain became unbearable.
Her death in a rented apartment by the sea in the Bahamas, where the couple had gone in search of an unproven cure, has now led to a measure on the November ballot. If it passes it will make California the only jurisdiction in the world to sanction in law what some doctors do privately in the shadowy regions where law and medicine uncomfortably intersect: assist terminal patients to a speedy and painless death. 
 The measure, written by Darlena Risley's husband, Robert L. Risley, and Michael White, both lawyers in Los Angeles, has set off a vigorous debate with moral, religious, medical and legal overtones in California.
Echoes of the debate are heard in every state. In Michigan, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has drawn national attention to the issue by the widely publicized machines by which he has helped five people end their lives. A bill in the Michigan legislature would legalize doctor-induced death by lethal injection in cases of incurable, irreversible diseases likely to bring death within six months, and efforts are under way to put similar measures on the ballot in Oregon and for the second consecutive year in Washington state. Yet in California none of the four candidates in the two United States Senate races nor other major political candidates have taken a position on the issue.
Early polls on the proposition were inconclusive. According to a statewide Field Poll taken Sept. 8-15, more than three-quarters of California voters were not yet aware of the measure; the remainder favored it two to one. When read a summary of the measure, voters favored it by 68 to 24 percent. However, history suggests that sentiments will shift drastically nearer to Election Day. (The sample size was 624 registered voters, for a margin of sampling error of six points either way.)
The California measure has support from some groups representing AIDS patients and others who argue that doctors, patients and their families should be able to participate in a dignified "assisted" death.
But it has come under withering assault by a coalition, including the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups, the California Medical Association, the California division of the American Cancer Society and other groups that argue the law lacks safeguards against death by mistake or for economic reasons. For example, critics point out that there is no required waiting period after a patient decides to seek help in dying.
In an act that has drawn complaints in many parishes, Catholic churches throughout the state have taken up collections on recent Sundays, contributing much of the $1.4 million raised to fight it with radio and television ads. The backers of the act say they have no money for advertising and will have to rely on free news coverage.
 
More Than Withholding Care
 The "California Death with Dignity Act" is similar to the "Natural Death Act" rejected last year by voters in Washington state, but is somewhat is more restrictive on what it allows doctors to do. As in most states, California law permits doctors to hasten death by withholding extraordinary treatment, but not to bring about death actively by lethal injection or other means.
The California act would protect doctors, nurses and other health-care providers from criminal or civil penalties for participating in the "painless, humane and dignified" death of patients who qualify. They are defined as mentally competent adults who have been diagnosed by two doctors as facing death within six months and who have voluntarily executed in the presence of two witnesses revocable directives requesting such deaths.
The request must be "enduring," meaning made more than once, though the measure sets no specific time between the requests. Nor does it specify the means of death, leaving it to the doctors. No doctor, nurse or hospital would be required to offer such service if morally or religiously opposed, but they would be required to transfer the patient elsewhere, if requested.
Mr. Risley, who is founder and chairman of Californians Against Human Suffering and a member of the Hemlock Society, a group that advocates voluntary euthanasia, says the act is narrowly drawn to apply mainly to AIDS and cancer patients and exclude people with Alzheimer's disease and others not able to act voluntarily.
The measure has deeply divided the people most directly affected, like AIDS patients. Mark Senak, director of the AIDS Project Los Angeles, which serves 3,600 AIDS patients and is the second largest AIDS care group in the country after the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, said the group had polled its staff, volunteers and patients on the measure, Proposition 161. The group decided to oppose the measure, not on principle but because they thought it lacked enough safeguards.
Among the chief complaints among all groups is that there is no required cooling-off period between the first and final requests to die, no witnesses required at the time of death, no mandatory family notification or psychological examination. "This is a very dangerous and bad law that some very few people will take advantage of and abuse," said Dr. Melvin H. Kirschner, a family practitioner in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles.
He added that doctors have difficulty determining when a patient has less than six months to live and that, without a cooling-off period, patients may make a hasty decision that they will not have the opportunity to regret. "People change their minds," he said. "If I act on that request today, they are not going to change their minds."
But other doctors say such concerns are overstated. A supporter of Proposition 161 is Dr. C. Ronald Koons, a radiation oncologist in Laguna Hills in Orange County, which has a large retired population. He said many doctors privately supported the act but feared to say so for fear of losing referrals.
Dr. Koons argues that, with the success of the hospice movement and advances in pain control, only a small fraction -- perhaps 5 percent -- of terminal patients would take advantage of the act. "The vast majority of patients can die in a very dignified comfortable way," he said. "But a small percentage do go into lot of agony. Those people find the agony of dying so totally dehumanizing they say how much longer does this have to go on? We need to be able to carry them through the whole process."
The strongest objections have come from the Roman Catholic church. "It's going in the wrong direction in caring," said Bishop John S. Cummins of Oakland, president of the California Catholic Conference, adding that the emphasis should be on easing pain and promoting hospice care. He added that he feared that many dying patients would opt for euthanasia so as not to burden their relatives financially.
"It is aimed at extreme cases of insufferable pain," he said. "But it is going to include the elderly as well. The aging must be instructed they are welcome, that we care for them."
For one, Roger C. Everaert, a 51-year-old furniture builder in Hollywood, would like that option. He has started to come down with the symptoms of AIDS and favors Proposition 161. "I've seen a lot go with dignity," he said. "But other were in horrible pain. People should have the choice of deciding when they've had enough. For myself, if the time comes, I would like to have that choice."

HEADLINE: Ford Files Preferred Stock

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company registered today a $1 billion preferred-stock offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Like most preferred offerings, the shares will carry a specific dividend when they are priced for sale at a later date. Ford hopes to sell the stock to small investors whose returns on fixed-rate investments have fallen as interest rates have dropped. 
 "Raising money in this way in this kind of interest environment makes a lot of sense," said John Casesa, an analyst for Wertheim, Schroder in New York.
An added incentive may be Ford's balance sheet, which is considered quite healthy during a time when other cyclical-industry companies are suffering.
"They've got a year and a half of capital spending in the bank now," said Doug Laughlin of Bear, Stearns in New York. "But as the old saying goes, 'It's easier to borrow money when you don't need it.' "
The stock registration is the latest aggressive move by Ford, the only U.S. maker to gain both car and truck market share in a year of weaker-than-expected auto sales.

HEADLINE: Advertising;
Columbus Voyage Is a Hard Sell After 500 Years

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
This time, Columbus really seems to have fallen off the edge of the earth.
There were expectations a year or two ago that hoopla over the 500th anniversary of his arrival in this hemisphere would be so widespread as to be inescapable. Instead, as America heads into this Columbus Day weekend, one must search as assiduously as any explorer to find promotions or advertising with Columbian themes. 
 "It's become a nonevent," said Kerry E. Smith, editor and publisher of Promo, a trade magazine in Wilton, Conn., which covers promotion marketing.
 
 
Missing the Boat
 All that is welcome news to consumers weary of marketers seizing control of the calendar and turning every holiday or special event into an excuse to buy greeting cards and collect "official" tchotchkes. But the playing down of the voyage of the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria means that advertising and promotion agencies anticipating a bonanza from additional assignments have missed the boat.
What little Columbus-related advertising that consumers are seeing is primarily the usual annual campaigns tied to Columbus Day, like sales at department stores and entreaties from telephone companies to "discover" their lower holiday-weekend rates.
While there are several reasons for the paucity of quincentennial pitches, probably the most important is the dispute over Columbus's achievements.
Arguments that it is insensitive to say he "discovered" America, and that his arrival signaled the start of the exploitation of the Indians, have been shaking up the realms of academia, the arts and religion. That debate is exemplified by books such as "The Conquest of Paradise," by Kirkpatrick Sale (Knopf, 1990), which Mr. Smith said his son Sean had been reading.
 "My son told me, 'Dad, this guy was a real bum,' " he added.
"The debunking of Christopher Columbus," he continued, "and resentment over everything that followed his arrival, could have scared away a lot of the more conservative companies that said 'Let's pass on this one.' "
Chris Sutherland, executive director at the Promotion Marketing Association of America in New York, said: "What marketers relate to are commonalities. They say 'I want to get people excited about my product; I don't want to change the world.' "
Another reason for the dearth of Columbian tie-ins, he added, is that marketers interested in the commemoration "are fighting the public's apathy" because "people just don't seem to care about it much."
Mr. Smith suggested that was because "the average person doesn't identify with something that far in the past."
Other long-ago events, he said, like Independence Day and George Washington's birthday, can be "dredged up" and made more meaningful by wrapping sales messages in red, white and blue bunting.
But in this case, he added, "Columbus predates the U.S. by 300 years."
 Indeed, the Italian Trade Commission's major promotion pegged to Columbus, which continues through today at the Park Avenue Armory at 67th Street in Manhattan, has a contemporary, rather than a historical, focus.
"We're dealing with the present rather than the past," said William McCaffery, president and creative director at McCaffery & Ratner Inc. in New York, which created advertising for the promotion, called "The Discovery of Italy."
"Museums would be mausoleums if all they did was celebrate the past," he added.
A third reason that marketers have resisted catching quincentennial fever is that they have already spent extensively on promotions pegged to other special events this year like the Winter and Summer Olympics and the Presidential campaign. That has left few, if any, dollars, for Columbus, particularly in a weak economy.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Clinton's 4-Point Plan To Win the First Debate

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 8

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton landed in this rainy, cold, windswept city today to huddle with top aides to try to figure out how to embarrass George Bush, quash Ross Perot and leave St. Louis on Sunday night the victor of the first debate.
"I'm going to try to hole up in my room and read my briefing books and get my voice back and practice a little," Mr. Clinton said in a hoarse voice before he disappeared. 
 To hear Mr. Clinton's advisers tell it, they are in the catbird's seat. The sort of political spin that campaign advisers usually save until after the debate started informally today as reporters waited on the tarmac at the Little Rock, Ark., airport for Mr. Clinton to arrive.
To the extent that political spin reflects political strategy, here is an idea of what the Clinton partisans are hoping to accomplish in the days leading up to the first debate.
TACTIC ONE Make sure that President Bush enters the debate looking like a struggling loser. He does not deserve re-election, this reasoning goes, because he has done what voters claim to hate -- attack, attack, attack.
"What has George Bush done in the last two months?" demanded George Stephanopoulos, the campaign's communications director. "He's got ads up on TV that don't mention a word about him. He hasn't on the stump offered one proposal, offered one new idea, said anything positive about where he wants to take the country, hasn't given the American people anything to hold onto in a second Bush term. And I think it's really stupid politics."
TACTIC TWO Publicly ignore Ross Perot, but prepare anyway, because no one really knows what to expect from him. He may not look like much in the polls, but a candidate who attracted 16 million television viewers for a half-hour political commercial and got on the ballot in 50 states cannot be written off.
TACTIC THREE "It's the economy, stupid." This slogan, posted in the Little Rock campaign headquarters, is a reminder to all who approach the Clinton campaign that their strongest hand is reminding voters what has made them angry about George Bush.
"George Bush is diminishing himself," said Stan Greenberg, the campaign's poll taker. "Every minute he spends talking about something other than the economy, I think, is a problem for him. Part of the reason people are angry at the President is because he's not addressing the economy."
TACTIC FOURBe prepared to counterattack. Aides to Mr. Clinton were startled by the President's decision to begin a frontal attack on Mr. Clinton by characterizing him as an anti-war activist who demonstrated against his own country on foreign soil -- while he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in England.
But even before Mr. Bush made his remarks on the CNN program "Larry King Live" on Wednesday night, Mr. Clinton's strategists had begun stepping up their effort to build a case against Mr. Bush's trustworthiness by criticizing the Bush Administration's role in providing loans to Iraq shortly before the Persian Gulf war.
 
Avoiding Too Much Detail
 For millions of potential voters who do not attend political rallies or exclusive fund-raising dinners, the three Presidential debates will become the first opportunity that they have had to assess the candidates for themselves.
During the primary season, when Mr. Clinton shared a stage with as many as five other candidates at a time, the Arkansas Governor often proved himself a pedantic debater.
Asked last week what the hardest part of debating was, he said it "may be just remembering that it's not like an oral exam." He added, "You can't tell everything you know on every question."
When Mr. Clinton broke through his tendency to talk too long and in too much detail, it was often with calculated but seemingly genuine explosions of anger. He did this during an Illinois debate when he warned former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California not to criticize his wife, Hillary.
And, of course, the candidate's aides are working to guard against that most fatal of debate problems -- the major gaffe.
"I'm not worried about what we say, but how we say it," an adviser said. "If you're defensive, you're dead meat."
Mr. Clinton's aides have one other concern: Mr. Bush will attack, Mr. Clinton will counterattack and Mr. Perot will smilingly remain above the fray watching the two career politicians go at it.
Presented with this scenario, Mr. Stephanopoulos paused. He shrugged.
The problem for the President, he said, is "if he spends the whole time attacking, he will continue to fall." He paused again as he turned to walk away, then added: "I think."

HEADLINE: Beginning a Strategy;
Although Limited, Energy Bill Offers Basis for Wider Action in the Future

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The energy bill that Congress finally sent to the White House today is far from a panacea for a country addicted to foreign oil. But it lays potentially important building blocks for a serious energy strategy in the future, bringing consumers closer to the day when they can choose to drive battery-powered cars and live in homes heated by wind or solar energy.
The legislation overhauls and expands the Government's role in the energy marketplace, carving a place for wind- and solar-power producers in the utility industry and instructing the Energy Department to enter into joint ventures with private companies to market electric motor vehicles. 
 Washington will set maximum flow rates for shower heads, toilets and faucets, while monitoring light bulbs and home heating systems with mandatory efficiency standards.
 
Just a Beginning
 What the bill will not do is seriously reduce the country's appetite for oil -- the source of 40 percent of the nation's energy and a big slice of the trade deficit. The legislation focuses on electrical power, renewable energy sources and conservation -- a beginning, proponents say, to larger projects to come in the next few years. The White House has indicated that President Bush will sign the bill.
"We still have to produce more energy," said Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming and a principal sponsor of the bill. "But it's fair to establish a nudge, and that's what we've done. In places where things work out, we can accelerate later."
Conservationists are not happy with the bill because the automobile lobby maneuvered to get higher automobile fuel efficiency standards struck from it. But they are expressing hope that the industrial-policy components of the legislation, intended to promote alternative and renewable fuels, could be expanded rapidly if the White House and Congress are committed to them.
During a session in which philosophical differences over Government's role in the marketplace blocked much action on the economy, Congressional Democrats and the Bush Administration agreed to promote a modest version of industrial policy in the energy bill to encourage the development of motor vehicles that run on alternative fuels like natural gas, batteries, electricity and methane.
 
Government's Goal
 The legislation will require the Federal Government to help create a market for such cleaner-fuel vehicles by purchasing at least 5,000 alternative-fuel cars and light trucks in 1993, 7,500 more in 1994 and 10,000 in 1995. By 1999, 75 percent of the cars and light trucks the Federal Government buys are supposed to run on alternative fuels.
At the same time, the provision will mandate that state governments buy cleaner-fuel vehicles, rising from 10 percent of their new fleets in 1995 to 75 percent in 2000.
California and several Northeastern states have taken the lead in this area by adopting strict antipollution rules that will require the sale of tens of thousands of vehicles that run on alternative fuels.
Congressional proponents compared their efforts to creating an egg that will eventually hatch into a chicken.
Industrial-policy mandates extend to the private sector, requiring companies that produce or market alternative fuels to convert their fleets to the new energy sources as well, as some private utilities have already done.
The mandates for new alternative-fuel fleets may be innovative, but it will take more than a decade for them to have more than a minor impact on oil consumption, despite the threat of higher fuel prices and long gasoline lines raised yet again by the Persian Gulf war last year. With the passing of the gulf crisis and the calming of the oil markets, the most ambitious conservation and production proposals in the bill were dropped.
All told, the Energy Department estimates the bill will reduce oil imports by about 1.4 million barrels a day from what they would otherwise have been in the year 2000 and by about 4.7 million barrels a day in 2010. The total demand for energy is to be reduced by about 6 percent by that year. The country consumes 17 million barrels of oil daily, about 50 percent of which is imported.
Perhaps the most far-reaching measure in the 1,300-page bill revamps utility regulations to increase competition at the wholesale level. It will tear down regulatory walls that currently prohibit small energy producers -- like those attempting to exploit renewable geothermal, wind and solar energy sources -- from obtaining access to the transmission lines of larger, more established utilities. Some studies show that the measure could lower monthly electricity bills 5 to 15 percent over the next decade.
Merribel S. Ayres, executive director of the National Independent Energy Producers, an organization representing the independent power industry, said the change would provide a wider menu of competing energy sources to utility planners, which "will mean upward pressure for innovation and efficiency and downward pressure on price."
 
Licensing of Nuclear Plants
 The nuclear power industry has been in a long slump since the Three Mile Island accident in 1978, and its future remains uncertain. But the energy bill certainly improves its prospects. The bill eases restrictions in the way of opening a proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert, which many nuclear power advocates hope will some day be available to store highly radioactive materials like spent fuel rods.
More immediately, the bill will streamline licensing of new nuclear power plants by combining the separate processes by which companies acquire construction permits and operating licenses before construction.
Praising the change in licensing procedures, Phillip Bayne, president of the United States Council for Energy Awareness, a pro-nuclear group, said, "The bill will give utilities and their investors a new legal framework that helps assure that nuclear power plants can be built on schedule and on budget, under regulations that are fair, stable and consistent."

HEADLINE: U.S. WAS WARNED ON BAGHDAD LOANS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors investigating a multibillion-dollar loan fraud involving Iraq twice warned policymakers in Washington that pending policy decisions would be favorable to the Baghdad Government, but the warnings were disregarded, according to a memo disclosed today.
One such case came with the Kuwait invasion, when Western nations froze Iraq's assets and Baghdad began to default on $1.9 billion in loans guaranteed by the United States under an Agriculture Department program, the Commodity Credit Corporation. 
 As a result, the Bush Administration suddenly found itself responsible for paying hundreds of millions to the Gulf International Bank, which made the loans. But the Bahrain-based bank was partly owned by the Iraqi Government.
The April 9, 1992, memo was made public today by Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. It shows that Justice Department prosecutors in Atlanta, who were investigating loans made to Iraq through the Atlanta branch of an Italian bank, objected to the repayment of the Bahrain bank's loan. They argued that it would be a de facto gift of tens of millions of dollars to the Iraqi Government. Months later, prosecutors were upset to learn that the Bush Administration had begun to pay Gulf International Bank anyway, the memo said.
 
Warning of Iraqi Role
 "These payments to banks both owned and administered in part by Iraq occurred long after we warned C.C.C. of the Iraqi ownership position in banks involved in the program," Gail McKenzie, the lead prosecutor in the case, wrote in a memo to the Acting United States Attorney in Atlanta, referring to the Commodity Credit Corporation. "We raised the issue of how C.C.C. could possibly consider, in effect, paying Iraq again for the very U.S. debt on which Iraq had defaulted."
The United States has repaid a total of $416 million to cover Iraq's bad debts to the bank.
The fact that the Bush Administration paid off loans to Gulf International despite evidence of its partial ownership by Iraq was first reported in March by The Los Angeles Times. The document released today further illustrates how officials within the Government warned against that action, and how Washington viewed the concerns of the Atlanta prosecutors as essentially irrelevant when stacked up against their larger foreign policy objectives.
"This is the first evidence we have showing the Administration was clearly warned before it paid Iraq for the very bad debt on which Baghdad had defaulted," Senator Leahy said in a statement today.
But R. Richard Newcombe, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department, took issue with the Senator's remarks, saying the loans were repaid after ironclad assurances from the other participants in the bank that "they had created an effective ring around Iraq so that any payments would not directly or indirectly benefit the Iraqis."
The prosecutors had intervened on an earlier occasion, on an even more contentious matter that had been widely debated at the highest levels of the Administration.
 
Agricultural Loan Guarantees
 Within weeks of the August 1989 closing of the Atlanta branch of the Italian bank, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the prosecutors recommended that the Bush Administration not go forward with a program to guarantee $1 billion in agricultural loans to Iraq. They cited mounting evidence that Iraq had abused the program.
Despite evidence gathered by prosecutors that Iraq was not creditworthy, and despite suspicions -- never proven -- that it used money from the American program to acquire arms, President Bush decided in November to extend the credits. Policymakers justified it then as the best way to carry out Mr. Bush's policy of using economic and political incentives to moderate Iraq's behavior.
In the memo, Ms. McKenzie noted that in both cases, the Administration "apparently discounted" evidence presented by her office in its decisions.
Gerrilyn Brill, the Acting United States Attorney in Atlanta who received Ms. McKenzie's memo last April, declined to discuss its contents or relevance to the case.
 
No Word From the C.I.A.
 Asked about the C.I.A.'s admission this week that it had issued incomplete and misleading statements to prosecutors and the judge in the Banca del Lavoro case, she acknowledged that she had not been informed by either the Justice Department or the C.I.A. that the agency had recently uncovered additional documents on the case.
Last week, in an abrupt reversal, prosecutors announced that they would allow the head of the Banca del Lavoro's Atlanta branch, Christopher P. Drogoul, to withdraw his guilty plea and allow the case to go to trial. Ms. Brill reiterated that the decision to go to trial was made by her office and not by the Justice Department and that the C.I.A.'s admission of mistakes the day before had "absolutely no impact" on the decision.

HEADLINE: Florio Proposes Chartering Of Parent-Teacher Schools

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Barely two years after pushing through a controversial public-school financing plan known as the Quality Education Act, Gov. Jim Florio today proposed another revolution: creating "charter schools" that would be independent of central administrations and exempt from many rules and regulations.
"Charter schools can encourage innovation by loosening the administrative straitjacket on teachers and allowing them to use their professional judgment and take responsibility for the results," Mr. Florio said in a speech before the State Board of Education. "The difference between schools-as-usual and charter schools is like the difference between the old G.M. assembly line and the new Saturn team assembly." 
 The New Jersey School Boards Association tentatively supported the idea, and Mr. Florio said he had heard favorable reactions from educators and some business leaders for schools run largely by parents and teachers.
But the 139,000-member New Jersey Education Association, which represents most of the state's public-school teachers, was dismayed by the idea. Calling the Governor's announcement an unwelcome surprise, Lynn Maher, a spokeswoman for the association, said, "We are seriously concerned that the issue could promote racial and economic divisiveness, and we question the appropriateness of parents and teachers running public schools alone."
Mr. Florio said he would take his proposal to the Legislature, but only after he worked to build support among business groups, educators and the public.
There is at least some support in the Legislature for the charter schools concept. The Assembly Democratic leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, and Assemblyman John A. Rocco, a Republican from Cherry Hill, last month introduced a bill that would permit their creation.
 
Free of Tuition
 Only two states have charter school programs. In Minnesota, the idea won legislative approval last year, and the first school opened this fall in St. Paul. California voted last month to allow charter schools.
Charter schools are similar to conventional public schools in that they are tuition-free and receive support from both the state and the local school district, but they are allowed many of the freedoms normally associated with private schools in designing their own curriculums and in setting their own goals.
"Essentially, charter schools are independent of any district and exempt from a number of rules and regulations that govern other public schools," said Peggy Hunter, who as enrollment options coordinator for the Minnesota Department of Education helps to oversee that state's charter school program. "The schools are operated by licensed teachers, and what it really does is to allow the teachers to take a risk if they have a better way."
But the concept has been fiercely attacked by the Minnesota Education Association, the teachers' union. "Charter schools, currently being sold by some as the cure-all for an education system they think is sorely in need of repair, many turn out to be the biggest boondoggle since New Coke," Robert E. Astrup, the union's president, said in a column two weeks ago in the national magazine Education Week. "We continue to believe that charter schools drain state resources and attempt to duplicate the efforts that are currently under way in many existing districts."
The Minnesota law allows a maximum of eight charter schools. The one in St. Paul opened last month with about 35 students who have a history of truancy or other disciplinary problems. Three other schools have been approved and are expected to open next year, Ms. Hunter said.
 
Up to 2 Per County
 The California legislation allows as many as 100 charter schools.
The most significant difference between the plans is that the Minnesota law dictates that charter schools must be new institutions, but California allows the conversion of existing schools to the concept.
The proposal by Mr. Doria and Mr. Rocco would authorize boards of education to establish "teacher-parent cooperative schools" by issuing written charters signed by the board and the directors of the school.
The legislators' proposal envisions a maximum of two charter schools in each of the state's 21 counties. Mr. Florio did not divulge details of his plan. Under the legislators' proposal, a group of parents and teachers could petition the local and state school boards for a charter.

HEADLINE: Economic Forecast Is Cut

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., Oct. 8

 BODY:
The nation's top business leaders were uncertain today over when the economy would shake off its sluggishness but expect help from the Government no matter who wins the Presidential election.
Senior economic advisers to the 100 chief executives of the Business Council, meeting at this mountain resort, scaled back their 1992 economic forecast from the last meeting in May and said they did not "feel confident in their ability to project exactly when the economy finally will begin to show more strength." 
 Many of the advisers opposed any attempt to stimulate the economy with tax cuts or spending increases for fear of adding to record Federal deficits. But they believe that whoever is elected in November will join with the new Congress to enact a stimulus package in the spring.
In their forecast, the economists predicted that the economy would grow at a sluggish 2 percent annual rate during the second half, no better than the first half and 1 percentage point below their previous forecast.
Most expect growth to pick up to a moderate 3 percent next year, but they stressed that they were uncertain over the outlook.
They said recent sales and profits had been "at least somewhat encouraging" in semiconductors, computers, communications equipment, steel, trucks, chemicals, textiles and retailing. But weakness is still reported in the aluminum, airline, auto, paper and oil industries.
The advisers expect skittish and debt-laden consumers to pick up the pace of their spending a bit, up 2.6 percent in 1993 compared with 1.5 percent this year. But they noted that even the improved rate would be three-fourths of the average rate over the last 30 years and "well below the pace typical during recoveries."
They reduced their inflation forecast to 3.25 percent for 1993 from 3.5 percent projected in the spring and 3.8 percent a year ago. They are also expecting a 14.3 percent increase in corporate profits next year, after a 15 percent rise this year.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Uses Hookup to Talk All Over New York

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
In most places they listened intently as Gov. Bill Clinton spoke about the need for change, the rightness of his economic policies, his hopes for a better future. And he issued a heartfelt thanks to all those New Yorkers trying to help him and Senator Al Gore prevent President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle from winning a second term.
"One lady actually wept when he was finished," said Joseph Board of Scotia, N.Y., a professor of law and comparative politics at Union College and the Albany Law School. 
 Mr. Board was one of hundreds of Democrats around the state last night who played host to fund-raising parties that drew thousands of Democrats. The guests of honor -- Mr. Clinton, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who introduced the Democratic Presidential nominee, and the New York Attorney General, Robert Abrams, who is opposing Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -- visited each of approximately 600 fund-raising parties by telephone hookup. Nearly half the parties, about 270 of them, were held in the five boroughs of New York City.
 
'Favorable' Reaction
 Darren Dopp, the spokesman for the Democrats' Coordinated Campaign in New York State, said more than 25,000 guests attended the parties, held in private homes, like Mr. Board's, restaurants, bars and clubs. Mr. Dopp estimated that their contributions would reach the projected goal of "several hundred thousand dollars."
Mr. Board said he had expected anywhere from 50 to 150 friends to attend; the final count was 95, and they included one of his neighbors, a Republican, who, Mr. Board said, listened carefully as Mr. Clinton spoke with a voice still raspy from campaigning.
In his remarks, which lasted less than 10 minutes, the Arkansas Governor projected a vision of hope for the future, shaped by economic policies and social programs that would change the direction of the last dozen years. Then he asked his supporters to continue to help him after he wins on Nov. 3.
Mr. Board said: "The reaction to his talk was very favorable. I even think my neighbor is almost convinced."
The idea for coordinated parties was developed by the state Democratic Party on behalf of the Presidential ticket and Democratic candidates for other offices. It is the kind of device that is especially beneficial to someone like Mr. Abrams, who is embroiled in a close race against an incumbent Republican who has raised many times more campaign dollars.
Mr. Abrams, who spoke from a party on Park Avenue, was brief, but in closing he urged New Yorkers "to drive George Bush out of the White House and Al D'Amato into the dog house."
But it was helpful, too, for Mr. Clinton. The hookup allowed him to spend more time where his lead is not as commanding as it is in New York.
But not all party-goers here had the chance to hear his message last night.
At one gathering, in an East 83rd Street carriage house with a political history -- similar events had been held there for Adlai E. Stevenson, Eugene J. McCarthy and George McGovern -- only a few of the 200 guests stopped to listen when Governor Cuomo began the program. When it was apparent that the small speakerphone was no match for such a large space, even the faithful turned back to their wine, hors d'oeuvres and conversations.

HEADLINE: China Worried by Clinton's Linking of Trade to Human Rights

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 8

 BODY:
If the Presidential campaign isn't going so well these days for President Bush, the Chinese leaders seem to think it's going even worse for them.
Most horrifying of all to the Chinese leaders, there is the prospect that next month United States voters will elect Gov. Bill Clinton, who has called for linking China's trade privileges to its human rights record. Mr. Clinton sent shivers down octogenarian spines here this summer when he called for "an America that will never coddle tyrants, from Baghdad to Beijing." 
 But even Mr. Bush, long regarded by the Chinese as an "old friend," has proved distinctly unfriendly on the campaign trail. Many specialists on China say relations are already severely strained and may get worse.
 
'Tense, Delicate Relationship'
 "I think that we're going to see a very tense, delicate relationship and that we're going to see the relationship continue to go downhill irrespective of who wins the White House," said John T. Kamm, a Hong Kong-based business consultant and specialist on Chinese-American relations. "Of course, they'll probably go downhill a little faster if Clinton wins."
Chinese officials have long shown a preference for Republicans, and they often speak glowingly of former President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger for opening up relations, while giving much less credit to the Carter Administration for formally recognizing China.
Beijing seemed to regard the Democrats in the 1970's and 1980's as too weak-kneed in opposing Moscow.
 
U.S. Patience Wearing Thin
 But there are a number of signs that the Bush Administration's patience with Beijing has worn thin, and that it is no longer willing to pay a political price for cultivating ties to China.
For example, the Administration is threatening that unless Beijing agrees by the end of this week to take major steps to open up its markets, the United States will retaliate against up to $3.9 billion in Chinese exports.
Just as bad, from Beijing's point of view, Mr. Bush announced last month that Washington would permit the sale of up to 150 F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province. The sale of the fighter planes is regarded by many experts, American and Chinese, as a violation of a 1982 accord in which the United States pledged that it would not increase arms sales to Taiwan.
 
Taiwan Is Still Ticklish
 "By brazenly selling F-16's to Taiwan over China's opposition, the United States has again revealed its hegemonist policy of using arms sales to interfere in other countries' internal policies," the official People's Daily said this week.
Beijing reacted to the F-16 sale by dropping out of arms talks with Western countries and by rejecting a longstanding proposal for a joint Chinese-American commission on human rights, and China has hinted it may retaliate further.
For now, the dominant issue is the deadline Saturday on reaching agreement on talks to open up the Chinese market to foreign competition. But experts say there is still time to avert a trade war, and note that past trade accords with Beijing have typically been reached at the very last minute.
"Given the importance of the issues at stake and given the progress that has been achieved so far, which is not insignificant, I think that there's a better than even chance that we'll be able to overcome the last hurdles," said a Western diplomat in Beijing.
For all their resentment at the Administration's recent toughness, the Chinese leaders do appreciate that Mr. Bush has vetoed Congressional efforts to put conditions on the most-favored-nation trade privileges that China enjoys.
Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, has advocated linking trade and human rights.
Ending most-favored-nation status would be a major blow to the Chinese economy, which counts on the United States as a crucial market for shoes, clothing, toys and other exports.
Last year 26 percent of Chinese exports went to the United States, and the figure may be even higher this year: in the first six months of this year, Chinese exports to the United States were running nearly 32 percent above the corresponding period in 1991.
Mr. Clinton has apparently given relatively little thought to China, and it is possible that he would work with Congress to put pressure on China without revoking most-favored-nation status.
But Chinese officials have been alarmed by his speeches and dismayed by the Democratic Convention, where the largest foreign delegation reportedly was Taiwan's, and even Tibet had nearly as many representatives as China. Two exiled dissidents, Li Lu and Chai Ling, were invited to the podium and hailed as heroes.
Among those advising Mr. Clinton on China are Richard Holbrooke, a former senior State Department official who is now an investment banker, and Michael Mandelbaum, an academic expert on international relations.
Mr. Mandelbaum visited Beijing earlier this year and held discussions that the Chinese say they found somewhat reassuring, in that both sides still seemed to care a good deal about the relationship, and Mr. Holbrooke came in July for a day-and-a-half visit on behalf of his banking clients.
 
Emphasis on Long Term
 Mr. Holbrooke said he did not come as an emissary of Mr. Clinton, but he told the two Chinese leaders with whom he met that Mr. Clinton was very serious about human rights issues.
Mr. Holbrooke also told them that a victory by Mr. Clinton would be good for China because Mr. Clinton was more likely to invigorate the United States economy, providing a basis for healthy trade and sound relations in general.
Aside from listening to his advisers, Mr. Clinton is also believed to have consulted other experts on relations with China, including Stephen J. Solarz, a Congressman from New York, and Winston Lord, a former United States Ambassador to Beijing.
Whoever wins the election, there are other conflicts on the horizon, including the possibility that the United States will set up a new radio service -- perhaps called Radio Free China -- to broadcast across the bamboo curtain. China disapproves of the Voice of America, which it calls "voice of rumors," and it would be outraged if a more aggressive broadcast service were established.
Even now, some Chinese officials hope that the problems will ease.
"We want good relations with the rest of the world, above all with the United States, and even if Clinton wins I don't think that there will necessarily be a big change," a senior Chinese researcher said. "Of course if Bush wins, that's better, but that wouldn't mean that relations will be smooth either.
"Before Reagan was elected President, he was also very hostile to the Chinese mainland. But after he won the election he was very pragmatic and he had to face reality. Maybe after this election, it won't be quite the same as it was in the campaign."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Trading in Hachette Halted Amid Rumors of Hostile Bid

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Amid intense speculation over a hostile bid from a rival European media group, trading in the shares of the troubled French communications giant Hachette S.A. was suspended today on the Paris Bourse.
The suspension came with Hachette trading at 158.7 francs a share, or about $31.60, an increase of almost 12 percent over Wednesday's price and 34.5 percent above Monday's closing price of 118 francs. During the week, in a generally depressed market, 1.23 million Hachette shares, or about 6 percent of the company's stock, have changed hands. 
 Thierry Funck-Brentano, a spokesman for the Hachette group, said, "We have evidence which convinces us that it is Havas that is buying the shares." Havas S.A. is Hachette's chief French media rival. Mr. Funck-Brentano declined to say what Hachette's evidence was.
Havas said in a statement, however, that "the board denies any interest in the acquisition of Hachette shares." A spokeswoman for Havas, Marie-France Benoist-Janique, said, "I think you have to look somewhere else for the buyer."
Mr. Funck-Brentano said Hachette was sticking by its conviction that the buyer was Havas.
Earlier in the week, there was speculation that the German media giant Bertelsmann was buying Hachette stock. Spokesmen for Bertelsmann A.G. could not be reached for comment late today.
A hostile takeover would seem to be impossible, because Marlis S.A., a company indirectly controlled by Hachette's flamboyant chairman, Jean-Luc Lagardere, holds 51.4 percent of Hachette's stock and controls 69.4 percent of the voting rights. Among Hachette's large stable of magazines are Elle and Woman's Day in the United States, as well as Elle of France.
But Hachette is facing acute problems after its disastrous foray into television with the failed La Cinq channel, and it has proposed a widely questioned merger with the military contractor Matra S.A. As a result, analysts suggested that Havas might be building a position to put pressure on Hachette to cede some of its publishing and media operations.
"Strategically, it makes a lot more sense for Havas and Hachette to put their publishing and media activities together than for Hachette to merge with Matra," said Jean-Jacques Limage, a media industry analyst at James Capel & Company, a brokerage firm. "It would be sad to see Hachette's excellent editorial activities absorbed into a defense group."
Through a holding company, Mr. Lagardere holds a substantial stake in Matra, which is financially stronger than Hachette. He is also chairman of both Matra and Hachette. The financial terms of the proposed merger have not yet been disclosed.
Mr. Lagardere, who has conceded that the La Cinq episode was "the most serious setback of my life," has vigorously defended the proposed merger with Matra, despite widespread skepticism among analysts. While he has argued that the proposed missiles-to-magazines group makes strategic sense, others have seen a thinly disguised financial rescue operation.
 
Strength of Havas
 Havas owns the French book publishing giant Groupe de la Cite and has a substantial interest in the pay television channel Canal Plus. It also has interests in advertising and newspapers.
The company, an old rival of Hachette, has recently performed more strongly than its competitor. Despite the recession in many of its businesses, Havas had net profits of 1.08 billion francs, or about $210 million, in 1991 on sales of 26.5 billion francs, or about $5.15 billion.
In contrast, after piling up losses with La Cinq, Hachette lost 1.93 billion francs last year, or about $375 million, on sales of 30.4 billion francs, or about $5.9 billion.
After a spending spree in the 1980's, which included the acquisition of Grolier encyclopedias and Diamandis magazines in the United States, Hachette is also burdened with debt, which stood at about 8 billion francs, or about $1.55 billion, at the end of last year.
As in several other industries, European media groups have been merging to prepare for the emergence of a single market in Europe. The most recent merger was that of the Dutch group Elsevier N.V. and Reed International P.L.C. of Britain.

HEADLINE: Caldor May Bid to Reopen Alexander's Stores

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The Caldor Corporation, a leading discount retailer in the Northeast, indicated yesterday that it was considering making a bid to acquire and reopen 6 of the 11 department stores in the New York area that Alexander's closed in bankruptcy last spring.
Two weeks ago, Bradlees Inc., another major discount retailer, said it had offered $82 million for the same six stores -- two in the Bronx, two in Queens, and one each in Yonkers and Valley Stream, L.I. But that offer was subject to approval by the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that is supervising Alexander's affairs, and Alexander's said that any higher bids would be considered.
 
Welcome in Bronx and Queens
 
 "Caldor's is seriously considering a bid," Warren J. Karp, a lawyer for Caldor's, said yesterday after a Bankruptcy Court hearing at which bidding procedures were established to encourage as many offers as possible for the sake of Alexander's and its creditors.
"It's a very complex transaction," Mr. Karp added. "We don't know yet if the economics makes sense. But Caldor's is looking very, very carefully at the possibility of an expanded presence in the New York area."
The possibility of a second bid for stores that went dark only a few months ago was welcome news in a city that has seen a dozen department stores closed over the last decade amid intense competition from suburban malls, and a dogged recession that has eroded the purchasing power of consumers and the economic base of merchants.
 
'Whether It Makes Sense'
 It was especially welcome in the Bronx and Queens, where the largely futile effort to retain large department stores has been most painful.
In Bankruptcy Court yesterday, Judge Cornelius Blackshear approved a motion by Alexander's and a creditors' committee requiring that new bids for multi-year leases exceed Bradlees' by $5 million in "present value," and include arrangements for the stores in Yonkers and on Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx. He set deadlines of Nov. 3 for new bids and Nov. 12 for selecting a winner.
A Caldor's bid would seek to buy existing leases for stores in Valley Stream, Yonkers and on Bruckner Boulevard, which are not owned by Alexander's, and would seek new leases on Alexander's-owned stores in Flushing, Queens, and on Fordham Road in the Bronx, and for part of a store in Rego Park, Queens.
"We can't say specifically at this time that we will make a bid," Allan Kuller, Caldor's vice president for real estate, said in an interview. "We'll be reviewing all the documents, determining what the costs will be, whether it makes sense."
Caldor's, which earned $22 million on sales of $1.9 billion in 1991, has 129 stores in the Northeast, including two in New York City. Bradlees has 127 stores in the Northeast but none in New York City. Neither company wants to acquire Alexander's flagship on 58th Street, across from Bloomingdale's, or its large store in the World Trade Center.

HEADLINE: Rock to Blues to Country. At the Post Office.

BYLINE: By JON PARELES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Rock-and-roll heaven will come to local post offices next year, along with Broadway angels and some honky-tonk heroes. Hank Williams, Buddy Holly, Dinah Washington, Patsy Cline and others, are to appear on 29-cent stamps.
Standing under an electric-blue guitar at the local Hard Rock Cafe, the Postmaster General, introduced by a postal official as Marvin (Rockin') Runyon, today unveiled the commemorative stamps to be issued next year. 
 The Elvis Presley stamp will inaugurate the series, to be called "Legends of American Music." Rock musicians, having conquered albums, movies and television, will be making their debut on stamps.
Mr. Presley won't be lonesome. His stamp, due out on Jan. 8, will be followed by those honoring four Broadway musicals ("Oklahoma," "Show Boat," "Porgy and Bess" and "My Fair Lady") in February and March.
And a booklet of rock-and-roll and rhythm-and-blues commemoratives, to come out in June, will include Mr. Presley, Mr. Holly, Ms. Washington, Bill Haley, Clyde McPhatter, Otis Redding and Ritchie Valens. In August the Hank Williams stamp is to appear, and in September a country-and-western booklet will feature Ms. Cline, the Carter Family and Bob Wills.
 
Visions of Profitability
 Other people to be commemorated include the fighter Joe Louis, the statesman Dean Acheson and the actress Grace Kelly. A group of stamps dedicated to books, due in October, includes "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm," "Little Women," "Little House on the Prairie" and "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
When President Bush accepted the Republican Party's nomination in August, he denounced his opponent's policies as "Elvis economics," a swipe at Gov. Bill Clinton's self-proclaimed adulation of Mr. Presley. But the economics of the Presley stamp are expected to be highly profitable.
The postal service plans to print 300 million Presley stamps in January. Mr. Runyon estimated that collectors would snap up $16 million worth. "A stamp saved is a profit turned," he said.
The Presley stamp was profitable even before the first lick. A million people voted for the likeness of the lithe young Mr. Presley rather than the mature Mr. Presley, at 19 cents a post-card vote.
Postal officials hope the stamps of the other pop musicians will appeal to collectors as well as to correspondents.
Popular music has shown up before on stamps, with figures like Duke Ellington and Cole Porter. But the music of the rock era has been ignored, partly because many of its pioneers are still alive, and with few exceptions people on United States stamps have been dead at least 10 years.
The newly announced "legends" constitute a multiethnic coalition, assembling influential white, black and Hispanic performers.
In a campaign season steeped in "family values," free-wheeling musicians might seem controversial subjects for stamps.
The first batch clearly had to include Mr. Presley, whose drug use is well documented, and the hard-drinking Williams, the most revered of country singers.
But the others were carefully chosen. There is even a married couple, A. P. and Sara Carter (though they later divorced) plus Maybelle Carter, Mr. Carter's sister-in-law and Mrs. Carter's cousin. Their songs, like "Will the Circle Be Unbroken," were steeped in devout gospel.
One notable musician missing from the series is Sam Cooke, the singer and songwriter who was shot dead by a woman who said he had attacked her. Otherwise his "You Send Me" might seem to a shoo-in for a postage stamp.
Nostalgia gives a glow to most of the new first-class superstars who, except for Mr. Redding, a powerhouse of 1960's soul explosion, flourished before or during the 1950's. But Mr. Runyon did not rule out the possibility of later stamps commemorating performers like Jimi Hendrix or Janis Joplin, two performers from the psychedelic 60's who died of drug abuse.
 
Chosen 'for Good Things'
 At the Hard Rock Cafe, which displays a "Seal of the Embassy of Rock and Roll," which is not the usual spot for official announcements, the Postmaster General said people were chosen for stamps not for their personal lives but "for the good things they did."
"I don't think any of us are just letter perfect," he added, with no pun intended.
Mr. Runyon said there had been criticism that the Presley stamp was like an advertisement, because it would help to sell albums. "That's not why we do it," he said. "He did change our culture. He may have changed part of our culture more than many, many other people depicted on stamps. We need to move along with our stamps and put images on our stamps that mean something to this country."
For 1993, the postal service suggests that rock-and-roll has uplifted culture as much as "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm."
Still, it may have inadvertently hedged its bet. In October, the first set of stamps to follow the rock-and-roll booklet will be a pair dedicated to American Sign Language and, a statement says, "recognizing deafness." "Purely a coincidence," said a postal service spokeswoman.

DINKINS PREVAILS ON HOUSING PLAN
The Dinkins administration yesterday prevailed in its plan to build 20 studio apartments for the homeless mentally ill, after City Council leaders decided not to try to override a mayoral veto. The Council's leaders said they yielded after the administration convinced them that appropriate social services would be provided to residents of the housing, planned for the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Although both sides have tried in the last week to defuse the bickering, the gulf between Mayor Dinkins and much of the police force he commands is still large, perhaps worse than at any time in recent memory. B2.

The City Council overwhelmingly passed a landmark anti-tobacco law that makes it more difficult for minors to buy cigarettes and requires anti-smoking messages to counter tobacco ads in bus shelters and on taxicabs and other spaces owned or licensed by the city. B3.

A state appeals court has ruled that the city's Schools Chancellor has the power to review the selection of school superintendents by local boards. But the Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, and the school boards differ on the impact of the ruling. B3.

HEADLINE: Citicorp Sees Payout Likely Again by 1994

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp is likely to resume paying a dividend on its common stock in 1994, John S. Reed, the company's chairman, said yesterday, adding that the company had solved enough of its problems so that investors should expect a strong rebound in profits even before then.
In a meeting with banking analysts and investors, Mr. Reed described Federal regulators as "a pain," but added that on balance, regulators' criticisms have helped make Citicorp a better company. 
 After regulators criticized Citicorp's below-average level of capital available to absorb unexpected losses, the company eliminated its stock dividend in late 1991. And criticisms of shoddy lending practices in Citicorp's home mortgage and other lending businesses led the company to overhaul its policies. Citicorp's stock closed unchanged yesterday at $14.50.
 
New Securities Issue Seen
 Mr. Reed's appearance at the Park Lane Hotel meeting in Manhattan was part of the company's effort to drum up business for a $650 million sale of securities expected next week.
Several people who were at the meeting confirmed Mr. Reed's remarks, but they spoke on condition that they not be identified. The Securities and Exchange Commission could delay the sale if it felt that the company or securities firms were the source of news stories that contained information not included in documents filed with the S.E.C.
Although Citicorp can point to many areas of improvement in its business, the high level of losses from bad loans remains enough of a concern that some analysts said yesterday that the company might be required to offer a higher interest rate on its preferred stock issue than the 7.75 percent to 8.25 percent range that has been tentatively discussed with investors. They said investors were hoping to obtain a higher rate.
 
Room to Absorb Losses
 The clearest area of improvement at Citicorp is its cutting of expenses so that the gap between income and expenses has increased to $1.8 billion in the third quarter from $1.38 billion in the first quarter of 1991. That gap, which Mr. Reed said should stay at about $7.2 billion annually, leaves the company with room to absorb high loan losses and still report profits to investors.
Mr. Reed said the company's key businesses could produce profits of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, about $1 billion of which would come from consumers around the world. In the increasingly competitive credit card business, where Citicorp is the leader by a wide margin but has lost market share in the last year, Mr. Reed said profits were falling, but remained at a high level. Rather than earning a profit equal to 40 percent of its investment as in the past, he said profits might fall to 25 percent or 30 percent.
Citicorp lost $457 million last year, and has relied on gains from the sale of nonessential businesses to report subpar profits of $326 million in the first half of this year. In the third quarter, the company said, losses on consumer and business loans stabilized or declined slightly, but remained high enough to keep profits in a lower-than-expected range of $80 million to $100 million.
While third-quarter profits are a far cry from Mr. Reed's projection, he pointed to underlying trends that support a higher profit outlook. The cost of bad business loans, including write-offs, additional reserves and expenses of real estate acquired through foreclosure, will drop to $530 million to $505 million in the third quarter, down from $705 million in the second quarter and $792 million in the last quarter of 1991.
By the end of this year, he said quarterly losses from business loans, including loans backed by commercial real estate, would be down to about $400 million to $450 million.
In the consumer business, Mr. Reed said delinquencies had stabilized but remained at a high level. Losses per quarter could be about $750 million by year-end, he said, down only slightly from $780 million in the third quarter, but well below the $838 million of the second quarter.
 
Damage in the Past
 By writing off as a loss $2.5 billion of loans and increasing its reserves for expected losses by $1.4 billion since the end of 1990, Mr. Reed said Citicorp had already suffered the greatest part of the damage it expected from bad loans, particularly loans for commercial real estate. He described how the company has changed its lending policies so that top management studies risks more carefully, rather than leaving that analysis to lower-level officials.
Mr. Reed said Citicorp would continue to increase reserves in 1993, but might stop adding to that cushion in 1994. Citicorp has the second-lowest level of reserves relative to its troubled loans of any of the nation's 50 largest banking companies. Mr. Reed said it was important that the company not be perceived as weakly reserved or capitalized, even though he said he personally thought that there already were more than enough reserves.
Mr. Reed said Richard Braddock, Citicorp's president and second-ranking officer, had resigned recently because his job of guiding the cost-cutting program was largely accomplished, and managers of Citicopr's key businesses were no longer reporting to him. Rather than have investors feel they were misled by having Mr. Braddock resign after the pending $650 million securities offering, Mr. Reed said his resignation was accepted beforehand -- even though it led analysts to wonder if turmoil in the executive suite on the third floor of its Park Avenue offices was hampering the company's recovery.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Mild-Mannered Avenging Shopper

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, Conn.

 BODY:
SHE'S casual, patient, low key, middle aged and virtually nondescript, and works very hard at it. Sometimes she's savvy. Sometimes she's infuriatingly dim. Sometimes she's irate or demanding. She knows just the color jacket she wants and none of these are it. Nope, not one. Not a very good selection, is it? Do you have any others in back?
Other times this woman is downright sheepish, waiting and waiting and waiting for a clerk to notice her waiting. Chances are, however, the sales clerk won't notice the stopwatch in the woman's purse. So when the woman asks about VCR's, the clerk says, "They're over there." And resumes chatting with a colleague. 
 Rarely do clerks observe how observant this woman is. At some point her eyes always fall, always unobtrusively, to the employee's name tag. This woman seems so fussy she even peeks inside the hamburger bun before eating, which has caused a patronizing chuckle or two back behind the not-so-fast-food counter.
If only they knew.
This woman is Naomi Greenberg, a name that would strike fear into the hearts of every currently employed but inattentive sales clerk in the Northeast if Naomi Greenberg used her real name, which she sure won't now. That's because Mrs. Greenberg is a mystery shopper, one of nearly 200 men and women across the country who work for Customer Perspectives of Hooksett, N.H.
Imagine! Stores, banks and malls pay these people to shop. In an age of retail Darwinism, these enterprises want to know which stores, which managers and which employees provide the service necessary in a keenly competitive climate. "Our business is growing because of the poor economy," said Judy Hess, one Customer Perspective partner. "Tomorrow's survivors will have good customer service today."
Two or three days a week Mrs. Greenberg takes her assignment sheet and sets out from her home near Hartford to become somebody else. "Basically," she says, "I'm an actress."
She's also an anonymous avenging angel for every ignored customer since the caveman's first fried-dinosaur stand. Remember the girl at the burger outlet who took your complex order for one cheeseburger with mustard only and one large Diet Coke and served you one hamburger with everything but mustard and, like, gosh, was that a small or medium Coke? Naomi would write her up.
Or the guys at the tire store who made you wait while sharing their versions of Monday night's game because what's your hurry, these tires aren't going anywhere? Naomi would nail them. And the haughty bank officer, too.
What a great job! (And she gets mileage, too.)
"I can tell you every clean washroom from here to Boston," boasts Mrs. Greenberg. "And the ones chronically out of toilet paper."
She had "a friend" with her the other morning as she strolled into a restaurant and demanded a table, no, a nonsmoking booth. Helen, the waitress, delivered menus promptly but was a little slow offering coffee and didn't list the specials. Mrs. Greenberg had many questions about foods she didn't order, so many questions, in fact, that Helen grew visibly impatient because she had other booths, you know, which seemed to lengthen the nice customer's list of questions.
The restrooms passed inspection and the food was hot, but Helen forgot the toast. That was the cook's fault, she volunteered. "Whatever," said Mrs. Greenberg, who appeared to be completing her shopping list. Nor did Helen inquire if everything was satisfactory. "The question is," said Mrs. Greenberg, "did you feel appreciated as Helen's customer?"
Helen's manager may hear from the head office one day soon.
Minutes later, at a major department store, Mrs. Greenberg is seeking a light-blue bathmat, no, lighter than this but not that light and not this dark either because it must match the new bathroom her husband built. Oh, and a soap dish, you know, one of those with drain holes that was obviously designed by someone who has actually cleaned a shower once. The clerk is helpful.
Soon after, the same woman, identifying herself as Nicki Mann, has many questions for a computer salesman, who has fewer answers, for a clothing salesman, who neglects to suggest an alternative jacket, and for a hardware clerk, who does find the correct light switch in the storeroom. "But I had to ask," notes the nondescript shopper.
There are tensions to mystery-shopping. "Half the time I don't remember who I'm playing," said Mrs. Greenberg, also known as Nancy Green. She is always observing, even when off duty dining out with her patient husband, who's never rebuilt a bathroom in his life and uses the name Ed because that is his name.
And what about the light-blue bathmat? "What about it?" asks Mrs. Greenberg. "That goes back by noon. I have to check Returns, too."

HEADLINE: Port Authority to Buy Land at Aqueduct

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
In a move intended to help New York State balance its budget, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday agreed to purchase 23 acres of Aqueduct race track in Queens for $40 million.
Although Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has wanted to sell all or part of Aqueduct for several years to provide the state with cash, it took this year's budget deficit and some cajoling on Mr. Cuomo's part to persuade the State Legislature and the New York Racing Association, which operates Aqueduct, to go along with the deal. 
 The money will come out of a $200 million Port Authority fund earmarked for economic development projects. Port Authority officials said the land purchase is a form of economic development because the land could be sold or leased to airport-related industries.
However, the Port Authority has no immediate plans for the property, which abuts the northwest corner of Kennedy International Airport. "In effect, this gives us breathing room for the future," said David Z. Plavin, director of aviation for the agency.
The motion passed easily. But one Port Authority commissioner objected, saying the transaction was simply a way to funnel Port Authority revenue into the state's general fund. In a prepared statement, the commissioner, John G. McGoldrick, suggested that he did not see clear economic benefits from the purchase.
"I cannot recall any other project to which we have allocated monies from the bridge and tunnel toll increase fund, or from any other Port Authority source, directly or indirectly for the state's general operating purposes," said Mr. McGoldrick, who was appointed to the Port Authority board by Mr. Cuomo.
Stanley Brezenoff, the Port Authority executive director, acknowledged that the authority was purchasing the property, which is largely a paved parking lot, at Mr. Cuomo's request.
Under terms of the sale agreement, the Port Authority gets right of first refusal to purchase any other portions of Aqueduct. The contract also grants the bistate agency considerable say in determining what can be built on Aqueduct if it is sold to another buyer.
Glen Mathes, a spokesman for the Racing Association, said the price also was similar to offers made by private developers.
Mr. Mathes said the Racing Association will now lease back the 23 acres from the Port Authority and continue using it as a parking lot. He said the sale will not affect racing activities at the 203-acre race track, whose seven-month season begins Oct. 21.
The Racing Association, which operates Aqueduct under a state-granted franchise, had balked at the sale. But association officials changed their minds in July after Mr. Cuomo threatened to pack the association's board of trustees with his appointees.

Schwinn Files Under Chapter 11

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Under pressure from its creditors, the Schwinn Bicycle Company, America's oldest bicycle manufacturer, said yesterday that it had filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
The two-wheeler of choice for many growing baby boomers during the 1950's and 1960's, by the late 1970's Schwinn's durable but bulky models lost their cachet in a market more interested in bicycles that were lighter, sleeker and sophisticated. Analysts said Schwinn was also slow to respond to the growing popularity in the 1980's of mountain bikes, which now account for six of every 10 bicycles sold in the United States.
 
A Steady Drop In Sales
 From a peak of 28 percent in the 1960's, Schwinn, based in Chicago, has seen its share shrink to about 8 percent of what today is a $2.5 billion to $3 billion market. 
 To help revive its flagging fortunes, earlier this year the privately held company retained Continental Partners, a Chicago investment bank, to search for a partner. The search for potential investors continues, unaffected by the bankruptcy filing, said Edward R. Schwinn Jr., the company's president and chief executive.
The company, which last year had revenues of about $195 million, has outstanding debts of approximately $80 million, Mr. Schwinn said. "Had the economy been buoyant, we would have been fine," he said in a telephone interview. "But we are a part of Americana and intend to stay that way."
 
Products Made Overseas
 Mr. Schwinn's great-grandfather Ignaz Schwinn founded the company along with Adolph Arnold in 1895. The Schwinn name may be as American as apple pie, but the bulk of its product line is not. To pare costs, since the late 1970's Schwinn has been importing its bikes from Taiwan and China. The company, which has 315 employees down from a peak of 1,900 in the early 1980's, still makes a few higher-priced Paramount bicycles at a plant in Wisconsin.
Despite the company's problems, industry watchers said they were optimistic about Schwinn's prospects.
"They will be all right," said Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling magazine. "They have the best retail distribution system in the business, as well as the most loyal. And with their health division, they have a little more diversity than companies who only make bicycles."
Schwinn manufactures Air-Dyne machines, a stationary bicycle that promotes cardiovascular fitness.
 
New Models Praised
 In addition, Mr. McCullagh and others said they were encouraged by Schwinn's 1993 product line, currently being exhibited at trade shows across the country.
New Schwinn bikes coming on the market for 1993 include a new line of "Z" bikes that feature both coaster and hand brakes on lower-priced bikes; "mag" wheels and hand brakes on mid-priced models and grip-shift gears, six speeds and aluminum wheels on premium models.
"Their new line looks good," said Mike Sinward, president and founder of Specialized Bicycle Components in Morgan Hill, Calif., a major competitor. "They had some new colors and graphics, and some new models. They are still a player, and we are keeping an eye on them."

HEADLINE: Marketing Blitz Aims to Show Companies Connecticut Hospitality

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FARMINGTON, Conn., Oct. 8

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. unveiled a $2.7 million marketing campaign today to sell Connecticut to businesses throughout the nation and the world.
The campaign, which is to include advertisements in many business magazines and newspapers, seeks to counter the image of Connecticut as a place where doing business is costly and cumbersome, and to promote its budget-balancing measures as a sign that it is a "state that thinks like a business." 
 Standing in front of a simple stone wall at the Hill-Stead Museum here in the hills of central Connecticut, Governor Weicker said: "We want businesses to understand that there are no stone walls in Connecticut except those which grace our landscape."
"The people of Connecticut bit the bullet and are doing what nobody else in the United States has done," he added, emphasizing not only that his administration had succeeded in reducing the state's deficit but also that it had cut business and sales taxes when it won approval of a state income tax. "We have a solvent state with brains and cash that can make anything happen."
 
Business Wooed Elsewhere
 The out-of-state advertising campaign begins four and a half months after a similar in-state promotion was announced in an effort to stem the flow of companies and jobs to states with lower labor costs and taxes. Since 1985, one-fourth of Connecticut's manufacturing jobs have disappeared, and in the last three years, the state has lost about 185,000 jobs -- many as a result of concerted campaigns by other states to woo Connecticut businesses.
Southern states, especially, have been targeting Northeastern states like Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts for 10 years, said Joseph J. McGee, the state's Commissioner of Economic Development. He said some states, like Texas and Georgia, had lured Connecticut companies using tactics like cash bonuses for new employees, free trips for business owners considering a move and even data bases to track and solicit companies whose leases are expiring. But Mr. McGee said that the new campaign involved "no retaliation."
Noting that 239 companies have moved from New York State to Connecticut in the last nine months alone -- continuing a decades-long exodus, particularly from New York City to Fairfield County -- Mr. McGee nonetheless struck a conciliatory tone toward other Northeastern states that have also lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in the last few years.
"We have an agreement with New York and New Jersey that we won't use negative advertising against them," he said. "We're not out to damage Manhattan."
 
Utilities Financing Campaign
 Instead, Mr. McGee said that the campaign -- which is being financed by Connecticut utilities -- would try to attract "manufacturers with a research-and-development component, like pharmaceuticals and medical products" by highlighting the state's strengths. He cited Connecticut's educated population and "growing collaboration between businesses and universities."
As evidence of the state's commitment to attracting new businesses, Mr. McGee said that Connecticut was making credit more easily available with a $1 billion loan and loan-guarantee program. He also said that the Department of Economic Development was providing $35 million this year in "risk financing" for product development by new companies.
The marketing campaign is to begin with a cover gatefold and a 13-page advertising supplement in a special issue of Fortune magazine titled "1993 Investors Guide," which is being delivered to subscribers now.

Hope Wanes on Fed Easing of Rates

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Bond traders and economists all but gave up hope yesterday for the prompt Federal Reserve easing that had seemed so certain a mere week ago. The economy remains so weak, however, that many still expect the Fed to lower interest rates after the election.
Money managers said the falling value of the dollar and the nearness of the election most likely stayed the Fed's hand. "It is traditional to the Fed's view not to operate before an election if they can avoid it," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston and a former vice president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. 
 The central bank's inaction helped the dollar gain sharply yesterday against foreign currencies, allowing bonds, in turn, to make up some of their recent losses. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 13/32 , or more than 40 cents for each $1,000 in face value, to 9722/32 , for a yield of 7.44 percent.
 
Dismal Economic Statistics
 A week ago, a series of dismal economic statistics and the prospect of Fed interest rate cuts had lowered the yield to about 7.31 percent. But that prospect also lessened the dollar's attractiveness to foreign investors.
Many bond traders expected the Fed to ease after the release of September jobless figures last Friday. While marginally better than predicted, they still showed a loss of 57,000 jobs. With no evidence of action, they shrugged and then waited until Tuesday for a meeting of Fed policy makers.
As Tuesday and Wednesday passed without the Fed giving interest rates a nudge, traders sharply reversed their direction, dumping the bonds they had enthusiastically stored up.
Although the timing of Fed actions is not necessarily predictable, economists say that the most likely moments have passed. "The failure to operate Tuesday, Wednesday and again today indicates that a majority of voting members don't favor any additional relaxation," said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter.
What strategists saw yesterday, however, was an economic landscape that remained as bleak, with bond prices that looked like bargains. The Government's auction of seven-year notes on Wednesday had gone badly, with an average yield of 6.01 percent -- well above where these notes had traded on the when-issued market in the previous days.
Buyers of these notes had cause to cheer yesterday, as the seven-year yield fell to 5.96 percent. The credit market had the most bounce at intermediate and shorter maturities, where interest rates are more directly affected by the Fed.
"With the auction behind us, we did see some good retail buying," said John C. Spinello, a managing director trading Government securities at Merrill Lynch.
The credit market continued volatile, tossed by every rumor of a report of a rumor. Prices received an early lift from rumors of imminent Fed easing, retreated as the rumors faded, then gained again as some investors saw the strengthening dollar and thought about the longer term. Declines in some European interest rates aided the value of the dollar and United States bonds.
Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, was one of the few to say even on Monday that the Fed would not cut its rates. Then, and again yesterday, he cited currency market fears.
"The desire to maintain stability in the foreign exchange markets after a period of extraordinary turmoil is the main current in the policy debate," he said yesterday. "If a U.S. rate cut had kicked the dollar into a sharp decline, that would have had a detrimental impact on markets worldwide."
 
High European Rates
 High European interest rates, especially in Germany, and falling rates here have sapped the dollar's value. Mr. Crandall discounted reports that the Fed was delaying rate cuts only to coordinate its move with foreign central banks.
With short-term interest rates already at 30-year lows, the Fed might want to leave themselves some room in case of a crisis. "They might want to parse out their ammunition in case of a market break," Mr. Soss said, adding that the stock market's rebound from its plunge Monday morning removed the need to start firing now.
Since Fed officials want to avoid the appearance of responding to political pressures, they will hold off acting until next month, he said. "It's a matter of getting your candy later, but you're certainly going to get it," he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Post Broad Rise; Dow Up 23.78

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
After five back-to-back losing sessions, the stock market staged a broad advance yesterday, inspired partly by a Government report that showed a downturn in jobless benefit claims.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed up 23.78 points, to 3,176.03. 
 The broader market reported solid gains: advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 205 million shares, against 184.4 million in the previous session.
Stocks initially rose after the Labor Department reported the new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 24,000, to 400,000, for the week ended Sept. 26. That's the first drop in six weeks and one of the few positive economic statistics investors have seen in recent days.
The early gains began slipping after the first hour of trading as computerized trading programs siphoned profits. The market bounced back by midafternoon on speculation that the Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank will cut interest rates together at some point in the future, said Hildegard Zagorski, a vice president at Prudential Securities Inc.
A similar rumor helped push up government bond prices in the afternoon.
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A. G. Edwards & Sons. Inc. in St. Louis, said the market's rise was based on technical factors. The heavy selling in the stock market since Friday has "just exhausted the sellers," Mr. Goldman said. That left many stocks in a temporarily oversold condition, which attracted technical buying, he said.
Centerior Energy, an Ohio holding company for Cleveland Electric and Toledo Energy, was the most active issue on the Big Board, up 1/8 at 18 7/8. A single block trade of 3.5 million shares within the last half-hour of dealings accounted for most of trading volume.
Centerior agreed Tuesday with consumer groups to freeze its rates through 1996. The session was the last day an investor could buy the stock and receive a quarterly dividend payment.
 
Other Active Issues
 Other active issues on the Big Board included Navistar International, unchanged at 1 7/8; Merck & Company, down 1/8 at 42 1/4; Citicorp, unchanged at 14 1/2, and Coca Cola Company, up 1/8 at 37 5/8.
Compaq Computer rose 2 3/4, to 36 1/4, a new 52-week high, a day after announcing plans to lay off 10 percent of its worldwide work force to meet the fierce competition in the computer business.
Rowan Companies was off 1/8 at 8 1/2. The contract drilling concern received favorable comments from analysts on Wednesday and the company's president said previous quarterly loss estimates were too low.
USAir Group was up 3/4 at 12 3/8 after the airline and unionized machinists announced a tentative settlement to a four-day-old strike.
 
Retail Sales Up
 Wal-Mart was up 1 1/8 at 58 5/8 and the Limited up 1 at 21 5/8 after the nation's largest retailers reported improved sales over Labor Day and slightly better-than-expected sales for September.
The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, was up 1 3/8 at 64 3/4 after reporting its third-quarter earnings rose 18 percent, to $1.51 a share, against $1.28 a share in the period a year earlier.
Borland International was off 3 1/8 at 27 5/8 in heavy over-the-counter trading after three major investment firms issued negative comments about the computer software company.
The Big Board's composite index rose 1.78, to 224.62, while the market value index on the American Stock Exchange gained 0.13, to 367.01.

HEADLINE: Retailers Report Gains But Remain Cautious

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The nation's chain stores yesterday reported their strongest monthly sales gain of the year, but retailers and analysts hesitated to interpret the September increase as a sign of a sustained rise in consumer spending.
Once again, the phrase of the day was "cautiously optimistic," because of exceptional factors like a later-than-normal Labor Day and a sudden drop in temperatures nationwide.
Department and specialty stores that do the bulk of their business in apparel reported unusually strong sales. Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates chains like Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's and Lazarus, posted a 6.6 percent rise at stores open at least one year, a closely watched indicator of retail performance. Mervyn's, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation that sells moderately priced clothing, saw comparable-store sales climb 11 percent.
 
'Some Broad-Based Strengths'
 And Sears, Roebuck & Company and Circuit City Stores Inc. reported strong sales of consumer electronics and appliances, big-ticket durable items that are of little interest to shoppers in a weak economy. 
 "You're seeing some broad-based strengths in the numbers," said Margo McGlade, a retail analyst at Paine Webber. "But it's hard to know whether you should read anything into it. We haven't seen a pickup in auto sales and consumer confidence, and that makes me somewhat skeptical of projecting on the basis of September sales."
Those stores that have consistently raised sales throughout the recession had another strong month, with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reporting a 12 percent rise at stores open at least one year and Gap Inc. ratcheting up an 11 percent increase. Gap cautioned, however, that heavy promotions were partly responsible.
Paine Webber's index of the sales performance of 20 large retail chains rose 7 percent in September, compared with 4.5 percent in August. A similar index of 15 retailers compiled by Salomon Brothers jumped 7.5 percent last month, compared with a 4.6 percent increase for August. But analysts cautioned that the results were misleading because of aberrations in the calendar.
 
'We Continue to Move Sideways'
 Retailers reported somewhat disappointing sales for August because shoppers were waiting for Labor Day promotions. But averaging August and September results together, most retailers sold about as much merchandise as they expected to sell, analysts said.
"I think when you look at the two months' sales combined, you see we continue to move sideways," said Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Securities. For example, in the combined August-September period, Federated's comparable-store sales grew 4.9 percent, and Dayton Hudson's were up 3 percent.
Mr. Hood said the weak California economy would keep a lid on sales growth for many retailers with a presence there, preventing comparable-store sales from growing much more than 4 percent this year. Other analysts are slightly more optimistic, projecting an increase of 5 to 5.5 percent for the year.
Analysts differ on how the holiday sales season, when retailers make the largest portion of their annual profits, is shaping up. Some believe that tight inventories, controlled expenses and virtually nonexistent inflation -- translating into favorable accounting adjustments -- will enable retail companies to generate higher profits in the fourth quarter.
"Consumer spending will not be ebullient at Christmas, but for the first time in four years, retailers will have good profits then," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, an analyst at Salomon.
Kimberly Walin, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers , said the stronger sales momentum in September has continued into the first week of this month. "What will happen is still anyone's guess," she said. "But if August and September tend to be strong, you typically don't get a weak Christmas."
So far, most retailers have avoided the excessive price-cutting that has eroded profits over the last several years. The cooler weather in September caused shoppers to buy their winter wardrobes a little earlier, which means merchants may take fewer markdowns in October.
 
Retailers' Sales Outlined
 By The Associated Press
 Following are the domestic September sales reported by some of the nation's largest retailers. The data compare the current year's sales with those of the previous year.

HEADLINE: Hewlett-Packard Sets Charge for Cut in Jobs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company said today that it will take a special charge of 40 cents a share in the current quarter to cover a voluntary employment-reduction plan. The company said it expects about 2,700 employees, 2,000 in the United States, to leave the company in early 1993 as part of the severance-incentive plan intended to balance its work force and cut expenses.
Hewlett-Packard stock closed today at $53.375 a share, down 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts had anticipated the job cuts since August, when the company posted disappointing earnings for its third quarter, ended July 31, and said that it would take steps to further reduce expenses. Hewlett-Packard carried out similar programs in 1986, 1990 and 1991; it currently has 90,900 employees. 
 "The program is one of a number of work-force balancing and expense-control options that we've used in the past to help manage the changing needs of our business," John A. Young, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. "Programs like this have proven to be successful and equitable ways to adjust our employment."
 The voluntary severance-incentive program in the United States includes six months' pay plus a half-month's pay for each year of service to a maximum of 12 months' pay. In locations outside the United States, programs vary depending on local regulations and practices in each country. Hewlett-Packard will offer the program to employees in all of its businesses.
Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said he expected many of the reductions to come in Hewlett-Packard's test and measurement equipment business, which had been "hurt both by the economy and also by the unwinding of the aerospace industry." He said the size of the reduction was a little larger than he had expected. "They seem to be saying, if we're going to go through this exercise, let's not nickel-and-dime it," he added.
Hewlett-Packard also said that many of its United States operations will close for three working days during the December holidays to reduce expenses; some international operations will also close. Employees in the United States will take paid vacation Dec. 29, 30 and 31, along with paid holidays Dec. 25, 28 and Jan. 1. The company has had similar plant closings in December for the last three years.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Mostly Higher In Absence of a Cut in Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday without any easing of interest rates in the United States or abroad, as was rumored.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery fell $1.10, to $349.90 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York said gold fell 85 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $349.75 an ounce. 
 Rick Krause, a dealer with the New York branch of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., said traders had been waiting for the Federal Reserve and the German central bank to bring down interest rates. But when that did not happen, he said, traders acted without benefit of good or bad news.
"The market's just decided it has seen the bottom for now and they are taking it up," Mr. Krause said. "The real question is whether we have started an upward trend for the dollar or if this is a correction."
In New York, the dollar rose to 121.70 Japanese yen, from 120.40 yen late Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 120.80 Japanese yen, from 119.78 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 120.90 yen.
In European trading, the British pound fell sharply after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, told Conservatives that the country would not rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism "until it is right for Britain."
In New York, the pound fell to $1.6828, from $1.7095 late Wednesday. In London, the pound fell to $1.6925, from $1.7150 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4815 German marks, up from 1.4490; 1.3135 Swiss francs, up from 1.2740; 5.0310 French francs, up from 4.9170; 1,305.5 Italian lire, down from 1,319, and 1.24875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24625.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.732 a troy ounce, up from $3.723 on Wednesday. Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $3.78 a troy ounce, up from $3.75 bid late Wednesday.

Matisse or Money
 The Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pa., with the encouragement of Sotheby's, is proposing to do something considered blasphemous in museum circles. The museum wants to sell its most valuable painting, Matisse's "Pink Shrimp," from 1920, to help cover operating costs. And the Museum of Modern Art's current blockbuster Matisse retrospective may help the Everhart to sell it. 
 Like many other museums, the Everhart is facing severe cuts in city financing and says it will have to close next year unless it sacrifices the painting. The museum needs permission from Orphans Court of the Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas in Scranton, which oversees charitable trusts like the one that established the museum in 1908, to sell the painting. According to court papers, in September 1991 officials at the Everhart were told that the annual appropriation from the City of Scranton, which was $155,000 in 1991, would be frozen. For 1992, the city reduced its annual commitment to $82,000, and the museum said it expected the reductions to continue. Moreover, the institution's accountants said the economic forecast indicates operating losses of $84,273 in 1992 and $214,890 in 1993.
"Pink Shrimp" is featured, along with two other Matisses from the Modern's show, in Sotheby's catalogue for its New York sale of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculptures on Nov. 10. The other paintings are being sold by two estates: that of Mollie Parnis Livingston, the dress designer, and of Wright Ludington, a founder of the Santa Barbara (Calif.) Museum of Art.
But whether the Everhart is free to sell the painting and use part of the money to cover day-to-day operating expenses remains to be seen. In a hearing on Monday in the Orphans Court, the museum asked for permission to sell the painting to establish an operations and acquisitions fund. According to court papers, Sotheby's recommended selling the work, which is estimated to bring $3 million to $4 million, in its November sale because "deaccessioning the Matisse at such a time, in coincidence" with the Modern's exhibition, which runs through Jan. 12, "would maximize the return."
 
Acquisitions, Yes. Operations, No.
 Professional museum organizations like the American Association of Museums and the Association of Art Museum Directors consider selling a work permissible if it is done to raise money to acquire more art. But they strongly disapprove of selling artworks to pay for an institution's day-to-day operating expenses.
But the Everhart Museum is not the first institution to attempt it. Last year, the Rose Art Museum of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass, sold 11 Impressionist and modern works by artists including Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec and Vuillard at Christie's in New York for a total of $3.65 million to help pay operating costs. Other museums, including the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pa., the Reading (Pa.) Public Museum and Art Gallery and the Fuller Museum of Art in Brockton, Mass., have proposed selling artworks to cover operating expenses, but in the end they were dissuaded by public and art-world pressure.
"It is surprising the issue keeps coming up," said Millicent Hall Gaudieri, the executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors. Last year, the association issued a code of ethics stating that any museum that sells works from its collection for any purpose other than buying art will no longer be able to participate in loan exhibitions with any of the association's 160 members.
Kevin O'Brien, the director of the Everhart, seems unfazed by the association's stand. "We're too small an institution to be included in the Association of Art Museum Directors," Mr. O'Brien said. "If we don't raise money soon, we'll have to close." In court documents, the museum says it has tried to raise money through its development committee. The museum estimates that $160,000 a year is needed to replace lost governmental revenues. So far, court documents say, fund-raising and trying to establish an endowment have been unsuccessful.
Ms. Gaudieri said the association was willing to send a task force to the Everhart to talk about possible solutions. "Many other institutions have faced similar problems and have solved them without selling works of art," she said. "We think we can help."
 
Looking for Alternatives
 The association isn't the only organization concerned with the Everhart's plight. Brent Glass, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, which operates about 28 museums in the state, said he could think of many alternatives. "Museums need to be challenged before taking a step like this," he said. "At the hearing on Monday, I saw some healthy trends in the Everhart's revenue that the museum tried to gloss over. While the City of Scranton is cutting funding, they are not cutting them off totally."
Jean Cutler, the director of the Pennsylvania Federation of Museum and Historical Organizations, a nonprofit organization that provides services to museums in Pennsylvania, said her trustees disapproved of what the Everhart was trying to do. "There are still many unresolved issues," she said. "In the hearing, museum officials kept saying the Matisse was a lone duck in its collection and was totally out of context. I don't understand. The Everhart has an Utrillo, as well as many European prints from the 17th to 20th centuries."
Mrs. Cutler said one particularly difficult issue for the museum was that under the museum's charter its board was made up of five judges, and judges, by state law, cannot raise money for the institution. "It's hard when the staff is expected to be the sole fund-raisers," she said.
Mrs. Cutler said that Judge Frank Eagan of Orphans Court, who is overseeing the current proceedings, resigned from the Everhart's board in 1988. She said he had not seen the five judges who are museum trustees in the last six months. Judge Eagan did not respond to several messages left requesting a comment.
"The judge is not part of the museum, so this is not a conflict of interest," said Mr. O'Brien, who added that he hoped a decision would be issued this month.
 
Old Masters for Sale
 Both Sotheby's and Christie's have snagged some big-ticket paintings for this fall's London sales.
This week, Christie's issued a three-page news release about one work: Pieter de Hooch's "Courtyard of a House in Delft," from 1658, which is to be auctioned on Dec. 11. The painting is estimated to bring $11.5 million.
Those who saw the "Treasure Houses of Britain" blockbuster at the National Gallery of Art in Washington six years ago may remember the work. It depicts a courtyard with a small girl sitting on a step cradling a dog. Several experts on Old Master paintings know it well, for it seems Christie's has been trying to sell the work privately for more than a year.
"Christie's offered it for sale at an enormous price and failed to sell it," said one expert who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Now, it's up at public auction at an estimate that matches what some people said they thought the painting was worth."
Charles Beddington, who heads Christie's Old Masters department in London, conceded that the painting had been offered around. "At one point, the seller would only accept a very much higher price," he said. "But now we have a price everyone is happy with."
Although Mr. Beddington refused to give specific numbers, he did say the painting was originally offered at a price about three times the present dollar estimate. "Now we have several interested people, so it's better to have a sale," he said.
Mr. Beddington described the painting as the most important de Hooch in private hands today. He said there would probably not be a problem in exporting the work from Britain, unlike the situation that existed when Holbein's "Lady With a Pet Squirrel and a Starling" was sold in April to the National Gallery in London for $17.7 million, rather than at public auction, to insure that it would remain in Britain. The difference is that the National Gallery in London has a painting by de Hooch that is similar to the one being auctioned.
As to provenance, the auction house would say only that the work is from Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire. According to the catalogue for the "Treasure Houses of Britain" show, the owner is Julian Byng, who inherited Wrotham Park from his mother's family.
"It is probably not being sold by an individual, but by a trust," said Susan Adams, a spokeswoman in the Christie's London press office. "And I'm afraid that's all we are allowed to say."
Sotheby's London sale announcement this week included two paintings that will be the stars of different London sales. The first work is Wassily Kandinsky's "Sketch I for Composition VII," from 1913, which belonged to the artist's friend Paul Klee and is to be offered Dec. 1 in the auction of modern paintings, drawings and sculpture. It is estimated to bring $8.7 million.
The painting is the first sketch for "Composition VII," a work that belongs to the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.
The other London star at Sotheby's is a rare bullfighting scene by Goya that is to be offered at the auction house's sale of Old Master paintings on Dec. 9. The 1824 work, one of the first Goyas to appear at auction without export restrictions, is estimated to bring $7 million to $10 million.

Perot: Raising Alarm on the Deficit

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
The Perot campaign began broadcasting three 60-second commercials about the state of the economy on Thursday. They are being shown nationwide on eight cable networks and on ABC, CBS, and NBC -- mostly during sporting events -- between now and Monday. A representative advertisement is titled "Red Flag."
 
ON THE SCREEN A red flag, rippling slowly, fills the screen, providing the backdrop for white-lettered text that rolls upward. A deep-voiced announcer reads the script, accompanied by the militaristic roll of a snare drum. At the end of the ad, the campaign's red "Perot" logo briefly flashes.
 

PRODUCER The 270 Group
 
SCRIPT "While the cold war is ending, another war is now upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of communism, but the red ink of our national debt, the red tape of our government bureaucracy. The casualties of this war are counted in lost jobs and lost dreams.
"As in all wars, the critical issue to winning is leadership. In this election, you can vote for a candidate who has proven his leadership by making the free enterprise system work. Creating jobs. Building businesses. A candidate who is not a business-as-usual politician, but a business leader with the know-how to expand the tax base, reduce the national debt, and restore the meaning of 'Made in the U.S.A.'
"The issue is leadership. The candidate is Ross Perot. The choice is yours."
 
ACCURACY The ad accurately conveys Mr. Perot's belief that the most dangerous threat to the country is its growing debt. His opponents, President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, say unemployment is an even more pressing problem.
As in the 30-minute "infomercial" broadcast by Mr. Perot on Tuesday, which will be repeated Friday, the 60-second ads never mention Mr. Perot's tough prescription for eliminating the deficit, which includes higher income taxes, a large increase in gasoline taxes and deep cuts in entitlement programs.
Mr. Perot's claim that his success in the business world would be transferable to government is, of course, unprovable. He has no prior political experience.
 
SCORECARD Mr. Perot is at his best when tsk-tsking about the economy, a practice that allows him to cast blame on both the Republicans and the Democrats. By stressing that the main threat to the country is now red ink, not the Red Army, Mr. Perot diminishes the liability of his dearth of foreign policy experience. By not appearing or being heard in any of the three ads, Mr. Perot may be acknowledging that his on-again, off-again campaign has made his message more powerful than its messenger.

GENERAL ELECTRIC TO LAY OFF 680 AT KENTUCKY PLANT

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The General Electric Company yesterday cited overly optimistic sales forecasts in announcing plans to lay off of 500 hourly and 180 salaried workers at its appliance manufacturing operations in Louisville, Ky. Most of the workers at the Louisville Appliance Park will be laid off on Dec. 11, said a company spokesman, James H. Allen. An additional 70 salaried employees would be laid off at other G.E. operations around the country, he said. 
 Although the move was prompted by slower-than-expected sales of G.E.'s washers, dryers and refrigerators, the layoffs will include employees involved in other manufacturing operations, Mr. Allen said. Norman Mitchell, president of an International Union of Electrical Workers local that represents G.E.'s hourly workers in Louisville, said he was angry that the layoffs would put workers in unemployment lines at Christmas time. G.E. employs 12,000 people at the plant, including 8,000 that the union represents.

HEADLINE: Double Standard on Refugees

 BODY:
Hundreds of Cubans have been landing in Florida in recent months, escaping the repressive Castro regime and economic privation. Under streamlined procedures, the new arrivals have been allowed to remain in the U.S. as legal immigrants and political refugees, receiving help from relatives and volunteer agencies.
Contrast this benign welcome with the harsh treatment of Haitian refugees, also fleeing a repressive and impoverished land. Many have been intercepted at sea and forcibly returned to Haiti, where they risk violent retaliation. 
 The U.S. cannot accept all the refugees who want to come here. That's why it's important to respond to those displaced by crises with flexibility, generosity and fairness.
The Cuban Adjustment Act, a relic of cold war hostility to Fidel Castro, accords special privileges to Cuban refugees. The act allows them to settle and work in the U.S., after a background check by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for previous criminal or undesirable activity. After a year they can apply for permanent resident status. For budgetary and policy reasons, the Immigration Service has now streamlined the application process, making it still easier for Cubans to enter. The special treatment has been an inducement to individuals on leaky boats and to smugglers who transport large groups. And it is politically popular among the anti-Castro Cubans in Florida. But it's often hard to distinguish between those escaping persecution, who are thus entitled to admission as political refugees, and those seeking a better life, who would not be except for the special law.
The Haitian refugees, meanwhile, are not even getting a fair chance to make their cases. They have suffered from chronic poverty and political turmoil, and ever larger numbers began fleeing oppression after the overthrow of the democratic Government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. But since May the Administration has stopped trying to distinguish which are political and which are economic refugees. Instead it cruelly turns them all back on the high seas, before they can make their claims for political asylum.
The legality of that policy will be reviewed by the Supreme Court within the year. Its immorality is already clear. The preferential treatment given Cubans is difficult to defend. The excessively harsh treatment of Haitians is impossible.

HEADLINE: First, Fight the Slump

 BODY:
To judge by the urgings of the Presidential candidates, no one would know that the U.S. economy is stuck, stagnating. They all talk about the long-term problem of spurring growth, which is surely a theme worth attention. But what about the present moment? The current slump traps millions in unemployment and threatens the jobs of millions more.
What should be done about that, now? Sunday's debate provides a superb opportunity for all three men to end their peculiar silence. 
 The best remedy for a sagging economy is a menu of quick-hitting tax cuts and spending hikes. Tax cut promises are rarely something politicians shrink from making. But in the face of a $4 trillion debt, the candidates this year are running away from deficits, any deficits, out of fear they'll be branded as irresponsible.
Short-term relief calls for the stimulation of temporary tax cuts and spending hikes. The key word is temporary. As long as lower taxes and higher spending are brought back into line as the economy recovers, the long-term deficit will be largely unaffected, economic growth uncompromised. The public needs to hear from the three candidates that they understand this, and how they propose to act on it.
Consumer confidence has sunk so low that spending isn't likely to recover anytime soon. And the Federal Reserve Board, having driven interest rates to their lowest levels in decades, is unlikely to do much more. Indeed, if the Fed were to become much more aggressive it might frighten bond traders. Fearing inflation, they could demand higher interest rates, the opposite of what the Fed wants to accomplish.
That puts the burden on Congress, which is just now going home for the election. It has options. It could, for example, raise Federal grants to state and local government to accelerate public investment projects that are already on the drawing boards but have been postponed for lack of money. This would help fight recession and also, by building infrastructure, boost long-term growth. Temporary, across-the-board tax cuts would also help stimulate the economy.
An anti-recession program might increase next year's deficit by, say, $80 billion. But a one- or two-year rise in deficits threatens nothing important. Congress's hardest challenge would be to convince Wall Street that it will keep its word and phase out the tax cuts and spending hikes as the economy turns upward. Putting that commitment into law would help. Indeed, the 1990 deficit-reduction law adds a measure of credibility. Congress has largely stuck by the agreement, introducing very few programs it wasn't willing to pay for.
When the candidates gather to debate the economy this Sunday, voters will want to listen carefully to their plans for the next several years. But those strategies, however interesting, should not be allowed to obscure what they propose for the next few chilly months.

HEADLINE: BILLS SENT TO BUSH AS 102D CONGRESS WRAPS UP ITS WORK

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Trying to end a grinding, unsatisfying session, the 102d Congress finished its main work today as the Senate passed bills dealing with taxes, energy, Western water resources and public health.
After two years in which their public image was determined far more by scandals, confrontations and vetoes than by their legislative output, the lawmakers were trying to adjourn, finally, on Friday after sending President Bush a packet of popular bills. 
 But as they have done for much of this session, they also sent him political problems -- bills he is being urged to veto but cannot without disappointing important Republicans.
 
Descent Into Partisanship
 A furious exchange over the Presidential campaign was a typical punctuation mark for the end of a Congress that began with stately speeches about the Persian Gulf war but dissolved quickly into partisan wrangling over the economy. Then it descended into dismal reflection over the House bank scandal and the Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill confrontation over allegations of sexual harassment.
The session begun in January was continually distracted by electoral politics, both Presidential and Congressional. It found occasional moments of accord, most memorably when both Houses agreed this summer to provide aid to Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union.
Today's legislative actions were generally civil, but the last big bill, the tax measure, was headed for Presidential rejection. The White House said today that Mr. Bush would veto the bill, even though it includes many provisions he sought, like the creation of enterprise zones, and items that Republican senators also covet, like an end to the luxury tax on boats and planes.
 
Argument From the Floor
 So Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, took the floor to argue with the reason that White House aides have given for a likely veto -- that the bill raises $27 billion in taxes over five years. Those increases are offset by an equal $27 billion in tax cuts, Mr. Danforth noted, saying "a revenue-neutral bill isn't a tax increase."
The water resources bill, furiously attacked by Senator John Seymour, Republican of California, because it would take water from farmers in the state's Central Valley to help cities and wildlife, is also backed by most other Republican senators from the West because it helps their states.
Senator Jake Garn, a Republican from Utah who is to retire, said today that he had worked 25 years to see completion of the Central Utah Project, which is in the bill, and pleaded, "Please, Mr. President, don't veto it."
The energy bill has a surer future. "We're pleased about that," Judy Smith, deputy White House press secretary, said today.
James D. Watkins, the Secretary of Energy, welcomed the bill, saying it would "stimulate energy production, promote energy efficiency, remove regulatory barriers and promote the use of alternative transportation fuels."
While the energy bill takes important steps in all those areas, it does far less to reduce consumption and increase production of oil than the Administration and Congress had promised two years ago.
A token of the temper of the session followed almost immediately after the 67-to-22 vote to pass the tax bill.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, took the floor to denounce President Bush for questioning why Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential nominee, had gone to Moscow while he was a Rhodes Scholar in 1969.
"Innuendo and smear," Mr. Bradley complained, assailing Mr. Bush for "impugning the patriotism of the Democratic nominee."
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Bush was "pouring salt on some of the most painful wounds the country has ever experienced."
 
Going Far Enough?
 But Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, said Mr. Bush had only asked why Mr. Clinton had gone to Moscow. "I don't think the President went far enough," he said. "When does asking a question become undignified or unfair?"
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said it was wrong to ask a question when the questioner knew the inference to be drawn was false. He said Mr. Bush's question was as "preposterous" as it would be for someone to ask why Mr. Bush survived and another flier died when his warplane crashed in the Pacific. Mr. Biden said that to ask, "did he leave him there to die," would be "outrageous."
But after Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, observed, "How merciful it is that this Senate session is coming to an end," the Senate turned to calmer oratory, abundant praise of colleagues retiring from the Senate and the adoption of uncontroversial bills by unanimous consent.
 
Cutting Health Costs
 Two bills to cut costs and expand services at public health clinics were passed. One would greatly reduce their malpractice insurance expenses by covering their approximately 100,000 doctors and nurses under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The other would guarantee them Medicaid price discounts for prescription drugs.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, said the clinics were "indispensable to millions of poor and under-served Americans." He added, "Rising costs and inadequate appropriations make it urgent for us to find new ways to stretch current resources further."
The Senate also passed to Mr. Bush an anti-carjacking bill, making the armed theft of an automobile a Federal offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The measure would expand the number of car parts marked with identification numbers, and require that repair shops check with a Government data base before installing used parts to make sure they are not dealing in stolen goods.
 
Financial Regulations
 The senators also adopted a bill to enhance the responsibilities of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in regulating exchanges that trade in futures, from pork bellies to financial offerings. Proponents argued that the measure would help American exchanges compete on the global market.
And they passed a major reorganization of Federal housing programs that includes more money for favorite programs that Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp designed to help low-income inhabitants of public housing buy their units. The bill also puts the multibillion-dollar market where existing mortgages are traded under an independent regulator. The bill would require the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, to set capital standards.
The Senate also sent to President Bush a five-year moratorium on tuna fishing by purse siene net, which can kill dolphins. A United States ban on imports of yellow-finned tuna products from Mexico and two South American countries that use the nets had prompted complaints that Washington was violating international free-trade accords. Under the bill, which is backed by the White House, the embargo would be lifted against countries that honor the moratorium.
Some of those measures went to Mr. Bush for his signature, a veto or to die by a pocket-veto if he does not sign them within 10 days. Others went to the House, which is scheduled to meet Friday with a handful of members on hand to agree to utterly uncontroversial measures. The Senate adjourned tonight until the new 103d Congress convenes on Jan. 5.
 
Abundance of Disputes
 Today's main Senate actions, though taken by lopsided votes, were hardly without dispute.
The greatest opposition was recorded against the tax bill. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, criticized it and said that because of its tax increases, "The bottom line is that the President will not sign the bill."
He suggested that the bill be stripped down to a few essentials, like the low-income-housing tax credit, repeal of the luxury taxes and breaks for the real estate industry. Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, rejected the idea and said too many senators had told him, "I want a stripped-down bill, but make sure my provision stays in."
Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said, "I hope no one seriously contends that this is the tax measure the President asked for." He attacked the bill for imposing a $10,000 limit on the deduction for moving expenses, saying the average move costs $15,000. "We pay for all these other goodies by taxing the middle class," he said.
 
Origins in a Riot
 Hardly mentioned in today's debate was the engine for the tax bill, the Los Angeles riots, which led to a shaky House alliance behind a measure focused on aiding distressed cities. But by the time the Senate passed its version last week, urban aid was only a small part of a bill that ranged from changes in individual retirement accounts to provisions to encourage contributions to universities, orchestras and museums.
The House-Senate conference on the bill may have been doomed from the start because political demands on Mr. Bush that he forswear anything anyone could call a tax increase intensified through his struggling campaign for re-election.
The energy bill overcame an intense filibuster by Nevada's two Democratic Senators, Richard H. Bryan and Harry Reid, who fought the bill because it would ease allowable radiation standards to facilitate developing a nuclear waste dump at their state's Yucca Mountain.
Mr. Bryan insisted that his state was "shafted" by the bill, but debate was cut off on an 84-to-8 vote.
 
Passed by Voice Vote
 The bill was passed on a voice vote after Senator J. Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who heads the energy committee, called it "the most environmentally sound bill ever considered on energy." He said it would lead to energy conservation in Federal buildings and in bathroom shower heads, and would promote the use of renewable fuels, clean coal and solar energy. "We expect that by the year 2000 there will be millions of alternative-fuel vehicles on the road," Mr. Johnston said.
The water resources bill, which passed 83 to 8, would authorize water projects in 17 Western states, bringing it many supporters despite some sympathy for Mr. Seymour's protests.
He objected to the bill's provision that would alter the way water from the huge Central Valley Project in California was used. The bill would take some water from farmers to improve stream flows and save fishery resources, and would make it possible for some parched cities to buy water from the project.
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, insisted that many of Mr. Seymour's concerns had already been dealt with and said, "This was the best deal California farmers were ever likely to get.
Senator Bradley, who managed the bill, said, "This bill is about the American West and its most precious natural resource, water." He added, "The key to meeting the West's growing water needs is greater efficiency."
 
Grand Canyon vs. Electricity
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, hailed one provision he had fought for, a requirement that Federal authorities treat preservation of the Grand Canyon as more important than steady electric power-generation at Glen Canyon dam.
Complaining of erosion from sudden heavy discharges from the dam into the Rio Grande, he said, "Somewhere along the line, we forgot our obligation to the canyon and to the future generations for whom we hold it in trust."
Mr. Garn called today's action a fitting conclusion to his 18-year Senate career. Counting time in other offices before then, he said he had spent a quarter century "trying to do one thing for my state," trying to secure completion of the vast Central Utah Project. The $922 million undertaking, on which developers and environmentalists, municipalities and Indian tribes have all agreed, is the biggest single item in the bill.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 10, 1992, Saturday / October 12, 1992, Monday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about a flurry of legislative action as Congress approached the end of its session referred incorrectly to Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey in some editions. He is a Democrat.
An article on Friday about the close of the 102d Congress misstated the location of the Glen Canyon Dam. It is on the Colorado River, not the Rio Grande.

HEADLINE: Backed by Zell Investment, Carter Hawley Re-emerges

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., the department store chain, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings today with stronger financing and a leaner executive suite. But it still faces a deteriorating economy in its principal California market.
As part of the reorganization agreement, the Zell/Chilmark Fund infused an additional $50 million today into the reorganized retailer, which owns the Broadway, Weinstocks and Emporium chains in California and Broadway Southwest in Arizona. 
 The fund, headed by the Chicago investor Sam Zell, is now the company's largest creditor and shareholder. Zell/Chilmark bought 80 percent of Carter Hawley's $600 million in unsecured debt from junk-bond holders and suppliers for 47 cents on the dollar, which will trim the company's interest payments by $43 million a year. In exchange, the fund will control 75 percent of the company's common stock.
Employees and public shareholders will see their holdings diluted to 7 percent of outstanding shares, while unsecured creditors will control 18 percent of the company.
 
California Economy an Obstacle
 During the reorganization, Carter Hawley consolidated and centralized its division-level executive suite, a $25 million cost-saving measure. The company's two secured creditors, owed $500 million, also agreed to postpone payments for several years.
The question now is whether the reorganized retailer can achieve its aims of upgrading aging stores, broadening its customer base and stocking more fashionable goods in light of the worst economic downturn in California since the Great Depression.
The economic picture in California, where Carter Hawley has 73 of its 87 stores, is not expected to improve before 1994.
"There's no indication that job losses are stabilizing, especially in Southern California," said Brad Williams, an economic forecaster for the Commission on State Finance. "Retailers have had it tough," he said, "and with the current trends in unemployment, I don't see it getting much better soon."
In a report issued this week, the commission said 800,000 jobs had been lost in California since 1988, about 25 percent of them because of military spending cutbacks.
 
Further Changes Are Seen
 "It's a question of whether Zell will give them the time," Walter Loeb, an industry analyst, said of Carter Hawley. He predicted more changes, like consolidating the company's four chains into two, and possibly other Zell cash infusions to pay for store renovations.
Leonard Rabinowitz, chairman of a clothing maker, Carole Little, and a Broadway supplier, said Carter Hawley was bringing in a new team of apparel buyers to improve its goods.
Another change is the expected departure of Carter Hawley's chairman and chief executive, Philip Hawley, who is 67 years old.
"I would think it would be logical that he'd retire," said James B. Sleyden, a retailing professor at the University of Southern California. "His strength was total management, and they don't need that anymore."
A company spokesman declined to comment, and officials of Zell/Chilmark were said to be unavailable.

 International
Beijing is to lower barriers to American imports under an agreement in principle reached by the United States and China, ending a long-running dispute that threatened to erupt into a full-blown trade war. Trade experts said the accord would give American-made computers, chemicals and telecommunications equipment greater access to China's huge market. [Page 1.]
A new trade dispute erupted with Japan because a Japanese Government research institute, the National Institute for Fusion Sciences, decided to buy a supercomputer made by NEC of Japan instead of one made by Cray Research. The American company filed an unsuccessful complaint with a Japanese review board. [35.]
American and European trade negotiators are to meet in Brussels Sunday in yet another attempt to settle the longstanding disputes that have blocked progress in broader world trade talks. But officials on both sides seemed unprepared to compromise. [35.]
 
Markets
The Dow industrials fell to the lowest level of the year, 3,136.58, down 39.45 points, or 1.24 percent, as stock prices retreated broadly. Rising interest rates, Ford Motor's disclosure late Thursday that it expected a loss and uncertainties surrounding this weekend's Presidential debates led investors to issue sell orders. [35.]
Treasury bond prices fell sharply as prospects dimmed that interest rates would ease, sending the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond up 8 basis points to 7.52 percent. [38.]
The dollar gained against other currencies, giving it an impressive advance for the week. [44.]
Orange juice futures prices fell to a six-year low after the Government predicted the largest Florida harvest in 13 years. [44.]
 
The Economy
Federal Reserve officials saw few glimmers of hope for a pickup in the economy when they met Aug. 18. They were markedly more downbeat about the economy then than they are now, interviews, public statements and the minutes of the meeting by the Fed's main policy-making committee show. [35.]
Despite misgivings about fiscal stimulus for the economy -- given Washington's failure to check the growth of the budget deficit in the last decade, not to mention the reluctance of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton to focus on the issue -- the idea of Federal spending or a tax jolt is suddently back in fashion. [35.]
 
Companies
Ford's shares tumbled $2.75, to $34.875, after the auto maker surprised Wall Street with a $1 billion preferred stock offering and said it expected to report losses because of poor European sales. L. Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, will retire on Jan. 1 and be succeeded by Jacques Nasser. [36.]
Digital Equipment filled two key executive posts, naming William D. Strecker vice president of engineering and chief technology officer and Richard Poulsen president of the $7 billion European operation. [36.]
Philip M. Hawley announced his retirement as chairman and chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, a day after the company emerged from bankruptcy protection. The move clears the way for Sam Zell, the investor who bailed out the big retailer, to install his own top managers. [36.]
 
Today's Columns
For parents who want to transfer a home or business to adult children while minimizing tax consequences, today's combination of depressed real estate values and low interest rates offers an opportunity. Jan M. Rosen: Your Money. [37.]
A fluorescent light box to cheer people up when days become short and cold has been patented by two scientists hoping to profit by treating seasonal affective disorder, the clinical depression brought on by winter. Edmund L. Andrews: Patents. [37.]

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
The most important vote in the United States this November may not be for the President, and it may take place in only one of the 50 states. Of course, calling California only one of the 50 states is like calling Michael Jordan only one of the Chicago Bulls. If California were a separate nation, it would have the world's ninth largest economy.
So when Californians vote on whether to become the only place in the world where it is unequivocally legal for doctors to kill terminally ill patients who request to die, the event will be of national if not international importance. If Californians pass the initiative, Proposition 161 -- and right now the polls suggest that they will -- no state that is linked to California by a simple airplane flight, no family that has friends or relatives there, will escape the impact. 
 Indeed, it would be a strange United States that could condone licensed health care workers' giving legal injections to the terminally ill on one side of a state line but watch them be tried for murder for the same act a few miles away. So it is disconcerting, to say the least, that every twitch and tantrum in the Presidential campaign garners more attention than Proposition 161.
People on both sides of the issue speak of it in terms of an attempt to end Western civilization's ancient prohibition against killing the dying.
To its proponents, it is not a moment too soon to overturn that tradition. The tradition, they believe, was always wanting; more important it has now been radically disrupted by technology. Technology, especially medical technology, teaches people that they can exercise control over natural forces.
But medical technology then seems to betray that promise by snatching control away, keeping people alive beyond their desires, beyond their endurance or dignity, to the point that natural forces themselves appear to be a blessing rather than an adversary.
The California measure is more finely tuned than a similar proposition defeated in Washington State a year ago. Proposition 161 requires two witnesses to the signing of an advanced, revocable directive indicating that a person wanted to have life ended "with the aid of a physician in a painless, humane and dignified manner" if terminally ill and if immediate death is requested at least twice. (Obviously, terminally ill patients who are comatose could not request to have their lives ended.)
The proposition also specifies who the witnesses to a death directive can and cannot be (no relatives, heirs, creditors, employees of the physician or a health care center). It recognizes the coercive potential of nursing homes by requiring that the directive of a resident there must be witnessed by a state-appointed advocate or ombudsman.
The proposition provides for doctors to request psychiatric consultation for the patient before complying with a request to be killed.
It makes it a crime to pressure patients to seek death because they are "a financial, emotional or other burden." Anyone who "coerces, pressures or fraudulently induces another person" to request euthanasia can be prosecuted.
It requires hospitals and doctors to report how many patients' lives they end, the patients' ages, illnesses and the dates of death.
The opponents of Proposition 161 consider these safeguards illusory. They point out that all the provisions for disinterested witnesses, including the special ombudsman for patients under custodial care, pertain only to the written directive, which could be executed either decades or hours ahead of a specific request to be killed. The actual request can be oral; there need be no record or witnesses (other than the doctor) to the patient's psychological soundness, freedom from pressure or awareness of medical alternatives.
Proposition 161 requires that a patient's request for death be "enduring" but the term is only defined as a request "expressed on more than one occasion." Must the occasions by separated by minutes, hours, days, weeks?
Neither the psychological exam nor notification of family are obligatory, opponents say; there is no need to establish that the patient is in severe pain that cannot be alleviated effectively, and predictions of death in six months are notoriously unreliable.
Each side in California appears poised for a last-minute advertising blitz. Each side is focusing on whether the measure contains sufficient safeguards against abuses by unscrupulous caretakers.
The deeper questions are being ignored. Will this kind of euthanasia inexorably expand to take in new groups of dying or disabled? The Netherlands, where euthanasia has been given quasi-legal status, seems to be making the slippery slope a way of life, extending the practice gradually from those who consent to those who cannot. A Government-sponsored report there found that several hundred patients a year who were incapable of giving consent were having their lives taken.
Will those approaching death be liberated by measures like Proposition 161 from the fear of their final days or be imprisoned in new obligations to go gently into that sweet night? What changes for good or ill does a Proposition 161 portend in the very heart of our culture?
The questions are valid. The scandal is that they have not been explored widely, carefully, thoughtfully.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond Prices Drop Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell sharply yesterday as prospects dimmed that interest rates would ease.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 7/8 point, or about $8.75 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was 7.52 percent, up from 7.44 percent late Thursday. 
 Gary Schlossberg, vice president at the San Francisco office of the Wells Fargo Bank, said traders noticed a report in The Financial Times, the British financial daily, that quoted an unidentified Federal Reserve official as saying he did not expect an interest-rate cut in the United States before the Nov. 3 Presidential election.
 
Assumption by Market
 The Treasury bond market has assumed that an easing will occur because of recent disappointing economic reports.
"It looks as if the market was set up for an easing by the Fed" and there was an overreaction to the official's remark, Mr. Schlossberg said. Now it seems "the window is closing on easing right away."
A laundry list of bad economic indicators also helped sour the mood in the markets, he said.
"The body of evidence suggests the economy is still flat," he said. "The sum of these negatives just continue to weigh on the market."
With the long Columbus Day weekend upon them, traders apparently dropped substantial portions of their bond portfolios before they became excess baggage, Mr. Schlossberg said.
Ray Dalio, president of Bridgewater Associates Inc. in Wilton, Conn., agreed that money had been moving out of the bond market -- but he did not accept the standard reasons.
"They could be reacting to some better opportunities they like someplace else," Mr. Dalio said. But, he added, "I haven't a clue" where the money is going.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term maturities fell 5/16 point to 1/2 point, and intermediate maturities fell 23/32 point to 3/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service said.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 7.73 points, to 1,267.03.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 2.87 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points, to 2.82 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Other Bill Yields Rise
 Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.04 percent, as the discount rose 8 basis points, to 2.96 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.15 percent, as the discount rose 11 basis points, to 3.05 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell to 215/16 percent, from 3 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9622/32 , down 10/32 point. The average yield to maturity was 6.42 percent, up from 6.40 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls To a Low For Year

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Stock prices retreated broadly yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling to its lowest level of the year. Rising interest rates, the disclosure by the Ford Motor Company late Thursday that it expected a loss, and uncertainties surrounding this weekend's Presidential debates led investors to issue sell orders.
By the closing bell, the Dow was down 39.45 points, or 1.24 percent, to 3,136.58, putting the widely watched market barometer at its year's low. Volume of 178.9 million shares was relatively light. For the week, the Dow lost 64.03 points. 
 The selloff in stocks followed the lead of the bond market, which seemed to abandon hope that the Federal Reserve Board would ease short-term interest rates soon. That sent the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond up to 7.52 percent, from 7.44 percent Thursday. [Page 38.]
Ford's announcement that it expected to lose money in the current quarter and might post a loss in the fourth surprised analysts. Most had been expecting a fourth-quarter profit.
 
Poor Market Conditions
 Ford made the announcement at the end of a news release announcing plans to sell $1 billion of preferred stock. It citing weakness in its European operations and poor market conditions in the United States.
Reacting to the news yesterday, investors pushed Ford shares down by 2 3/4, to 34 7/8. The stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange and led to drops in General Motors, down 7/8, to 29 1/4, on heavy volume, and Chrysler, off 3/8, to 22 1/8, and then to broader declines.
With losing issues outnumbering gaining issues by more than 2 to 1, broader New York Stock Exchange averages also tumbled. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 5.09, to 402.66. And the Russell 2000 dropped by 1.04, to 188.21. Over-the-counter stocks of smaller companies also suffered. The Nasdaq's composite index fell by 3.36, to 570.52.
Wendy Needham, an automotive analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said, "Ford is finally coming to grips with the fact that they have a mess in Europe."
And traders were quick to look beyond Ford. Michael Ward, an auto analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said, "G.M. has a lot of European operations, and if Ford is weak there, the thinking is that they will probably be subject to the same type of negative trends." Chrysler has very modest production operations in Europe.
Already faced with weak demand in the United States and mounting labor problems, General Motors can ill afford a slump in Europe, which has generated impressive revenue and earnings for years.
 
Loss More Likely
 Analysts said the possibility that G.M.'s European operations might be less profitable this year only increased the likelihood that the nation's largest automobile company would lose money for the third straight year.
The news from Detroit "is another sign the economy is crumbling," said Robert Walberg, senior equity analyst at MMS International. "The market sees that the economic data are weak, but that the Fed is looking beyond those numbers to the election and the possibility that a Clinton victory would lead to fiscal stimulus."
Arguably, more fiscal stimulus might help the economy, but bond traders fear such measures will also expand the deficit and ignite inflationary pressures.
 
No Need for Heroics
 With those fears, plus the coming debates and uncertainties about third-quarter earnings, "there is no reason to be a hero" and buy stocks, Mr. Walberg added.
But one auto company, Brilliance China, fared better yesterday. The Hong Kong-based company, which manufactures mini-vans in China, closed at 20 1/8, unchanged on the day but up from its recent initial offering price of $16 a share.
Oil stocks declined. Texaco dropped 2 1/8, to 60 1/4, after reports it was shutting a Southern California refinery a day after an oil explosion and fire. And word that the Iraqi national guard had seized an American worker near the Kuwait border pushed down international oil companies like Exxon, which fell 1 1/4, to 61 5/8, and Mobil, which lost 1 3/8, to 61 5/8.

HEADLINE: Taste for Fiscal Stimulus Returns

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
President John F. Kennedy's tax cut of 1962 was widely celebrated as the dawn of the millennium of can-do economics. But by the early 1980's, the use of fiscal stimulus to revive a flagging economy was seen as an act of hubris, a temptation to the slumbering gods of inflation. And by 1990, the notion of adding to the budget deficit for any reason seemed folly.
Now the pendulum is swinging back. How could anyone believe that policies so long discredited would do more good than harm? 
 The answer offered cautiously -- very cautiously -- by economists is that much has been learned in the last few decades. And in any case, they argue, the brief against an active fiscal policy has never been as clear-cut as it appeared.
 
Testing a Theory
 Today it seems almost self-evident that tax cuts and government spending can influence output and jobs by putting more money in people's pockets. But contrary to myth, the ideas of John Maynard Keynes, the great British theorist who changed the face of economics in the 1930's, were not explicitly tested in the United States until the 1960's.
Walter Heller of the University of Minnesota and James Tobin of Yale, then members of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, persuaded a reluctant President Kennedy to support tax cuts for business, even at the risk of increasing the budget deficit. The apparent success of the Kennedy initiative in setting off a vigorous expansion, which did not end until 1970, ushered in a golden era of interventionist economics. In fact, it was widely assumed that economics would soon tame natural swings in employment and output, much the way medical science was taming bacterial diseases.
But something -- well, lots of things -- happened to shatter confidence in the "science" of fine-tuning. Sharp increases in the price of imported oil in 1974 and again in 1979 worked like tax increases, depressing demand for goods and services made in America. At the same time, the higher energy prices raised the cost of producing virtually everything, leaving the economy reeling from inflation in the midst of a recession. And while economists were eventually able to make some sense of what had happened within the Keynesian framework, their inability to cope with stagflation in the 1970's opened the door to revisionism.
Indeed, research in the 1970's and 1980's had the effect of breaking the faith in fine-tuning and redirecting economists' efforts toward the more modest goal of smoothing the path toward long-term economic growth. One reason for the new skepticism was the problem of lags -- the time it took to translate the need for stimulus into more concrete poured and more autos sold.
Government spending is particularly problematic because it takes months to plan new public works on top of the months it takes to pass the enabling legislation. "We have a history of adopting fiscal stimulus when it is no longer needed," concluded Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Tax cuts, especially across-the-board cuts that show up in reduced withholding from paychecks, work faster. But there is evidence that people are reluctant to spend increases in income that they do not expect to be permanent. Thus, additions to the deficit in the form of temporary tax cuts do not seem to add much to demand.
This frustrating complication in manipulating private spending became part of a much broader critique of activist economic policy. Once people and corporations get wind of what the Government is trying to do, the argument goes, they will change behavior in ways that offset the impact in unpredictable fashion or even cancel it entirely.
In the purist's scenario, offered by Robert Barro of Harvard, adding an extra dollar to the deficit would add nothing to overall demand because people would prudently set aside a dollar to cover the expected increase in their future taxes.
You do not, however, need to buy the whole cloth to see some merit in the fabric. As recently as a few months ago, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was counseling caution on tax cuts because they would create fears of more inflation down the road. And that expectation would lead lenders to demand higher interest rates on long-term commitments, discouraging investment by businesses and home buyers.
A distinct but related drawback to deficit-financed stimulus is the difficulty of changing course when the oomph is no longer needed. Of course, the "expansionary bias" of government that asks not what you can do for your country has always been a worry. But in light of Washington's failure to check the growth of the budget deficit in the last decade, not to mention the reluctance of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton to focus on the issue, the worry looms ever larger.
"Temporary fiscal stimulus has all the credibility of the tooth fairy," opines Benjamin Friedman of Harvard.
Why, then, is the idea of a spending or tax jolt suddenly back in fashion? One reason is political necessity: a recession that threatens to break the Republican lock on the White House, and then doom Bill Clinton to a single term, is a recession that will not be ignored much longer. "You've got to do something when conditions are unacceptable," Mr. Reischauer suggests.
There are also some economic reasons. The only alternative to fiscal stimulus is monetary stimulus: lower interest rates that encourage consumers and businesses to borrow in order to buy. But the Federal Reserve has already walked a long way down that road -- interest rates are half what they were before the recession. And the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, reportedly fears that still lower rates would lead to further chaos in world currency markets as investors scrambled for the higher interest rates available on European bank deposits.
 
Some See Quick Results
 Moreover, supporters of a temporary fiscal push, many of whom are unrepentant Keynesians, believe that the pitfalls have been exaggerated. They concede there would be some lag between concept and execution. But they argue that a carefully designed package of tax incentives and spending increases could make a difference within a few months.
And while they acknowledge that fears of inflation might take the edge off the impact by raising borrowing costs, they are exasperated by the invocation of these "expectations effects" as a justification for doing nothing. "Whenever I hear the word 'expectations' I reach for my gun," said Robert Solow, the Nobel Prize-winning economist from M.I.T.
The most troubling worry for many is the deficit. But here, too, necessity may prove the mother of optimism. The stimulus package should be temporary, supporters say, with taxes and spending automatically reverting to tamer levels at a preset date -- or, better yet, when unemployment falls to a more acceptable level.

HEADLINE: Amsterdam Journal;
Plane Crash Exposes a Dutch Ghetto

BYLINE: By PAUL L. MONTGOMERY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, Oct. 8

 BODY:
All day, the curious make the 20-minute metro ride from the center of the city to the apartment building where an El Al cargo jet crashed on Sunday evening.
Many stand and watch as cranes continue to lower lines into the scorched gap the plane tore in the building, searching for bodies among the rubble. 
 The crash, which Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers called the worst disaster in the Netherlands since World War II, has focused attention on the daily tragedies in the lives of the residents of Bijlmermeer, the poorest quarter of the city. And the visitors making the trip to the crash site are discovering a part of the city some never knew existed.
 
Center for Immigrants
 Bijlmermeer is teeming with immigrants from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Some immigrants come to take advantage of one of the most generous welfare states in the world. Some of the new arrivals enter the country by legal means while others slip through the cracks illegally.
A retired Dutch woman who lives alone in Bijlmermeer was watching the passing throng at a shopping arcade the other day, surrounded by stores selling saris and tropical vegetables and other foreign goods.
"I like the color and variety of this place very much," she said in precise English. "I think you will find that the Dutch are a tolerant people, and certainly the last war taught us to hate racism. But then you see the junkies and the people who don't work and you wonder. This is my country and I am not afraid, but it cannot go on forever like this."
 
Lab at Airport
 The city authorities have tried to reassure the illegals who might have friends or family in the wreckage to come forward with reports of the missing.
"I promise you that you will not get into difficulties," said Ed van Thijn, Amsterdam's Mayor.
The city has set up a laboratory at Schiphol airport, 10 miles from Bijlmermeer, to identify the bodies and coordinate the reports of the missing.
[So far, 51 bodies have been found, and some Dutch officials are now projecting a death toll of around 120 people instead of the 250 estimated to have died shortly after the crash, Reuters reported. The authorities say that some victims may have been incinerated completely in the fire.]
There is none of the open hostility to immigrants that has made headlines in Germany, but some Dutch are puzzled about the situation.
Bijlmermeer, for example, is notorious for drugs. Young men in American athletic gear stand ready to deal in parking lots and shopping arcades, scanning the streets for the police. A municipal report two years ago estimated there were 1,500 addicts among Bijlmermeer's 75,000 people.
In March the police raided the area and arrested nearly 50 people, almost all from Ghana. At the time, the police said those arrested were dealers and couriers in a Europe-wide cocaine and heroin network.
 
Majority From Dutch Colonies
 Most of the immigrants in the area come from former Dutch colonies like Suriname and Indonesia, and are admitted to reunite families.
The 187,000 people of the overseas territories of Aruba and the Dutch Antilles (Curacao, Bonaire and St. Maarten) have residence rights and also make up a part of Bijlmermeer's population. Others, apparently the majority, get visas to come and work in largely menial jobs.
In 1990, when 82,000 non-Dutch immigrants to the Netherlands were approved, the Dutch spent 30 percent of their gross domestic product on social welfare, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This compared with an average of 20 percent in the other industrial countries.
Imram Mujoorie, from Pakistan, said he found that a shrinking economy and recent restrictions on welfare payments had reduced the desirability of the Netherlands for some would-be immigrants.
"Some of my friends are going back," he said. "There is very little work now."
 
Work Force on Disability
 He has a residence permit that allows him to work, he gets a rent subsidy from the city and spends most of his time tending the counter at a sex store in the red-light district.
The country is unique in having 14 percent of its work force receiving payments for physical or psychological disabilities. Payments can amount to 70 percent of a worker's last salary. Many of the recipients who are younger than 40 complain of bad backs or psychological problems.
But the crash has made many immigrants question life in Bijlmermeer. At the local sports center, which serves as a shelter for those left homeless by the crash, a weary-looking man stood in a corridor resting his forehead on the concrete wall.
"I don't know, I don't know," he said, over and over.
Evert H. Verdies, who came here from Suriname, wants to put distance between his family and the crash, which occurred about 200 feet from his apartment.
"I can't forget it, and my children can't either," said the 39-year-old construction worker. "It's better to go away."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: ISSUES -- Economic Philosophy;
Candidates Sharply Divided On Prescription for Economy

SERIES: Issues: Economic Philosophy -- Second article of a series

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
President Bush believes that the American economy is fundamentally sound and that the Government generally should keep its hands off and let the free market thrive.
Gov. Bill Clinton, by contrast, holds that the economy has run aground and that the Government should step in, get it sailing again and plot its course in detail. 
 Those contrasting views on the state of the economy and on what needs to be done about it in the next four years are at the heart of this year's election campaign.
 
Split From Parties
 Both men are outflanked within their parties. Mr. Bush does not go along with the Republican supply-siders like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp who favor tax cuts at any cost. And Mr. Clinton has taken pains to distinguish himself from Democrats who support huge new Government programs financed by much higher taxes.
But no one -- not even Ross Perot, who has his own distinct economic principles -- can fairly accuse the two main Presidential candidates in 1992 of being tweedledum and tweedledee on economic philosophy.
Mr. Bush maintains that wealthy Americans are taxed too much. Mr. Clinton would raise their taxes.
Mr. Bush says he would cut Government programs across the board. Apart from cutting the military budget, Mr. Clinton stresses additional Government spending.
Mr. Bush wants to loosen Government restrictions so businesses can become more prosperous. Mr. Clinton wants new regulations on business to force energy conservation and protect the environment.
Mr. Bush favors free trade almost without exception. Mr. Clinton places more emphasis on making sure America's trading partners play fairly.
Mr. Bush's proposals on medical care and job training are based on tax incentives. Mr. Clinton would require employers to provide medical insurance and job training for their workers or pay extra taxes to the Government to do it for them.
Neither man treats the Federal budget deficit as a primary problem. Despite the tax increase he agreed to as part of the 1990 budget deal, Mr. Bush has generally taken the position that keeping taxes low is more important to him than trimming the deficit. Mr. Clinton says the deficit must take a back seat to what he calls investment, a euphemism for spending Government money on education, training and public works projects that he says would pay off in the long run.
This is in contrast to Mr. Perot, who has made lowering the deficit the cornerstone of his political campaign. "Unless we take action now, our nation may confront a situation similar to the Great Depression -- and maybe even worse," Mr. Perot asserts in the opening sentence of the book he put out last summer, "United We Stand: How We Can Take Back Our Country"
But as much as he emphasizes the problem, Mr. Perot tends not to broadcast the painful solutions he promotes in the book to eliminate the deficit over the next five years: higher taxes on most Americans and sharp cuts in popular programs.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush accuses Mr. Clinton of favoring European-style "social engineering" in which the Government would replace the marketplace as the driving force in the economy. Mr. Clinton says Mr. Bush would demolish programs like Social Security and Medicare that long ago took root in American society.
Those assertions are nonsense. Mr. Bush would not abolish the welfare state, and Mr. Clinton would not impose a socialist economy. As different as their views are from one another's, neither takes such extreme positions.
 
Candidates' Core Views
 Separating the candidates' campaign oratory from their core beliefs can be difficult, but looking at their records over the years, a fundamental distinction seems evident.
Mr. Bush's basic tenet reflects the Wall Street-Greenwich-Andover-Yale milieu of his youth and the philosophy of the Texas oil country where he first went into business. It is that people with capital should be free to develop it with only a minimum of interference from the Government in the way of taxes and regulations.
Mr. Clinton's core view, perhaps a consequence of his having become Governor of a poor state at the unusually young age of 32, is that Government programs, intelligently designed and properly executed, can make the country more prosperous and people's lives better.
The two candidates offered the most thorough expositions of these philosophies in speeches to the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Bush last month and Mr. Clinton in August.
The President said it was his position that the main function of Government was "to keep tax rates low and make them even lower, to keep money sound, to limit Government spending and regulations and to open the way for greater competition."
Mr. Clinton advocated a middle course between the Republican principle of reliance on private enterprise and the Democratic orthodoxy that a Government program should exist to solve nearly every problem. "I don't believe in big Government," he said, "but I do believe in an effective Government that promotes jobs and growth and gives people more choice and better services and inspires more personal responsibility."
 
Addressing the Topics
 The implications of their overall philosophies can be seen in the way Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton address these specific economic topics and social policies with economic implications:
TAXES -- Mr. Clinton says tax policy should be used to redistribute wealth. Mr. Bush does not.
Thus, Mr. Clinton proposes raising the top tax rate on family incomes above about $200,000, imposing a surtax on incomes above $1 million and increasing the minimum tax on wealthy taxpayers who have big deductions. He would use the revenue to finance a tax cut of a few hundred dollars a year to families with incomes below about $90,000.
By contrast, Mr. Bush vetoed legislation this year that included many of his pet tax cuts for business because the measure included a modest tax increase on the wealthy.
On capital gains taxes, the domestic issue on which he has seemed most exercised, Mr. Bush would reduce the rate on all investments. Economists disagree on the merits of such a proposal, but few doubt that the main direct beneficiaries would be the wealthiest taxpayers. Mr. Clinton would reduce the capital gains tax rate only for investors who start new businesses and hold them for at least five years.
Mr. Perot would raise the top tax rate to 33 percent from 31 percent on couples making more than about $90,000 and would lift the rate even higher, he says, if more money were needed to balance the budget. He also favors raising the gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon each year for five years, increasing the taxes on Social Security payments received by beneficiaries with more than a modest income and allowing tax deductions for mortgage interest payments only on mortgage amounts below $250,000.
TRADE -- Both main candidates favor expanding international trade. Mr. Bush believes so strongly that open markets lead to economic growth that he favors relaxing American trade barriers almost without exception. Mr. Clinton focuses more on retraining American workers who lose jobs because of free trade and to retaliating against countries that maintain trade restrictions against American products.
ENERGY -- Mr. Bush worries aloud about increased use of imported oil, but he would rely on the markets to force change. He would open more areas to oil drilling, encourage greater use of nuclear power and give tax breaks to domestic producers.
Mr. Clinton favors increased Government intervention in the energy markets, including stricter automobile mileage standards, new restrictions on oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Government rules requiring a reduction in the emission of gases that could cause global warming and less reliance on nuclear power.
HEALTH CARE -- Relying on private markets, Mr. Bush would offer tax credits to poor people to help them buy basic medical insurance. He would try to generate competition between insurance companies, would limit damages in malpractice suits and would encourage arrangements like health maintenance organizations to keep costs down.
Mr. Clinton would have the Government impose an overall limit on national health spending, public and private, and would make the states set price restrictions on doctors and hospitals, if spending threatened to exceed the limit. He would require employers to provide medical insurance for their workers or pay a special tax to the Government to finance a public insurance program.
JOB TRAINING -- Mr. Bush would give people losing their jobs vouchers of up to $3,000 to help them pay for training. Under Mr. Clinton, companies would have to spend 1.5 percent of their payroll on job training or pay the Government an equivalent amount to finance a public training program. Mr. Clinton would require large Government contractors to have special training programs as well.
A basic rule of economics is that production and economic growth require three elements: physical capital like plants, machinery, equipment and buildings; human capital, which is the textbook term for workers, and technological change, which means product improvements, the introduction of new products and cost saving.
Beyond the fundamental disagreement between Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton on the role the Government should play in the economy and the society, some economists have spotted another philosophical difference in the relative emphasis they place on these elements.
Mr. Bush stresses the importance of physical capital. He is vigilant in fighting inflation, one of the main deterrents to capital investment. And he argues that the cost of investment in plants, machinery and the like is too high, much higher than in Japan and Germany. That is why Mr. Bush pays so much attention to interest rates and to the costs the Government places on businesses through taxes and regulations.
Mr. Clinton's innovative proposals are on the human side. Not only would he require businesses to pay for the training of rank-and-file workers, but he would have a national apprenticeship system to help students not bound for college obtain job skills. And he would replace the existing student loan program with a system in which college students could pay off their loans by paying a small portion of their incomes over time or by devoting two years to public service work -- as a school teacher in a poor neighborhood, say, or a police officer.
 
 
 
HOW THE CANDIDATES DIFFER
 The specific policies Presidential candidates advocate in their campaigns often fall by the wayside, but the overall philosophies they espouse offer important insights into what kind of Presidents they would be. The economic philosphies of President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton are especially important, since both men have promised major steps to turn the economy around in the years ahead. Both men's tenets are closer to the center of the political spectrum than they are to the far right or the far left. But there are significant differences in what they stand for.
 
THEMES
Mr. Bush holds that the American economy is basically healthy and that in most circumstances the Government should not interfere in the marketplace. He emphasizes the importance of tax breaks to generate investment in plants, machinery and equipment.
Mr. Clinton believes that the economy is seriously off track and that the Government should play an active role in reversing the course. He stresses new Government spending for public works projects, education and job training.
 
SCORECARD
Mr. Bush's biggest problem in the election campaign is explaining why he stood by so passively in the face of the sour economy. Public opinion polls show that most people are prepared for more Government intervention in economic affairs.
Mr. Clinton has not made clear how he would be able to pay for all the Government programs he wants without a substantial tax increase. In the past, public works projects have often been pork barrel. Government job-training programs have rarely been successful.

HEADLINE: Candidates Seek Right Strategy in a New District

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Oct. 9

 BODY:
This is the way it went on the campaign trail in the Sixth Congressional District this week: State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos, a Republican, explained his positions on the issues to 15 listeners at a luncheon of the Belmar Kiwanis Club while Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, stood on the banks of the Raritan River to receive the endorsement of environmentalists before an audience of eight reporters and photographers.
The crowds are not always that small, of course, and the pace of the campaign is expected to pick up in the three weeks before Election Day, but both camps are keenly aware of running in the shadow of the proverbial 800-pound gorilla that is the 1992 Presidential race. 
 "This is an unusual year, even for a Presidential election, because there is so much interest being generated by the frustration over the economy and Ross Perot's presence in the race," said Mr. Kyrillos, who supports President Bush but recognizes that much of the sentiment for change generated by voter frustration is aimed at the President.
His strategy is to try to focus some of that frustration on what he calls an "arrogant" Democratic Congress and on Mr. Pallone.
 
An Incumbent 'Maverick'
 For his part, Mr. Pallone, who is running in a new district where 58 percent of the voters have never seen his name on a ballot, is trying to distance himself from any anti-incumbent sentiment by calling himself a "maverick." Far from denying his unpopularity among members of both parties in Congress, he points to it as affirmation of his independence.
The bipartisan commission that drew new Congressional district lines this year quickly picked Mr. Pallone's Third District for elimination when the state was told it would lose one of its 14 seats after the 1990 census. The Third was divided between the Fourth and Sixth Districts, forcing the 40-year-old Congressman to consider running against another incumbent. That problem disappeared when Bernard J. Dwyer, the Democrat representing the old Sixth District, retired after 12 years in Washington.
The new Sixth District, predominantly blue-collar and Democratic, extends from Sea Girt, an affluent beachfront town in Monmouth County, north along the coast and west along Raritan Bay into Middlesex County, where it includes 13 towns.
Trying to turn to advantage his image as a poor team player, Mr. Pallone usually begins his speeches by pointing out that he was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote against the $40,000 pay raise Congress awarded itself in 1989.
Mr. Kyrillos responds that while Mr. Pallone voted "no," he nevertheless accepted the raise. The Republican says that if he is elected and another pay raise comes up, he will vote against it and return any raise to the Treasury.
Mr. Pallone said he gives $10,000 -- the net raise after taxes -- to Monmouth, Middlesex and Ocean County charities each year. He said he keeps only his pre-raise salary and cost-of-living adjustments.
Mr. Kyrillos and Mr. Pallone are among the Jersey Shore's most successful vote-getters; neither has ever lost an election. Mr. Pallone, a lawyer, was a Long Branch Councilman when he won a seat in the New Jersey Senate in 1983 and again in 1987. The following year he won a special election to succeed the late Congressman James J. Howard in the old Third District.
Mr. Kyrillos was 27 when he was elected to the Assembly in 1987. He was re-elected two years later despite Gov. Jim Florio's landslide victory, which pulled Democrats into office elsewhere in the state. Mr. Kyrillos, who is director of business and ethics for the Mid-Atlantic Health Group, a hospital service organization, in Rumson, was elected to the State Senate in 1991.
In the June primaries, both Mr. Pallone and Mr. Kyrillos overcame strong opposition from candidates based in Middlesex County, which dominates the Sixth District and includes its largest city, New Brunswick.
The primaries depleted both candidates' campaign chests. Mr. Pallone amassed more than $500,000, about 60 percent of it from political action committees, during 1991 and early 1992, earning him the 21st spot among members of the House of Representatives in the amount of PAC money received between Jan. 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Kyrillos had raised $108,000 through June, with $23,650 coming from PACs, including $9,900 from the National Rifle Association.
"The problem is not with accepting PAC money, but where it comes from," Mr. Pallone said. "Most of mine comes from labor unions, environmental groups and senior citizens, groups who support what I have been doing and who do not try to tell me how to vote."
Mr. Kyrillos said he is not against accepting PAC money, but he said it should not become a candidate's chief source of campaign funds.
 
Agreement on Abortion Rights
 Both candidates support a woman's right to choose an abortion, though Mr. Pallone was once strongly opposed to it. He has since changed his position and voted consistently in support of abortion rights. "I didn't believe it was right for me to impose my personal religious beliefs on others," he said.
Both men support reduced military spending to make more money available for public works, and both say they back tax credits for business creation and expansion.
Mr. Kyrillos supports President Bush's proposal to allow tax credits to enable people to buy their own health insurance. Mr. Pallone supports a bill that would establish a national health-care system that he said could be financed by the elimination of administrative costs in the present system. Mr. Kyrillos said an analysis of the bill by the House Ways and Means Committee concluded that it would raises taxes on individuals, corporations and those receiving Social Security.
Mr. Pallone said that recent polls showing Democrats leading Republicans in New Jersey Congressional contests would not affect his campaign strategy. "There's a long way to go," he said, "and voters are very sophisticated. We have to work very hard."
To win, Mr. Kyrillos conceded, "I have to get most of the Bush voters, Perot supporters and the non-traditional Democrats who backed Ronald Reagan and Bush for the last 12 years."

HEADLINE: China Will Lower Barriers to Trade In Accord With U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Ending a long-running dispute that threatened to erupt into a full-blown trade war, the United States and China reached an agreement in principle today under which Beijing would bring down barriers to American imports, Administration officials said.
Trade experts said the accord, among other things, gave American-made computers, chemicals and telecommunications equipment greater access to China's huge market. 
 The agreement is part of the Bush Administration's efforts to increase trade with the fast-growing markets of Asia, an effort that seeks to insure that Japan does not achieve commercial domination of the continent.
 
Vindication of Policy?
 China experts also said the Administration would point to the accord as evidence that Washington's decision to maintain relations with China, notwithstanding the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square, was benefiting the United States -- this time, in the form of a market-opening accord.
American trade officials said they hoped the Chinese Government would give its final approval to the agreement in time to allow a signing ceremony in Washington on Saturday.
American officials have long asserted that China used an extensive web of restrictions to keep American exports out, including quotas, secret regulations and technical standards that discriminate against foreign goods. Aides to Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, refused to disclose details of the accord today.
 
Threats by Both Sides
 In August, the United States threatened to impose punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent on $3.9 billion worth of Chinese goods if no agreement on removing Chinese trade restrictions was reached by Oct. 10. Such tariffs would have effectively doubled the price of many Chinese goods in American markets.
In response, Beijing threatened to retaliate by placing steep duties on some $3.9 billion worth of American exports, including grain, aircraft, fertilizer and autos
If there had been no agreement and both sides imposed duties, President Bush could have been hurt in important constituencies just weeks before Election Day.
The Administration certainly did not want to face retaliation against American farm goods. Indeed, in a bid for farm state votes, President Bush last month expanded subsidies for American wheat exports to China, which is a highly profitable market for grain exporters.
The new accord also goes a few steps toward alleviating a fast-growing trade deficit problem for the United States. America's trade deficit with China has skyrocketed in the last six years as China has increasingly become a low-wage rival to other Asian nations.
American's deficit with China soared to $12.69 billion last year from $10.43 billion in 1990. That compares with a $6 million deficit in 1985. America's trade deficit with China, which is expected to exceed $15 billion this year, is now second only to the country's deficit with Japan.
 
Bush Vetoed Bill
 Today's agreement comes 11 days after President Bush vetoed a bill passed by Congress that would have restricted China's trade with the United States unless Beijing improved its record on human rights, free trade and arms control.
The Senate upheld that veto a week ago, as it did last March. The White House has relied on farm state lawmakers in its recurring battle with Congress over most-favored-nation trade status for China
As it faces repeated criticisms during the Presidential election campaign for being cozy with China, the White House is expected to point to the market-access agreement as showing that it knows how to get tough with Beijing.
"The agreement will probably strengthen Bush's claims that his engagement policy is serious and effective," said Richard A. Brecher, director of business advisory services at the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies with investments there. "He will argue that he is following through on his promises to address the many legitimate concerns that we have with the Chinese."
The Administration is also expected to point to the agreement as one that will help create jobs in the United States. Throughout his re-election campaign, President Bush has emphasized the importance of trade accords to economic growth.
The 44-page list of Chinese goods against which Mrs. Hills threatened retaliation was the biggest target list that the United States had ever published, American officials said. That list included shoes, beer, ginger, silk shirts and even hog guts, which are used as sausage casings.
 
Pointed to Consumers
 Chinese officials asserted that American consumers would be the victims of the dispute because China supplies the United States with some 45 percent of its shoe imports, 31 percent of its toy imports, and 26 percent of its textile and apparel imports.
The United States published another list of potential punitive tariffs last year when it was pressing the Chinese Government to adopt and enforce new law against violations of American copyrights, patents and trademarks. Last January, just hours before the tariffs were scheduled to be imposed, China agreed to Washington's demands.
American officials have long complained of China's quotas against numerous American products, including computers, automobiles and chemicals.
One of Washington's demands has been for Beijing to publish its secret restrictions that often trip up unsuspecting American executives.
Representatives of American industry often cite China's Document 56, an internal document, in which Chinese officials say they will buy telephone-switching equipment from only three foreign manufacturers, none of them American.
According to one industry official, several local Chinese governments selected the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to sell them equipment, only to have those agreements blocked by the Government in Beijing.
China's Ambassador to the United States, Zhu Qizhen, said at a news conference this summer that China's modest level of American imports was caused by a slowdown in China's economy and not by discrimination against American goods.

Good Time for Parents to Give Assets to Children

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
For some parents who want to transfer a home or business to adult children, the present combination of depressed real estate values and low interest rates brings opportunity.
The goals of such transfers are to keep property in the family while giving the younger generation immediate use of it, to provide parents with steady incomes, and to avoid what would probably be an onerous estate tax if property were simply left in a will to children. 
 Those aims can be achieved through what is called a private annuity, which pays regular annual payments that children pledge to make. It is not related to the annuities sold by mutual funds and insurance companies.
David S. Rhine, a tax partner at BDO Seidman in New York, called private annuities "a very interesting vehicle that can solve a number of problems." He said he had used them for quite a few clients recently. "It's gotten up a little head of steam in the last six months," he said, cautioning, however, that there are financial risks because property is transferred without a lien, so the technique is not for every family.
Mr. Rhine cited two examples of using private annuities:
Parents in their 60's want to retire and move south. Their 30-year-old daughter has always loved the family home. She has a good job and can make monthly payments, but she does not have the savings needed for a down payment to buy the home with a bank mortgage. So the parents transfer the house to her, and she pledges an annuity in return.
"There's a psychological benefit here as well," Mr. Rhine said. If the parents had sold the house, which they bought in the 1960's, they would have a capital gain under the tax laws because the sale would have produced much more than the original cost of the house, but not as much as it would have five years ago.
"People always feel they have a loss when the value has gone down," Mr. Rhine said, "but if the house stays in the family, it softens that blow."
In the second example, parents transferred the family business, a hardware store, to their son. After graduation, he went to work for a large company, but after a few years he joined his father in the store and is now ready to take it over.
The first step, Mr. Rhine explained, is to have the store appraised. Say the fair market value is $500,000 and the parents' cost basis is $200,000, meaning they have an imputed capital gain of $300,000. Based on their life expectancy and a 7 percent interest rate, the son would make annual payments of $44,927, presumably from the cash flow of the business.
For the parents, $7,042 of that payment over 28 years represents the recovery of the original cost of the business and would not be taxable, $10,563 would be capital gain and $27,321 would be ordinary income. If the parents died in a few years, the son's obligation would end and the business would not be included in their estate. Conversely, a cap can be put on the duration of the annuity so that the son's obligation ends after a set number of years, changing the amount of the payments depending on the number of years.
The son could take out a life insurance policy in favor of his parents to protect them in case he should die. But suppose he cannot make the annuity payments because the business fails or for other reasons?
There is no protection against such risks, Mr. Rhine said. "And for that reason, I would not do it if the business was the family's only asset," he said. Such transactions work best if a family has several assets, faith in their children and a strong desire to keep property in the family, he added.
"I have several clients who do not need the annuity payment themselves," he said, "and are recycling it, giving it to grandchildren" to build a nest egg for their college education.
Some clients are combining a gift to their children with a transfer and annuity, he said. Say a business has a $2 million value, much of it in commercial real estate. Under the tax law, each person can give or bequeath up to $600,000 free of gift or estate taxes. This means that a husband and wife can give their children $1.2 million tax-free, and after their deaths the first dollar of their estates will be taxable.
The parents can thus transfer the $2 million business to their children who are active in it, giving them $1.2 million of it tax-free and accepting an annuity for the remaining $800,000. What this does is to establish a price for the business based on today's depressed market value and enable the younger generation to keep running it.
If the parents retained title to the business and left it to their children in their wills, the future value could be much higher, and anything above $1.2 million would be subject to estate taxes of up to 55 percent. In such situations, businesses are often sold in whole or in part to pay taxes.

HEADLINE: Fed Has Brightened Its View Since August

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials were markedly more downbeat about the economy in August than they are now, interviews, public statements and the minutes of the August meeting of the Fed's main policy-making committee show.
The officials saw some glimmers of hope for a pickup in the economy at the Aug. 18 meeting, but dwelled at length on several stubborn factors that were impeding a strong recovery, according to the report of the meeting released today. The officials seemed particularly worried about the debt burdens weighing on consumers and businesses, the lack of consumer confidence and the sluggish growth in the money supply. 
 Two weeks after that meeting, the Fed moved to lower interest rates.
 
Some Glimmers of Optimism

 
 On the positive side, however, the officials at the August meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making committee, said that low interest rates and the weak dollar should encourage business activity and that banks were in a stronger condition and were pursuing lending more aggressively.
"The members recognized that the outlook for the economy was subject to major uncertainties," said the official summary of the meeting. "A number commented that they could not identify any sector of the economy that seemed primed to provide the impetus needed for a vigorous expansion."
The committee met again on Tuesday, and in interviews just before then Federal Reserve governors expressed more optimism about the state of the economy. But they still sounded dissatisfied with the protracted nature of the nation's slump.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, said "the potential is there for a very nice combination of solid economic growth with very low inflation." He added, "I would think there's a lot of potential in 1993."
 
Hope for Housing
 In the interview, Mr. Lindsey said that housing was the most affordable it has been in 20 years thanks to lower interest rates and that there was pent-up demand for homes. He also said that the debt-service burden of consumers was declining, which should lead to a pickup in spending, and that business's increased profits and productivity also pointed to increased investment.
David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, also saw growth ahead, saying in an interview that he expected growth of "a little over 2 percent" in the next few quarters.
Mr. Mullins said that thanks to rate cuts in July and September, there was additional stimulus in the system that should help push the economy along.
In recent days, many investors have interpreted remarks by Fed officials showing some optimism about the economy as indicating that the Fed will not cut rates again until after Election Day, Nov. 3. Fed watchers say the central bank was uneasy about cutting rates this month because the election was so near.
At the meeting on Aug. 18, the Federal Open Market Committee voted for a directive that favored further monetary easing. The committee consists of the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board and 5 of the presidents of the nation's 12 Federal Reserve districts.
 
The Opposite View
 There were two dissenters at the meeting: John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, and Thomas C. Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The two argued that "monetary policy already was appropriately stimulative" and that "an easing move in present circumstances might well stimulate inflationary concerns by reducing confidence in the system's willingness to pursue an anti-inflationary policy."
During the meeting, some members voiced worry that further easing could hurt bond markets as well as the already weak dollar.
Fed officials who supported further easing said it was not likely to foster inflationary pressures, "given the appreciable margin of unused resources in the economy." They also said easier money would ease debt restructuring by consumers and businesses, which was slowing spending and investment.
The members pressing for further cuts asserted that more "easing than had been needed in the past seemed to be required to overcome the depressing effects of the restructuring activities and to cushion an already sluggish expansion against the possibility of some further loss in momentum."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe to Try Again on Trade Disputes

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Trade negotiators from the United States and the European Community will meet here starting Sunday in yet another attempt to settle the longstanding disputes that have blocked progress in broader world trade talks. But in comments this week, officials on both sides did not seem prepared to compromise.
While some European officials said the talks offered the best chance yet for breaking the deadlock, officials in France, whose agricultural policies are at the heart of the dispute, warned that they would block any concessions to the United States. 
 And Bush Administration officials, although clearly eager to win an agreement in advance of Election Day, said in Washington that they were not bringing any new proposals with them and were coming only to hear whether the Europeans had finally agreed on a common position.
If the two sides cannot reach agreement soon, the simmering dispute could lead the United States to impose punitive tariffs on $1 billion of European exports, a step that would almost certainly doom negotiations on a global trade pact being negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body.
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, will lead a team that will be pressing Europe to reduce subsidies on oilseeds that are used in animal feed. European oilseeds compete primarily with soybean oil from the United States.
The two sides are also feuding over European grain subsidies and European complaints that the United States is unfairly limiting foreign access to its markets for services, including telecommunications. The United States says it will only open its telecommunications market to nations that have ended monopoly control of their own telephone industries, a step some European nations have not taken.
European Community officials here said they were optimistic that a deal could be struck because Europe would like to have an agreement ready for consideration by the leaders of the 12-nation community at their meeting in Birmingham, England, next Friday. They said they expected the United States side to be equally eager to bolster President Bush's campaign position that he is winning trade agreements that will benefit the domestic economy.
Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, warned the Administration today against being so eager for an agreement that it might make too many concessions.
Mr. Leahy said the Administration and its negotiators should "forget about the election" and "do what's right for our country."
The deep splits within Europe over the issue were clearly visible this week. On Tuesday, European Community foreign ministers urged a quick resolution to the dispute, saying Europe needed the economic help it would get from an agreement on further liberalization of world trade. Germany, whose economy is weakening, has been particularly active in lobbying France to drop its hard-line opposition and agree to a compromise.
But on Thursday France's Agriculture Minister, Jean-Pierre Soisson, reiterated his nation's hard-line stance, saying France would reject any concessions to Washington. French farmers, a powerful political force, have long opposed European Community agricultural trade policies and were at the core of the opposition in France to the Maastricht treaty on European unification. The treaty was approved by only a narrow margin in a referendum in France last month.
"There's no question of capitulating," Mr. Soisson said. "It's a question of studying retaliatory measures against the United States."

HEADLINE: Mr. Perot's Xenophobia

 BODY:
The charts Ross Perot displayed during his campaign commercial Tuesday night made a persuasive indictment of the Bush and Reagan Administrations' failure to confront the nation's economic problems, and most notably the soaring national debt. But in a half-hour blizzard of detail, facts are easily distorted, as they were when Mr. Perot accused 76 unnamed former officials of aiding America's economic enemies.
The thrust of his blatantly xenophobic argument was that any official who subsequently does work for a foreign business or government is "like a general switching armies in the middle of a war . . . because we're in a business war now, folks." In other words, it's O.K. to go to work for Chrysler, but not for Hyundai. 
 Mr. Perot is wrong on many counts. First, by raising this issue in the middle of a broadcast devoted largely to current problems, he gave the impression that most of the offending officials were Bush appointees. None of them were. As Mr. Perot said himself, they were people who left the Government between 1980 and 1985 -- Carter and Reagan appointees.
Moreover, Mr. Perot seems to feel that registration as a "foreign agent" is a dastardly act, regardless of what the "agent" does, or for whom. Such a blanket charge is both irresponsible and absurd: for example, one high official who left during those years did some work for the Republic of Seychelles, hardly a threat to America's security. Another represented the Honduran Ministry of Tourism.
But the most offensive aspect of Mr. Perot's charge is the implication that there's something bad about former Federal officials working for foreigners. He misses the essential point: There is something bad about former officials working for anyone they have dealt with as government officials. It's the "revolving door" problem, and there are laws to control it. But these laws properly apply to people who work for American interests as well as foreign interests.
Mr. Perot's implied suggestion that officials should not work for foreign interests is unreasonable and impractical. Free societies let people work where they want to. To deny officials the right to sell their expertise abroad would be the equivalent of regulatory export controls. And if later employment by foreign interests were proscribed, some of the best and the brightest might never work for the Government in the first place.
Mr. Perot says he would fix this. Let's hope he doesn't have the chance.

HEADLINE: Why It's Important to Know a Truck From a Car

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your arguments in "Sophistry in Detroit" (editorial, Sept. 22) against a Senate bill to reclassify all multipurpose vehicles as trucks reflects unfounded cynicism, not thoughtful analysis. Here are the facts: 
 The Treasury Department, in the most controversial ruling of its kind, responded to foreign political pressure in 1989 by reversing a Customs Service decision on multipurpose vehicle classification. Customs had concluded that importers could no longer be allowed to classify such vehicles entering the United States as cars or trucks to suit their own purposes.
Rather, Customs ruled that the Government would classify all multipurpose vehicles as trucks, which is, in effect, the way importers classify these vehicles before other Government agencies for emission and fuel-economy standards and gas-guzzler and luxury taxes. Even the Japanese Government classifies these vehicles as trucks in the voluntary export restraint statistics.
Treasury's action led to the illogical system in which two-door multipurpose vehicles are classified for tariff purposes as trucks, and four-doors are classified as cars.
Contrary to your claim, if anyone has enjoyed "windfall profits" from this action it has been the importers, not domestic motor-vehicle manufacturers. The classification inconsistency provides importers with a loophole that allows them to dodge more than $300 million a year in import duties at the expense of United States workers and taxpayers.
Your attempt to paint multipurpose vehicle reclassification as a consumer ripoff is specious. Multipurpose vehicle capacity is expected to expand 20 percent in the next five years, increasing the fierce competition among all producers, foreign and domestic. To be a player in this fast-growing market, all manufacturers must price competitively. It is inconceivable that domestic manufacturers would price themselves out of the very market they pioneered.
And contrary to your suggestion, classifying all multipurpose vehicles as trucks is not illegal or a violation of any United States obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Despite the claims of importers, no GATT rule prohibits a change in classification of goods for customs purposes.
If a foreign government could prove that multipurpose vehicles had been classified consistently in one category, it could seek compensation from the United States in the GATT. However, since importers classified them as both cars and trucks through the 1980's, the GATT could hardly support such a claim.
Finally, just because a vehicle "drives along highways, runs on gasoline and carries passengers" doesn't necessarily mean it's a car, as you imply. While both cars and multipurpose vehicles carry passengers, multipurpose vehicles are derived from trucks, built on truck chassis, manufactured in truck-assembly plants, designed for heavy-duty cargo carrying and off-road use, and for sales purposes are classified as trucks by all major publications -- including your own.

HEADLINE: Why It's Important to Know a Truck From a Car;
To Protect U.S. Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Tax. Blame. Regret. Elect." (Op-Ed, Sept. 29), an attempt to respond in kind to the Bush campaign's statement that Gov. Bill Clinton raised taxes in Arkansas 128 times, Mickey Kantor, chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign, displays a dismaying confusion between what constitutes a tax and what represents actions that save American jobs. 
 Eighty-one of the "taxes" he lists are actually antidumping and countervailing-duty orders. These cases all spring from injured United States industries and workers seeking relief from unfair foreign competition.
Antidumping and countervailing-duty orders are not revenue-raising devices. They are intended to offset unfair foreign-trade practices that have hurt United States industry and taken jobs from United States workers. For example, if a foreign government subsidizes exports to the United States at a rate of 10 percent, a duty of 10 percent is imposed at the United States border.
Mr. Kantor should ask the United Steelworkers of America at Bethlehem Steel, or the employees and management at Georgia Pacific and International Paper -- or employees in any of the other United States industries, such as textiles and semiconductors -- whether or not they believe that preserving United States jobs and preventing unfair trade is a tax.
Moreover, antidumping and countervailing-duty actions are brought by industry and labor, as is their right under United States law, not by the President. The Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, an independent agency, administer these laws. Orders are issued only after careful determinations that unfair trade and injury have occurred.
Trivializing the intent of these actions as tax raises obscures their true function: preventing injury to domestic industries and workers from practices internationally recognized and condemned as unfair under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr. Kantor's misrepresentation of attempts by this Administration and United States industry to secure just relief for United States workers ravaged by unfair trade practices demonstrates a woeful lack of understanding by him and his colleagues of international trade and insensitivity to the needs of United States workers.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Perot Leaves a Field of Broken Rules

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The Perot Show is something new in political campaigning and something old in television. A screen occupied by an unprepossessing figure displaying graphs and charts is the sort of dozer that gave educational television a bad name in the 1950's. But the concentration on facts without the distraction of what producers like to call production values is just what critics of television campaigns have been hollering for.
Ross Perot's opener, broadcast on Tuesday on CBS and repeated last night on ABC, defied all the rules of both television and politics. Not only was the scene static - a man behind a desk using a slide-out metal pointer to explain what the wiggles and curves on his charts meant -- but the news was all bad as well. Yes, there was the occasional wan attempt at a joke ("This is like having Willy Sutton run the banks," he said, then had to explain that Mr. Sutton had been a bank robber) and an obligatory line about working together to clean up the mess ("It'll be tough, but it'll be fun"), but this may have been the most downbeat half hour ever to occupy a major network during prime time. Talk about negative commercials. 
 Yet after weeks of being assaulted by the improbable grins and the waves and cheers and handshakes and huggings and kissings and effusions of nonstop energy and go-getter spirit by both Democratic and Republican campaigners, some viewers may have found the undemonstrative lecturer a relief from the two-party jig. The 16.5 million people who tuned in on Tuesday and the other millions who caught Mr. Perot last night were given a straight-on look at the national economic decline. Although essentially an indictment of the Reagan-Bush Administrations, this commercial was a much more relentless downer than anything the Clinton-Gore team has dared to put forward. Mr. Perot went so far as to tell Americans they are not paying enough for gasoline.
The chief commandment in American politics, especially on the tube, is Optimism at All Costs. Voters have made plain that they do not like to be discouraged. Jimmy Carter did not do much for his prospects of re-election when he told the nation it was in a malaise, and Walter Mondale's promise to raise taxes did not raise his ratings. When Paul Tsongas, running for the Democratic nomination, said and kept saying "I am not Santa Claus," he was not improving his odds.
neighborhoods, lately catered to by President Bush, is compounded by commercial television's disinclination to treat viewers as grown-ups, and political campaigns are run these days along the lines established by television. The presence of a camera can turn even a poll-tormented pol like Mr. Bush into a happy warrior.
Even upbeat statistics tend to be audience killers, yet there was Mr. Perot delivering the worst numbers he could find and then delivering The citizenry's natural disposition to be told that Washington is going to shovel money into their pockets or more of them and more, like a dentist who won't stop drilling: Jobs are down; profits are down; the dollar is down; the debt is up. The only shiny note in his performance was the pointer. And as if the news were not dire enough, each bleak item was announced by a stark white-on-black headline, like "The Stick Up." With an exception or two, the charts were instantly understood, but never have pie graphs seemed so inedible.
"Now that completes my presentation," Mr. Perot announced at the end of his half hour (a line definitely not written by Peggy Noonan) to those patients who were still in a condition to hear anything. Then he held up a copy of "United We Stand," a book he did not write and may not have read. But it was a minor lapse in an otherwise stupefyingly ungimmicky performance. You don't have to believe Mr. Perot has the answers or even find the man bearable to appreciate that in what are likely to be his fading weeks, he has already made an estimable contribution to the electorate's comprehension of the real world that will confront whichever cheerful contender defeats him next month.
 "Even upbeat statistics tend to be audience killers, yet there was Mr. Perot delivering the worst numbers he could find and then delivering more of them and more, like a dentist who won't stop drilling: Jobs are down; profits are down; the dollar is down; the debt is up."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 12, 1992, Monday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a mechanical error, an article on Saturday headed Critic's Notebook, about Ross Perot's first television commercial, included jumbled type. The affected passage, at the start of the fifth paragraph, should have read:
"The citizenry's natural disposition to be told that Washington is going to shovel money into their pockets or neighborhoods, lately catered to by President Bush, is compounded by commercial television's disinclination to treat viewers as grown-ups, and political campaigns are run these days along the lines established by television. The presence of a camera can turn even a poll-tormented pol like Mr. Bush into a happy warrior.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Strong Week With Day of Modest Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher yesterday in moderate foreign exchange trading, but its gains for the week were impressive.
Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 50 cents, to $350.40 an ounce. But the Republic National Bank reported a late bid for gold of $349.75, off 85 cents. 
 Analysts said lower interest rates in Europe, coupled with the lack of Federal Reserve action to lower rates in the United States, helped the dollar to one of its best weekly performances of the year.
For the week, the dollar gained about 9 pfennigs against the German mark and was also up substantially against the Swiss and French francs.
The United States currency drew strength from lower interest rates overseas. In the last week in Europe, "four countries cut official rates and three other countries eased money market rates," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA.
"It all helps the dollar look more attractive," he said.
Still, analysts were not confident the dollar could continue its advance. "What you need to sustain the move is an improvement in the U.S. economy," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. But the economy "just appears to continue to limp along," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 121.55 Japanese yen, from 120.80 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it rose to 121.87 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 121.80 yen, up from 121.70 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6855, from $1.6930 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.6945 to buy one pound, up from $1.6828 Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4865 German marks, up from 1.4815; 1.3155 Swiss francs, up from 1.3135; 5.0460 French francs, up from 5.0310; 1,304.00 Italian lire, down from 1,305.50.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Retirement Set at Carter Hawley Hale

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Philip M. Hawley, chairman and chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., said today that he would retire from the department store chain on Jan. 31. He will remain on the company's board and help search for his successor.
The new top executive will have to contend with the challenge of attracting customers to the company's Broadway, Weinstocks, Emporium and Broadway Southwest stores amid a steep recession in the West. 
 Carter Hawley Hale, based in Los Angeles, is the West's biggest retailer, with 87 department stores. The company emerged this week from bankruptcy protection with lower overhead costs, mostly as a result of a debt-for-equity swap with the Zell/ Chilmark Fund of Chicago.
"They need someone who can get into the organization and find out what's been crippling it and bring back its luster," said Robert G. Nesbit, who specializes in executive searches for retailers for Korn Ferry.
H. Michael Hecht, the company's president, is 52 years old and is not considered a probable candidate, according to a retailing consultant.
 
Move Is Timed
 In an interview, Mr. Hawley, who is 67 and will earn $750,000 this year, said he decided to retire after it became clear the company would successfully emerge from bankruptcy. "I'd rather do it when there is no crisis or emergency attached to it," he said.
Because of the reorganization, the company should be profitable within a year, Mr. Hawley said.
Mr. Hawley is one of the last of the old-line merchants who started his career on the shop floor and ended with his name on the door.
He joined the company as a buyer for its Broadway stores in 1958. In 1974, Broadway-Hale Stores Inc. changed its name to include his. He became chief executive of the parent company in 1977 and added the chairman's title in 1983.
Along the way, Mr. Hawley led the company's ultimate expansion to nine regional chains. But to fight off a takeover bid from the Limited Inc. in the 1980's, Mr. Hawley took on $1.3 billion in debt and sold the company's profitable specialty stores, including Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.
The debt took its toll, and the company was ultimately forced to file for protection from its creditors.

HEADLINE: But Can You Dance to It?: MTV Turns to News

BYLINE: By Judith Miller; Judith Miller is the staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
The television screen explodes with a flash of light and a riff of hard rock. This is the "Bill of Rights," according to the rock group Aerosmith.
"Freedom," declares Joe Perry, the lead guitarist of Aerosmith, is the right "to use handcuffs for friendly purposes." And, as he licks whipped cream off the chest of a gorgeous blonde, Perry says: "Freedom to wear whipped cream as clothing." Finally, as two blondes wearing American-flag suits hold up the rim of a gigantic condom, a voice off-camera intones: "Freedom to wear a rubber all day -- if necessary." 
 "Hey!" yells Steven Tyler, the lead singer. "Protect your freedoms. Vote!"
"Even for the wrong person," adds Tom Hamilton, the bass player.
You won't see this unusual political message on any of the three network newscasts or even on CNN. But millions of regular viewers of MTV, the 24-hour music channel whose hyperactive, sound-thumping music videos are critical to determining whether a record will sell, have been watching the Aerosmith public-service announcement all fall. It is part of MTV's ambitious, $1 million "Choose or Lose" campaign, whose goal is to get young Americans to vote on Nov. 3.
The campaign includes not only video messages like this one, but also sustained coverage of the Presidential campaign on MTV's daily and weekly newscasts. Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, says the decision to provide constant coverage of the race is a turning point, a "quantum step" for MTV, one of the world's fastest-growing and most profitable cable networks.
Until "Choose or Lose," MTV News focused heavily on rock stars, tours and news about the music industry and popular culture. By deciding to devote an average of about 25 percent of its daily and weekend newscasts to the Presidential campaign and increasingly to other major news developments, MTV is becoming, in effect, a kind of Rolling Stone of the air.
"We are never going to be CNN for young people," says Freston, who is 46. "But we will probably have about an 80 percent music to 20 percent news and features mix in the future. And we are committed to becoming more of a full-service network for our viewers, who, contrary to their image, are neither couch potatoes, nor passionless."
The channel's entry into this commercial and political mine field is risky. "We know that some of our audience may react by saying -- just shut up and play the music," says Judy McGrath, MTV's 40-year-old creative director. Too much politics and news, or the wrong tone, could prompt young viewers to tune out, jeopardizing one of the industry's most enviable franchises.
But if MTV succeeds in this voter-education-and-registration campaign, the electorate it helps deliver could very well affect the outcome of the Presidential race. The figures are formidable. MTV has about 20 million viewers, two-thirds of whom are between the ages of 18 and 34. Of this group, only 44 percent voted in the last Presidential election.
But this year could be different. According to an MTV survey late last month, 76 percent of viewers polled said that in this election they were "very likely" to vote, with 61 percent reporting they were "almost certain" to do so. This could be bad news for George Bush. MTV's own recent polls show that its viewers favor Clinton by 24 points.
MTV demonstrated its political muscle a number of times earlier in the campaign. During the New Hampshire primary, "Rock the Vote," a music-industry drive, resulted in the registration of 10,000 young adults, many for the first time. And in late September, a free concert in Seattle by the grunge-rock group Pearl Jam to sign up voters generated some 2,400 registrations.
Unaccustomed to such political clout, MTV is under enormous pressure to remain nonpartisan in the Presidential election, a somewhat alien concept to a network whose news broadcasts and music videos are often highly opinionated. "We have no intention of endorsing any candidate in this race, directly or indirectly," says Dave Sirulnick, 28, director of MTV news.
On the objectivity issue, the network is clearly feeling its way. Last month, Freston adopted a new policy: MTV employees involved in political coverage were instructed not to make large contributions to candidates. And this summer, after a heated internal debate, the channel decided against broadcasting an anti-abortion advertisement that it had been offered $1 million to run. (MTV executives note that they also rejected an abortion rights spot as well.) "Politics opens up a whole range of vulnerabilities for us," Freston says.
Finally, the music channel's foray into politics, news and public-service broadcasting challenges the traditional networks, which have already lost 40 percent of their audience from evening newscasts.
"Forty years ago, when television was born," says Jon Katz, the influential media critic for Rolling Stone, "television news consisted of middle-aged white men reading 22 minutes of news into a camera. Today, network news consists of middle-aged white men reading 22 minutes of news into a camera."
Such "old news," as Katz calls it, perpetuates the myth of a homogenous national culture -- an America of Ozzies and Harriets. By contrast, what Katz calls the "new news," referring to unconventional outlets like MTV, daytime talk shows and other pop media whose primary business is not news, reflects a country that has grown more ethnically, culturally and economically diverse. In the age of AIDS and economic paralysis, the young men and women who watch MTV are likely to have far different concerns than their parents about such issues as sex, jobs, the environment and racism.
"Walter Cronkite projected an image of an industrious, harmonious America in which everyone was happy," says Katz. "But who was happy? Women weren't. Blacks weren't. Hispanics weren't. White middle-class men were happy. Walter Cronkite was happy."
KURT LODER IS DEFINITELY NOT WALTER CRONKITE. THE anchor of MTV's 10-minute evening newscast, "The Day in Rock," and its half-hour, weekend version, "The Week in Rock," hardly ever smiles. He never wishes his audience a good night or a pleasant tomorrow. Attired in funereal black, he looks as if he hopes that it will thunder and rain all day. He is, in short, the contemporary Reverend Dimmesdale of rock.
A typical Loder newscast is nothing if not eclectic. It opens with news about rock stars, like the controversy surrounding Madonna's new book on her sexual fantasies, called "Sex"; Loder then goes on to disclose the dates and itinerary of, say, the latest tour planned by the rock group Bon Jovi. This is followed by highlights from an interview with the likes of Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of the Seattle rock chart-busters Nirvana; he holds his infant daughter, guitarlike, on his lap, while denying charges that he and his wife used heroin during her pregnancy. A recent newscast ends with a report on Michael Jackson's new multimillion-dollar contract to stage concerts for his children's foundation. The concerts are to be sponsored by Pepsi -- a beverage, Loder informs viewers in a characteristically cutting aside, that Michael Jackson apparently does not drink.
But interwoven into this music-intensive mix is a three-minute feature report from MTV's political reporter, Tabitha Soren, who has been on the campaign trail with Bill Clinton. Once Soren's report is concluded, Loder tells viewers that the Bush campaign, citing concerns about the format, has once again "squirmed" out of a debate with Clinton. In a third story, this time from Capitol Hill, viewers learn that the Senate, by a vote of 62 to 38, has failed to override President Bush's veto of a Motor Voter Bill, which would have allowed Americans to register to vote when they renewed a driver's license.
Loder was a respected rock journalist at Rolling Stone when Linda Corradina, MTV's 33-year-old vice president in charge of news and specials, recruited him as the channel's news anchor. "I wanted his head," says Corradina of the 47-year-old Loder, who now writes a monthly music column for Esquire.
Loder inhales deeply, without a trace of guilt, on a Marlboro. "I used to look down on TV, just as CNN used to look down on our political coverage," he says. "They said we would trivialize politics! As if anything could trivialize politics."
Loder's newscast reflects what he calls his "total political uncorrectness." He enjoys poking fun at multiculturalism on the air. "The idea that everything white and European is useless is dumb," Loder says.
His news stories often focus on censorship, free speech and other First Amendment issues. In late September, for example, MTV News featured a story about a concert organizer's decision to drop the speed-metal band Body Count, led by Ice-T, from a Guns 'n' Roses concert in Los Angeles. "It comes down to this," Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns 'n' Roses, told Loder. "Freedom of speech is O.K., as long as it doesn't [expletive] off some public official."
Weeks before the networks had even heard of Body Count's "Cop Killer," Loder was reporting on the group's album. Ice-T eventually withdrew the cut from the album after police groups charged that he was advocating murder of their members.
"I was initially skeptical of the 'Rock the Vote' effort," Loder confesses, referring to the get-out-the-vote campaign by members of the music industry, most prominently MTV. "I mean, half the 'Rock the Vote' people weren't even registered. And I think not voting is a vote."
But Loder says he now supports the registration campaign. And he has tried to be evenhanded in his treatment of both sides -- evenhandedly irreverent. He has taken potshots not only at Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle but also at Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore. During a broadcast last month, the MTV anchor reported that Clinton had "dropped in" on U2, the hugely popular rock band from Ireland, after discovering that they were staying at the same Chicago hotel. Loder told viewers, in his deadpan best, that Clinton had chatted with band members about politics, "no doubt, to the delight and illumination of all concerned."
"I'm neither a Democrat nor a Republican," Loder says. "I think a lot of what passes for politics in both parties is just plain stupid."
MTV, LIKE ALL SUCCESSFUL VENTURES, HAS MANY fathers. What is clear is that a group of young and not-so-young entrepreneurs -- Steve Ross, Bob Pittman, John Lack, David Horowitz and Tom Freston, among others -- founded MTV 11 years ago as a company originally controlled by Warner Communications and American Express. When a group of MTV executives tried to buy the company, a fierce leveraged-buyout battle ensued.
The winner was Viacom International, which was bought in 1987 by Sumner M. Redstone, the New England theater owner who won control of the company with a $500 million in cash and $2.8 billion in debt. Today, Redstone, 69, is an active Democrat strongly committed to the Clinton campaign, and he owns 76 percent of Viacom International, MTV's parent company, whose estimated worth stands at $4 billion.
Although MTV has broadcast some news almost from its inception, news became a separate department with its own budget only in 1985. "We originally had two news readers, a budget of about $500,000, no special effects, nothing," recalls Doug Herzog, the 33-year-old senior vice president for programming. "Talk about lean and mean." Today, MTV News has a news staff of 15, backed up by about 35 freelancers and a budget of nearly $5 million.
"The Day in Rock" now covers international events, like the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the attempted coup in the Soviet Union last year and the recent arrest of Shen Tong, the 24-year-old student dissident who had returned to China to continue his campaign for democracy.
And while it broadens its horizons, the network is also experimenting with new approaches to breaking stories. During the Los Angeles riots, Loder devoted his entire broadcast to the riots, including replaying footage not only of events leading up to the violence, like the police beating of Rodney King, (which the networks did as well) but also of reaction from black rappers (which the networks did not initially do).
The best way to define MTV News is to describe what it is not. The channel does not attempt to cover every major national or international development. "If the news item won't interest younger people, we leave it out," says Sirulnick. You will probably not see a story on the European currency crisis or a Congressionial budget fight on MTV anytime soon. The rule of thumb is to anticipate what viewers will be interested in and to shun any news reporting that smacks of "take your medicine." MTV is not "sound bite" news. While the total time devoted to news may be far less than that offered by networks, individual political features are three to four minutes long -- roughly double the network length. The channel also tries to avoid a common network pitfall -- appearing earnest and sanctimonious. "We don't try to tell our audience what they should do about something," says the MTV creative director, Judy McGrath. "We'd fall victim to channel surfing in a minute if we were preachy and tried to tell them what to do -- or how to vote."
Most surprisingly, given the often highly subversive content of much of its music, MTV's political coverage is not countercultural in the 60's sense. This disappoints some critics, many of whom come from the fortysomething generation. For these Americans, rock-and-roll was part of a revolution -- a questioning of everything about the nation and its actions at home and abroad. In the forefront of this revolution was music and a sensibility still shared by many MTV executives, but far less so by most of its 180 staff members, whose average age is 27.
MTV officials are keenly aware of this "sensibility gap" and of the differences between today's younger generation and its predecessors. "Our viewers are not in rebellion," says Freston, a founder of the network. "There is no revolution going on out there. This generation -- the baby busters -- are totally different from us. We felt that we had inherited the world, that we could make it anything we wanted it to be. They feel that they inherited . . . a recycled popular culture, AIDS, debt, college and job worries, a planet on the brink of ecological suicide. So sure they're disconnected, alienated; sure they have low self-esteem. But they're not passive. They don't sit around at political protests or in front of the television. On average, these kids watch less television than we do. They have jobs after school. They're working their [expletive] off. They're very conservative and hate giveaways. They don't have a lot of time for counterculture."
One word that would seem to describe the largely white, middle-class suburban MTV audience is libertarian. They are, according to surveys, economically conservative and socially liberal. The Aerosmith public-service announcement speaks about individual rights but says little about the responsibilities inherent in those rights. Mark Crispin Miller, a writer and television critic, says MTV celebrates the "egoistic, selfish materialism of American culture."
Another harsh critic, David Rosenthal, who edits books about media at Random House, thinks MTV's political coverage is "guilt programming." The channel, he charges, is trying to expiate its sins by "giving a little politics" to a generation whom MTV has helped "lobotomize."
"Many of these kids are so spaced out they would think that test patterns are groovy," Rosenthal says.
And yet paradoxically, music and television are probably less important to baby busters than they were to baby boomers. "We used to listen to Bob Dylan for inspiration," Freston recalls. "What Dylan said was gospel. The music influenced how we dressed, the way we thought. That's not true for these people. Our audience doesn't look like the musicians they watch. They're not easily taken in. We had to find a way to talk to these people, so we started our public-service ads on subjects like racial tolerance, safe sex, AIDS. And that led naturally to politics. But we always have to stay in touch with what they want and the issues they care about."
MTV officials, however, do not deny that expanding its public service and political coverage is good for business -- the effort has attracted major new advertisers, like Ford. After a major expansion overseas in the last few years, the music channel now broadcasts to an audience of 210 million in 72 countries. And revenues for MTV Networks are growing at an annual rate of about 20 percent.
"There are very few aspects of the cable industry where a single company has such a dominant position," says Steven Rattner, an investment banker who specializes in communications at the firm of Lazard Freres. "MTV owns this franchise. They really have no serious competitors."
But MTV executives challenge the notion that their new enthusiasm for news and politics has anything to do with placating critics who accuse the channel of marketing sex and violence through its videos. "We don't have a guilty conscience," says McGrath. "We love lingerie ads and rock bands. We're doing this because we want to, and because our viewers like it."
Other critics argue that MTV's political coverage only thinly conceals a partisan political agenda. Among the most vocal is L. Brent Bozell 3d, chairman of Media Research Center, an ultraconservative media monitoring group; he has repeatedly assailed MTV as a "mouthpiece for liberalism" and was particularly enraged at the network's gulf-war coverage, which, he claimed, was unabashedly antiwar. Bozell cited repeated instances during the buildup to the war of the network's broadcasting the celebrated antiwar ballad "Give Peace a Chance."
To avoid such criticism of its political coverage, MTV is trying hard to appear fair to both parties. The network has extended an open invitation to President Bush to be a guest at a special election forum, an echo of the 90-minute question-and-answer session to which Bill Clinton submitted himself last spring. Despite the boost in popularity Clinton's candidacy received after his appearance on that forum, President Bush declared in July that he would not be going on "the teeny-bopper network."
Freston still fumes about the put-down, though he is quick to add that MTV's offer to President Bush and Vice President Quayle expires only on Nov. 3. "In 1988, those teeny-boppers voted, 50 to 41 percent, for George Bush," says Freston. "I hope eventually the G.O.P. will question the wisdom of writing them off."
Over time, even some of MTV's staunchest critics have warmed to the network and its programming. In 1983, Steven Levy, a writer for Rolling Stone, issued a blistering attack on MTV, describing the channel as "the ultimate junk culture." The advent of MTV, he wrote, meant that television was now the most crucial element in marketing a song, and that promotion had clearly triumphed over art. He also blasted MTV for refusing to broadcast videos by black and other minority artists. And outraged by the blurring of the distinction between images projected in its music videos and those of ads surrounding them, he concluded that thanks in part to MTV, rock-and-roll had been replaced by commercials.
Levy now says he has softened. Perhaps, he muses, "we've all gotten used to the junkification of American life -- to the fact that you can now eat at McDonald's and that 50 years from now, we may even be nostalgic about it." Beyond that, however, he finds MTV's evolution "encouraging." While MTV is "still not a very healthy fantasy land," the network has made important changes. "Michael Jackson made them realize that the largely white suburban kids who watch them wanted black artists, that they had to offer more diversity," says Levy. "They've also gotten more critical of, and more of a sense of humor about, themselves."
In recent news specials, MTV has explored such commercially and politically sensitive topics as sexism in the music industry and MTV's own reluctance until the mid-80's to show videos by black rock stars. Freston has publicly apologized for an infamous decision in 1989 not to broadcast Neil Young's ultimately award-winning video, "This Note's for You," which mocked musicians for accepting commercial endorsements. "We learned the hard way that our audience didn't like our looking like slaves to advertisers," Freston says.
But controversy over what MTV will and will not broadcast continues. Women at MTV were furious, for example, when they were not consulted about the decision not to broadcast Madonna's video "Justify My Love," parts of which ABC wound up playing on "Nightline." Staff members were also angry that MTV would only show the George Michael video "I Want Your Sex" with a disclaimer from the artist stating that he believes in monogamy.
This self-censorship infuriates some MTV staff members. But most acknowledge at least privately that some self-monitoring is essential if MTV is to stay on the air. "Besides, being banned by MTV is often the best way to sell a record," says Freston. "Look at Madonna."
Would MTV have shown the Body Count video for "Cop Killer"?
"There was no such video -- thank God," Freston sighs.
AT BOTH THE Republican and Democratic conventions this summer, MTV, the newcomer, was assigned a booth at nosebleed level -- "like cheap seats at a rock concert," as Judy McGrath puts it.
Tabitha Soren, MTV's chief political reporter, notes some similarities -- and differences -- between conventions and concerts. "Everything depends on the level of your pass," says Soren, who turned 25 during the G.O.P. gathering in Houston. "Security is more or less the same. Politicians, of course, are easier to handle than rock stars. There are fewer intermediaries -- no agents, managers and record-company reps. But the pols, too, are superstars."
So is Tabitha. Everyone under 30 at the G.O.P. convention seemed to want her autograph. Older delegates wanted to be photographed with her so that they could impress their teen-agers back home. Soren, an Air Force brat who grew up in the Philippines and other foreign posts, is about as hard-driving and ambitious as they come, and studiously professional. "I haven't decided whom I'm going to support for President," she says. "But if I had, I probably wouldn't tell you."
Despite a propensity for unconventional attire ("I like men's wear," she says), Soren and her political team are fairly risk-averse in their approach to political interviews and news coverage. For example, at the convention in Houston the network chose not to shoot the abortion-rights demonstrations taking place outside the Astrodome (though they did buy and broadcast footage of the protests). Nor did the crew visit any of the poor neighborhoods immediately surrounding the lavish partying taking place within the Astrodome. But MTV's unusual camera angles, quick cuts, zoom shots and tight rhythmic editing made what might have been uninspired material on the convention floor positively riveting.
Last month, during a Clinton-Gore bus tour across Georgia, the Soren spot featured "stutter cutting," that is, removing video frames to create a jerky, jumpy image, making the viewer feel the bumps and lurches of actually riding on the bus. Also en route, MTV's camera crew zoomed in on a woman carrying a "Psychics for Clinton-Gore" poster. The stars, she said, show that the Democrats will win. The MTV camera also captured the Clintons before an interview -- "Let me clean up a little for you, Tab," said Hillary Clinton.
At the Republican convention, MTV's opening feature package was reported by Ted Nugent, of the heavy-metal band Damn Yankees. Wandering around the Astrodome in a sleeveless shirt, a long ponytail and cowboy hat, Nugent pointed out the elephant statues on sale and the hairdressing salon in the adjoining souvenir pavilion. He referred to the concession stands as the "Capitalist Republic of America."
On the convention's third night, Treach, a black rapper from the group Naughty by Nature, roamed the convention floor as the Rev. Pat Robertson condemned homosexuals and feminists to the buttoned-down crowd. "It ain't like this in New Jersey," said Treach, who is from East Orange. "I mean, man, there aren't a lot of families like this where I come from. In my neighborhood, I was almost arrested for loitering once cause I was hanging out in front of my house."
OH GOD! IT'S dehfinitely doughnut rotation time," screams Geoff Whelan, an MTV writer. Whelan is not the only one at this weekly MTV brainstorming session who is deh-finitely unhappy with the latest suggestion about what the channel should broadcast the weekend of the Presidential election.
Boxes of glazed, chocolate, cream-filled and plain Dunkin' Donuts instantly exchange places on the oval conference table. Another round of milk is poured; there is no coffee or tea. Caffeine is the last thing needed by these 14 people -- more than half of whom are women, two of whom are black, one of whom is British and none of whom is wearing anything remotely resembling standard business attire.
"O.K. Let's do it, people," pleads Greg Drebin, MTV's director of programming and the owner of a hamster that recently escaped from its cage and is now presumably roaming free somewhere in the corridors connecting the rumpus rooms that are the company's offices.
"How about a Family Value Package?" offers Whelan. "Or a weekend of Politically Incorrect Videos? We could show nothing but Meg adeth, Ice-T and Judas Priest."
One woman suggests: "Or 100 videos most likely to get you pregnant."
"A sex and violence weekend?"
"That's two weekend ideas, actually," Drebin replies deadpan.
"It'll never fly," cautions Allan Infeld, an advertising account manager. "Think of the advertisers."
The group pays no attention. "We need to think interactive," says David Felton, who takes pride in being, at age 52, MTV's oldest living staff member. "What about an MTV public-service offer," he says. "If you're too wasted, we'll take you to the polls. Or, why doesn't the network just go black on election day so people won't be distracted and will get out and vote?"
"Extrafine!" an intern cheers.
The advertisers would deh-finitely not like that.
Ultimately MTV decides on a far more conventional approach. The night before Nov. 3, it intends to replay most of its political features and its "Rock the Vote" promotion videos by music superstars, and to broadcast the latest pre-election news. On Nov. 3, it will broadcast music videos, but superimpose on each what it calls a "bug," an animated symbol aimed at reminding people throughout the day not only to go to the polls, but also, as only MTV would put it, to "Vote Loud."

HEADLINE: A DIRECTORY OF CRUISES WORLDWIDE;
The Roster Grows As Trips Shrink

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL reports on the travel industry for The Times.

 BODY:
SO many millions of Americans took advantage of last summer's bargain air fares that some travel industry executives wondered if all that spur-of-the-moment travel would cut into fall and winter cruises. While a final answer won't be known for months, early indications are that the cruise industry will post its 22d consecutive annual increase, thanks in large part to fall and winter travelers. While some analysts see storm clouds on the industry's horizon, a few years from now, cruise line officials expect 4.4 million passengers this year, up from 4 million in 1991, and some winter cruises already have "sold out" signs on them.
"Several ships are already full for cruises around Christmas and New Year, and most others for that time are filling up quickly," said Cheryl Myerson, president of the National Association of Cruise Only Agents. But hundreds of other cruises scheduled between now and spring are yet to be filled. 
 This year's cruises range from A to Z, with stops at Anguilla (on Windjammer, Clipper Cruise and Renaissance) and Zanzibar (Paquet French, Renaissance, Royal Viking, Sea Quest and Pearl Cruises). There is also a Sagafjord cruise to remote Pitcairn, the South Seas island colonized by mutineers from the British naval ship Bounty, and five lines have scheduled stops at Devils Island, one of the three Iles du Salut 10 miles off the coast of French Guiana and a one-time penal colony.
Vietnam is slowly returning to cruise line itineraries, and two ships will make their first calls there: Royal Cruise Line's 450-passenger Golden Odyssey, on a 12-day trip from Singapore to Hong Kong, with an overnight in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), sailing Jan. 5, 1993. And Classical Cruises' 80-passenger Aurora I, departing Singapore Dec. 24, 1992, and returning to Hong Kong Jan. 5, with stops in the Vietnamese cities of Haiphong, Danang, Ho Chi Minh City and Rach Gia.
"This is a trip for people who feel they've been just about everywhere else," said Jamie Rosen, the president of Classical Cruises. "It's like visiting China 15 years ago."
The fastest-growing cruises are still two to five days, a category that has grown 329 percent since 1980 -- or almost twice the 178 percent overall growth rate during that period, according to the Cruise Lines International Association, whose 32 members' ships visit some 400 ports in almost 100 countries. The next fastest growing is the six-to-eight-day category, at 155 percent, which still attracts the biggest share (54.3 percent) of the cruise market.
Majesty Cruise Line's Royal Majesty, which entered service Sept. 18, has designated both its dining room and 132 of its 528 cabins nonsmoking -- the first cruise ship to do so, according to industry officials. And while cruises and dieting seem basically incompatible, most ships these days offer at least two low-fat, low-calorie entree selections at each meal.
While many cruises cost $600 or more a person a day, Barbara Weiner, an industry spokeswoman, said the average was between $175 and $225, including air fare and meals.
The most popular cruise ship destination is still the Caribbean, accounting for about 35.4 percent of passengers. Together with the Bahamas (13.6 percent) and eastern Mexico ports (7.5 percent), which the cruise industry lumps with the Caribbean, the total Caribbean market is well above 50 percent. Other leading destinations are western Mexico (8.7 percent), the Mediterranean (8.1), Alaska (6.2) and Europe (3.5).
One destination growing in popularity is the "deep south" of the Caribbean, cruises of up to 11 days that usually depart from San Juan and call at Grenada, Bonaire, Barbados, Martinique, Curacao, Virgin Gorda and Tortola.
Other increasingly popular ports of call in the Caribbean are private islands, usually in the Bahamas but some off Haiti or the Dominican Republic. The day after the Norwegian Cruise Line's 1,246-passenger Dreamward is christened at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 5, the ship will sail to the Caribbean on a seven-day trip that includes a stop at Pleasure Island, the line's four-mile-long private island in the Berry Islands, the Bahamas.
Other lines with private islands in the Caribbean or the Bahamas -- where passengers can beachcomb, barbecue, swing in a hammock, snorkel, sail or water-ski -- include Princess, Costa Cruises, Dolphin, Majesty, Premier, Crown and Commodore. This year, Royal Caribbean completed a $7 million-dollar renovation of Coco Cay, its private island in the Bahamas.
Royal Caribbean also has a private resort on the northwest coast of Haiti, Labadee, but the cruise line has been unable to call there since Washington imposed an economic embargo on Haiti last year.
Although Hurricane Andrew struck the Bahamas before bearing down on the United States mainland, it did only minor damage to the private islands and barely touched Nassau and Freeport. Thus it did not effect cruise itineraries.
Hawaii was not as lucky. Hurricane damage to Kauai forced American Hawaii Cruises to suspend cruises there for the time being; instead, its ships are spending more time in Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii.
Cruises through the Panama Canal represent only 3 percent of all cruises, but are a fast-growing segment. Thirty-four ships representing 16 cruise lines have scheduled dozens of such trips this fall and winter. Princess alone has scheduled 27 transcanal trips in 1992-93 (14 between November and April by its Royal Princess), while the Song of Norway will make 10 canal transits this winter. The Holland America Line's Statendam, the fifth ship to bear that name, will transit the canal on her maiden voyage in January, while that same month Carnival's Tropicale will inaugurate 10- and 11-day cruises through the canal. Sun Line is offering 12 cruises through the canal that depart from and return to Galveston, Tex.
The busiest cruise port remains Miami, with almost 1.3 million embarkations last year of two-day cruises or longer, followed by Port Canaveral (502,000) and Port Everglades (442,000). New York ranks seventh in North America, with 165,121 embarkations last year, but that was 22 percent higher than in 1990. Celebrity, Crown, Crystal, Regency, Royal Caribbean and Royal Cruise all offer cruises from New York to the Caribbean this fall and winter, while Cunard's Queen Elizabeth 2 has two Caribbean tours scheduled from New York.
On Jan. 3, the QE2 is scheduled to sail from New York on a six-continent 104-day world cruise, which can be broken up into 35- to 56-day segments covering South America, the Pacific and Orient, the tropics and the Mediterranean. Other ships planning world cruises this fall or winter are Costa's Daphne (103 days), World Explorer's Universe (100), the Royal Viking's Royal Viking Sun (97) and Cunard's Sagafjord (96).
The QE2 was out of action two months after striking a rocky ledge near Martha's Vineyard on Aug. 7, and to allow more time for an overhaul, the line canceled an 8-day Iberian cruise that had been scheduled for November. Cruise ships operating out of Miami escaped the wrath of Hurricane Andrew, as did the port itself, although a few ships canceled departures because the airport was closed about 36 hours.
Many passengers are apparently waiting until the last minute to book passage -- just as for the last few years vacationers have waited until the last minute to make airplane, hotel and guesthouse reservations. Travel industry officials say that trend started when the nation's economy softened, and people waited to see whether and what kind of vacation they could afford. While the economy is hardly robust now, much of the procrastination is fueled by the expectation of bigger discounts and more add-ons, the closer the departure dates of ships with unsold cabins.
SOME cruise lines, such as Royal Caribbean, Princess and SeaQuest, have tried to counter last-minute deep discounting and haggling for upgrades by offering their lowest discounts for those who make reservations early or by pledging that if a lower fare becomes available after passengers book, those passengers will receive the lower rate.
Nevertheless, discounts of at least 35 percent off published prices are common, although cruise lines have been trying to apply them selectively rather than across the board. Thus Sun Line Cruises is offering fares of $100 a person, plus air fare, for third and fourth passengers who share a cabin with two passengers who each pay full fare, from $2,590 to $5,460, on its Stella Solaris' 15-day Caribbean cruise in December. Fantasy Cruises is offering half off the regular fare for seniors traveling as the second occupant in a cabin with a full-fare passenger, on cruises to Nassau, the Caribbean or to eastern Mexico. Norwegian Cruise Lines lets a companion sail free, from Los Angeles to Mexico, when one passenger pays full fare.
Four new cruise ships will go into service later this year: Norwegian Cruise Line's Dreamward (1,246 passengers), Starlite's Rainbow (1,195), Costa's Allegra (800 passengers) and Club Med's Club Med II (386). Eight other new ships, totaling 6,416 beds, previously went into service in 1992, including Royal Caribbean's 2,766-passenger Majesty of the Seas.
Some industry sources cite the new ships scheduled for this year and into the future as proof of the cruise industry's vigor. The industry has grown, in terms of numbers of passengers, an average 9.8 percent every year from 1980 to 1991, and occupancy rates above 90 percent are taken for granted. But others fear that the new vessels may create a glut with attendant losses. The Trends Research Institute, formerly the Socioeconomic Research Institute, in Rhinebeck, N.Y., for example, recently forecast that not only will the cruise business not grow according to industry expectations, but also that occupancy rates will fall from their current 90 percent to 70 percent by 1996.
"The industry's primary market, the middle class, is being squeezed with declining discretionary income compounded by increasing inflation," the institute, which tracks trends of all kinds, said. Seeking to maintain high occupancy levels, the cruise lines are slashing prices, it added, a strategy "that will cause some of the great names in cruises to become caught by a socioeconomic undertow that could take them into a whirlpool and lead to their reorganization, sale or closure."

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
The Artist As Conjurer, King and Christ

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman

 BODY:
One of the most remarkable legacies in the history of 20th-century art is surely the series of roughly 80 self-portraits that the great German painter Max Beckmann turned out between 1899, when he was a 15-year-old art student, and 1950, the year in which he died. Over the years, he cast himself in a dizzying range of roles, both earthly and divine -- the artist as mountebank, conjurer and man about town, as king, Jupiter and Jesus Christ. Beckmann's intensity, encapsulated by the unflinching and intimidating stare with which he returns a viewer's gaze in one after another of the self-portraits, rarely faltered.
A selection of 30 of these self-portraits is at the Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue, in Manhattan, through Oct. 31. Even without the best examples, the exhibition, with works selected by the Beckmann scholar Peter Selz, packs a tremendous wallop. 
 Beckmann didn't seem capable of holding back. He rose to prominence in the years just before World War I as a conservative painter, dubbed the German Delacroix because of the grandiose historical and mythological compositions he undertook of subjects like the sinking of the Titanic and the battle of the Amazons. The war, in which he served as a medical orderly until the brutality drove him to mental collapse in 1915, irrevocably altered his view of life. But far from abandoning out of despair the allegorical and emotional ambitions of those early canvases, he channeled them into the very different kind of art for which he ultimately became known.
It was not like the work of German Expressionists such as George Grosz and Otto Dix. Like them, Beckmann dealt for a while in the claustrophobia and chaos of the modern city, especially the German cities, which were reeling from economic ruin. In 1923, when he made one of the prints in the current exhibition, "In the Hotel (The Dollar)," depicting a sycophantic art dealer proffering a dollar to the disdainful painter, rampant German inflation had raised the value of that dollar to a trillion marks.
But Beckmann's art was also suffused with a deep, if eccentric, spiritualism, based partly on his readings of Madame Blavatsky and his dabblings in Gnosticism, Buddhism and the cabala. And so, while his edgy and sardonic paintings, with their angular and compressed forms straining against the edges of the pictures, were dark metaphors for the metropolis in extremis, at the same time they aspired to something more enduring than contemporary social commentary, something closer to religious revelation.
No wonder Beckmann admired not only the social satire of Hogarth but also the sorrowful spirituality of painters as diverse as Grunewald and van Gogh. His works are filled with images that seem to stand for other things, with obscure signs and symbols. The largest and most impressive of the paintings in this exhibition, "Les Artistes With Vegetables," shows Beckmann holding a mirror and seated around a candelit table with three of his compatriots, one holding a turnip, the next a fish, the last a loaf of bread. All four are German exiles in occupied Holland. Each member of the quartet stares in a different direction, participating silently in this inscrutable ritual, with its Christian overtones and distant, perhaps unintended, echo of van Gogh's "Potato Eaters."
Beckmann's imagery often evokes a kind of stage on which bizarre epic dramas unfold and in which he himself assumes the part of the leading player. Only Picasso, among major artists in this century, treated self-portraiture with similar devotion.
Beckmann was, in his prints and drawings, a master of the psychologically charged line -- of nervous, agitated scratches and deep, scarred markings, almost like wounds on the page. The black and white of his drypoints and woodcuts especially suited the mordancy and bleakness of many of his images. In his print entitled "Large Self-Portrait," of 1919, Beckmann presents himself -- cigarette clamped between his lips and head turned slightly so that he peers almost sideways -- as a skeptical and unforgiving figure.
In "The Family," from the 1919 "Hell" portfolio of lithographs, he glares accusingly at his hapless mother-in-law and his goggle-eyed son playing with toy hand grenades -- metaphors, perhaps, for a German people either cowed or infantilized by the war. Beckmann himself comes across in these works as both judge and savior, the role he assumes in "Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery," a painting unfortunately not in the exhibition.
But he could just as easily represent himself as a fool, and the self-portraits, like so many of his works, are frequently leavened by a deadpan wit. For example, he seems an oddly comic figure, with his bowler hat tipped back on his huge brow, in "Self-Portrait With Red Curtain," of 1923. The golden backdrop and the heavy red curtain, intimating royal portraiture, suggest the artist as social lion; but his stiff pose and curiously blank expression imply that he intended something more ironic. The painting brings to mind the story of Beckmann, in black derby hat, visiting the parents of a patron and suddenly turning cartwheels in their garden, only to act immediately afterward as if he had done nothing out of the ordinary.
Beckmann was a master colorist. One is struck time and again in the show by the sumptuous and vibrant colors of the paintings -- the electric blues and pinks and yellows and the brilliant orange peeking out from beneath the blue-gray jacket Beckmann dons in "Self-Portrait in Sailor Hat," of 1926. He may, as a young artist, have disdained Matisse as a mere decorator, but he clearly learned from him how to make color, on its own, serve expressive ends.
One also carries away from the exhibition an indelible memory of the artist's spendidly round head and downturned crescent mouth, inevitably juxtaposed with the cigarette caught between his pointed fingers -- an image so curiously potent and redolent of its era that it has become almost a cliche of the doomed Weimar Republic.
A more complete overview of the self-portraits than this one could lay out virtually the entire course of the artist's career, not just the Weimar years with which he is often too narrowly identified, but the whole of a life that brought him eventually to the United States. Having been condemned in 1937 as "degenerate" by the Nazis, upon hearing Hitler promise in a speech to sterilize wayward artists, Beckmann caught the first train for Amsterdam. The remainder of his life was spent in exile. In 1947 he accepted a teaching post in St. Louis and then settled in New York. Until the end he painted self-portraits.
The show at Gagosian serves most of all to whet the appetite for what promises to be an even finer examination of Beckmann's self-portraits, with many major loans, in the spring at the Hamburg Kunsthalle. It is being organized by that museum's director, Uwe Schneede, who is also editing the artist's correspondence. Until then, the Gagosian exhibition serves admirably as a window into the soul of probably the greatest German artist of this century.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
Early Salvos in the War To Capture People's Minds

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg; Vicki Goldberg is the author of "The Power of Photography: How Photographs Changed Our Lives."

 BODY:
After World War I and the Russian Revolution, visual images came to the forefront in the war for people's minds. George Bernard Shaw said, "Next to torture, art persuades most," but photography had taken art's place. Lenin called for the new Soviet state to create "a political and social journalism infused with images," and in 1926 the Russian artist El Lissitzky wrote: "The invention of easel-pictures produced great works of art, but their effectiveness has been lost. The cinema and the weekly magazine have triumphed."
They triumphed everywhere. Though the Soviet Union led the world in the politicization of images, some of its ideas immediately caught on elsewhere. In Germany in the 1920's, Communists founded the worker-photography movement, a bold attempt to teach workers how to photograph -- and in so doing politicize the proletariat and give it control of its own image. 
 The intention was to create, with the potent assistance of journalism, a class consciousness that would eventually lead to political action against oppression. "Camera as Weapon: Worker Photography Between the Wars" at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University (through Oct. 31) presents photographs made of, by, and for workers in a search for solidarity and self-knowledge.
According to the catalogue essay by Leah Ollman, curator of the exhibition (which was organized by the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego), the mainstream press seldom pictured the working classes, leaving them to some extent invisible even to themselves. The worker-photography movement, a group of Communist-front associations that did not require membership in the party, was founded in Germany in 1926 to teach the proletariat to photograph its own living and working conditions.
The movement guaranteed a supply of authentic images that the workers' magazines could use to educate their audience, and it quickly spread to Switzerland, Holland and Czechoslovakia. Though a workers' press had existed earlier in the century, this must have been one of the first times in history that the working class was this highly organized for the purpose of defining itself not just to its bosses, as in labor unions, but to itself.
To judge by the work on view, most of it unfamiliar here, the movement produced highly competent photographers but no unsung masters. Some are still unidentified, since it was safer to publish anonymously, and a few of the better photographers were not even members of worker-photographer associations but political sympathizers who contributed to the worker magazines. The one outstanding figure is John Heartfield -- a German who changed his name from Helmut Herzfelde in defiance of anti-British propaganda -- not a photographer but an artist who appropriated popular images or else staged photographs, then montaged them in scathing satires of the Hitler regime.
Heartfield is hardly unknown -- the Kent Gallery had a major retrospective last year -- but he is always worth seeing, and a lively selection is on view. There's his barren Christmas tree with its branches bent into the shape of a swastika; there's Hitler giving the Nazi salute while a huge industrialist behind him stuffs money into his upraised hand.
The rest of the photographs frequently generate more historical heat than feeling. Walter Ballhause turned out some very creditable reportage; Max Schiff pointedly applied avant-garde ideas to social documentary, and Cas Oorthuys's images from occupied Holland in World War II are affecting.
But for reports made by insiders, most of these images seem oddly remote. Beggars are coolly regarded and unemployment lines viewed from a distance, with a sense of emotional remove that might owe something to the dominant strains of art photography in Germany at the time. The workers' social documents tend to miss the wrenching sense of identification present in pictures of similar subjects by American photographers of the Depression like Dorothea Lange.
The notion of creating a cadre of reporters from among the unemployed would not necessarily result in great art (which the movement had repudiated anyway) or in great reporting or even great passion. Apparently many came to learn the art of photography but ended up politically indoctrinated; they had meant to produce nudes and pastorales but portrayed oppression and injustice instead. There was a similar situation in America in the 30's, when working- and middle-class writers, directed by local Communist-front organizations to create politically correct proletarian literature, wrote a number of books in which good intentions outstripped talent.
"Camera as Weapon" comes alive when it presents the actual magazines, chiefly the Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung (A.I.Z., or Workers Illustrated News). It is less important for a single picture to be brilliant in a magazine context than on a gallery wall, and these magazines, after all, display the photographs as they were meant to be seen. Backed by polemical text and allied with other pictures, the images were sometimes laid out in fancy, gimmicky spreads and at other times arranged in sequences and relationships that formed some of the earliest photo essays of modern photojournalism.
The early picture press thus owed some debt to politics. One of the less talked about but still major changes effected by World War I and the Russian Revolution was a new understanding of the suasive power of the press and a reorientation of the mass media in some countries to better serve the cause of propaganda. Allied forces had prevented reporters and photographers from reaching the front during much of the European conflict, but after German front-line news articles began to find an eager audience in other countries, the Allies realized they had to counter with their own news. Soviet photography, cinema and art forms were soon drafted into the service of agitation and propaganda.
The mere establishment of the worker-photography movement was an acknowledgement that the bourgeoisie already understood the effectiveness of images in the press and film, and that it had tightened its lock on power by controlling what people saw. It was a stroke of daring perception on the movement's part to recognize the propaganda impact of ostensibly apolitical images in the mainstream press, and another perceptive stroke to recognize the impact of the lack of images of the underclasses.
The political nature of popular imagery has become clearer and clearer over time. In recent years protests have been mounted against depictions of women on album covers and blacks in film, or the dearth of minorities in most advertising -- not to mention the bitter struggle for control over money for art.
IN WEIMAR GERMANY, PROTEST was dangerous, and when the Nazis took over in 1933, the A.I.Z. moved to Czechoslovakia. In 1938, after the German invasion, it moved once more. Hitler's minions swallowed the German press whole and regurgitated Nazi propaganda. They had not failed to notice how the worker-photography movement used the power of images in the media to advance its cause, and they imitated this tactic in their own way.
Nazi lies now made the need for counterpropaganda pressing. In a 1934 article titled "Dachau -- How It Really Is," the A.I.Z. reproduced a Nazi-approved, illustrated story depicting Dachau as a kind of adult summer camp, but surrounded it with a text that revealed what the camp was really like. Yet the truth made no one free, for powerful as the media were, they were no match for bullets.
The worker-photography movement's efforts to teach people to see and record their own conditions have had echoes down to this day. The catalogue notes that the organization was re-established in Germany in the 1970's. In America, at least since the 60's, a few individuals and groups with no direct relationship to the movement and a somewhat different political agenda have taught photography to young people in minority and low-income groups, encouraging them to make their own sense of their surroundings and to discover their own voices.
The importance of controlling one's individual or group image has become so obvious that celebrities demand final say over which portraits magazines run, and guerrilla groups record their own actions to counteract reports in the official press.
Politics makes strange bedfellows. Now that these photographs made to galvanize workers are on view in a gallery, most people seeing them will not be working class. In the back room of the Grey is an extended work by Adrian Piper called "Decide Who You Are," political in its own specific way, that centers on repeated images of Anita Hill at age 8 and the three monkeys who hear, see and speak no evil.
Just outside the gallery one day, beneath a sign saying "Adrian Piper/Decide Who You Are," a table was set up to hawk applications for Visa and Mastercard, with an advertisement promising "What You Want Where You Want When You Want It."

HEADLINE: Getting the Grime off the Face of the City

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
IT'S been a cloudburst of cleaning: Trinity Church, the Dakota, the Flatiron Building, the New York Yacht Club, the Century Association and dozens of other buildings in New York have emerged after baths in acids, detergents and in some cases just plain water, as fresh and new, shedding years of grime.
The results range from the sublime to the startling and, occasionally, the tragic. 
 The recession has created a downturn in all kinds of building renovation, but over the last decade or two facade cleaning has moved from the unusual to the unexceptional. Some owners seek to renew -- not just modernize -- the historical character of the buildings; others clean facades to better investigate underlying physical problems.
Lucia Hassen of the Landmarks Preservation Commission staff said that improper cleaning could cause long-term cosmetic and even physical damage, especially with brick, which generally has an outer protective shell. But there is still a wide variety of opinion about what procedures are best with which materials.
Everyone is agreed about one thing: It is cheaper to clean a building as part of a larger project, when sidewalk sheds, scaffolds and workmen are already in place.
For a small building or older elevator apartment house, a competent cleaning generally runs from $5,000 to $50,000. For larger or more complicated projects the cost can be far greater. The cleaning of the Flatiron Building last year cost about $80,000, that of Trinity Church this year ran to more than $750,000 and the cost to clean the Custom House was $600,000, although that also includes repointing.Architects left no care labels for their buildings a century ago, and cleaning a building is a complicated mix of science, craft and business reality. Occasional references in the architectural press before the turn of the century indicated that dirt on facades was an issue of some interest, particularly when coal was still in wide use as a heating fuel. In the 1910's and 20's, trade journals carried ads for companies like the Allied Stone Renovating Company, which showed dramatic pictures of half-cleaned buildings "both by sand blast and our own improved hand process."
Sandblasting, in which sand is sprayed on the building at high pressure, was widely used through the 1960's even though knowledgeable people in the industry recognized that it could irreparably harm brick, terra cotta and even stone. Some companies held out for pure water, misting or lightly spraying it on a building for several days and then following with hand scrubbing or high-pressure water. But because of the cost, they were the exception. Until the 1960's, cleaning buildings was conceived of purely as as maintenance, but with the advent of the preservation movement the merely old became the historic and most of our knowledge about cleaning masonry dates from recent decades.
In present practice there are two reasons given for cleaning a building: to permit careful analysis of the conditions of the facade, and purely for the pleasure of it.
The recent cleaning of the Flatiron Building and of Trinity Church were of the first kind, where concerns about facade conditions made cleaning an integral part of the process. Frank Farinella, the architect for the Flatiron project, says that the cleaning revealed three or four times as much damaged masonry as had been predicted. At Trinity Church, a paraffin coating applied decades ago to protect the brownstone was trapping both dirt and water, damaging the stone as well as hiding cracks.
ON the other hand, the recent cleaning of the limestone facade of the New York Yacht Club, at 47 West 44th Street, was part of an overall effort to get the club into the best possible shape. Cleaning work at the Dakota was undertaken because new light-colored mortar between the bricks produced a bizarre contrast with the darkened brick and stone. Officials there decined to say how much the work cost.
Cleaning a building today is much more complicated than doing the wash.
"It's a question of how you clean, and how much," says Ray Pepi, president of Building Conservation Associates of Manhattan. "In almost every case when a building is cleaned, there is some damage, somewhere, so you naturally seek the most conservative approach."
His company has worked on the cleaning of Carnegie Hall and the Knickerbocker Club and has its own laboratory for analyzing masonry and cleaning materials.
"We test in the lab before touching the building," he says.
A microscope view of a polished cross-section of masonry can actually show the type and location of the dirt.
Typical participants in the cleaning process include a contractor who does the work, often but not always supervised by an architect, engineer and/or conservator. Most major contractors who do exterior masonry work also do cleaning, and typical quoted prices range from $1.75 to $3 a square foot, including window area, for a 10- to 15-story building, which usually measures 10,000 to 30,000 square feet. Because it is more economical to do large buildings, these rates double or triple for rowhouse-size properties.
Speed is money in the construction business but is antithetical to careful cleaning, and it is not hard to find tenement-type properties where the brick has been obviously "burned" by careless application. "A lot of companies will bid the job short and then just do it in one pass," says Vincent Scandole, a principal at Hydro Klean Restoration of Elmont, L.I.
But even more expensive buildings exhibit damage related to cleaning.
On the 1914 Alameda apartment house, at the northwest corner of 84th Street and Broadway, the limestone of the lower floors is covered with surviving brush, drip, swab and other marks left by whatever chemical was applied. The rich subtlety and depth of the limestone, its character as a compressed whorl of tiny sea skeletons, has tragically been lost.
Another problem is that there is no consensus on the appropriateness of the processes. Sandblasting is now widely rejected as too abrasive even by the most commercial contractors. Water cleaning -- with rigs of plastic pipe to keep water flowing over the surface -- is usually, but not always, indicated for marble and limestone. Detergents of various types are often used for brick and terra cotta. Acids are considered by many relatively safe for brick.
But it is easy to find divergent views. Steven Brisk's company, Brisk Waterproofing of Manhattan and Ridgefield, N.J., uses some caustic alkaline cleaners on limestone or marbles, and it used hydrofluoric acid to return the sooty Universty Club to its original pink granite in the mid-1980's. Mr. Brisk also thinks that detergents are generally ineffective.
George Wheeler, a research chemist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art who also works on outside projects, is testing sandblasting on the Tuckahoe marble of the Washington Square arch. Hy Zelcer, an associate at Summit Waterproofing of Long Island City, says he has never even heard of anyone using acid to clean buildings.
It's a bit hard to sort out because even concerns described by others as incompetent tend to use conservation lingo -- like "less aggressive" and "minimum intervention" and promote cleaning products by the industry leader, ProSoCo.
"You can really mess up a building by not knowing the 10 good contractors and the 20 stinky ones," Mr. Wheeler says.
The considerations involved in building cleaning do push the limits of brick-and-mortar contracting into the area of chemical science.
The "dwell time" for chemical cleaners before rinsing can be critical, gauged in minutes, which is difficult for a worker in heavy protective clothing on a high scaffold working on large patches to manage.
IF a building has been painted, the contractor may have to tackle a layer of dirt, a layer of paint and the inner layer of dirt that the paint covered up. Cleaning the surface layer of dirt may expose unseen staining, especially on stone buildings, and the cleaning chemicals -- even water -- may induce other staining.
And chemical reactions change in speed with the temperature (the work at the Flatiron Building was done at night to minimize temperature variation).
Then there are concerns beyond the cleaning itself.
Acids used in cleaning can etch window glass, which is usually protected with a brush-on latex coating. Water used in cleaning or rinsing can penetrate the walls if the pointing is very loose, or even the apartments if the window frames are not tight. Wind gusts can send a mist of chemicals drifting onto neighboring property. (Mr. Brisk recalled that a 10-second gust while cleaning the Woolworth Building in the 1970's did $60,000 worth of damage to cars in a doctors' parking lot.)
Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, said that some acid runoff had collapsed sewer lines and that all runoff -- even pure water -- was prohibited from city street drains. Big-budget jobs often rig up elaborate trap systems for runoff, but most practitioners say the rule is widely ignored.
A larger issue is that, once cleaned, a building will begin to be soiled again, meaning that cleaning is not a one-shot process, but a cyclical one. How many times can glazed terra cotta take chemical cleaning? Such issues are generally addressed only in the most important cleaning jobs, but all contractors note that the "average" work -- say, a cooperative apartment house or a midtown office building -- has pretty much dried up.
One exception is the 15-story cooperative apartment house at 127 West 96th Street, recently cleaned by Summit. The building's engineer, Richard Balser, says he advised against cleaning because the budget was tight and, if loose mortar was discovered, the building's managers might find themselves short of cash. But with a sidewalk shed already in place for extensive roof work, the board felt that cleaning the facade would improve the appearance and also help sales on what is rather a drab block between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues.
According to Ruth Shoenthal, the board's treasurer, the $19,000 cost was spread out over 148 units and there have been no complaints about spending money on esthetics.
"Everybody was thrilled," she said. "The building used to have a very sad affect, but now it tends to glisten in the sun."
Indeed, what had been brickwork of indeterminate color is now revealed as crisp tapestry of olive, maroon, tan and brown.
Buildings like 127 West 96th Street, which has rough, wirecut brick, are often surprisingly different after cleaning because the rough surface of the brick traps substantial dirt.
The heavily soiled red brick and white terra cotta apartment house at 45 East 66th Street, cleaned by Hydro Kleen and supervised by the engineer Vincent Stramandinoli, showed brilliant colors after cleaning.
WITH many red brick buildings the changes are more subtle. The red brick and marble Knickerbocker Club, at 62d Street and Fifth Avenue, was carefully and gently cleaned by Brisk under the supervision of Building Conservation Associates, and the result is exquisitely sophisticated but not obvious. Some smooth, yellow or buff brick buildings, like the San Remo at 73d Street and Central Park West, do not clean particularly well, and brownstone rowhouses are especially problematic because the stone is so fragile and often in bad condition.
When a building goes through such a substantial change, it becomes an essentially new structure. Although it is hard to find anyone to speak against the esthetics of cleaning, the entire process raises questions about what it is we value about old buildings. The Dakota, for instance, does look great, all fresh and new -- but it also looked great when it was craggy and old and dirty. The University Club does look fresh, but its (dirty) charcoal gray exterior did have a venerable, stodgy character -- like an English tailor's top-grade wool.
Anyone making a list of important buildings that cry out for cleaning will find that it's getting shorter and shorter. One favorite is still the sooty, pigeon-spotted First Church of Christ Scientist at 86th and Central Park West, but it is much harder than a decade or so ago to come up with others. The city's major and many minor buildings now present themselves in novel fashion, and ours may come to be viewed as a time when a massive scrub brush swept the city's architecture.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Carnegie Hall;
What's Playing? Maybe a Rousing Business Meeting

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
LOOK who's playing Carnegie Hall. Primerica Inc., the financial services company, held its annual meeting in the main hall in April. Last month TAFA International Inc., an executive search firm, held a dinner for 110 people in the East Room, plus a private concert in the Weill Recital Hall.
Next month -- on Nov. 14 -- the American arm of Credit Suisse, the big Swiss bank, will hold a black-tie dinner for 150 banking clients on the premises, when it sponsors the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra's concert in the hall. It will also offer drinks and coffee during intermission, probably in the venerable Carnegie Cafe. 
 "It will be a pleasure not to worry whether it's going to rain, or if people will linger too long over dinner," said Edgar K. Mitchell, the bank officer who arranged the event.
Bret Silver couldn't have said it better himself. As Carnegie Hall's manager of event sales -- a position created just last year -- Mr. Silver's prime goal is to present Carnegie Hall as not just a cultural institution, but as physical space with cachet.
He and other staff members are taking executives on tours. They are using direct mail, personal letters and followup calls to corporate donors, suggesting they use the 2,804-seat main hall or the 268-seat Weill Recital Hall for product demonstrations.
All told, they want to persuade companies to put Carnegie Hall on the same resource list as any good hotel with a ballroom.
"Too many people still think of us as a concert hall," Mr. Silver said. "I want them to think of us as a full-service venue."
Indeed, over the last couple of years, Carnegie Hall has become just that. It has modernized its elevators, expanded its backstage space and -- perhaps most important for attracting corporate clients -- it has opened lounges and dining rooms.
For the first time, Carnegie Hall can compete with Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library and other larger cultural sites for corporate business. For years, companies have used these places to piggyback on a cultural event (witness the receptions that Philip Morris Companies Inc. and others held at the Museum of Modern Art before the current Matisse exhibit opened to the public) or to soften the business aspect of events by holding them in an environment of class and culture.
Now, Carnegie Hall, which always had the prestige, finally has the catering services and facilities to play that role.
The hall has leased 25,000 square feet on the second and third floors of the office building right next door, the Rockrose Development Corporation's 60-story Carnegie Hall Tower, and broken through the walls between the two buildings on those floors.
Carnegie Hall's new museum, a mahogany-paneled, colorfully carpeted area replete with glass cases displaying the hall's memorabilia, sits in the original building just east of the main auditorium. It opens almost seamlessly into the East Room, a new 1,972-square-foot room in the tower that can accommodate dinners for 200.
The 725-square-foot Club Room, right nearby, is suitable for a cocktail reception. There is a new 176-square-foot lounge on the third floor, next to Weill Recital Hall, that Carnegie Hall's slick new marketing brochure suggests for "executive breakfasts, artist receptions and post-concert events." Restaurant Associates has the exclusive contract for food and beverage service.
Renting the main hall costs from $4,200 for a morning to $8,250 for weekend evenings. Weill Hall can be had for between $400 and $840. A dinner with a top-line menu costs about $150 to $175 a person.
Most of the new amenities were put in to make concert-going more pleasant for patrons. The East Room, for example, was originally opened as a restaurant in January, serving a $45 prix fixe dinner to people with tickets for that night's performance. It did not generate as much interest as the hall had hoped, and was closed. Although it reopened to the public on Sept. 30, with a $24.95 buffet, companies or individuals who want to book it for private parties will get preference.
Some Carnegie Hall loyalists are not entirely comfortable with such commercial priorities. But they concede that the hall is losing some lucrative pop concert bookings to cavernous spaces like the Brendan Byrne arena in the Meadowlands, which can seat 20,000. And the stubborn recession is making fund-raising ever harder.
"It would be stupid to pretend that our marketing isn't an effort to build dollars," Mr. Silver said.
Sanford I. Weill, Primerica's chief executive and Carnegie Hall's chairman, is equally blunt. "It's a damned good idea to market the space," said Mr. Weill. "You can always use the extra funds for education, presentations, or building up the museum."
Mr. Weill and other members of Carnegie Hall's roster of high-powered trustees are throwing their names and Rolodexes behind the marketing effort. Mr. Weill, for whom the Weill Recital Hall is named in honor of his hefty contributions to Carnegie Hall, is sending a letter to other chief executives, suggesting they hold board dinners in the new facilities, then take their directors to a concert.
Christopher W. Roberts, the head of Credit Suisse's United States operations and president of Carnegie Hall's International Club, recently held a dinner for about 35 club members in the East Room, simultaneously feting them and introducing them to the new amenities. The club members are executives from multinational companies who contribute to the hall.
Klaus Jacobs, TAFA International's president and a Carnegie trustee since 1977, just persuaded a European lawyer friend to hold a dinner in the East Room on a night when the hall was dark.
"The facilities are certainly elegant enough and the museum is interesting, so why not generate money for Carnegie Hall on its off nights?" Mr. Jacobs asks.
So far, people who have held simple dinners and receptions say they are pleased. Mr. Jacobs, who treated his guests to a chamber music trio in Weill Recital Hall, recalls a trouble-free night.
But Carnegie Hall may have problems attracting the glitzier, more intricate -- and, by definition, more lucrative -- events that Mr. Silver most wants. The Recital Hall, the most likely venue for such events, has neither the wiring, the space nor the equipment needed to accommodate complex staging. And some would-be event holders complain that the hall charges exorbitantly for stagehand assistance, possibly well above what the union contract forces them to pay.
ON Sept. 14, Grey Advertising Inc. brought 105 of its managing directors from all over the world to a reception in the Club Room, dinner in the East Room, a show in the Weill Recital Hall and champagne and strawberries in the lounge.
Marie Illos, the Grey vice president who arranged the event, remembers it as a "beautiful evening at reasonable cost." But Jonathan Scharer, president of Overland Entertainment Inc., the production company she hired to produce the show, has less charitable memories.
At Ms. Illos's request, he brought an Irving Berlin musical review from Rainbow and Stars, the Rainbow Room's smaller dinner-and-performance space, to Weill Hall that night. Soon after, he received a stagehand bill for $4,300.
"My God, a show like that, with three musicians, four singers, no props but a freestanding drape, anywhere else it would be $1,500 at most," Mr. Scharer said.
In fact, he notes, he recently staged "Side by Side by Sondheim," a more intricate musical review, in the Hotel Macklowe's 303-seat theater. The stagehand bill was under $2,000 and, he said, the lighting was a lot better.
Still, even Mr. Scharer is loath to tell corporate clients to chalk Carnegie Hall off their list of event sites.
"Yes, it's outrageously expensive and badly equipped," he said. "But let's face it -- you say the name Carnegie Hall, and people's faces light up."

ALL MEN A DANCIN'
 An array of male dancers that includes Honi Coles, one of the country's most accomplished tap dancers, and Fernando Bujones, principal dancer with the American Ballet Theater and numerous other companies, will participate in the Connecticut Ballet Theater's "Celebration of Men in Dance," to be held on Saturday at the new Rich Forum Theater in Stamford. 
 Dancer-actress Ann Reinking will serve as master of ceremonies for what is believed to be the first American dance program dedicated to men. The performance is scheduled from 8:30 to 10:30 P.M. and Brett Raphael, artistic director of the Connecticut Ballet Theater, has assembled a remarkable aggregation to fill those two hours.
In addition to Mr. Bujones and Mr. Coles, the roster includes Jack Soto, New York City Ballet; Edward Morgan, Joffrey Ballet; Dudley Williams, Alvin Ailey Dance Theater; Johann Renvall, American Ballet Theater; Bertram Ross, formerly Martha Graham Dance Company; Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo; Jose Limon Dance Company; Pilobolus Dance Theater, and Batou Yetu, African-American dance company from Manhattan. They will be joined by John Wallowitch, songwriter and humorist.
A dance symposium from 3:45 to 5 P.M., open to the public in the Leonhardt Room of the theater, will feature Mr. Bujones, Mel Tomlinson, master dance teacher in Boston, and Francis Mason, dance critic of WQXR radio.
Symposium tickets are $12.50; performance tickets are $28. A combination ticket covering the performance, symposium and dinner at the Radisson Tara Hotel from 5:30 to 8 P.M. is $125. Call 259-6153 or (800) 286-3100 for reservations or more information.
 
APPLE PIE BAKE-OFF
 It's apple pie time again, when museum-quality pies are submitted for judging at the Complete Kitchen in Darien and Greenwich. Each fall the ubiquitous apple is baked into more than 100 entries at the two gourmet shops and judged by professional pastry chefs for quality of ingredients, texture, taste and appearance.
Other fruit or accompaniments may be added, but apples must be the dominant filling. There are no regulations for pie sizes but tiny tarts will not be acceptable.
Candidates must register by Wednesday and submit their pies at 10 A.M. Saturday, either at the Darien store, 863 Post Road, or in Greenwich at 118 Greenwich Avenue. Judging will take place between noon and 2 P.M. Saturday, after which any pies left behind by their creators will be distributed in slices to customers, free of charge.
Call 655-4055 or 869-8384 to register or to obtain more information.
 
FUTURIST ART
 "Dancer on the Beach" by Gino Severini, a painting from the Futurist School that flourished in the early part of this century, will be the subject of a talk by Anne Coffin Hanson, Yale professor emeritus of the history of art, on Tuesday at 5:30 P.M. in the Yale Art Gallery.
Also speaking at that time will be Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Angelica Zander Rudenstine, a scholar of 20th-century art. Both women will offer reminiscences of Lydia Winston Malbin for the opening of the Lydia Winston Malbin Papers, given to the gallery by her children, Sally Winston Robinson, Ernestine Winston Rubin and Harry Winston Jr. The family has also endowed a lecture series in her name, of which this is the inaugural.
Lydia Winston Malbin died in 1989 at the age of 92, after amassing a distinguished collection of Futurist -- in particular, Italian Futurist -- art. She also created a Futurist art archive of artists' letters, photographs, exhibition histories, bibliographic notations, shipping instructions, reviews, essays and undergraduate term papers. It is one of the most complete and meticulous documentations of a collection ever kept.
Admission to the lecture is free. Call 432-0600 for more information. The gallery is at Chapel and York Streets in New Haven.
 
BY COLUMBUS'S SIDE
 The quincentenary of Columbus's voyage to America is being observed at the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport with a new planetarium show called "Columbus Arrives!"
Children will be able to follow the explorer, who thought he was heading for Japan, as he navigates by the star Polaris and the planets and constellations known and visible at the time.
Admission to the shows is free with museum admission of $5.50, $3.50 for children, students and the elderly. Showings are scheduled from Tuesday through Friday at 3:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays at 1 and 3 P.M., until Thanksgiving. Tomorrow, Columbus Day, shows are at 11:30 A.M., 1 and 3 P.M. The museum is at 4450 Park Avenue and the phone number for more information is 372-3521.
 
AMERICAN VIEWS
 The wilderness of America, the technological America of today and the America between the two, are depicted in an exhibition of paintings and photographs on view through Oct. 30 at the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts of Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven.
Lee LeVasseur and Marcello Llorens have presented a variety of impressions on canvas, ranging from two small stowaways bound for early America, to an astronaut collecting moon rocks.
Other paintings, and Mark L. Johnson's photographs, consider such subjects as the ramifications of the Monroe Doctrine and current ecological concerns in the Amazon River region.
Viewing hours are Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. Admission is free, and more information may be obtained by calling 397-4435.
 
TALKING AUTHORS
 In an effort to boost sales in these pinch-penny times many bookstores are attracting customers by offering free lectures by authors of new novels and nonfiction.
The Hickory Stick Bookshop in Washington Depot has embarked on such a course, presenting a talk today from 2 to 4 P.M. by Mathea Falco, author of "The Making of a Drug-Free America: Programs That Work."
The book, to be released Thursday by Times Books-Random House, addresses the failed drug policies of recent years and offers hope by identifying successful programs. A lawyer and a former Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics matters, Ms. Falco is an advocate of reforms.
On Saturday from 3 to 5 P.M., the shop will head in another direction when it presents Georgene Muller Lockwood, author of "Your Victorian Wedding: a Modern Guide for the Romantic Bride."
Ms. Lockwood will reveal such arcane lore as the significance of the stacked wedding cake, and she will offer advice on how to recreate a Victorian wedding and honeymoon economically. To enhance the mood, the shop will serve tea and Victorian tea-time delicacies. Call 868-0525 for more information.

HEADLINE: New District Lines, New Challenges

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
SUZI OPPENHEIMER, the four-term Democratic State Senator from the Sound Shore area, has long taken pride in what she felt was a high level of name recognition in her district. "We took a poll once and found that 56 percent of my constituents said they had actually met me," she said.
This year, redistricting came to Mrs. Oppenheimer, as it must to all incumbents, and like other officeholders, she found that she has to seek out many new voters to solicit their support. An aide to the Senator said that perhaps one-third of the voters in the redesigned 36th Senate District are new to Mrs. Oppenheimer. 
 In the redistricting, which redraws political borders every 10 years to conform to population shifts, Mrs. Oppenheimer lost a solid Democratic bloc in Mount Vernon as well as the Republican village of Eastchester. She absorbed Mount Pleasant and North Castle, which vote Republican, as well as Ossining, which has a slight Democratic edge.
The result, she said, is a district with a 6,000-to-7,000 Democratic edge and a lot of new issues. "I got the General Motors plant in North Tarrytown, scheduled for closure in 1995, and I also find that I represent four prisons, including the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining," she added.
Her challenger, Robert Weininger, is a newcomer to politics. A trial lawyer for 13 years and a Harrison resident for 8, he grew up in Queens, attended the University of Wisconsin and the Washington University School of Law. He said his interest in seeking office followed his being asked last year to represent Philip Marracini, the Republican candidate for Town Supervisor, "in a high-profile First Amendment case."
"The town of Harrison was attempting to enforce a local ordinance against campaign signs," Mr. Weininger said. "We got a restraining order barring the town from enforcing the ordinance against homeowners displaying the challenger's campaign signs." Mr. Marracini lost by 11 votes, but Mr. Weininger was bitten by the political bug.
"A number of people pointed up the need to have fresh blood infused into the political arena," he said. "I adopted their premise, which was that part of the problem we're facing today is that we're leaving our state legislature to a political class."
Mr. Weininger says Mrs. Oppenheimer lacks influence in the State Senate, and he said that one bill she was able to get passed "would have raised New Rochelle's sales tax by 1 percent if it had not been blocked in the Assembly by Ron Tocci," a reference to Ronald C. Tocci, a four-term Democrat from New Rochelle.
"That bill would have killed what remains of New Rochelle's retail trade," Mr. Weininger said, prompting Mrs. Oppenheimer to note that "the Mayor and City Council had begged for this 1 percent addition to the city sales tax, to help pay for police and firefighters. The alternative, raising property taxes, is coming under increasing resistance from homeowners."
On the matter of legislative effectiveness, Mrs. Oppenheimer said she gets all of the "local" bills through, those relating to the county or communities within her district. On larger issues, such as the environment -- protecting habitats for endangered species, for example -- the problem is a "philosophical difference with the Republican leadership; in some cases, rank-and-file Republicans do no better than we Democrats do in getting approval."
 
Disagreement on Public Housing
 Mr. Weininger and Mrs. Oppenheimer disagree sharply over the need for public housing. He has declared in a published statement that "the so-called affordable housing problem is a figment of the imagination of out-of-touch incumbents like Suzi Oppenheimer and of developers like Andrew Cuomo" who, he said, "create problems where none exist and then rush to solve them with government subsidies."
Mr. Weininger was referring to a proposed affordable-housing project in Harrison, backed by members of the Town Board but opposed by some neighborhood groups. He said that during this year's second quarter, 10 percent of 1,382 residential units sold for less than $100,000 and another 25 percent sold for less than $200,000.
Mrs. Oppenheimer said Mr. Weininger "does not address the problem of supply and demand." In Harrison, she said, there are 150 residents of the town on a list to buy 14 proposed units and 54 others residents, all of Harrison, who want to rent another 14 proposed units. The average purchase price, countywide, is $287,000, "and who can afford that?" she said.
Mr. Weininger has Conservative Party support and is also running on the Independent Taxpayers Party. The Right-to-Life candidate is Daniel J. Gough. The Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion has endorsed Mrs. Oppenheimer, saying that while Mr. Weininger favors continuing Medicaid financing for abortions, he also supports mandatory parental involvement.
 
'I'm Sick of Campaigning'
 While Mrs. Oppenheimer is still considered the favorite in her race, despite the apparently reduced support in registration, two other State Senate races in the county appear safer for Republicans, even though one of them is all but certain to mark the end of a 14-year Republican incumbency.
That is in the 37th district, where Assemblyman George E. Pataki beat the seven-term incumbent, Mary B. Goodhue, in a rare Republican primary. Mrs. Goodhue remains on the ballot as the candidate of the Independent Taxpayers Party but has not resumed active campaigning.
"I'm sick of campaigning," she said in response to a question about her intentions, effectively leaving the contest to Mr. Pataki and the Democratic candidate, Marshall S. Belkin, a former North Salem Supervisor. The district, moved north through redistricting, takes in most of the upper tier of Westchester County as well as all of Putnam County, which it had before, while adding six towns in Dutchess County.
Mr. Pataki said he did not find the new district daunting, because his Assembly seat included parts of four counties on both sides of the Hudson River, but he added that he was "taking it seriously because I'm new to a large part of the district -- and because it's a strange political year."
 
Message Remains the Same
 His campaign message, he said, "is the same as it was in the primary: we have to change the direction of this state government by creating a pro-economic growth and pro-business climate and stop taxing people out of their homes and businesses."
He said that "during the primary we targeted our efforts not only at Republicans but at specific Republicans. Now we want to appeal to the broad spectrum of the electorate, saying we have to open up the governmental process and create a pro-opportunity climate."
Mr. Belkin, who was the North Salem Supervisor from 1988 through 1991, said that when he took office "the Town Hall needed repair, there was no fund balance and we were facing three lawsuits. When I left, the Town Hall was to be fully restored by a foundation, we had a half million dollar fund balance and all the lawsuits were settled in principle."
"I considered that I had proved myself a capable manager and problem solver," he said, "and would like to bring those qualities to state problems." He was especially critical of the "closed door" atmosphere of the Republican-controlled Senate, which he said needed reform badly.
 
Abortion-Issue Differences
 Mr. Belkin, who once shared a law partnership with former County Executive Alfred B. DelBello, said that his campaign was financially strapped. "I don't have the $25,000 to do one mailing," he said, "and the Senate Democrats won't provide it."
In the meantime, Mr. Belkin said he was meeting voters "by going to any organization that invites me" and was stressing the need to break through the Senate's conservative agenda. He was also reminding voters that Mr. Pataki's initial goal was the county executive post and that the race for State Senate might be intended as a stepping stone.
Mr. Belkin also said that he and Mr. Pataki differed over the abortion issue. "He keeps saying he's pro-choice, but he favors parental notification and cutting off Medicaid funding for abortion." The Right-to-Life candidate is James J. Hamilton.
The third major Senate race in Westchester pits Nicholas A. Spano, a three-term Yonkers Republican, against Albert L. Menard, an investment banker and a founder of the I.B.M. Westchester Employees Federal Credit Union. Mr. Menard says he had been active as a volunteer in Democratic politics, but this is his first run for elective office.
He has raised the issue of "the Spano empire," a reference to an earlier admission by the Senator's father, County Legislator Leonard N. Spano, that 19 Spano family members are on the county payroll. Mr. Menard said he had no evidence that Senator Spano was similarly involved, but the Senator's failure to condemn, Mr. Menard said, represented condoning the practice. Senator Spano said he had not hired any relatives.
 
Mental Health Also an Issue
 Mr. Menard has criticized Mr. Spano, who is chairman of the Senate Metal Hygiene Committee, for opposing legislation intended to close 22 psychiatric hospitals at a yearly saving of $360 million. Mr. Spano said, "We should close them based on quality of care rather than on a fiscal basis, and in any case not until a community-based system is operational."
Mr. Spano wins his elections by comfortable margins despite figures that show more registered Democrats than Republicans in his district. He said that despite redistricting, which gave Mount Pleasant, a heavy Republican area, to Mrs. Oppenheimer, "we still have 10,000 more Democrats than Republicans." The majority of his constituents are in Yonkers, where registered Democrats often back Republican or Conservative candidates.
On the abortion issue, both candidates favor a woman's right to choose an abortion, Mr. Spano having switched his allegiance a few years ago. Polly Rothstein, president of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, said Mr. Spano "has held to the pro-choice position firmly." The Right-to-Life candidate is Peter J. Toner, who sought unsuccessfully to wrest the Conservative Party endorsement from Mr. Spano in a primary.
Incumbents in two Senate districts located mostly in the Bronx but including parts of Westchester are expected to win re-election. One district is the 33d, where an incumbent Democrat, Joseph L. Galiber, who also has Liberal backing, faces Michael J. Stuart, a Republican, and Maria Small, a Conservative, and Marisa Velez, the Right-to-Life candidate. In the 34th District, the three-term Republican-Conservative incumbent, Guy J. Velella, is opposed by Karen M. Argenti, Democrat-Liberal.
The 34th, which used to include a part of Yonkers in an inverted L-shaped corridor, now includes Pelham, which is strongly Republican, and small areas of New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and Yonkers in a horseshoe-shaped corridor that completely surrounds the southern part of Mount Vernon, now the northern tip of the 33d District.

HEADLINE: The Awakening Chinese Consumer

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, the Yaohan Department Store Company of Japan broke ground for what will be the largest department store in Asia. With almost 20 percent more selling space than even the Macy's at Herald Square, which claims to be the world's largest department store, the 1.3 million-square-foot palace of consumption will be filled with popular brands, from Sony televisions to Chanel perfume and Ritz crackers.
Its location? Not the affluent sprawl of Tokyo, Hong Kong or Singapore, but Shanghai. 
 To the delight of executives who for years had written off this vast market of 1.15 billion consumers as too poor and too closed, China is increasingly looking like one of the most important business opportunities in years. The Communist Government's decade-old experiment with opening its economic system while maintaining a lock on the levers of power has produced a nation of brand-conscious consumers who are snapping up foreign products that were forbidden pleasures a few years ago.
These days foreign brands are as ubiquitous as Mao's little red books were two decades ago. Turn on Chinese television and you are likely to see commercials for Coca-Cola, Tang orange drink, Contac cold capsules and Head and Shoulders shampoo. Atop Shanghai's No. 1 Department Store, the nation's largest retailer and a 45 percent partner in Yaohan's giant new development, is a neon-lit billboard for Ponds facial cream and Vaseline Intensive Care lotion. Display windows show the latest Sanyo laser disk players.
On Shanghai's bustling Nanjing Road, China's answer to Fifth Avenue, Zhao Gu Rong, a salesmen behind a counter full of Sony and Aiwa tape players, said that his shop did carry a few Chinese brands at low prices, but that they were mostly for shoppers from the countryside who did not know any better.
"I admit, I've been very surprised by how much China has changed," said Kazuo Wada, chairman of the company building the giant store, to be called the Next Age Department Store. Mr. Wada, who three years ago considered China a distant afterthought, now also hopes to build 1,000 supermarkets in China by the end of the century. "The official figures do not tell you how strong demand is now," he said. "I had thought this was just in the special economic zones, but it's spreading."
 
Big Investments
 John Frisbie, director of the Beijing office of the United States-China Business Council, a trade group, added: "You're right at the leading edge of a consumer boom. It's real."
Foreign brands started to appear in China in a very limited way after 1978, when Beijing ended the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. The products were sold at first mostly in the free-wheeling south, near Hong Kong, to tourists and others with hard currency. Over time, joint ventures spread, using foreign equipment and inexpensive Chinese labor.
What has changed, a number of foreign and Chinese businessmen said, is that many of these products are now being sold to ordinary Chinese.
Indeed, in what is turning into a banner year for foreign investment -- a fact often obscured by tense relations with the United States -- consumer product companies are advertising aggressively, building distribution networks, placing salesmen around the country, adding product lines and building their first wholly owned plants. The Government is not only allowing foreign retailers to build stores for the first time, it is permitting them to import up to 30 percent of their merchandise.
A major test of whether this progress will gain impetus is the Communist Party congress scheduled to begin tomorrow. Chinese newspapers have been filled the past month with articles suggesting that the economic reforms will be deepened. Price subsidies will be lowered, state-owned industries will receive less aid, bloated state payrolls will be cut, and the financial markets will be expanded, according to the reports.
The Communist Party is also expected to endorse steps giving greater freedom to foreign companies operating in China, particularly in the consumer markets. In what would be an important new step, Tong Yizhong, a senior official in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, was quoted last week in the China Daily as promising that the Government would make it easier to convert the yuan into hard currencies.
Already, foreign companies have been given some freedom to move capital in and out of China. The yuan is not yet fully convertible, but the Government has set up official swap centers where, within limits, foreign companies can buy dollars or other currencies.
"The real limits you face today are the physical distribution capabilities of the system," said Mark Hu, general manager of a joint venture in Shanghai with S. C. Johnson & Son Inc., which makes everything from Raid bug killer to Pledge furniture polish and Maxam shampoo. "There's no real resistance anymore from a regulatory viewpoint."
 
The Down Side
 Even with its promise, China is still a developing country with an economy hobbled by its socialist legacy. Road and rail service is poor. Almost no retailers or wholesalers distribute beyond a single city. Tariffs are high on imports -- more than 100 percent for most consumer goods. Laws are sometimes enforced inconsistently.
There are also many uncertainties. Political storms in a Government in the midst of a transition from its old generation of revolutionary leaders to a younger generation could threaten the economy's openness. And trade disputes continue, as does the continuing chill in China's relations with the West after the brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square three years ago.
The United States and China have been locked in a tough series of trade negotiations that produced threats of a trade war, although a tentative agreement was reached on Friday.
The economy itself is a source of uncertainty, too. When it was overheating in 1988 and the inflation rate shot above 20 percent, the Government clamped down with an austerity plan that reduced all economic activity, including consumer spending.
This year the economy is expected to grow about 12 percent, up from 7 percent growth last year. That is helping sales for the moment, but it has also made some wary about another reversal of policy if inflation soars.
But the growing consumer consciousness in China has clearly brought with it some permanent changes. These shifts say a great deal about the current state of China's unfinished social experiment, about how far the country has come in just the past few years and how far it has yet to go.
 
Appeasing the Masses
 As the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown demonstrated, China's Communist Party is far more willing to let citizens choose what they will wear than to select who will lead them, or the system under which they will live.
In fact, many argue that the opening of the consumer goods market is intended as a way of deferring political reform. By giving consumers a sense that their lives are improving, and giving them a stake in the status quo, they may not be so eager to demand political change.
This is the opposite course taken during the ultimately disastrous attempts at reform in the former Communist bloc nations. The Soviet Union had attempted political reform before economic reform, and the entire system collapsed. People lost patience with a system whose response to consumer needs was goods of poor quality, available only after waiting in long lines.
In China today there are few lines; there is, instead, a bustle, at least at the counters selling foreign-brand goods, as shoppers struggle to spend their large stock of savings and what are thought to be large amounts of unreported income.
Retail sales nationwide rose 13.2 percent in 1991, to the equivalent of $173 billion -- five times the 1978 level, according to the official statistics -- and could grow 15 percent this year. These numbers reflect a vigor that even some Government officials admit has taken them by surprise.
 
The Money to Buy
 These statistics do not include smuggled goods or those sold in the vast gray market, where billions of dollars more in foreign products are said to change hands annually, particularly near the porous border with Hong Kong.
Judging from official figures, foreign brands should be out of reach for the average Chinese. The average annual wage in China is less than $500, with a large gap between rural areas, where most of China's people still live, and urban areas, where the population is a little more than 300 million.
But in both the countryside and cities people have developed numerous means of obtaining extra income. For one, many workers have second jobs or simply trade freely on their own through shops or informal businesses; little of that income is reported. Workers also receive a variety of bonuses that often do not show up in the official statistics. Housing prices are heavily subsidized, meaning a high proportion of people's income is disposable.
When Chinese shoppers go to market now they are armed not only with large amounts of cash, but a highly refined sense of cachet. A hierarchy has developed, in fact, with imported products the most coveted, followed by goods made in China at joint venture factories. A distant third are the home-grown products, which are cheap but generally shoddy and poorly packaged. The foreign-brand goods are from three to eight times as expensive as Chinese products, but that seems hardly to matter.
"I always buy joint venture products if I can afford them because the quality is so much better than the Chinese junk," said Feng Guoye, who was browsing in an electronics shop on Nanjing Road.
 
The Foreign Presence
 For some foreign companies the results of this progress have been impressive. Coca-Cola, for instance, was first imported into China in 1979, but it was available only to tourists or the minuscule number of Chinese with access to foreign currencies. In 1981, the Coca-Cola Company built a plant in Beijing, but it used imported concentrate and had limited distribution. The company built its first wholly owned plant in Shanghai in 1988. That plant makes its own concentrate.
Coca-Cola's soft drinks are now bottled at 13 plants around China and are shipped to many remote areas of the country. China is now the company's second-largest market in Asia, after Japan, and sales are still expanding by more than 20 percent a year.
"The growth has been exponential," said Roualeyn Fenton-May, president of Coca-Cola China Ltd. "China's much more open than most people outside think it is. The barriers were there in the early 1980's but in the last few years no one stopped us from going anywhere."
Johnson & Johnson, which makes baby care products, from shampoo to powder, has just graduated from joint-venture factories to its first wholly owned operation in Shanghai.
Procter & Gamble, after opening its first shampoo plant in the southern city of Guangzhou in 1988, now manufactures goods from Pantene shampoo to Whisper sanitary napkins and Oil of Ulan skin care products (known as Oil of Olay in the United States).
It recently began producing Safeguard soap in a new factory in Beijing. While it had to import most of the raw materials at first, Procter & Gamble is now buying most of those materials locally, lowering its costs.
The retailing business is also starting to open up, with numerous department store and shopping center projects in the groundbreaking or blueprint stage.
Jack So, executive director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, is about to join Sun Hung Kai Properties, the British colony's largest real estate developer. His main project, he said, will be developing shopping centers on the mainland. The company expects to have begun 10 projects within a year.
"As strong as the momentum is, it's still in its infant stages," he said.
Even historically complacent Chinese retailers are setting their sights much higher.
"Not far into the future we believe the automobile will become common in China," said Yang Xingkui, deputy general manager of the Xidan Department Store in Beijing. "It's the next big big opportunity."
 
 
 
DANCING AROUND THE RULES
 There are many lessons to be drawn from those now in the Chinese market. It requires persistence, since most enterprises lose money for several years and take several more to build distribution networks, find reliable sources for parts and materials and build relationships with business partners.
All agreements must be negotiated with great care, because in practice just about every "rule" in China is discretionary. In China, increasingly decentralized during the reform process, taxes to be paid as well as tariffs and duties for imports, must often be negotiated separately for each province. Many foreign companies have a Hong Kong partner to help them navigate the treacherous bureaucracy and to find ways of distributing products.
Many Government rules are also opaque to outsiders, which often means delicate discussions just to figure out what is permissible or where opportunities lie.
"You have to just do things the way you think they should be done and see what happens sometimes," said Melvin Song, head of Dentsu, Young & Rubicam Advertising in Beijing. "If you ask outright the answer is always no."

 
 
OF LOTTERIES, GIVEAWAYS AND THE HARD SELL
 LI FENG XI has seen a lot in his years at the Beijing Department Store in China's capital city, where he is deputy general manager, but never anything like this: The store is giving away three Chinese-brand autos and a minivan to lucky customers who win a drawing. In front of the store, on the city's bustling Wang Fu Jing Street, people line up three deep and gawk at the bright red cars.
"Consumer" has traditionally been a dirty word in Communist China. In a society geared toward producers, consumers took what they were offered, or took nothing. Department stores were gloomy warehouses where clerks plopped poor merchandise on dusty counters -- if they were not too busy chatting.
Not anymore. At a counter at Beijing's Xidan Department Store, whose motto is "We sell cheaper," a fast-talking young woman demonstrated a kitchen tool that sliced, diced and shredded vegetables. Sending shards of carrot and sweet potato flying, she kept up a constant sales patter that mesmerized a small crowd as her assistants pressed the plastic gadgets, selling for the equivalent of 75 cents, into the hands of shoppers.
The hard sell is just one of the new concepts behind China's retail revolution, along with the lotteries and giveaways.
"This is the first time we've done a lottery, but we have to do such things to bring in more customers," Mr. Li said. "Some people criticized us, saying that if your product is good enough you don't need to give anything away. But we believe that these promotions work. We'll be doing more."
"The truth is," he added, "we can't afford to neglect these new techniques."
Indeed, the single most important new concept is competition. Department stores are advertising, renovating and, perhaps most important, putting foreign brand name products in the forefront. One of the first things you confront in large Chinese department stores these days are counters stacked with Head and Shoulders shampoo, Johnson & Johnson baby products and Lux soap, among others.
They are what the Chinese consumer wants. "The producers have to satisfy the consumers now," said Yu Cai Xiang, head of the marketing division at the Ministry of Commerce. "The aim is to invigorate the entire market, and it seems to be working."
Consumption, the Chinese are discovering, does not have to be a chore. "People want to have some fun when they go shopping these days," said Xie Zhen Hua, deputy general manager at the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, China's largest retailer. "Price is not really important. They want style and they are willing to pay for it."

HEADLINE: Software -- Japan's Little Nightmare-in-the-Making

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
As Japan's economy has slumped in the last few months, various industries have successfully appealed for Government subsidies to help them retrain or at least keep paying unneeded workers. The supplicants include smokestack industries like blast furnaces, plywood manufacturers and brick makers. And software developers.
Japan's software industry is in dire straits. Dozens of companies have gone bankrupt this year as corporations have cut computer spending. More than just economic problems are at work, however. There is a growing acknowledgment in the industry and in Government that the industry is badly organized and fundamentally uncompetitive. Japanese companies sell almost no software outside the country. And even in Japan, software is developed by what many consider an outmoded process. 
 The industry's weakness is a glaring vulnerability for Japan. Software is becoming the key to the computer industry -- and many others. It controls the robots in Japan's automated factories, the engines in Toyotas and Hondas and the computer networks that support banks and securities companies.
Rather than developing "packaged" products that can be used by many companies -- like the American Lotus 1-2-3 or Oracle data base management system -- Japanese software companies mainly do customized programming for specific clients. Input, a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif., estimates that less than 20 percent of the software sold in Japan is packaged programs, compared with 60 percent in Europe and 75 percent in the United States.
Customized software can be of very high quality and suit a company's needs better than a general package, but it is also costly and time-consuming to develop. When the recession is over and a new industrial surge demands new software, an overly heavy reliance on customized programming could cause a bottleneck that would slow the growth of Japan's entire economy.
"It's inefficient to develop software each time for different uses," said Hirofumi Katase, deputy director of the information services industry division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "The top priority for MITI is to solve the 'software crisis.' "
Industry executives and Government officials both say that if there is one good thing that will come out of the current slump, it is that corporations, more cost-conscious, will begin turning more to packaged software. But while such a change might be good for Japan in the long run, it will probably be very painful for customized-programming companies. They could face severe contractions and fail to make the switch to packaged software, which is a far riskier business because the market is not guaranteed.
For the last decade, the customized software houses have been growing at 25 percent a year or so and have had to struggle to recruit enough programmers. CSK, one of the largest, spent more than $100 million to build an employee training and recreation center with a pool, hotel, tennis court and even a Shinto shrine. This year, however, there is no growth and companies are said to be cutting back.
In addition, to the extent that Japan turns more toward packaged software it may open its market up even more to American companies. Yuji Ogino, president of the International Data Corporation Japan, a market research firm, estimates that American companies hold about 50 percent of the packaged-software market in Japan. At least 75 American companies have a presence in Japan, with 15 having set up shop in the last year alone, according to the American Electronics Association, which has published a guidebook for software companies looking at Japan.
In some segments, such as data base programs for large computers, American companies like Oracle and Sybase hold nearly all the market, Mr. Ogino said. American companies are also dominant in software for engineering work stations.
For personal computer software, Japan has many of its own suppliers. Nevertheless, Lotus is the leading spreadsheet vendor and Microsoft dominates operating systems. Companies like Wordperfect (in word-processing software) and Novell (in networking software) are making strong gains here. The Japanese companies have yet to prove that they can write software for window-based screen displays or PC networks.
Inevitably, discussions about software in Japan turn to the question of the creative loner (American) who comes up with creative programs versus the team approach (Japanese), which churns out code more quickly and with fewer defects.
Japanese companies seem to acknowledge the need for both. They have been clamoring, for instance, to work with Apple Computer Inc. in creating new handheld information appliances, with Apple providing the software and Japanese firms the hardware.
Japanese companies have so far failed to develop many products that succeed abroad. Part of this is clearly because of language barriers and differences in business practices that make it hard, say, for a Japanese company to develop an accounting program for the United States market. Indeed, video game software, where these barriers are less of a problem, has been the big exception.
The lack of success in packaged software results as much from structural problems in Japan's computer and software industries as from any lack of creativity.
For one thing, packaged software tends to be used more on small machines like the personal computers and work stations now dominant in the United States, while customized software tends to be used more on large computers that still rule in Japan.
Another factor is the lack of standards. In the United States, there are de facto standards for both mainframe computers and personal computers, giving software companies large target markets to shoot at. In Japan, both the mainframe and personal computer markets are more fragmented, with incompatible systems.
Japan also does not generally have the entrepreneurial culture that has spawned American software companies like Microsoft and Lotus. Many of the brightest college graduates prefer secure and prestigious positions at large companies to striking out on their own. And venture capital is much less available here than in the United States.
George Hara, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who works in both Japan and the United States, recalled having difficulty lining up investors for a promising startup company because the company founder had dropped out of college. In the United States, some of the most successful entrepreneurs -- including Microsoft's co-founder, William H. Gates, and Apple's co-founder, Steven Jobs, are college dropouts.
Banks are also reluctant to lend money to software companies because they have little history and no assets like buildings or machinery to offer as collateral.
"It's so difficult to start unless you are the son of a rich family," said Masayoshi Son, president of Softbank, an entrepreneurial company that has become Japan's leading distributor of software. Softbank still celebrates a day each year when it honors those who helped start the company in 1981, including a bank branch manager who practically defied his superiors to give the young company a $750,000 loan.
Japan's Government has tried various approaches to spur the development of a more competitive software industry. There have been several Government-backed projects aimed at software, including the $200 million Sigma project, intended to develop techniques for more efficient software engineering. Separately, there is the privately financed Tron project, with a budget of less than $1 million a year, intended to develop an operating system, the key software controlling a computer. But these are considered to have not helped much.
MITI also has a fund to provide about $275 million in loan guarantees to software companies, to help them qualify for bank loans. With many software companies in dire straits, that program is expected to grow.
An advisory council to MITI is trying to develop new ideas. One is to encourage computer companies to sell software separately, to encourage development of a market and more of an appreciation among corporate users for the value of software alone. Until now, particularly for large computers, computer companies have often thrown in the software virtually free.
For all the problems, many entrepreneurs have started in PC software. The Justsystem Corporation, run by a husband and wife, dominates the market for Japanese word-processing software (see box). Hudson Soft, run by a railroad buff who owns an old Hudson steam locomotive, had revenues of about $310 million in its last year, mainly from video games.
But still, some of Japan's most successful software entrepreneurs publish magazines about software and distribute products made by others rather than develop software.
Perhaps Japan's best-known software entrepreneur is Kazuhiko (Kay) Nishi, who co-founded the Ascii Corporation in 1977 while in college. The company, once Microsoft's distributor in Japan, publishes computer magazines and develops and distributes software. Ascii expanded so rapidly into new businesses that it needed an emergency loan to pay off its debt.
Softbank, the largest distributor, is another success story. Mr. Son, now 35, was born in Japan of Korean heritage and attended high school in the United States. While a student at the University of California at Berkeley, he developed an electronic translator and sold the patents to Sharp for $1 million.
Softbank revenues grew to $354 million in 1991. About half the company's revenues from distribution come from American software, Mr. Son said. Softbank has a joint venture with Novell Inc. to distribute the Utah company's networking software products in Japan. It also has a venture partly owned by Perot Systems that does customized software and consulting.
Electronic Data Systems recently purchased 20 percent of Japan System K.K., a computer-services company that desperately needed capital after its orders collapsed. Some industry executives say that with Japanese companies falling on hard times, more of them will end up in American arms, in a reversal of the usual high-technology acquisition pattern. "It's time," said Tomoo Takahara, chairman of the Japan Information Service Industry Association, "for American companies to purchase Japanese companies."
 
 
 
A FULL AGENDA FOR JUSTSYSTEM
 TOKYO
Had they lived in Silicon Valley, Kazunori and Hatsuko Ukigawa might have set up shop in a garage. But with big garages not common in Japan, the husband-and-wife team used the guest room at her parents' house.
Now, their Justsystem Corporation has become Japan's leading supplier of personal computer word-processing software and a rare entrepreneurial success story. The company's program, Ichitaro, commands at least 60 percent of the market and is the first software purchase for many PC buyers.
The Ukigawas met at college, where both were in the amateur radio club. Soon they were sitting together in engineering classes. In 1979, in the guest room, Justsystems was born as a dealer of Toshiba office computers. But a big obstacle to computer sales at the time was the difficulty of entering the Japanese language, with its thousands of complex characters, into a computer. By the early 1980's, computer makers had begun to develop systems that allowed users to type with English letters or with the Japanese phonetic alphabet, and have the computer automatically change the text into the more traditional Chinese character.
Justsystem, still with only five employees, began working on word-processing software in 1982. Its first program appeared in 1983 and Ichitaro, named after a student Mr. Ukigawa had tutored who had died suddenly, appeared in 1985.
The privately held company, in rural Tokushima on Shikoku Island -- Mr. Ukigawa is president and Mrs. Ukigawa is executive director in charge of technology development -- has sold more than a million copies of Ichitaro and had revenues of $74 million, in its last fiscal year. It has moved into graphics and desktop publishing software.
Sales this year will probably be flat for the second year, in part because a weak economy has hurt the PC market. Also, competitive products, including Japanese versions of Wordperfect and Microsoft Word, are moving onto Ichitaro's turf. Finally, Justsystem must develop software for PC networks and for window-based operating systems like the Apple Macintosh. The Ukigawas have a full agenda.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Clinton Win: Good for Stocks, Bad for Bonds?

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse

 BODY:
The WORD on the Street is that a victory by Gov. Bill Clinton would be good for stocks and bad for bonds. If he wins, as current polls indicate is likely, Mr. Clinton is expected in his first hundred days as President to take a muscular, Franklin Roosevelt-like approach to the slump. Many people bet he would push through a fiscal stimulus program to shake some life back into the economy. By showing he means business about the economy, he might help revive consumer and investor confidence. Mr. Clinton would also no doubt use his Presidential pulpit to tell how his huge public investment program will build a more prosperous America.
All this would in theory spur growth, which, says Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston, could cause a stock market rally because "one would expect that corporate profits would be enhanced." A public investment program would mean more spending on highways, railroads, airports and telecommunications and would probably be a boon for construction, electronics and transportation-equipment companies. 
 Bonds would probably be a different story.Bond buyers tend to act as if they were allergic to prosperity. They may fret that faster growth will increase inflation, that fiscal stimulus will raise the budget deficit. "Should there be a major short-term fiscal stimulus package, the bond market would act adversely," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist for CRT Government Securities. "Such a plan would show fiscal irresponsibility."
Robert M. Solow, a Clinton supporter and a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachussets Institute of Technology, said bond buyers might not be reflexively negative. "The notion that the day Clinton takes office the bond market wets its pants does not suggest the appropriate degree of maturity" for bond holders, he said.
Some experts say stocks and bonds might not react much to a Clinton victory, suggesting that financial markets have already discounted this possibility.
The Federal Reserve's reaction to a fiscal stimulus program could cushion any downturn in the bond market. If the Fed concludes that pump-priming will push up prices, it could raise short-term rates to fight inflationary pressures, allaying bond buyers' fears.
The debate over the Fed's response to a Clinton victory has produced another over what the dollar will do. Some economists predict it will fall if Mr. Clinton wins, because investors might conclude his policies will push up inflation and the deficit. Speculators might also quickly attack the dollar to test his will to defend it.
On the other hand, a Clinton triumph could help the dollar, because faster growth and a rising stock market could attract foreign investment. If the Fed raises rates, that could also prop up the dollar.
But don't assume a rate increase on Inauguration Day: The Fed might want some signs of robust recovery before it takes that unpopular move. Besides, Mr. Soss says, "we might be in a period where inflation is difficult to generate."

THE ECONOMY
 
The Nafta Bandwagon Rolls Toward Congress 

The occasion was rich with pomp. President Bush, with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, looked on as negotiators for the three nations initialed the North American Free Trade Pact in San Antonio last week. The pact must be approved by Congress before it takes effect, but that appears increasingly likely. Leaders of 100 of the largest American companies endorsed the pact last week, and so did Gov. Bill Clinton, with some caveats. He would send the treaty to Congress, he said, but with "parallel agreements dealing with the environment, dealing with labor standards" and with initiatives for retraining American workers and reinvesting in American communities. President Bush was not impressed with Mr. Clinton's endorsement. "Governor Clinton looked at the polls one more time and came out for Nafta," he said.
 
Read His Lips, This Time
 
 The new tax measure, which got final approval from the Senate last week, was apparently born to die. The measure contains some provisions that President Bush likes, including tax breaks for enterprise zones in America's inner cities among cuts totaling $27 billion. But it keeps those cuts from adding to the Federal deficit by increasing taxes in dozens of ways. And that, as Congress well knew, runs smack into the President's latest promise about no new taxes. When the bill finally arrives on the President's desk, it will be vetoed, the White House said.
 
F.D.A. Charges for Approval
 
Americans have been paying fees to take their drivers' license tests for years. But until last week, when the Senate approved a new plan, the nation's pharmaceutical companies had their drugs tested for safety by the Food and Drug Administration with the taxpayer footing the bill. No more. The new bill authorizes the F.D.A. to collect about $300 million from drug companies over the next five years. The F.D.A. will use the money to hire 600 new inspectors who will cut in half the time it takes to approve -- or reject -- new drugs. The process should take six months for the most important drugs and 12 months for the rest. Without the new plan and inspectors, "the time it would take to approve new drugs would increase dramatically," said Dr. David Kessler, Commissioner of the F.D.A.
 
Chain Store Sales Perk Up
 
A little good news -- finally -- for the nation's troubled merchants. Retail sales at the nation's chain stores last month showed their strongest gains of the year. According to PaineWebber's index of 20 large chains, sales increased 7 percent in September after gaining 4.5 percent the month before. Department and specialty stores did especially well -- Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates Abraham & Straus, Bloomingdale's and Lazarus, showed sales gains of 6.6 percent. Gap Inc., had sales increases of 11 percent while Sears Roebuck & Company reported strong sales of electronic goods. But analysts warned it still is not time to uncork the champagne. "You have to look at the two months combined," said Jeffrey Feiner, a retailing analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "When you do that, you're basically talking about a consumer who is extremely price conscious and still watching their dollars very carefully."
 
Pay-Per-Listen?
 
The Federal Communications Commission proposed last week to assign a block of frequencies to satellites to broadcast digital radio signals to homes and cars. With digital technology, satellites could transmit static-free, compact-disk-quality sound. Listeners could tune in even if they were nowhere near a town. But local broadcasters worry that the satellite sound may take business away from their terrestrial transmitters."What we've got here is the beginning of a new consumer electronics market segment," said Martin Rothblatt, founder and chairman of Satellite CD Radio Inc. But Mr. Rothblatt isn't interested in taking advertising revenue away from earth. His company is proposing to sell its space sounds on 30 or so channels to subscribers with the right equipment for $5 to $10 a month.
 
600 Economists for Clinton
 
Generally, if you have 600 economists, you have 600 different opinions. But last week, 600 of them -- including nine Nobel Prize winners -- agreed on endorsing Gov. Bill Clinton's economic program. The plan calls for tax cuts for the middle class, tax increases on upper-income Americans and reduces military spending by $40 billion more than President Bush's plan. And while Ross Perot plans shock therapy to slash the deficit, Mr. Clinton would "gradually reduce it," said James Tobin, a Nobel Prize winner favoring Mr. Clinton.
 
Perot's Infomercial
 
By any standards, it was a risky approach. While the other Presidential candidates were blanketing the airwaves with 30-second spots, Ross Perot was spending $380,000 out of his own pocket to give the nation a 30-minute lesson in economics. He then spent another $620,000 to rerun the program. The ad featured Mr. Perot with dozens of flip charts showing everything from the increase in the national debt to a comparison of gasoline prices around the world. The program had the highest rating in its time slot. With 11.4 million people tuned in the first time, it was the largest economics class ever held.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Germany's Inflation
 
The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, threw the world's currency markets into a tizzy by keeping interest rates high. Those rates were necessary to keep inflation low while Germany absorbed its eastern half. But last week Germany's Federal Statistics office said that the cost of living rose only 0.3 percent in September and 0.2 percent in August. That puts German inflation at about 3.5 percent for the year. While holding firm on the discount rate -- to keep its no-nonsense reputation -- the Bundesbank has been letting the money supply expand so market interest rates would fall. That strategy is working. Money market rates dropped nearly one percentage point to about 9 percent in a month. "German interest rates have fallen considerably and I expect them to come down further," said Ulrich Hombrecher, chief economist at Westdeutsche Landesbank Birozentrale in Dusseldorf

Yeltsin Locks Out Gorbachev
 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, former President of the former Soviet Union, has been feuding with his one-time friend and successor, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. His criticism of Mr. Yeltsin's reforms and the breakdown in order caused Mr. Yeltsin to take away Mr. Gorbachev's limousine privileges earlier this year. Last week the feud reignited when Mr. Gorbachev said Mr. Yeltsin "is clearly not coping with his duties," and that the country should be run by a state council. Mr. Yeltsin countered with the seizure of the offices of Mr. Gorbachev's privately funded International Foundation for Socioeconomic and Political Research. He had the doors locked and transferred the premises to an academy that trains bankers.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Not Just Looks, An Engine, Too
 
Car enthusiasts often moaned that Detroit's highest-priced metal has been long on looks and short on engines and drive trains, especially when compared with their German and Japanese rivals. "We see interesting cars and say, 'It's a shame they don't have an engine,' " said David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine. That's beginning to change. Last week, the Ford Motor Company rolled its first Lincoln Mark VIII coupe off the line powered by a sophisticated 32-valve, 280-horsepower V-8 engine wedded to an electronic transmission. The Mark VIII goes on sale Dec. 26, and will be priced at about $38,000 -- right in the middle of Lexus, Infiniti and B.M.W. country. But Ford is not the only American car offering an "engine" this year. The General Motors Corporation has also gone high-tech for 1993, with its muscular 32-valve V-8 Northstar engine.

G.M. may be building engines that blend world-class technology with American levels of testosterone, but it does it less efficiently than its rivals. According to a study released last week by Harbour Associates of Troy, Mich., a manufacturing consulting firm, it took G.M. 4.55 workers per vehicle of output per day versus 3.76 for Chrysler and 3.01 for Ford. The study estimated Ford's labor cost per vehicle at $1,563 compared with $2,358 for G.M. The weakness at G.M. is its duplicative management while Ford's strength is its "tough, centralized management," said James Harbour, the study's author.
 
Toning Down the Rap
 
Warner Brothers Records, and its parent, Time Warner Inc., caught a lot of flak for releasing the "Cop Killer" song by rapper Ice-T. That experience -- replete with death threats, protests, speeches at the company's annual meeting and mentions in the Presidential campaign -- made Warner Brothers and the other record labels more cautious about the tracks they put down on their albums and EP's. Last week Billboard magazine reported that several companies in the $400 million rap market -- A&M Records, Warners Brothers and MCA Records -- dropped plans to distribute songs or asked artists to tone down their lyrics, if not exactly to Tipper Gore standards then at least to a less violent pitch. The music business "is under a microscope," said Bob Merlis, a spokesman for Warner Brothers.

Schwinn in Chapter 11
 
When baby boomers were tooling around on their streamer-laden, balloon-tire bikes in the 1950's and 60's, they were probably riding a Schwinn. The Schwinn Bicycle Company in Chicago had as much as 28 percent of the market. But when Americans went 10-speed, they left their Schwinns behind. Last week, with only 8 percent of the market, the 97-year-old family-owned company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. Schwinn, which had revenues of $195 million last year, has outstanding debts of $80 million. The company said the filing will give it time to reorganize and bring out a snazzy new line of bikes. Will Schwinn get its balance back? "They will be all right," said Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling magazine. "They have the best retail distribution system in the business."

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
A Little Gore Before Dinner

BYLINE: By Bob Morris

 BODY:
IT was as if they had been lured into a Venus Fly Trap.
Tatum O'Neal, who's been buzzing around the uptown gala circuit recently, arrived with a friend at the Whitney Museum Gala on Monday night. Before heading upstairs for cocktails and dinner, they took a quick tour around an exhibit of disturbing, lurid, biomorphic drawings by the surrealist Alfonso Ossorio, which were on display in the gallery adjacent to the lobby. 
 "His fingers are tearing at his own heart," said Ms. O'Neal, who was transfixed by a watercolor called "Scavenger Heart."
"Those yellow eyes scare me," her friend said. She told him not to take it so personally, and they moved on to another picture of two cracked faces surrounded by claws, fetuses and skulls. "It's like Dorian Gray," Ms. O'Neal mused.
"This one's like Zap comics," her friend said, studying a heap of rotting flesh and agonized faces.
"Oh come on," she said. "It's a lot better than that."
But by the time they got around to the last few images, Ms. O'Neal was acting less like the mother of three children and more like the child she won an Oscar for playing in "Paper Moon."
"This is really scary," she said twice, as she recoiled from the writhing masses of limbs, heads and blood, then swept out of the gallery.
Only a few of the other late arrivals bothered to stop and look at the exhibit before going upstairs. Amanda Burden, in a simple black gown with a yellow flourish, passed through the gallery like a lunar eclipse with good taste. Joan Rivers, in black velvet and pearls, took a quick peak, too.
"Interesting, provocative, but not for my bedroom," she said. "And not for my Christmas cards either."
Mary McFadden, who arrived at the party late, said she was a fan of Mr. Ossorio's work. "He's out of his mind," the designer said. "That's why he's great. I had one of his pictures, but it was so mad I couldn't live with it anymore."
Wrapped in an ingenious pleated gown she called a Greek column and with her pale face blasted with white powder, she seemed to know what she was talking about.
 
Ladies, Start Your Engines!
 Hardcore headache music filled the Polish National Home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, on Oct. 2. On that Friday night, under Sunoco racing flags and a disco ball, the social club's earnest members were serving Zywiec beer and kielbasa sandwiches to a crowd of rebellious locals and mild-mannered greasers who were waiting for "Wildgirl's Go-Go-Rama" to begin.
Wildgirl is the name Ericka Peterson uses when she is the host of her show on the alternative radio station WFMU (91.1), and her Go-Go-Rama -- which she promotes as a "wild rock 'n' roll party with no less than 30 fabulous go-go babes" -- is a chance for women she knows to dance like Dionysian Maenads in front of an audience.
Ms. Peterson, who has the lean plain looks of the girl in your homeroom who once got suspended for smoking in the bathroom, also has an M.F.A. in sculpture from New York University and supports herself as a ceramist. Her show, which is broadcast on Saturdays from 6 to 9 P.M. and has been reviewed in Speed Kills magazine, is devoted to hot-rod-inspired music and auto-racing reports.
"Everyone in racing wants to go 300 miles an hour and live on the edge," said Ms. Peterson, who was the embodiment of "gearhead" culture on Friday, with an STP key chain on the front of her jeans and a National Hot Rod Association cap on her head. She chewed gum with a cigarette dangling from her mouth and autographed a shirt. "To Mitch -- Rock on," she wrote.
"I like it because the car is the great equalizer," she said. "I can race a car as well as any man, and I even know a nice 77-year-old grandmother from North Carolina who's a superstick champion. Her 60-year-old son is her crew chief. Then there's an entire genre of music based on the hot rod: all that early 60's stuff with revving engines and screeching tires from Jan and Dean to the Devil Dragster, anything loud and fast that rocks your socks."
Later, when the song "Wild Thing" came on, Ms. Peterson, who had undergone a total visual transformation, stepped onto the stage. Surrounded by women who were trying to look provocative while dancing to a relentless bludgeoning of hard-core rock, Ms. Peterson, in black cat suit, dangling earrings, spike-heeled boots and teased hair -- resembling the young Ann-Margret -- danced with more conviction and poise than anyone else on stage.
Like actors who become politicians and socialites playing Broadway, Ms. Peterson was simply, to invoke some new-age jargon in a heavy-metal situation, following her bliss.
 
Feeling Lucky
 If luck were a lady and she shopped on Rodeo Drive, she would probably look a lot like Jacqueline Stallone, who was lending her support last Sunday night to the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS casino benefit at the Sheraton New York. She wore a glittering jacket, a layer of makeup so thick it almost hid the stunning Roman face that launched Rocky and Rambo, and a necklace laden with history.
"These pearls were sold to me by Ann Hamilton," she said. "She got them from Imelda Marcos."
An astrologer who doesn't gamble, Mrs. Stallone is more concerned with the sweeping machinations of destiny than with the mere vagaries of luck. As she walked around the room with a psychic friend and a cocktail, predictions were spinning out of her like food from a lidless Cuisinart.
If luck were a younger lady, she might look like the pop singer Debbie Gibson. Wearing a silver lame jacket and a dusting of makeup, Ms. Gibson was dealing blackjack to a group of inexperienced gamblers, including Kevin Wright, her boyfriend, a blond teen-heartthrob whom she met while they were both in "Les Miserables," and Cameron Mackintosh, the boyish British megamusical producer, who is responsible for "Cats," "Les Miserables," "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Miss Saigon."
"Hit me, Deb," said Mr. Mackintosh, whose slightly pudgy hands were folded in front of him on the green felt table. "Oh, God," he said with a disappointed sigh.
"I don't make the cards, I just deal them," Ms. Gibson told him, as she dealt a winning hand to Mr. Wright, who's currently unemployed.
A woman dressed as a jockey approached the table to take bets on the last video horse race of the evening, and Mr. Mackintosh placed $10 on a horse named Cameron's World. "I know where my bread's buttered," he said, putting two racing stubs next to some chips that, like the musicals he has in production all over the world, were starting to accrue, in a little pile under his nose.
His horse didn't win, but by the end of the evening, Mr. Mackintosh's pile of chips had become as unwieldy as the swinging chandelier in "Phantom." Ms. Gibson had to explain to him what playing "double or nothing" entailed before dealing him cards for the four hands he had going at once. "I never knew ignorance could be so profitable," he said.
After the game broke up, Ms. Gibson, who still lives on Long Island, where she grew up, was signing an autograph for a fan who told her he was also from Long Island.
"We use to be famous for you," he said. "Now we're famous for Amy Fisher."

"No Painless Way Out for the Next President," (Week in Review, Oct. 4), states that Ross Perot has "put forth a detailed, generally plausible plan for balancing the budget." This rosy characterization of Mr. Perot's deficit reduction program reflects the conventional wisdom. 
 I wonder if anyone has read "United We Stand," Mr. Perot's book, where he claims he will save $754 billion through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. This figure is a monster of an exaggeration.
Of the $754 billion, $141 billion (19 percent) comes from reductions in health care costs for Medicare and Medicaid patients (page 48). How does Mr. Perot plan to cut health care costs? His book says only that "a cost containment and prevention program should be developed immediately" (page 89). He has no plan, though he knows that the plan he doesn't have will save $141 billion!
Then, not all of the $754 billion will be used to reduce the deficit. Mr. Perot's book describes deficit reduction as "our first priority" (page 35). But while he says that the $754 billion "will not be allowed to fall into the black hole of government" (page 56), there is an interesting caveat. "Except for the tax revenues committed to special purposes, it" -- the $754 billion -- "will go to the American people to invest and save."
The gas tax revenues, which total $158 billion (21 percent of the $754 billion) are devoted to the "special purpose" of building infrastructure (page 48). Contrary to you and to the popular perception, Mr. Perot's gas taxes have nothing to do with deficit reduction. The revenues raised will be spent, not saved.
It is also possible that, by slowing growth even further, Mr. Perot's deficit reduction plan would be to some considerable extent self-defeating. Most economists think tax increases and spending reductions risk worsening a stagnant economy. With even slower growth, tax revenues would decline due to lower incomes, and government expenditures would increase due to antipoverty programs, such as unemployment insurance, food stamps and Medicaid.
The $754 billion figure Mr. Perot promises in Chapter 3 does not account for the tax cuts and spending increases he proposes in other chapters to achieve goals other than deficit reduction. To foster economic growth, his book proposes numerous tax incentives and increased Federal spending for research and development (pages 59, 65, 66, 69, 71).
He also favors universal health care coverage (page 90), Federal funds for abortions (page 94), increased prison time for various offenses (page 86), increased drug treatment (page 85), tax incentives for urban enterprise (page 82) and more funds for preschool programs such as Head Start (page 78).
All of these proposals would obviously reduce tax revenues and increase spending. Yet Mr. Perot does not estimate any of these costs; much less does he factor them into his budget calculations.
In light of these huge gaps, the conventional wisdom that Mr. Perot presents a detailed, plausible deficit reduction program is quite wrong. Mr. Perot, it turns out, is no different from the stereotype politician from whom he tries to distance himself. He, too, promises that we can have our cake and eat it too. We can balance the budget and have everything else we want: economic growth, universal health care, better schools, and safer streets.

Of Optometrists And Ophthalmologists

 BODY:
The article "Optometrist vs. Ophthalmologist: Trading Barbs and Lawsuits" (Sept. 13) refers to "optometrists, who do not have medical degrees," and "ophthalmologists, who do." Optometrists may not have medical degrees, but they do have medical training.
These young people are given courses and training under qualified doctors, medical and optometric, in pathology that covers the gamut of physical diseases as well as clinical training in examining and diagnosing symptoms, because many show up in the human eye before the body sends out signals. They have four years of intensive study of the eyes, in contrast to four years of medical school that professes to diagnose, treat and operate on every organ in the body. 
 Optometrists must pass rigid tests and are required to attend annual conferences to keep abreast of new developments in medical as well as optometric practices. They have enjoyed fine relationships and referrals with ethical opthalmologists who see these two professions linked, supportive and beneficial to patients.
It seems to me that with optometrists so highly trained today, there are fear tactics involved in the ophthalmologists' prohibitions and limitations. That fear, evidently economic because there is no question raised about ethics, translates to less concern for the patient who can get prompt attention, diagnosis, care -- and referrals if necessary for surgery -- to more concern about monetary infringement.
I am the mother of a highly qualified and respected optometrist.

How Bush Lost Five Chances to Seize the Day

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE final act of a Presidential campaign brings its own brutal simplicity. The handlers, the strategists, the subplots recede. The polls acquire a sudden clarity. The televised debates, which begin tonight, are the candidates' last best chance to affirm the voters' judgment, or to shake it.
Republicans have difficulty believing that it has come to this: A Republican President, under siege even in Texas and the Deep South, regions that once seemed congenitally Republican; a President struggling to push his approval rating above 40 percent just 18 months after he seemed so unassailable that most of the best and brightest Democrats never ventured into the field. 
 The debates, it is almost universally assumed, are Mr. Bush's last opportunity to save his Presidency. But five times before Mr. Bush has had such an opportunity, and five times he has missed it by failing to connect with a country consumed by an ailing economy and the problems at home. As the campaign nears its end, these missed chances haunt his party, and help explain why Mr. Bush is still trying to persuade the voters that he has a plan and a passion for a second term.
March 1991: It would be hard to exaggerate Mr. Bush's political dominance in March 1991 after the end of the Persian Gulf war. His approval rating stood at 88 percent, tied with the high set by Harry S. Truman in June 1945 after the surrender of Germany.
But even when the afterglow of the gulf war was at its warmest, there were warnings that the country was looking inward and not liking what it found. Many Republicans urged the President to spend some of his political capital on an aggressive new domestic agenda; never had the Democrats, on Capitol Hill and beyond, seemed so cowed by George Bush.
But the war, some Republicans now say, gave the White House a dangerous sense of security. "It bought us a year of complacency," said a Republican close to the White House, who insisted on anonymity. "In a funny way, the gulf war perpetuated the illusion that we didn't have to do much to win, that we could coast to victory."
The victory speech that Mr. Bush delivered to a joint session of Congress on March 6, 1991, was joyous, emotional, a patriotic celebration filled with stirring vignettes and deep national pride. But the country was already moving beyond it, and Mr. Bush did not keep pace.
November 1991: By fall, there was little subtlety to the public mood: Mr. Bush's popularity had dropped 16 points in a single month as the economy continued to falter. In Pennsylvania, Harris Wofford defeated former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a Senate race that centered on the economic concerns of the middle class, including health care; the strategist of that Democratic campaign was James Carville, who quickly signed on with Gov. Bill Clinton's campaign for the Presidency. "If they'd missed everything before that, the Thornburgh race should have been a good indicator," said a Republican strategist, who also spoke on condition that he not be identified.
Again, many Republicans pleaded with the White House to do something, to put the full power of the Presidency behind an economic recovery plan, even to call Congress back into special session. Many of the Administration's spokesmen continued to insist that the economy was on the mend. But that only stoked the emerging Democratic criticism that the Bush Presidency was out of touch, focused on issues abroad at a time of crisis at home.
Within a month, John H. Sununu was gone as White House chief of staff, one sign of Presidential alarm. But Mr. Bush chose to wait another month before outlining his new domestic proposals.
January 1992: It was a costly wait. By late January, the President's approval rating in public opinion surveys had dropped well below 50 percent, half of what it had been just 10 months before. There was no mystery to this free fall. More than eight out of 10 Americans rated the economy as "fairly bad" or "very bad," according to the New York Times/CBS News Poll. The case against Mr. Bush was now being made not only by the Democratic contenders, but by Patrick J. Buchanan, mounting a troublesome challenge in the New Hampshire Republican primary.
Weeks of buildup preceded Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message; it was billed as the kickoff to his re-election campaign, his vision for an ailing economy. When he took the stage to deliver the address, he acknowledged that it was time to "look homeward."
But the domestic proposals he outlined were largely incremental, or measures he had advanced unsuccessfully in the past, like a cut in the tax on capital gains, or measures he only lightly defined, like his health care plan. It did not match the moment.
March 1992: A window opened again in March, when the Democrats were tangled in a series of bloody primaries and Mr. Clinton was struggling with the murky image he had acquired from the controversies over his draft history and reports of infidelity.
Mr. Bush had the opportunity to regain control of the political debate and to highlight the contrast between his Presidential stature and the squabbling of the Democrats. In fact he delivered a major speech on March 20, outlining a "reform agenda" and taking a tough new line with Congress. But many Republicans say he simply did not follow through. It was H. Ross Perot, with his blunt promise to simultaneously shake up Washington and steady the economy, who captured the public's imagination in the spring of 1992.
August 1992: By August, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was returning to the White House to grapple with campaign and policy problems, and Republicans comforted themselves with the hope that Mr. Bush would use the invaluable forum of the national convention to make a strong case for a second term. When Republicans look back on the Houston convention today, many speak of it in the angry, mournful tones that Democrats used to describe Michael S. Dukakis's meandering tour through Massachusetts in late August 1988 while his lead slipped away.
The convention became known not for its economic prescriptions, but for its nightly appeals to "family values," delivered by such tribunes of the right as Mr. Buchanan and the Rev. Pat Robertson.
Representative Jim Leach, a centrist Republican from Iowa, said, "By background and by demeanor, George Bush is the candidate of the center, of the professional American, and the convention defined his campaign and therefore the ticket as out of touch, cornered, special-purpose candidates."
A conservative Republican, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said, "For all the talk about how bad the family-values stuff was, the only reason it assumed such prominence was because Bush's speech didn't."
Like many in his party, Peter Hart, a Democratic poll-taker, says that these missed opportunities have a common theme: "This is a person who never had a feel or a touch for domestic policy. He never exhibited it in the 20 years preceding his becoming President, and he didn't exhibit it in the four years of his Presidency."
Under the Democratic analysis, Mr. Bush has a fatal flaw for recessionary times; his inability to chart a bold course in domestic policy is bound to destroy him. The "vision thing" that Republicans scoffed at in their glory days of 1988, when the economy was still healthy and the public mood still fairly content, has now become their nightmare.
Mr. Clinton has run his campaign on this premise. From the beginning, he has presented himself as the man with a plan for economic recovery, the man with a three-point program for every unfulfilled need. His campaign is the mirror image of Mr. Bush's: Mr. Clinton will not stop talking about the economy.
The Republicans still hope to win this race. They have their strategems for rattling Mr. Clinton in the first debate, pressing the attack throughout the week, raising doubts and moving the polls. But they are anguished when they talk of the time that was lost, and the stumbling that brought them to this.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Clinton Economists Cast A Wide Net, for Liberals

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
TO judge by the polls, Bill Clinton's economic advisers have been far more successful than their 1980's Democratic counterparts in finding campaign themes fit for a majority party. The Clinton economic package dodges the questions that divide generations, while dishing up a stew of policies -- everything from national health insurance to college loans -- that is apparently palatable to sometime Republicans hungering for economic security.
But a Clinton victory would sorely test whether the idea makers who have smoothed the candidate's path can serve him equally well in the White House. "The stuff of campaigns is different than the stuff of governing," said Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist. 
 That does not worry Clinton partisans very much, though, for in their view the Arkansas Governor would likely be a more sophisticated consumer of policy advice than any President since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Indeed, the best guess now is that a President Clinton would follow the F.D.R. model of keeping economic advisers of widely varying persuasions at arms' length, picking and choosing ideas to suit the needs of the moment.
The people who have reportedly had the most influence in shaping Mr. Clinton's campaign economics are a colorful lot, a far cry from the pipe-smoking, tweed jacket types who largely shaped Democratic economics from Kennedy to Dukakis.
Ira Magaziner has dabbled in everything from urban self-help projects to university curriculum reform and made millions along the way as a consultant to the Fortune 500. Robert Reich, a lawyer and professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, writes best sellers about the global economy. Derek Shearer, a professor of urban studies at Occidental College in California, helped bring rent control -- and radical chic -- to Santa Monica in the 1980's. Robert Shapiro is vice president of a Washington research group that specializes in developing centrist policies for Democrats with suburban constituencies.
But by almost everyone's reckoning, they have done the job well. Consider Mr. Reich's contribution, the campaign's focus on education. Mr. Reich supports free trade because it is inevitable, and he generally opposes economic regulation because it undermines growth. But he removes the sting from this un-liberal message by pressing programs to save those at greatest risk in a rapidly changing economy. Under the Clinton plan, employers would have tax incentives to retrain workers.
Or take the Magaziner-inspired emphasis on public investment in infrastructure. It appeals to traditional Democrats, who see it as a jobs program for construction workers, a conversion program for defense workers and a shot in the arm for cities. But Mr. Magaziner's enthusiasm for high technology -- from levitating trains to fiber-optic information pipelines -- makes it an easy sell in Silicon Valley.
Then there is the compromise on the budget deficit, which bears the fingerprints of Robert Shapiro. A call for a balanced budget would have undermined Mr. Clinton's plans for spending-led growth, and might also have forced him to specify whose cherished programs would be trimmed. But a charge into deficit finance would have raised inflation alarms and panicked Wall Street.
 
Avoiding Sacrifices
 The Clinton third way, reluctant toleration of the deficit in the near term combined with new taxes on the rich and a shift in spending priorities from consumption to investment, avoids the need to call for sacrifice while still making a gesture to people who shudder at the mention of the $4 trillion debt. "The best one can hope for," concludes Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, "is a balance of deficit reduction and policies aimed at productivity growth."
Even the apparent influence of Derek Shearer, scourge of corporate America, may have helped the campaign. The idea of sticking it to executives who pay themselves six-figure salaries, which would have frightened the upwardly mobile in the go-go 80's, appeals to young, middle-class Americans who doubt they will ever live as well as their parents.
Those who are great at generating the high concepts may not, however, be good at polishing the script. Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning Clinton supporter who teaches at M.I.T., frets that the Clinton economic team has yet to include the technical types who could, say, figure out the cost of a change in tax rates or analyze a computer simulation of international capital flows. "The translation of the Clinton program into numbers," he noted, "has yet to be done."
Mr. Clinton would not have much trouble locating willing professionals with sterling resumes; indeed, a dozen or so have already been helping out at the margins of the campaign. And rumors are already flying about who would be tapped: Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, Paul Krugman of M.I.T., Alan Blinder of Princeton, Rudiger Dornbusch of M.I.T. and Benjamin Friedman of Harvard top most lists. Herbert Stein, an economic adviser to Presidents Nixon and Ford, notes, however, that "the Democrats have been out of government for 12 years -- there is hardly anyone out there with experience" in the Federal Government.
Perhaps a more serious problem is the clash of ideologies -- more specifically, enthusiasm for government intervention -- between the Clinton insiders who have been supplying grand campaign themes and the hands-on economists likely to join a Clinton Administration.
 
New Kitchen Cabinet
 But virtually all the high-powered economists on the recruitment lists are far more conservative than the Clintonauts in their views of what government can accomplish. Even those, like Mr. Krugman, who are left of center are less than eager to subsidize glamorous technologies, solve environmental problems with direct regulation or rescue manufacturers from foreign competition. And it is an open question whether they could work together harmoniously.
One possibility is that they would not be asked to try. The academics might occupy official seats as advisers and budget managers, while the campaign veterans -- particularly those who are old friends of Mr. Clinton -- might be part of a kitchen cabinet that influenced policy in informal ways. Another is that the more conservative economists among the new crowd would form a brain trust in the Treasury Department under the shelter of a strong secretary -- say, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker -- who would champion their views.
The least likely scenario is the one in which a President Clinton retreated to the role of chairman of the board a la Bush. Mr. Clinton simply has too much confidence to filter his information through the equivalent of a James Baker or a John Sununu. "Clinton just doesn't feel comfortable about getting advice from a few people," concluded Gene Sperling, who coordinates the Democrat's positions on economic issues.

HEADLINE: The 7 Levels of Plastic in Recycling-by-the-Numbers

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Now that Manhattan is pursuing recyling in earnest and the rest of the city is soon to follow, well-meaning New Yorkers are struggling with a new kind of separation anxiety.
It's easy to tell green glass from clear, and steel cans from aluminum ones -- but what are those little numbers inside the three-arrow recycling symbols on every plastic container in the refrigerator? And will mixing the 3-triangles and the 5-triangles together risk the $200 fines the city is threatening? 
 The answer is that the numbers are the plastic industry's attempt to make sense of the hundreds of kinds of plastic it uses.
The numbers, from 1 to 7, identify broad groups of resins. Recycling plastic is far harder than melting down aluminum -- it is crucial that some kinds not get mixed. A few bottles made of No. 3, polyvinyl chloride, for example, will spoil a truckload of virtually identical ones made of No. 1. The vinyl will char at the temperature needed to melt the polyethylene terephthalate, and black specks will contaminate the whole batch.
New York City asks residents for soda, milk and detergent bottles. It doesn't use the numbers, but that effectively means it collects only 1's and 2's.
No. 1, polyethylene terephthalate, is the most commonly recycled plastic. It is the kind in large soda bottles, and usually is shredded for uses like carpeting or fiberfill in parkas and sleeping bags. But even this process is tricky -- the caps may be made of more flexible polypropylene (No. 5) and the base cups of stronger high density polyethelyne (No. 2).
The Partnership for Plastics Progress, an industry group, says that 35 percent of PET bottles were recycled last year; most have come from states with refund-deposit laws. A few Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola bottles are dissolved and recast as bottles, but most recycled plastics are not used for things that will contain food.
No. 2, high density polyethylene, is used in milk jugs and detergent bottles. Although manufacturers like to color bottles, clear plastic is more valuable. Light blue Downy bottles, for example, can't be made from dark orange Tide ones. According to Recycling Times, an industry publication, clear HDPE is worth from $160 to $240 a ton in the New York area, while mixed colors command only $40 to $80 a ton.
Other plastics can be recycled, but the costs are high. Recyclers dislike foamed polystyrene -- best known in coffee cups and egg cartons -- because it is more than 90 percent air. The difficulty of recycling it helped persuade McDonald's to drop its plastic clamshell hamburger box.
Some experts question the value of the codes, since each plastic comes in hundreds of varieties. "There is a big difference between the high density polyethylene used in piping and what's in a shampoo bottle," said John Ruston, a researcher with the Environmental Defense Fund. "You can't grind them together and expect to get high quality products."
 
Bar Codes
 A better approach, he said, would be to reduce the number of varieties of plastics used in consumer products and imprint a bar code on items so machines could sort them.Another alternative is to export mixed plastics to countries with low labor costs for hand-sorting.
The low prices paid for many recovered plastics means that cities are losing money in their recycling efforts. Marc Sulam, a securities analyst with Kidder, Peabody, said Philadelphia reduced its recycling budget by almost $500,000 when it decided to stop collecting plastic at curbside. The recession has cut prices for virgin plastics, which manufacturers prefer, leaving many recycled plastics with no markets. Just as old newspapers jammed warehouses in the 1980's, Mr. Ruston said he expects to see plastics pile up until an industry develops.
But some programs may not last that long. "This is a classic case of supply exceeding demand," said Chaz Miller of the Waste Recycler Council, an industry group. "Many recyclables are being sold at a substantial loss. The future of recycling is at risk."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Debate;
CANDIDATES CRAM FOR FIRST DEBATE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The Presidential candidates stayed mostly out of the public eye today, cramming for the first of three nationally televised debates that could be pivotal in efforts by President Bush to reverse his electoral fortunes, Gov. Bill Clinton to cement his lead and Ross Perot to reclaim his reputation.
The first debate, on Sunday at 7 P.M. Eastern daylight time on all major commercial networks and many cable stations, is expected to be the most watched single event so far in the campaign. In preparation, Mr. Bush took part in a mock debate at the White House theater room. Mr. Clinton, after running in a charity race in the morning, stayed at a hotel in Kansas City, Mo., rehearsing and resting his hoarse voice. Mr. Perot made no public appearances as he prepared in Dallas. 
 While political debates usually solidify existing opinions rather than alter people's views of the candidates, this year they may have greater impact. Analysts cite the volatile electorate and the remarkably compressed schedule of three Presidential debates and one Vice Presidential debate in nine days. Another wild card is the unpredictable effect of a third participant, Mr. Perot.
"Our traditional conclusion that debates reinforce and don't change minds may be turned around this year," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and an authority on Presidential debates. "While single events don't usually change attitudes, the four debates might come to function as a single event, as a mini-series, and the power of the media to interpret the debates may be minimized."
The live 90-minute spectacle at Washington University's gymnasium, in Clayton, Mo., a St. Louis suburb will not be a debate in the classic sense, because the contenders are not supposed to speak directly to one another. Instead, they will take questions from a panel of three reporters.
Nevertheless, after a campaign of unprecedented exposure of the candidates on television talk and call-in shows, the debates offer the public the first opportunity to see them on the same stage. Even if they speak in scripted set pieces, their comments will be much longer than the 10 or 20 seconds they usually command on the evening news.
 
Shaping Expectations
 Advisers to Mr. Bush say they hope their candidate will gain momentum on Sunday, perhaps if Mr. Clinton makes a blunder that the Republicans can pounce on in the subsequent debates. They also say he could draw sympathy if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot gang up on him.
Mr. Clinton's aides say they want their candidate to do well enough to solidify his lead in the polls and give Mr. Bush no opening to overtake him.
Mr. Perot, emphasizing his deficit-reduction plan, will seek to change the image as an ego-driven spoiler that he acquired by dropping out and then re-entering the race.
Recent television commercials have telegraphed the messages the campaigns will be trying to convey: The Bush camp, for example, would like to see Mr. Clinton questioned about what it calls his "tax-and-spend" record in Arkansas. The Clinton camp hopes the President will be grilled on the sour economy.
The first debate comes after weeks of posturing by the campaign organizations over whether to debate at all and long negotiations over ground rules, and public interest appears to be high. A New York Times/CBS News poll found that two-thirds of registered voters nationwide said they were very likely to watch the debate on Sunday and that 54 percent expected to learn something that could influence their vote. The margin of sampling error in the survey, conducted Oct. 2-4, was plus or minus three percentage points.
"There's just a fascination of seeing Bush and Clinton in the same arena, with that strange third guy on the scene," said Don Hewitt, the executive producer of the CBS News program "60 Minutes" who produced the debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon in 1960.
"The whole country will tune in to see the two guys square off the way they used to tune in to watch Joe Louis or Rocky Marciano. It has all the elements of a boxing match and they want to see one guy walk out a winner," he added.
The public's images of past debates seem to be a jumble of faux pas or non-verbal cues rather than recollections of what was actually said: In 1960, there was Mr. Nixon and his five o'clock shadow; in 1976 was President Gerald Ford's comment that Poland was not under domination by the Soviet Union; in 1980, President Jimmy Carter was ridiculed for recalling a conversation with his daughter, Amy, about nuclear arms; in 1984, President Ronald Reagan humorously deflected questions about his age by saying, "I will not make age an issue in this campaign," and in 1988, Michael S. Dukakis later acknowledged he goofed when he put forth an impersonal answer to a very personal hypothetical question about whether, if his wife were raped and murdered, he would favor the death penalty for the killer.
Noting that the public is electing a President, not the captain of a debate team, academics warn that television viewers should not overemphasize the contenders' verbal skills or even whether they come off as nice guys. Instead, the focus should be on their message and problem-solving abilities.
"Reporters often ask, 'Who would be your favorite seat mate on an airplane?' " Ms. Jamieson said. "The more relevant question is, 'Who do you trust to act in the country's best interest? Am I comfortable with the way this guy makes decisions?' "
Most troubling to many students of the process is when analysts declare "winners" and "losers."
"For many of the millions who watch the debate, it may be the first time they have heard what the candidates are thinking about on a particular issue," said Diana Carlin, a professor of communication studies at the University of Kansas who has written extensively about Presidential debates. "I don't like to think in terms of winning and losing."
But the pleas from academics will never stop people from viewing the debates as they would a boxing match. "Let's face it," Mr. Hewitt said. "You know full well you're going to say, 'Clinton won last night,' or 'Bush won last night.' It's the nature of politics. There's always a winner."
 
Betting on Clinton
 Viewers already have expectations. In the Times/CBS poll, 41 percent of registered voters said they expect Mr. Clinton to do the best in the debates, with 24 percent for Mr. Bush and 8 percent for Mr. Perot.
Mindful that in politics expectations can outweigh reality, Mr. Bush has for days told audiences that Mr. Clinton is an Oxford-trained debater, saying, "I'm not the greatest debater." Aides to Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, insist that it is he who is outmatched by Mr. Bush. The fact is, both of the major-party nominees are highly skilled and experienced.
Mr. Perot is a far less experienced debater, but his country drawl and skill with one-liners make him a strong presence on television.
Mr. Bush's biggest problem in public speaking is that he is clumsy with syntax and often cannot complete a sentence. "Bush can express himself very clearly if he sticks to short sentences," said Lilyan Wilder, a speech and media coach who helped the President prepare for his 1984 Vice Presidential debate against Geraldine A. Ferraro. "He can be too verbose and he can end up speaking sentences that are grammatically incorrect and difficult to wade through as a listener."
Dick Morris, who for years was Mr. Clinton's chief political consultant and coached him for debates in Arkansas, said the Governor has to avoid being too pedantic and getting lost in detail. "His defect is that he falls in love with his own rhetoric," said Mr. Morris, now a Republican consultant. "We used to practice 20-second answers. I'd sit there with a stop watch."
The biggest concerns for Mr. Perot, the experts say, is keeping his sometimes testy demeanor in check and not appearing uninformed next to the other men, who are far more steeped in issues.
Whatever happens Sunday, it is certain that the debate will be remembered not for its substance but for its superficial images. "These things tend to have a life of their own," said Jim Lehrer of PBS, who is the moderator. "We'll see what life this one has."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Voters;
While Not Squarely Pro-Clinton, One Town Is Definitely Anti-Bush

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND HEIGHTS, Mo., Oct. 10

 BODY:
This St. Louis suburb tends to be up for grabs in Presidential elections. It split 50-50 in the vote four years ago. But ask about George Bush this time around, and the response among even his dwindling supporters tends to be a merger of disappointment and disbelief, all the more so since the President started attacking Gov. Bill Clinton's activities in the 1960's. Here at least, that maneuver has backfired in a big way.
"This is just a lot of garbage," 73-year-old Audrey Mueller said of the Bush attacks on Mr. Clinton for traveling to Russia in 1969 and attending antiwar demonstrations in England. "I wish he'd get away from this stuff. The President of the United States shouldn't be doing this."
 
'No Way for Bush'
 Her husband, Leslie Mueller, 75, put it this way: "I was in World War II. Who cares? That was 45 years ago. Who cares what Clinton did 20 years ago as a young man? Let's talk about the homeless and unemployment, Mr. President. What are you going to do about those?" 
 With that, Mrs. Mueller repeated, 'Garbage!" Both she and her husband voted for Mr. Bush four years ago. They will not say whether they are voting this time for Mr. Clinton or Ross Perot, but they do say this: "No way for Bush," Mr. Mueller said. "Forget it," said his wife.
In close to a hundred conversations over three days in this mostly white, though racially mixed suburb of blue- and white-collar families, about one in three people remained loyal to Mr. Bush. But in the library and the health club, on the streets and in the mall, most others were for Mr. Clinton, though a few said they liked Mr. Perot based on his recent televised appeals. But for the most part, Mr. Perot was treated as a joke. The man who set out to be the antidote for cynicism about government has wound up fueling it.
"I'm embarrassed I ever wanted to vote for Perot," said Christine Griffin, 23. Along with her two co-workers who sell cosmetics, she said she would vote for Mr. Clinton.
Said Rudy Douglas, a 37-year-old shoe salesman who says he will vote for Mr. Clinton: "It turns out Perot was just power hungry. He's flaky. Who knows what he would do as President?"
Judy De Weerdt, a teacher who says she is leaning toward Mr. Clinton, summed up Mr. Perot this way: "He's a mealy-mouthed little critter."
But while Mr. Clinton seems to have most of the support here, it is a grudging support, with people not sure he is up to the job and not convinced he has been straightforward with them. People made it loud and clear that this would be an anti-Bush election, not a pro-Clinton election.
"I'm voting for Clinton, but I want to like him more than I like him," said Nick Niederlander, 45, the librarian here.
Raymond Stay, 51, is more skeptical of Mr. Clinton and says he is voting for Mr. Perot. "I don't trust Clinton," he said. "You always have the feeling he's not being square with you. He should have been man enough to say, 'I didn't want to go to war. I pulled a couple of strings to stay out.' "
If there was one word that dominated the interviews, it was trust. Even more than the economy, it is the big issue in this city of 10,000 people, which is adjacent to the St. Louis suburb of Clayton, where the Presidential debate will be held Sunday night.
Truth be told, most people do not seem to trust any of the candidates. They believe Mr. Bush lied to them about not raising taxes and Mr. Perot about whether he was running or not. As for Governor Clinton, they do not think he has come clean with them about the draft. And they are not sure they trust him to run the Government, though most say they have no choice.
"I don't trust any of them," said Lee Lawrence, 37, a secretary who didn't vote in 1988 and may not vote this time. "Clinton has good ideas, but I'm not sure you can trust him to carry them out."
Said Pete Curtis, 39: "I just don't trust Perot. He scares me."
Mary Davitt, 38, an accountant, says she voted last time for Mr. Bush but regrets that now. "I don't trust Bush," she said. "He hasn't told the truth about Iran-contra. He's desperate. He's burned out. It's time for someone else."
The conversations here in Richmond Heights were different than those from close to a thousand similar interviews throughout the country since the start of the primary season. For one thing, with the election imminent and their decisions now seeming real, people took more time to think about their answers. For another, they talked much less about allegations that Mr. Clinton had once had an extramarital affair. In fact, part of the resentment about Mr. Bush's raising of the issue of what Mr. Clinton did 20 years ago is that the voters have already put the character issue behind them. What had been an amusement in March seems a trivial distraction in October.
But perhaps the most important difference between the interviews here and the earlier ones is that more and more people talk not just of a failed George Bush but also of a failed Republican philosophy.
"I voted for Bush, I voted for Reagan," said Angela Gelb, 50, an interior designer. "But I think the Republicans have been in power long enough. They were great on defense. But we have to concentrate at home now. Let's see what the Democrats do. They'll have the White House and Congress. Maybe it'll work."
 
'Need for Change'
 Keith Lilek, 35, a sales manager, voted for Mr. Bush last time. "We like being Republicans," he said. "We don't like giving our money away. But after 12 years, I can see the need for change."
Like many other Republicans here, Mr. Lilek is upset that in the final weeks of the campaign, the President has turned to attacking Mr. Clinton for demonstrating against the Vietnam War. "Who wasn't demonstrating 20 years ago?" he asked.
For some Republicans, the election is over, and they want to see their President leave with dignity. "It's the desperate ploy of a desperate man," William Guttman, 48, an accountant, said of the latest Bush attack on Mr. Clinton.
But for other Republicans, it isn't over until it's over. They hold out hope, though they feel let down by their man's tactics.
"You have to be for Bush, he's the only one who can help the economy," said Roger Miller, 39, a sales representative for a medical equipment company. "He may pull this off yet. But the liberal media is against him."
 
'It's Beneath Him'
 Still, even Mr. Miller is offended by the attacks on Mr. Clinton's antiwar demonstrating. "I hate it," he said. "I wish Bush would stop it. It's beneath him."
There is an autumn briskness in the air here. The nights are chilly. The leaves are just beginning to turn on street after street of neat brick homes. On one block, Rose Mary Ammon stands in front of her house, wearing a red-white-and blue flag pin and looking as if she had just stepped off the cover of a Republican leaflet. At the age of 84, she has been a Republican all her life.
"I've been a Bush supporter for a long, long time," she said. "I've been a contributor. But not this year. I think Bush has been in office for as many years as he should be."
With that, she turned to walk away, then stopped to say: "This is one of the worst elections I've lived through. All this mud-slinging. Now this stuff with Clinton that they're saying is such a big deal. They ought to point to their own Vice President."

"We like being Republicans," he said. "We don't like giving our money away. But after 12 years, I can see the need for change." (Photographs by Bill Stover for The New York Times) (pg. 24)

HEADLINE: Prison Commissioner to Drop Electronic Monitor Program

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Under mounting pressure from the Legislature and after a series of well-publicized incidents that shook public confidence, the Commissioner of the State Department of Corrections has ended a program that monitored some prisoners from their homes with electronic bracelets.
"It's an economic decision, a management decision and a political decision," said Commissioner William H. Fauver. "I'm disappointed, but I want to stress that this was my decision. It was not forced on me." 
 The electronic monitoring program has been under siege since April when an inmate, Tony Palmer, 21 years old, removed an ankle bracelet that was supposed to track his movements and shot and killed a friend, Vernon Major, 19, in Paterson as they "horsed around," the police said.
A month later, another inmate in the program, a convicted drug dealer, also broke free of the bracelet and was later charged with aggravated assault in the beating and stabbing of another man. In a third similar incident in June, a prisoner was arrested on a sexual assault charge.
 
Adds to New York Debate
 New Jersey's decision to drop its electronic bracelet program is sure to fire the debate that already is raging elsewhere in the region, especially in New York City.
The New York City program has come under national scrutiny in a case involving two reputed members of the organized-crime family controlled by John Gotti. The bracelets used to keep track of the two men, John and Joseph Gambino, were removed in July with the approval of the Government. In late August, the two Gambinos failed to appear for arraignment in Manhattan on murder and racketeering charges. They were arrested early this month in Florida.
Even though he decided to drop the electronic monitoring program in New Jersey, Mr. Fauver said he still supported the idea.
"We had over 2,000 people in the program and the failure rate or arrests for new crimes was 1.8 percent," he said. "That's really a very good percentage. But it only takes one notorious case, likes the Gambinos in New York City or our own problems here, to hurt the program."
 
Supposedly Tamper-Proof
 Under the program, some first-time offenders who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes are fitted with a supposedly tamper-proof electronic bracelet on their ankle or wrist. They wear it 24 hours a day and complete their sentences under house arrest. A radio transmitter is fixed to the prisoner's telephone. In theory, if the prisoner wanders more than 150 feet from the transmitter, the signal is broken and officers are alerted.
New York City wants 500 bracelets to help ease crowding among its 22,000 jail inmates. Connecticut electronically monitors 25 inmates.
New Jersey began its program in 1989 to deal with a prison population that was increasing because of tough new mandatory sentencing laws. A Department of Corrections spokesman, Jim Stabile, said 2,880 inmates had been in the program. It handled an average 537 inmates this year at a cost of $3.5 million, with most of the expenses going toward the monitoring staff.
 
Last 6 Months at Home
 The New Jersey program generally involved prisoners who had served regular prison time and were released early to complete the last six months of their terms at home wearing a monitor, Mr. Fauver said.
"They tended to be everything except murderers, arsonists and sex offenders," he said.
One of the main criticisms of the New Jersey program was that so many drug offenders were involved.
Immediately after the April incident, Mr. Fauver stopped placing new inmates in the program and hired a consultant. The Republican-controlled Legislature began its own inquiry, and members introduced bills to drastically limit the program.
"The wrong people are being let out of the system," State Senator Louis F. Kosco of Paramus, chairman of the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee, complained in June.
 
Commissioner Changes Mind
 Despite the Legislature's anger and a consultant's report that found New Jersey's program flawed and mismanaged, Mr. Fauver had steadfastly defended it. As late as last month, he had told legislators he intended to restart it with improved software, training and procedures.
But in a surprising turn, Mr. Fauver announced on Thursday that he had decided to drop the program at the state level.
"The program will be phased out through attrition and that should take about two months," Mr. Fauver said in an interview on Friday.
Senator Kosco said he was surprised but very pleased with the decision to end the monitoring program.
"The public's safety and welfare was at risk, and in the end, the right things were done," he said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks $800 Million For New Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
On Nov. 3, New York voters will decide whether to gamble on adding $800 million to the state's already-worrisome level of debt in the hope of reversing the worst loss of jobs to hit the state since the 1930's.
Proposal One on the ballot asks voters to approve a bond act that would authorize the state to issue $800 million worth of bonds to finance investments in roads, sewers and other public infrastructure projects throughout New York. 
 The program is the centerpiece of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's strategy for stimulating the stalled economy of New York, which has been one of the states hardest hit by the recession.
Since June 1989, New York has lost 550,000 or 6.7 percent of its jobs. Of the 11 largest industrial states, only California's 9.4 percent unemployment rate is higher than New York's 9 percent rate.
New York economic development experts calculate that the Cuomo program, which aims to have many projects under way in the spring, would create at least 24,000 jobs in construction and related industries. Most would be created within two years, said Dennis H. Allee, Senior Deputy Commissioner of Economic Development.
 
Hope for 100,000 New Jobs
 And over the next 8 to 10 years, state officials say, the plan will create 79,000 to 106,000 permanent private jobs. It will do that, they contend, by providing the sewers, water systems, access roads, commercial lighting, parking lots and the like that are needed to attract businesses to the state and to persuade the ones here to stay and expand.
Despite the promise of new jobs, the bond issue carries risks. The state is already saddled with a debt of $24.29 billion that must be repaid from taxes. That is nearly double the level in 1986 and amounts to $1,343 for every New Yorker, one of the highest levels in the nation.
While the construction jobs are a relatively sure thing, several academic experts say it is hard to predict just how many permanent jobs will follow -- especially since the projects have not been chosen. The finalists will be announced on Thursday and a competition will be held in January, if Proposal One passes. Of the $800 million, $600 million will go to the counties according to their populations.
The bond issue comes at a time when most economists see few signs of an upturn in New York's economy.
"With the most recent numbers, the summertime hopes of a bottoming out have once again been disappointing," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the Regional Commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. "New York is still in decline."
Depending on the rating agency and the bond type, New York's credit rating is the lowest or one of the lowest of the 50 states. Financial analysts say, however, that New York has avoided having to pay higher interest rates than many states with better ratings. Because New York bonds are exempt from city, state and Federal taxes, heavily taxed New Yorkers accept a relatively low interest rate, they say.
When asked whether an additional $800 million in borrowing might affect the state's rating, executives at Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation declined to comment, saying it was a political issue. They said they also needed to know more about the bonds to be issued and the actual projects that would receive the funds.
But both agencies pointedly stressed the height of New York's debt, and the struggles by the state to keep spending in line with revenues. They blamed high spending, especially on Medicaid, and weak tax receipts because of the the ailing economy. Nor did they expect these pressures to ease significantly soon.
George W. Leung, a Moody's managing director, said: "In the 90's, the levels of revenue growth for all states will not likely return to the levels of growth we experienced in the 80's. States, including New York, need to review their spending commitments and programs. New York has done some of this, but it needs to do a lot more."
Governor Cuomo is campaigning hard for the bond issue. Curiously, one opponent making the rounds of newspapers, television and radio stations, and local civic and business groups is Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller. The Republican describes himself as a would-be, luke-warm supporter of the bond proposal.
 
Regan Seeks Rein on Debt
 Mr. Regan is asking voters to reject it unless the Governor and legislators commit themselves to supporting a constitutional amendment to reform the borrowing process. Mr. Regan wants to increase voters' authority to approve state borrowing, to subject borrowing legislation to greater public scrutiny and to end government borrowing practices that are widely seen as questionable.
He wants a 30-day waiting period between the time a borrowing bill is introduced and put to a vote to insure adequate time for public scrutiny. He wants state authorities like the Urban Development Corporation and the Thruway Authority to be prohibited from borrowing for activities not directly affecting them. And he wants the amount that the government can borrow without voter approval to be limited to a "modest" amount. Even those amounts should require the approval of three-fifths of each house of the legislature instead of the simple majority now needed, he says.
Mr. Regan says the state government has authorized borrowing $6.62 billion without voter approval since 1988, when voters last approved a bond issue.
Governor Cuomo insists that he has long favored reform. But he argues that Mr. Regan's attempt to tie the bond proposal to borrowing reform makes no sense, since the Legislature will not meet before Election Day. Mr. Cuomo failed in 1990 to win voter approval for a $1.95 billion environmental bond issue.
This time, voters will have to choose between two compelling arguments. One is that the borrowing is needed to jump-start the economy and to make New York more competitive over the longer term, which will strengthen, not weaken, the state's financial position.
The other is that borrowing $800 million will only make the state's current debt worse. That, in turn, will make it more difficult for New York to attract and retain businesses.
 
Opposed by Conservatives
 Groups fighting for rejection of Proposal One include conservative organizations, like the Conservative Party and Change-NY, which advocate a smaller, more efficient state government.
"There is no possible way that New York can afford this," said Paul P. Jesep, a spokesman for Change-NY. His group contends that the bond issue, including interest, will cost taxpayers $1.9 billion, assuming the state issues 30-year bonds.
But state officials said the maturity of the bonds would range from 20 to 30 years, and assuming an average of 25 years, the cost would be $1.7 billion.
The Department of Economic Development says the bond issue will generate $9 billion to $11 billion in economic activity over 8 to 10 years and more than $3.1 billion in taxes over 25 years, or about twice the cost of the bonds.
Several academic experts on state finances and spending are skeptical. Roy Bahl, an economist at Georgia State University, and Steven D. Gold of the Nelson Rockefeller Institute of Government said much of the benefits could leak to other states. Construction companies will not have to be from New York to win contracts. And while state officials say they plan to encourage contractors to hire New Yorkers, these firms will undoubtedly also employ New Jersey and Connecticut residents.
Steven G. Craig, an economist at the University of Houston, warned that it would probably be some time before the tax revenues generated by the program could service the debt. But he said that if New York was going to borrow more, it was good that it was for improving its infrastructure. Compared with other states, New York has been a laggard in capital spending, he said.
 
Business and Labor Support
 State officials calculate that the public-spending plan will reach at least $1.27 billion when contributions that local governments will have to make are included.
Many of New York's main business organizations and labor unions are backing Governor Cuomo's program. They agree with the view that someone has to come to the rescue of the state's ailing economy.
Indeed, the level of residential and commercial construction remains deeply depressed. And with the Bush Administration opposing significant increases in Federal spending on infrastructure -- programs that had been slashed during the Reagan and Bush years -- there seems to be nothing else on the horizon..
About the only major Federal spending initiative for infrastructure in recent years was a six-year program enacted in December that called for spending $151 billion on highways. Already the Federal Government is reneging on its promises. New York officials say they were promised $940 million for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 but were just notified that they would only get about $775 million.
"Washington is broke," Mr. Cuomo said in a recent interview. "After Clinton wins, which he will, he will have $20 billion for each of the four years for infrastructure. But it will not be enough for all this country needs. States will have to supplement it."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Pennsylvania;
Specter's Challenger Gaining With Help of Ads and Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 17

 BODY:
After flagging for months, Lynn H. Yeakel's Democratic campaign for the United States Senate has come to life, with assistance from more than $1 million in advertising and a strong performance in a recent debate with her Republican opponent, Senator Arlen Specter.
Ms. Yeakel, a fund-raiser for women's charities who is making her first run for elected office, has rebounded from a nose-dive in popularity in public opinion polls in September, when she was as far as 16 percentage points behind Mr. Specter. 
 Political analysts say Ms. Yeakel has begun to focus her campaign on solving economic ills, and scored many points in the televised debate last Saturday.
"The only record Senator Specter distorts more than his own is mine," Ms. Yeakel said, referring to her opponent as "Senator Flip-Flop." Ms. Yeakel refused to shake Mr. Specter's hand at the conclusion of the debate and wound up having to retract one of her flip-flop accusations, but she was widely considered to have outperformed Mr. Specter, who seemed ill at ease and dwelt at length in the minutiae of his record in two terms in the Senate.
 
Dismay About Incumbents
 But most analysts say Ms. Yeakel's gain in the polls represents, more than anything else, the voters' anti-incumbent mood. Polls indicate that more than half of her support comes from voters who want an alternative to Mr. Specter, and three weeks before the election, nearly half of the voters tell poll takers that they are undecided or considering switching candidates.
"Yeakel has had a pretty meager campaign until recently," said G. Terry Madonna, a political analyst and poll taker. "And Specter has run a textbook campaign, bordering on brilliant, but he still may lose because of the tremendous desire for change among voters."
Mr. Madonna, the director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville State University in Lancaster, said his and other polls this week suggested either a dead heat or slight lead for Mr. Specter.
Mr. Madonna and others also say Mr. Specter was hurt by Prof. Anita F. Hill's appearance this week on national television, where she reminded Pennsylvania voters about Senator Specter's hostile cross-examination of her during the confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas last year.
The Specter campaign had made preparations for the avalanche of publicity surrounding the anniversary of the Thomas hearings. For two weeks, the campaign has run a statewide television advertisement in which Teresa Heinz, the widow of Senator John Heinz, says that while she did not agree with Mr. Specter on the Thomas confirmation, she is supporting him. Mr. Heinz was one of the state's most popular politicians.
Mr. Specter is outspending Ms. Yeakel 2 to 1, but that may not be enough to overcome his high negative ratings, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. "Arlen Specter has two major problems, Anita Hill and George Bush, and he can't do much about either one," she said.
Mr. Specter acknowledged in an interview on Thursdaythat Professor Hill and Mr. Bush represented high hurdles for him.
 
Comfort From History
 He continually emphasizes his record as an independent and as a supporter of women's issues, and he says he takes some comfort in Pennsylvanians' penchant for split votes. The last three times a Democratic Presidential candidate carried the state, voters also elected a Republican senator.
Yeakel campaign officials say they knew all along that the race would be bumpy, largely because of a shortage of money. "The only reason we were behind in the polls two weeks ago was that we did not chose to start advertising," said Neil Oxman, one of the campaign's strategists. "When we started advertising almost three weeks ago, Specter had already been on television for 12 straight weeks and on radio for 16 straight weeks. We have just begun to overcome the fact that Lynn Yeakel is not well known in the state."
The Yeakel commercials feature endorsements by teachers, workers and the elderly and suggest she has ideas for improving the economy.
Mr. Specter's advertisements remind voters that Ms. Yeakel delayed paying more than $17,000 in Philadelphia income taxes until the day before she announced her candidacy.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Profile;
Perot's Spokesman, a Former Prisoner of War, Is His Boss's Truest Believer

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Oct. 10

 BODY:
With the candidate out of sight, the voice of the Ross Perot campaign speaks these days not with a Texarkana twang but with the droopy drawl of southwest Georgia. It belongs to Orson G. Swindle 3d, who seems to share Mr. Perot's penchant for both patriotic fervor and backwoods philosophy.
Ten weeks ago, Mr. Swindle was minding his own business, running an association of preschools in Honolulu, where he had recently moved. Now, as executive director of United We Stand, America, Mr. Perot's political organization, he spends his days jousting with the likes of Ted Koppel on "Nightline" and John H. Sununu on "Crossfire," when, of course, he is not appearing on "Good Morning America" or the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour." 
 When Mr. Perot announced in July that he would halt his Presidential campaign, he strained his relationship with some longtime allies like Thomas W. Luce 3d and burned his bridges with hired guns like Edward J. Rollins. What was left by the time he re-entered the race last week was a small coterie of loyalists, some of them relatives, some of them employees, and some, like Mr. Swindle, true believers.
Of that group, the 55-year-old Mr. Swindle has emerged as the campaign's most public presence. After directing the Hawaii Perot campaign, which he joined in the early stages of its first incarnation, he was appointed director of United We Stand on July 31 by the state coordinators who still hoped Mr. Perot would get in the race. He gave up his job in Hawaii and temporarily moved to Dallas.
In addition to defending Mr. Perot on television, Mr. Swindle holds daily briefings for reporters in Dallas, plays cheerleader for the fledgling Perot state organizations and consults frequently with Mr. Perot. He says he is having the time of his life.
"I enjoy the mental combat," he said. "I enjoy pressure. I've always thrived on it. I've had two ulcers in my life, and both times it was because I was bored to tears with what I was doing."
 
20-Year Friendship
 Like Mr. Perot's running mate, James B. Stockdale, Mr. Swindle is a former fighter pilot who was shot down over Vietnam and spent six years and four months as a prisoner of war. As a friend of Mr. Perot's for nearly 20 years, he maintains a highly idealized view of his candidate.
Mr. Perot, he says flatly, joined the race for love of country, not massage of ego. When asked at a news conference on Thursday what proof Mr. Perot had that prisoners of war remained in Southeast Asia, Mr. Swindle replied: "If Mr. Perot said it, it's true. Mr. Perot does not lie."
But Mr. Swindle also has a realist's understanding of the disillusionment caused by Mr. Perot's alternating decisions about joining the race.
"I've told him you cannot believe the damage that's been done to these people," Mr. Swindle said in an interview. "In the conversations I've had with Ross, I'm convinced that in July he did not fully comprehend how deep their feelings were."
Despite his relative inexperience in electoral politics, or perhaps because of it, Mr. Swindle is not afraid to speak his mind. But he often has little knowledge about what Mr. Perot is thinking or even any awareness of what has been reported about either the Perot campaign or those of its rivals. As a result, his statements usually reflect his own opinions, not necessarily Mr. Perot's.
This week, for instance, he referred to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who has taken to wearing safari hats, as "Indiana Fitzwater." With little prompting, he said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was a man "the business world would like to see just slowly disappear."
Mr. Swindle's extraordinary loyalty to Mr. Perot clearly stems from Mr. Perot's work on behalf of prisoners of war.
After growing up in Camilla, Ga., Mr. Swindle joined the Marines in 1959. In 1966, while flying what was supposed to be his last combat mission in Vietnam, the 205th of his tour, Mr. Swindle's plane was hit by antiaircraft fire. He parachuted into the hands of the North Vietnamese.
While in prison, he was repeatedly and brutally tortured. He occasionally communicated through whispers and a tapped code with his fellow inmate, Mr. Stockdale.
After Mr. Swindle came home, he was invited to a reunion of prisoners of war in San Francisco by Mr. Perot, whom he had never heard of. They struck up a friendship.
Conservative by nature but generally apolitical, Mr. Swindle was lured into politics by his outrage at former President Jimmy Carter's declaration of amnesty for Vietnam draft dodgers. He ran Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign against Mr. Carter in his southwest Georgia Congressional District, an unpopular mission so close to Mr. Carter's home town.
As a reward, he won a patronage appointment as the Georgia director of the Farmers Home Administration, the lending arm of the Department of Agriculture. The agency was drowning in delinquent loans and Mr. Swindle set out at Washington's behest to toughen credit policies and declare foreclosures.
 
Power of Constituents
 That did not sit well with the state's Republican United States Senator, Mack Mattingly, who began fielding irate calls from rural constituents. The Senator won a long battle for Mr. Swindle's removal by making it a condition for the Senate's approval of a deputy agriculture secretary.
Former aides to Mr. Mattingly, who is now Ambassador to the Seychelles, said their primary objection to Mr. Swindle was his imperious and uncompassionate style.
"He's perfect for the Perot campaign," said Jay Morgan, who was executive director of the Georgia Republican Party at the time. "He's one of those guys who is smarter than anybody he's ever met."
Mr. Swindle says he was deposed because he refused to play pork-barrel politics. He had the same problem in his next job, as assistant secretary of commerce in charge of the Economic Development Agency.
The agency's mission was to funnel money to public works projects in economically depressed areas. But it had become a clearinghouse for pork and Mr. Swindle set out to publicize instances of abuse, including efforts by then House Speaker Jim Wright to earmark agency grants for the Fort Worth Stockyards.
Mr. Swindle did not survive at the development agency for long after George Bush's election as President. At the 1980 Republican National Convention, he had committed the unpardonable political sin of voting for Jack F. Kemp for Vice President. And in his four years in Washington he had made enemies on both sides of the aisle.
"They ran him out of town," said Daniel W. Caprio, a former aide to Mr. Swindle at the Commerce Department. "Someone like Orson who was so confrontational didn't fit into the Bush Administration. He wasn't kinder and gentler."
Mr. Swindle remains something of a Republican at heart. He says he would vote for Mr. Bush over Gov. Bill Clinton in a two-way race and he concedes that he has some difficulty with Mr. Perot's proposals for large tax increases.
But having seen the government from the inside, he has become convinced it needs fixing from the outside. "Unfortunately we have a system in which the business of government is totally corrupted by ineffectiveness and incompetence," he said. "And the people who are running it give themselves a pay raise for having it that way."

HEADLINE: FED CHIEF AFFIRMS ITS INDEPENDENCE

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., Oct. 10

 BODY:
Election-year politics will not keep the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates again if needed to stimulate the sluggish economy, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the central bank, said today.
But in a rare news conference with reporters attending a meeting of chief executives of the nation's largest corporations, Mr. Greenspan carefully refrained from hinting at the Fed's course. "Obviously if we perceive that further actions are required," the Fed will do so, he said. "If not, not." 
 He pointedly rejected published reports suggesting that the Federal Reserve had decided to delay any moves on interest rates until after the election for fear that the politically independent central bank would appear to be kowtowing to the Bush Administration.
 
'An Irresponsible Action'
 "This would be an irresponsible action on our part," he said. "I wish to emphasize that we at the Federal Reserve will continue to observe and evaluate the economy the way we always do and will not, if we believe it is necessary, abstain from taking actions largely or solely because there is an election and a campaign under way."
Mr. Greenspan commented after conferring behind closed doors with the Business Council, an elite group of corporate executives who meet twice a year at the secluded Homestead resort.
His remarks came after a week of wild gyrations in financial markets that traders said were caused by disappointment that the central bank failed to cut rates. Traders had widely expected a reduction in response to a Labor Department report showing a loss of 57,000 jobs in September.
After none came, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3136.58 on Friday, down 64.03 points from a week earlier and its lowest close of the year.
Mr. Greenspan declined to comment on the market but said he remained concerned about the economy and was watching very closely to see if businesses and consumers would pick up the pace of their spending after months of paying off excessive debt.
"There is an incredible degree of uncertainty that exists in the economy," he said. He called the economy "sluggish", adding, "It's clear we still have growth but it's also clear it's not accelerating at this stage."
He said Fed rate cuts over the last three years have helped prevent what he called a 19th century-style economic implosion but at the same time the central bank has avoided going too far and worsening inflation.
Many of the executives attending the Business Council said they were skeptical that another rate cut would do the economy much good but others said a reduction could not hurt.
"For a year I've been asking for lower rates," said John F. Welch Jr., chairman of the General Electric Company. But today, he said, "I think we're low enough to get this thing going."
 
'Rates Are Not a Question'
 Robert C. Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, said it was time to speed up Government spending on road building and other infrastructure improvements.
"Rates are not a question right now," he said. "Whether you're buying a house or a car, interest rates are lower than a lot of us have seen in a long time. In the short term, I think we are going to have to do something other than just pure monetary policy."
The Fed has reduced the key rate for loans between banks, the Federal funds rate, from 9.75 percent in mid-1989 to a 30-year low of 3 percent. Consumer and business loan rates and mortgage rates are near 20-year lows, yet the economy remains nearly stagnant.
Yet, as measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at an anemic 1.5 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter and analysts believe growth was about the same in the July-September period.
Howard P. Allen, chairman of the Southern California Edison Company, said another cut probably would not make much difference in corporate investment but it might give consumer spending a boost.
"I think it sends a psychological message" to consumers, he said. "Consumers are not spending; they're saving more."
He said that in general "they don't want to do anything because of uncertainty with government and the economy."
James D. Robinson 3d, chairman of the American Express Company, said a quarter-point reduction could help the economy a bit, but more useful would be a reduction in German interest rates.
Many analysts attribute recent volatility in both financial and currency markets to the wide difference between low United States rates and high German rates.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Pulse -- California;
Bush's Downhill Political Journey in California

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 10

 BODY:
"Four more weeks," the hecklers chanted gleefully as Vice President Dan Quayle tried to make his way down Grant Street in San Francisco's Chinatown the other day.
In that sarcastic message, if in nothing else, the demonstrators seemed to speak for California as a whole. This immense state, whose 54 electoral votes represent the largest share of the national total cast by any one jurisdiction since the Civil War, has turned with a vengeance on President Bush and his Administration. 
 He seems certain to be drubbed here by Bill Clinton on Nov. 3, and since California has formed a keystone of Republican victories for two decades, that makes it much harder for George Bush to put together a national majority. Moreover, his astonishing unpopularity in this state -- the most recent poll by Mervin Field shows the President 21 percentage points behind -- may doom Republican nominees to defeat in important Senate, House and legislative races as well.
 
Needed: "Grand Slam"
 This was to have been the golden year for the Republicans of the Golden State. Eighteen months ago, Mr. Bush seemed sure to carry California again. The impending retirement of Senator Alan Cranston seemed to open the possibility of electing two Republican senators this fall, and the reapportionment necessitated by the state's explosive growth seemed to open the possibility of a House delegation split 26-26, compared with the current 26-to-19 edge for the Democrats.
Now Mr. Bush is written off by most Republican leaders; one said this week he would need "a grand-slam home run in every one of the debates" to turn things around. Representative Barbara Boxer and former Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco, both Democrats, are heavy favorites to give the state the first pair of female senators in Washington. The Democrats may end up with 29 or even 30 House seats from California.
So what happened? Plenty.
"The economy is 75 percent of the answer," Ms. Feinstein said in an interview this week. "Californians have always believed that this is the pot at the end of the rainbow, the land of the second chance, where people come for hope. Now that hope is being replaced by anxiety and apprehension as we lose jobs, solid blue-collar jobs, the $20-an-hour jobs that made this state such a prosperous place.
 
'People Are Scared'
 "In the last two years, 44 percent of all the jobs lost in America have been lost in California, and people are scared."
Gov. Pete Wilson, who defeated Ms. Feinstein two years ago, did not disagree with her. He said it was impossible to overestimate the political impact of the decline of the real estate business, now "flat as a fritter," as he put it, and the rapid shrinkage of the state's big military contractors and military installations.
"There has been a devastating ripple effect," he said. "In the last two years, $25 billion of projected state revenue, a quarter of our income, has gone, vanished because of the economic stall."
The result, says Mr. Field, the poll taker, is "an electorate more pessimistic and lugubrious than any I can remember since the Depression, when I was a kid." The current weakness in the economy, "plus the palpable evidence that the United States is slipping as an industrial economy," he asserted, "has invaded every pore of the California body politic."
 
'He Hasn't Done Anything'
 Gerald Warren, who worked for Richard M. Nixon in the White House and now edits The San Diego Union, said the recession was costing the Republicans more votes than it might do otherwise because "we're losing our manufacturing base, and people sense that those jobs are never coming back."
"Mr. Bush is paying the price because people think he's completely incapable of turning things around," Mr. Warren added. "It makes me sick to say it, because I'm so fond of George Bush, but he's far too weak. He doesn't stand for anything, and he hasn't done anything. This is a solidly Republican county, but he's dead here, absolutely, unless he can seize the initiative in the debates. I don't see any real chance of his doing that, either."
If things are tough for the President in San Diego County, they are not much better in Orange County, the almost mythically conservative realm between San Diego and Los Angeles. In a poll completed late last month, The Los Angeles Times found Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton running almost even there, a disaster in the making for the President. Four years ago, when he carried California with a bare 51 percent, Mr. Bush still took 68 percent in Orange County.
 
New Democratic Approach
 Phil Angelides, the 39-year-old state Democratic chairman, thinks a change in his party's approach has helped considerably.
"We used to bridle at the Republicans' charges that we were nothing but a bunch of special interest groups, but when I became chairman, I realized they were right," he said. "Everyone wanted a place at the table, even though there was nothing on it to eat. Being out of power forced us to unite, to start early, to work hard."
The opposite happened to the Republicans. Electoral cycles are imprecise, but with the Republicans having held the statehouse here since 1966, with the exception of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s tenure, and having held the White House since 1968, with the exception of Jimmy Carter's term, they were bound to run out of gas soon.
Both nationally and in California, the party has made a sharp turn to the right. The Houston convention's adamant opposition to abortion and seeming hostility to working women was echoed at a subsequent state convention dominated by the religious right, which Mr. Wilson refused to attend.
Such Southern California conservatives as Representatives Robert K. Dornan and William E. Dannemeyer were pleased, but the Republican mainstream was horrified, here as elsewhere.
 
'Destruction of Our Party'
 "It all starts at the top, you know," said one of Ronald Reagan's most prominent strategists, who agreed to speak only on condition that he would not be identified. "We're watching the destruction of our whole party here, because George Bush is the voyeur of domestic policy, who just sits and watches events march past. And because he was afraid to take on the religious extremists.
"Well, he won't turn it around with the draft issue, or the Moscow issue, or the bimbo issue. People in California aren't crazy about Bill Clinton, but they've decided that they don't like George Bush at all, so they're going to take a chance on something new."
Willie Brown, the Democratic speaker of the California Assembly, said that both Governor Wilson and President Bush, after major successes early in their terms, "played it wrong by trying to bring the right wing in." Instead of broadening their coalitions, he said, "they were simply eaten up alive by the conservatives," who kept asking for more and more.
"Anyway, you can't discuss morality with voters who are worried about where they're going to live," Mr. Brown said. "People don't respond to preaching when they're hungry. You can't get them to tithe from their welfare checks. So the negative stuff never had a chance in this economy."
 
All but Unassailable
 Because Mr. Clinton has held a solid lead here since the Democratic convention, neither of the principal candidates has spent much time or much money in the state. Ross Perot, who led the race here in May and part of June, is making a significant effort, but his support has fallen to below 10 percent in most of the state polls.
With about two-thirds of the voters holding unfavorable views of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot, Mr. Clinton holds an all but unassailable position, even though 35 percent view him unfavorably, too, in the latest Field poll. Conducted Saturday to Wednesday, with interviews of 502 voters, it had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.
"It's mostly that the Republicans have fallen apart, at the Federal and state level," said Joseph Cerrell, a Democratic consultant in Los Angeles. "So much of it has to do with them, not us. Ask me what we've done, and I have to say, 'Not much."'

HEADLINE: Squalid Slums Grow as People Flood Latin America's Cities

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
In March, 600 families invaded land that had once been a garbage dump on the southern outskirts of Lima, making a settlement by building straw huts overnight. The police moved in repeatedly, evicting the families and leveling the huts, but the settlers came back each time.
The invasion, like others throughout Latin America, had a predictable result: six months later, the 400-acre tract is a teeming shantytown with 10,000 residents who are lobbying the city to give each family title to its own piece of dusty ground 20 feet wide by 40 feet long. 
 Despite the grinding poverty, Peruvians seeking a better life have been fleeing the countryside for Lima at the rate of more than a thousand a day and building settlements like this one, a seemingly endless expanse of small straw huts brushed constantly by a gritty wind next to a noisy highway.
 
Terrorist Threat Remains
 And even though the Peruvian Government is celebrating the blow dealt the Shining Path guerrilla movement by the capture of its founder, Abimael Guzman Reynoso, experts warn that it will be hard to wipe out the terrorist group if the country cannot address the overcrowding, poverty, lack of health care and other symptoms of the deep gap between rich and poor that are so visible in this settlement, problems that caused the message of the Shining Path to fall on relatively fertile ground.
"The demand in Lima for a piece of land is so great it can't be stopped," said Pedro Ublitas, general secretary of the settlement. "The authorities call us terrorists and criminals. They bring the police in and threaten us. But they don't realize we need space for our families."
Forty years after Latin Americans started a great migration to their cities, this shantytown full of barefoot children and idle men illustrates what is perhaps the most serious problem facing the continent: excessive urbanization and the bitter fruit it is bearing.
Latin America is the most urbanized part of the underdeveloped world. In 1950, only 42 percent of Latin Americans were city dwellers; today almost 73 percent live in cities, according to the United Nations. This compares with 34 percent in Africa and 33 percent in Asia.
The trend has created megacities throughout the continent: Buenos Aires, with 12 million out of 32 million Argentines; Santiago, with 5 million out of 13 million Chileans; Lima, with 7 million out of 22 million Peruvians, and Mexico City, the world's biggest city, with more than 20 million of the country's 90 million people.
In many countries the equation is similar: the major city attracts one-quarter to one-third of the country's population, with many living in squalid slums or shantytowns encircling the affluent inner city. While the percentage of city dwellers is close to that in the United States, where 75 percent of the population lives in cities, the Latin American example has produced a host of economic and social ills.
 
Expert Sums Up: Lima a Time Bomb
 In such concentrations of humanity, the migrants from the countryside have found crushingly disappointing economic opportunities, alarming levels of pollution, uncontrollable crime, and the nearly free movement of terrorists and other violent groups. The political unrest these problems produce becomes at times a potent weapon for demagogues.
"It was really ironic for those of us who went to the Rio summit," said Alfredo Gastal, director of the United Nations Office of Environment and Human Settlement in Santiago, referring to the world environmental conference in Rio de Janeiro in June. "Everyone there was worrying about trees and rain forests, and they were in the city that best exemplifies the worst problem in Latin America, and nothing was said about it."
This Lima shantytown, called Susana Higushi after the wife of President Alberto K. Fujimori, embodies all the woes of Latin American over-urbanization. "The city has grown like a wild animal without any kind of planning," said Eduardo Ballon, an urbanization specialist. "Lima is a time bomb."
In the six months since the land grab, the shantytown has organized itself for self-defense and to lobby for land titles, but its municipal services are almost nonexistent. Water is brought in in barrels. Electricity comes from the few car batteries that residents manage to pick up. City authorities do not collect trash and garbage, because to do so would be to acknowledge the legitimacy of the settlement. So residents dump it by the side of the road.
Barefoot children shout and play in the streets while the men, having no work, congregate around makeshift bars where they play cards or quietly chat. In the tiny market, where vendors sell squash, bananas, fish, salt, rice and beans, the talk was that there was no money and that no one was buying.
"We're just sitting here day after day, waiting for things to change," said Flor, who who came here from Ayacucho. She would not give her last name.
 
The Summer Is Due, And With It Disease
 While residents say they live in fear that Shining Path will infiltrate the settlement, their biggest concern now is the coming of the Southern Hemisphere's summer. With no electricity, running water or sewage system, they see summer as a time of disease and death.
The settlement has just one tiny medical post, and it has only small stocks of medicines. Over the last two years, Peruvians have been shocked by a cholera epidemic that has infected more than 500,000 people and killed 3,500. The disease hit hardest in the cities, where it was almost solely a plague of the poor. But there are other sicknesses -- tuberculosis, measles and hepatitis -- that many fear just as much.
Latin American urbanization experts like Mr. Gastal say they are concerned by two trends. Though the rate of growth of the cities has slowed, they say, rural dwellers will continue flocking to them well into the next century, when they could hold 85 to 90 percent of the people. The countryside then will be all but empty.
Just as alarming, population experts are finding that middle-sized cities are also growing quickly, putting a heavy burden on local governments less able to cope with the misery of overcrowding. And the urban sprawl is linking giant cities. Experts say that by the year 2010, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo will be one continuous megalopolis 350 miles long with almost 40 million people.
The current urban growth rate, experts say, means that every year 8 million to 10 million people are either going to cities or being born in cities in the nations south of the United States, most into conditions not unlike those at the Lima shantytown.
"They all should have light, heat, water, medical attention, education, transportation," said Jorge E. Hardoy, director of the Latin American chapter of the International Institute of Environment and Development. "But that is simply impossible. This is why you start with the problems we are seeing."
 
The Rich Live Behind Bars
 The institute estimates that Lima has to absorb 400,000 new people every year; Sao Paulo 450,000, and Buenos Aires 100,000. The strains are evident in every major city.
In Santiago, there is no water treatment plant for industrial or home waste, and no government regulations prohibit the dumping of toxic chemicals by industries.
In Rio de Janeiro, the affluent live behind iron fences and barred windows to protect themselves from rampant street crime. In Caracas, Venezuela, the masses of poor have rallied behind a leader of failed coup attempts against the Government, reflecting their desperation over tough economic policies.
In Mexico City, one of the world's most polluted cities, residents are choked by smog from overcrowding and excessive industrialization. It is estimated that only 40 percent of the 20 million residents have running water and that only 30 percent have sewers.
If the problems can be addressed through government policies and private enterprise, the trend is not necessarily all bad. Many of the nations are experiencing a fundamental change from agricultural economies to economies based more on industry and service, and the recent renewed trend toward stable economies could bring about a decade of job growth. Also, health care and education tend to be better even in the poorest areas of the cities than in the countryside. But problems seem certain to mount.
"We are seeing an incredible social apartheid here," said Herbert de Souza, executive director of the Brazil Institute for Social and Economic Analysis in Rio de Janeiro. "More and more the middle class and the rich have to live isolated from the vast masses of poor, who face violence, sickness and hopelessness." Many are warning that it will not take much to mobilize these masses into a potent and perhaps violent political force.
 
Shining Path Feeds Rush to the Cities
 At the Susana Higushi shantytown, the specter of the Shining Path looms large, though few residents would discuss it. The settlement sits below another shantytown, settled years ago, that has a strong Shining Path presence. Many here think it is only a matter of time before the guerrillas come.
"Everyone thinks everyone is a terrorist," Mr. Ublitas said. "I've been accused of being a terrorist because I am trying to organize here. You just have to go on with your life. They will eventually come and try to do something here. But I think the people will resist."
As in other nations, people flocked to this capital from the countryside in the 1950's and 1960's in search of better jobs, education and health care.
At first, jobs were plentiful. But in the 1980's Peru's Government, like other Latin American governments caught in the debt crisis and rising inflationary spiral, cut off almost all industrial growth. Investment plunged,and poverty began to rise again.
Peru had an added problem: the growing Shining Path violence in the Andean region. The peasants there were caught in the middle, with many killed by either the guerrillas or the army. This created a wave of refugees.
"They were coming to Lima just to survive, not to better their lives," said Mr. Ballon, the urbanization specialist.
Lima had other problems, in particular a lack of city planning and a weak municipal government. Services collapsed from lack of investment and guerrilla sabotage. In the city, 58 percent of the water produced by the state water company is lost, and 20 percent of those who have water obtain it illegally. When water and electricity are rationed, usually as a result of Shining Path sabotage, they are unevenly distributed, with the rich sections getting more than the poor ones.
Now Peru, like other countries, finds that its secondary cities are exploding too. Arequipa, Ilo and Cusco are all expanding at 5 to 8 percent a year.
"The big cities do not offer the same attractions they offered 10 years ago," said Francisco Leon, a United Nations economist. "They are saturated, so people are turning to intermediate cities, but that creates new problems. Where do you get money to provide basic services? You have many of these places that are essentially going from being small villages to complete cities in a matter of years."
 
Forest Is Falling To the Settlers
 And there are potentially long-lasting environmental consequences. One casualty of the Susana Higushi settlement is one of Lima's few natural forests: a stately stand of eucalyptus trees in the desert that surrounds the city. On many nights, one or two of the trees are mysteriously cut down, expanding the borders of the shantytown and at the same time slowly destroying one of the few remaining barriers in Lima to total desertification.
The settlement continues to grow with the arrival of people like Fernando Ortiz, who stood outside his straw hut one day pulling nails out of boards that he planned to use to shore up the structure. He and his wife, Maleni, fled Ayacucho, the cradle of the Shining Path, arriving about a month ago. They had given up a good school for their daughter, a clean hospital and a home with electricity and running water for a patch of dust and a hope that they could avoid guerrilla violence.
Mrs. Ortiz said she was so troubled by the violence that she did not mind losing those amenities. The only thing she really laments, she said, is that her daughter is not speaking her native Quechua, and will inevitably lose much of the cultural heritage of the Indians of the Peruvian Andes.
"In the sierras the people are very strong and alive, and you can feel it in the language," she said. "Here in the city, a lot of that disappears."
But as her husband pointed out, that was a small price to pay. "Many of us don't have a choice," he said. "This is the best we can do right now."

HEADLINE: Saving the Sound: Symbols of Progress

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLD GREENWICH, Conn., Oct. 9

 BODY:
As a damp wind ruffled the waves behind him, Chris Lagano dug busily this afternoon in the sand flats that appear at low tide at Greenwich Point Park here. His back bent, Mr. Lagano, a recent law school graduate, was engrossed in a search for cherrystone and quahog clams, which he deposited proudly in a bucket beside him.
Only recently did this kind of harvest become legal again in Greenwich. Since 1960, the shellfish beds have been closed because of pollution, mainly from sewage, in the Long Island Sound. Because clams, like oysters and mussels, absorb the bacteria in their environments, collecting and eating them was outlawed for health reasons. Because of improvements in local sewage treatment, a few beds were reopened last year, and this year more will be open for a season that runs from October through April. 
 "For years, people have been taking them illegally and a few people have gotten sick," Mr. Lagano said. "You feel safer now. This year is the cleanest I've ever seen the sound."
 
Sign of Improvement
 The return of small-scale shellfish gathering here is a small sign of how a concerted preservation effort has begun to restore Long Island Sound. A host of organizations, large and small, local and national, have made the sound a priority, and people involved in the effort say that because of their work, the estuary is purer in some ways than at any time since the 1960's.
"Certainly, water quality has improved," said Jeff Kane, program coordinator for Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a nonprofit group based in White Plains. "However, our understanding of water quality has also improved, so there are now other things that we need to be concerned about."
Amid the recession, the Sound's chances of remaining a political priority has some experts worried. While the economic slowdown has meant a decrease in demand on sewer systems, for example, many people who are concerned about simply making ends meet may have less sympathy for a body of water that often appears to be doing just fine.
"Communities all along Long Island Sound are bankrupt," said Terry Backer, who heads a nonprofit agency, the Long Island Soundkeeper Fund, and patrols the water in search of polluters. "The recession hurts because you can't make improvements to sewage treatment. But it has helped because it has slowed down development."
 
Controlling Hypoxia
 A major Federal study, scheduled to be completed next month, spent six years and $15 million examining water quality in the sound. Among its recommendations is that more be done to control hypoxia, a low-oxygen condition that kills marine life and is caused by the presence of too much nitrogen in the water. More than half the nitrogen found in Long Island Sound is released by sewage-treatment plants, said Mark Tedesco, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Long Island Sound office, which is to release a management plan for the sound within a few weeks.
As a result, pressure has mounted on local governments to alter their sewage systems so that less nitrogen enters the sound. But such controls, while the simplest to institute, are expensive: at least $6 billion for the region, by one estimate, which is a lot to ask in a time of fiscal constraint.
One plan is to set limits on the amount of nitrogen released by treatment plants. That approach, already under way in Connecticut and New York, has been met with opposition from some who fear it will stymie development, and threaten local tax bases, once the economy turns around.
"We say that it is not going to cause any moratoriums," said David J. Miller, regional vice president of the National Audubon Society, who is based in Albany. At a conference last January held by an alliance of groups interested in protecting the sound, more than 1,100 construction workers formed a picket line, armed with slogans like, "Crabs Don't Vote, People Do" and "One Percent Nitrogen, 35 Percent Unemployment," Mr. Miller recalled.
 
A Consensus Emerges
 But after a meeting between protesters and environmentalists, a consensus emerged. Both sides began calling for the Federal Government to restore its discontinued financing for sewage-treatment plant construction. A bill providing money for such jobs, known as the Clean Water Jobs Act, was introduced in both houses of Congress in March and is expected to be voted on next year, Mr. Miller said.
"It dismisses the myth that it's jobs versus the environment," he said. "It would help not only to clean the water for things like shellfishing, marinas, beaches and tourism, but it would also help the people going to work to rebuild the facilities."
The sound, formed by glaciers over thousands of years, provides a livelihood to thousands of people and recreation to millions more. Measuring 110 miles long by 21 miles wide at its widest point, it includes 577 miles of shoreline and 248 miles of beaches. Fishermen working the sound catch lobsters, bluefish and other seafood; Connecticut produces more oysters than Maryland or Virginia, 750,000 bushels a year, Mr. Backer said.
Mr. Backer is a third-generation commercial fisherman who patrols among lobster boats and oyster vessels whose crewmen he has known for years. He says protecting the Sound is in his blood. But the support for efforts like his comes from recreational users of the estuary as well. "Ten years ago, you'd have been hard pressed to find one or two organizations that were really doing anything about the Sound," he said. "Now almost every harbor has a group concerned about its water quality. There seems to be a new breed of activism."
 
A Regional Approach
 The approach that works best is a regional one, involving New York City officials as well as those from Long Island and Connecticut, experts have said.
Much of the activism comes from local groups. In Greenwich, for example, the local Shellfish Commission helped get officials interested in testing the water for contamination and eventually securing the state's permission to reopen the shellfishing areas. "It shows definite improvement in the sound," said Lucy Jinishian, the commission's chairwoman, who was out today with her bucket and rake, picking up mussels that formed a jagged navy carpet along the shore as the waves receded. Along with the mussels, the sand held pebble-sized snails, an occasional hermit crab, and, every so often, a bone-colored oyster sealed tight against the air.
Mrs. Jinishian, a longtime environmentalist, and her husband, John, are clearly happy to have shellfishing in their town again. "It's quite a glorious thing to see 30 or 40 people out here on a good day, taking clams and oysters," Mr. Jinishian said. "It's something that young kids today can learn to appreciate, instead of thinking shellfish comes in a can or that they have to be afraid of it."

HEADLINE: The Gridlock Congress;
The 102d Will Be Remembered as Much For Its Embarrassments as Its Legislation

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Exit snarling. The 102d Congress left town this week without good humor or credibility, remembered as much for its embarrassments as for its legislation, and notable for battles with President Bush when one side or the other claimed victory but national problems like the recession endured.
This Congress will make the history books, but primarily for foreign policy, for moments when it followed Mr. Bush's lead and voted for war in the Persian Gulf and for peace with Russia, along with foreign aid, after a cold war that had lasted longer than the tenure of almost every Senator or Representative. 
 The vote to authorize Mr. Bush to attack Iraq reasserted the Congressional authority over the war-making power that had languished since the 1950's. The vote to assist Russia and other nations of the former Soviet Union ended more than four decades during which foreign aid was a means of overcoming Moscow in the contest for world power.
In a way, the record of Congress is not all that different from that of the President it confronted: historic in the foreign policy areas that the public is turning away from; slight in domestic areas that worry Americans more and more.
Congress did pass important energy, transportation and health legislation that Mr. Bush signed or will sign. But on grander issues, it did less. It worried about the health care crisis but never brought an important bill to a vote. It passed tax cuts that it hardly believed in, saying it was trying to stimulate the economy.
And on veto issues ranging from abortion to family and medical leave to China's trade status and unemployment benefits, Congress and the President made a political point when they could not solve a problem. Thus together Mr. Bush and Congress brought the term "gridlock" into fashion.
Congress, which gets trivial television attention, has no sense of news management and cannot speak with a clear voice, tended to get the brunt of the blame for mutual inaction.
That differs from its record in the first two years of the Bush Administration. There were tough fights and vetoes. But the 101st Congress negotiated with Mr. Bush, often painfully, and enacted major domestic measures, including the Americans With Disabilities Act, the renewal of the Clean Air Act, broadened immigration policies, child care measures and the 1990 budget law: a political albatross for Mr. Bush but a measure that has clearly succeeded in limiting Federal spending. The deficit has grown anyhow, but because of the recession and the failures in the savings and loan industry.
But things changed in the 102d Congress. Both sides had nearly exhausted the agenda of problems that mattered enough so that compromise, not insistence on first principles, was acceptable. So on Nov. 9, 1990, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said: "There's not a single piece of legislation that needs to be passed in the two years for this President. In fact, if Congress wants to come together, adjourn and leave, it's all right with us. We don't need them."
The joint decision on the war, a rare, eloquent moment when Congress commanded the country's attention, was a signal exception. But for most of this Congress the Administration has lived largely by the Sununu standard, negotiating only when threatened by severe embarrassment, such as a potential veto override.
Congress helped make that possible with a series of scandals that started unfolding last fall. Disclosures that the House had a bank where checks never bounced and a restaurant where some bills lingered on past a Representative's retirement fed the sense that Congress was disconnected from the world where its constituents struggled to get by.
 
Senate Defects Went Public
 But those shabby failures of the House came to the public only indirectly, through reporters and radio talk show hosts.
The Senate put its defects on national television during the Judiciary Committee's hearings on Anita F. Hill's accusation of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas, and both principals' defenders were appalled.
 
An 'Indisputable' Black Eye
 Even Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader and a staunch defender of the way the Senate handled the Thomas nomination, conceded last week that it was "indisputable" that the hearings made the public think less of the Senate. Again, Congress seemed out of touch.
Democratic leaders in Congress argued that the out-of-touch image took hold because Congress was not solving the nation's problems and that that failure, in turn, was caused by what House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington this week called "the obdurate decision of the President to veto so many bills."
Of course, that's a partisan view, just as balanced as this week's argument of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, that Republicans could count this Congress a success because "the most important thing was what we did do in stopping the Democrats' continuing to jack up the deficit."
In fact the Democrats identified the recession and health care as the two chief domestic problems this Congress faced.
No legislation was brought to the floor at all on health care. Mr. Mitchell and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, each tried to forge consensus but found the going rough. They decided that rather than risk failure on the floor it would be better to wait for leadership from the Clinton Administration they expected in January.
The Democrats did pass what they called an economic recovery measure after President Bush demanded one by March 20. His proposal was a tax cut bill, and so was theirs, but for different beneficiaries. The Democratic Congress, wanting to identify with the middle class, aimed to cut their taxes and pay for it by stiffing the rich. Mr. Bush insisted that cutting capital gains taxes would fix the economy.
 
Bush Ridiculed by Republicans
 When Mr. Bush vetoed the Democratic bill, House leaders could not even muster a majority, let alone the constitutionally required two-thirds, to override. But even Senate Republicans had ridiculed the President's plan, saying it was paid for not by soaking anyone but with accounting gimmicks. Neither plan stirred much confidence that it would ease the recession.
If a tax bill could not be made that would promote economic growth, perhaps one could be fashioned to make life better in the cities. At least that is what the Administration and House leaders tried to do in July after the Los Angeles riots. They adopted a bill with Mr. Bush's cherished plan for enterprise zones, in which tax breaks are supposed to bring investment to urban and rural slums.
But by the time the Senate finally got around to passing the bill this week, the political urgency had gone out of the issue. Dozens of other provisions were added, and most of all, Mr. Bush was in such electoral trouble that his aides said he would have to veto the bill because it included tax increases, even some he had once proposed.
Nor would Congress argue that the savings and loan problem had gone away. But it would not vote to put more money into the fund that reimburses depositors. Neither Democrats nor Republicans found such a cause easy to sell at home, and each side blamed the other for not getting the votes to move ahead. A similar mutual inaction was displayed on banking legislation, even though growing bank failures worried most lawmakers.
Aside from its own tarnished image, the biggest cloud over the mood of this Congress was the reality of the deficit. Democrats who wanted to solve problems could not find the money they needed, especially when Republicans and Mr. Bush stood firm against using the 1990 budget act's allowance of "emergency" spending for anti-recessionary measures.
The only real anti-recession legislation enacted was three packages of emergency unemployment benefits, paid for with obscure taxes and creative accounting. But last June, Congress, led by Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, permanently liberalized the existing emergency benefits law to help victims of future slumps.
The budget act's spending limits were maintained by a combination of Bush veto threats and Congressional cuts in military spending. The post-cold-war cuts, however, were smaller than expected because the recession made the military budget an important jobs program. Renewed fights, especially over the cost of troops abroad, are certain next year.
The most creative approach to the money problem was taken in the health field. Congress voted to charge drug companies fees to pay the cost of testing and certifying new drugs. It acted to guarantee public health clinics the same quantity discounts on drugs the Medicaid program receives.
 
Budget Shoe Pinched
 A third measure will reduce those clinics' costs for malpractice insurance by having the Justice Department serve as their lawyer. Liberal Democrats like Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Ron Wyden of Oregon, took the lead in this area but succeeded only with the help of conservative Republicans like Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois.
But most of the time, the budget shoe pinched. For example, the Higher Education Act was cited by both parties' leaders as a Congressional triumph. It greatly expanded the availability of loans to middle-class students, but only pretended to raise Pell grants for the poor as budget realities actually cut maximum grants to $2,300 from $2,400.
The energy bill sent to Mr. Bush this week did little to increase domestic oil production and nothing to order higher automobile mileage standards. Political obstacles were too high. But in almost every area of energy production and use the bill found ways to encourage a changing national philosophy toward energy, for cheaper mortgages for insulated homes to creating demand for alternative fuel cars by directing Federal and state governments to start using them.
 
Transportation Focus Shifted
 The Surface Transportation Act passed last year was more than a highway bill, though at the end it was approved because it promised jobs building roads. The measure shifted the 35-year focus of Federal transportation programs dramatically to allow states to use much more money for mass transit.
Fights over abortion were continual, and indeed 9 of Mr. Bush's 36 vetoes were related to this issue. Congress came close to overriding his bans on federally financed abortion counseling and fetal tissue research. But legislation to block state regulation of abortion itself was kept from the floor for fear of defeat or serious amendment.
The 1991 civil rights bill overturned a raft of Supreme Court decisions that had made it harder for women and minorities to sue over what they said was job discrimination. When a veto override threatened, the Bush Administration retreated and agreed to a measure very close to the one it had denounced as a "quota bill." Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dole, and Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican, forced the Administration's shift.
Mr. Danforth also had a central role in Congress's one sucessful attempt to override a veto, last week's enactment of a bill that would restore some regulation of the cable television industry.
The campaign added bitterness to a debating atmosphere already soured by recriminations over House scandals. But there were some inspiring moments when Congress seized a place in history. This Congress began with the Gulf War debate. And just a week ago the House completed action on legislation to assist Russia through foreign aid and the International Monetary Fund.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader who was completing his 36th year in the House, fought for Republican votes by arguing that the success of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia was essential. After spending billions on the cold war, he said, "having it all go for naught by failing to respond now when the chips are down would be just ridiculous and foolhardy."
When the bill passed, 232 to 164, he had carried a bare majority of his party with him, 78 to 77.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Major Accomplishments of the 102d Congress"
 
DOMESTIC POLICY
 
Civil Rights - Congress and the White House reached agreement on a compromise civil rights bill. The law reverses 1989 Supreme Court rulings that restricted the ability of women and members of minority groups to win job discrimination suits, and it allows punitive damages in sex discrimination cases.
 
Abortion - Congress twice passed legislation that would have lifted the Administration's ban on abortion counseling at federally financed family-planning clinics, but failed to override President Bush's vetoes of the measures. Fear of defeat stalled legislation promised by Democratic leaders to prohibit states from imposing restrictions on abortion. Congress also failed to lift the Government's ban on paying for fetal tissue transplant research when President Bush vetoed the effort. .
 
Family Leave - Congress passed a bill that would have required employers with 50 or more workers to allow up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal and family medical emergencies. President Bush vetoed the bill and Congress failed to override the veto.
 
Transportation - Congress agreed on a compromise bill to provide $151 billion for six years and give states more flexibility in using the money. The bill grants states about $32 billion for mass transportation and $119 billion for highways.
 
Crime - After House and Senate negotiators agreed on a compromise anti-crime package, Senate Republicans effectively killed it with threat of a filibuster. The compromise would have authorized the death penalty for about 50 Federal crimes, restricted death row inmates' ability to challenge their sentences and imposed a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
 
Voter Registration - Congress approved legislation that would enable all citizens to register to vote as they go for driver's licenses and apply for social services at government agencies. President Bush vetoed the measure and Congress failed to override the veto.
 
Cable TV - Congress passed legislation that would authorize regulation of minimum cable service. President Bush vetoed the bill and Congress overrode the veto, the only one of his 36 vetoes in four years it overturned.

Budget - A proposed constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget fell short of the two-thirds vote needed for passage in the House. A last-ditch attempt to revive it in the Senate also failed.
 
Scandal - The House was forced to deal with public criticism over perks and waste when it was revealed that hundreds of its members had routinely overdrawn their accounts at the House bank. No taxpayer money was involved and no checks actually "bounced" because the overdrafts were usually covered by the deposits of other House members. There were also accusations of improprieties at the House post office, and the office records of three members have been subpoenaed by a United States Attorney to determine whether anyone in their offices may have improperly exchanged stamps for cash.
 
Campaign Finance - Congress passed legislation that would have limited spending on Congressional elections, restricted contributions by political action committees and provided Federal funds to candidates who agree to comply with spending limits. President Bush vetoed the bill and Congress failed to override the veto.
 
Energy - Congress approved a bill that calls for new energy efficiency standards, restructures the electric utility industry, makes it easier to license nuclear power plants and promotes gasoline substitutes. Stripped from the bill were the two controversial provisions: one permitting oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the other requiring new fuel-efficiency standards for cars.
 
Education - Congress approved spending $115 billion over five years for higher education programs and made it easier for students from middle-income families to pay for college with government grants and loans. On secondary education, Republicans in the Senate blocked final action on a compromise bill that provided $800 million to states for developing new education plans because it omitted President Bush's proposal to offer parents vouchers for private and parochial schools.
 
Unemployment Benefits - Congress approved three extensions of emergency unemployment benefits -- in November 1991 and February and July 1992. The third extension also included a major change in unemployment laws to make it easier for workers out of a job more than six months to collect extended benefits in future recessions.
 
Health Care - President Bush and Congressional Democrats put forth conflicting plans for addressing the soaring costs of health care. Neither received any action.
 
 
FOREIGN POLICY

Gulf War - In January 1991, after defeating resolutions urging continued reliance on economic sanctions, Congress gave President Bush authority to go to war against Iraq. The vote was 52 to 47 in the Senate and 250 to 183 in the House.
 
START Treaty - The Senate ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that sharply reduces the number of long-range nuclear weapons held by the United States and four republics of the former Soviet Union. Congress also approved legislation limiting nuclear testing.
 
Soviet Aid - Congress approved a $417 million aid package for Russia and other former Soviet republics.
 
Military - Congress agreed to a $274.3 billion military budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 that cancels the B-2 Stealth bomber program and pares back the Star Wars anti-missile defense system.
 
 
ECONOMIC POLICY
 
Banking - Congress twice provided money for the savings and loan bailout, of which $38 billion was used. After the agency's spending authority lapsed last March, Congress declined to provide more money, as neither the lawmakers nor the White House wanted to raise the issue as the Presidential election drew closer. For banks, Congress approved more than $70 billion in loans in November 1991 for the insolvent fund that insures banks and tightened regulations on the industry.
 
Tax Bill - Congress passed a measure that provides $27 billion in tax reductions over five years and a matching amount of tax increases, to avoid increasing the deficit. The bill includes a limited capital-gains tax cut for job-creation in 50 enterprise zones in depressed areas, expands the availability of tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts and repeals luxury taxes on yachts and furs. President Bush is expected to veto the bill because of the tax increases.
 
Trade - The Administration's "fast-track" authority to make trade agreements was renewed so a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico and a 108-nation pact to lower trade barriers could be negotiated. Congress twice approved legislation that would have put conditions on the renewal of China's favorable trade access to the United States market. President Bush vetoed the measures and Congress did not override the vetoes. (pg. 30)

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Baker Re-emerges as Bush's Campaign Chief, Only to Be Hit With Criticism

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD with THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Once the Bush Administration was proud of its collegiality. Now Bush aides and friends paint a picture of a White House awash with scalding leaks and ruthless back-stabbing, with even the President as a target. The intrigue resembles a campaign version of the classic murder-mystery board game Clue.
The White House game board based on accounts of Administration players might look like this: Richard Darman in the West Wing with a noose. James Baker hiding in the conference room with a candlestick. Nicholas Brady in the Treasury with a revolver. (Aimed at Mr. Darman.) The conservatives in the Cabinet room with wrenches. (Looking for Mr. Darman and Mr. Baker.) Mrs. Bush in the library with a lead pipe. (Also looking for Mr. Darman.) President Bush in the Oval Office with a knife. (Gripped in self-defense.) 
 "If this President is done in, and many of us are still hoping and working to see that he is not, then he will have been done worse by those he trusted most," said William J. Bennett, the former Bush Administration official and conservative leader. "This is Shakespearean: Woe is England for here are cynicism, betrayal and treachery, to talk about their President, their friend, their sponsor as the doddering old fool in the attic."
 
Focus Quickly Blurred
 On the eve of the debates, six weeks after James A. Baker 3d came from the State Department to take control of a roiling White House and campaign, things are roiling as much as ever. Campaign officials are upset that while Mr. Baker and his team initially brought a focus on economic issues and a disciplined message, the clarity dissipated soon after Mr. Bush's Sept. 11 speech on his economic vision failed to produce a bump in the polls.
The debate blitz that begins Sunday night could change everything. While the Bush campaign seems to be churning, more interested in strafing attacks on Gov. Bill Clinton's patriotism than in keeping the focus on the economy, the Clinton campaign seems strangely skittish. Mr. Clinton once again finds himself struggling to fit together the pieces of his past -- this time the extent of his involvement in Vietnam War protests while a student at Oxford. Strategists in both parties say they have noticed that the Arkansas Governor's jumpy demeanor seems oddly out of sync with his commanding lead in the polls.
"Clearly, Clinton seems rattled, scared, nervous, elusive and evasive," said James Pinkerton, a Bush campaign official.
At this point, the President's aides are praying for heavenly intervention in the shape of a Clinton debate gaffe or smoking gun out of his past. Until then, the portrait of Mr. Bush has been more poignant than rousing, with the President appearing at lessthan buoyant fund-raising events and on talk shows that he once dismissed as beneath the dignity of his office. While Mr. Bush tried to "go the extra mile," as he puts it, his aides were sarcastically recalling to reporters his claim that he'd gained the momentum in the 1980 primary race against Ronald Reagan: "We've got the Big Mo now." Incumbent Senators have made themselves scarce at Bush rallies.
 
Criticism From Within
 Political circles were consumed with talk of recent articles in The Washington Post by Bob Woodward that offered a highly negative look at the troubled economic policies of the President's first term, compliments of Bush insiders.
President Bush has long considered it a mortal sin for any aide of his to whisper negative comments about him to the press, and he and his family were said to be furious about what they saw as the betrayals of senior aides who were willing to criticize Mr. Bush in articles published only a month before the election. Among other things, Mr. Darman, the budget chief who is still arguing that the 1990 budget deal that broke Mr. Bush's "no new taxes" pledge was the right thing to do, was quoted as saying that the President's repudiation of the deal was "sheer idiocy."
Because the Post articles strongly reflected the point of view of Mr. Darman, and because Mr. Darman and Mr. Woodward are good friends, many in the Administration assumed that the budget director was the source of the biting commentary about Mr. Bush, Mr. Baker and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
In an editorial, The Wall Street Journal called the series "transparently Dick Darman's attempt to set the tone of all future histories of economic policy during the Bush years." And a syndicated column by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak acidly noted that "many argue that Darman has used the nation's most renowned investigative reporter to relate his version of the budget deal at a moment of maximum political peril for the President."
 
'Peculiar Timing'
 Asked on a morning television news show whether the budget chief might resign, Mr. Bush once more defended Mr. Darman, who has been playing Mr. Clinton in debate preparations. But Mr. Bush allowed that the series was "peculiar timing, I will admit."
While some Bush aides were leaving their footprints all too visibly, Mr. Baker remained largely invisible. He has stayed so far in the shadows that some campaign officials who are based at the Bush-Quayle headquarters a block away from the White House complain that they have yet to lay eyes on him; his aides insist that in his six weeks in the White House that he has given no interviews.
Reporters are now humorously tracking "Baker sightings" and comparing him to the elusive cartoon character Waldo.
"Baker's been M.I.A.," said one White House official. "Maybe Ross Perot will find him."
Mr. Baker's team spent the first three weeks putting Mr. Bush's disparate economic proposals into a single package for reviving the economy, entitled "Agenda for American Renewal," which the President presented Sept. 10 at the Economic Club of Detroit. The idea was to provide a basis to compare Mr. Bush's economic ideas and philosophy of governing with those of Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Baker was scheduled to appear on some talk shows on the weekend after Mr. Bush's presentation, but at the last minute he decided not to go on, a move that annoyed and puzzled several White House officials and Bush family members.
"Baker is our best salesman with the press," said one White House official. "If he would have gone out and sold it, the press would have taken it more seriously."
Some inside and outside the campaign mutter that Mr. Baker is keeping a distance, as he has been known to do in the past when disaster looms. But aides say otherwise. Mr. Baker is obsessed with not sullying his statesman's credentials and appears to believe that the less he is seen in public as chief of staff, the more people will remember him as Secretary of State.
On the back of Mr. Baker's chair in the cabinet room are four brass plaques, with the dates of his service. They read Chief of Staff, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, Chief of Staff.
"He would not like that to be his last plaque," said one aide. "His attitude is that 'I am here to help my friend, but my friend has not asked me, and I did not sign up, to be a political hack.' "
A Baker aide cites another factor for his low profile: "It was a no-win situation for him. If he had leapt in with both feet, you all would have been screaming 'Deputy President,' 'Bush can't think for himself; he sends Baker out to do all the heavy lifting.' Then when he doesn't jump out there, you ask why he's hiding."
Nevertheless, Mr. Baker is keenly aware that he does not have Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes, the bare-knuckled strategists of the 1988 campaign, to absorb the criticism of any slashing tactics. Mr. Baker is now in the gun sight for mistakes and for negative campaigning, and he felt the sting of that last week over the meeting he and Mr. Bush had with a group of conservative Congressmen, led by Robert K. Dornan, Republican of California.
Several campaign officials privately fretted afterward that the meeting would be seen as emblematic of a campaign that seemed reduced to personal accusations that even Mr. Dornan and Mr. Bush admitted they did not have all the facts for.
 
Murky Accusations
 For almost two weeks, the far-right Congressional group had been using speeches on the House floor to float murky accusations about Mr. Clinton's visit to Moscow when he was a student at Oxford.
"Who would go to Moscow on a vacation in the dead of winter?" Representative Sam Johnson, the Texas Republican, asked a reporter.
Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who also attended the meeting with Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, said: "We went to the Oval Office because Bush wanted to thank us for standing up for him. He said, 'Thanks for sticking up for me; I appreciate that.' The President said it was not right for him to use his office to get information on who Clinton met with on his Moscow trip. Dornan said, 'If you were L.B.J., you would already have the information.' And the President said, 'Well, I'm not L.B.J. and I'm not going to do it.'
"One thing the President did say was that he could not understand why the American media was not forcing Clinton to answer the question of who he met with in Moscow."
As for Mr. Baker's role, Mr. Hunter said, "The only thing I recall is that Baker just listened politely and was nice to us."
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat, said: "The irony is that James Baker's greatest contribution would have been to remain at State. Bush's re-election depended on his image as a statesman striving to build a new world order. By abandoning that concept, he and Baker squandered Bush's one potential strength. With a sagging economy and a foreign policy without values or goals, they were left with only their worst instincts."
The debates are known around the White House as "Svengali's last shot," referring to Mr. Baker's image.
As one White House official noted: "If it's clear we have not gotten momentum from the three debates, half the White House will turn to 'Jim Baker wasn't so great after all' spinning and the Baker team will turn to 'Everything was such an unbelievable mess before we got here that even Baker couldn't win it.' "

HEADLINE: Two G.O.P. Senators Join D'Amato on the Stump

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato took his television attack ads live today, criticizing his Democratic challenger, Attorney General Robert Abrams, as "hopelessly liberal," in appearances here and in Albany and Buffalo.
Mr. D'Amato, who was accompanied on his campaign swing upstate by fellow Republican Senators Bob Dole of Kansas and Slade Gorton of the State of Washington, also took his Senate-floor filibuster with him. "While my opponent was sleeping," he told a small airport rally in Buffalo, "Senator Moynihan and I were down on that floor fighting for what is right." He denied Mr. Abrams's accusation that his dramatic, but unsuccessful, last-ditch effort last week to amend a tax bill to help keep a Smith-Corona typewriter plant from closing in Cortland was a political move.
 
Talking Politics
 On the ride on a small chartered plane from Buffalo to Rochester, Mr. D'Amato regaled his Senate colleagues with vivid descriptions of his advertisements criticizing Mr. Abrams for taking contributions from donors who do business with the Attorney General's office. Mr. Dole, who is known for an acerbic campaign style, gave him this advice: "Why don't you ask him to step down?" 
 Mr. D'Amato, whose aides said his own internal polls show him ahead of Mr. Abrams, was in high spirits, telling his supporters, "We're not just going to win, we're going to blow him away." Repeating the accusations he has made about Mr. Abrams's call for a universal health plan, Mr. D'Amato said the plan "will put 100,000 New Yorkers out of work -- he'll raise taxes on every single taxpayer in New York."
In Rochester the three Senators attended a $1,000-a-person fund-raising luncheon for Mr. Dole and then went to a veterans' rally, where Mr. D'Amato said Mr. Abrams's health-care plan would eliminate veterans' benefits.
 
President Who?
 Mr. D'Amato, who has distanced himself from George Bush because the President is badly trailing Gov. Bill Clinton in the polls, never mentions him on the stump. But the presence of two well-known Republican Senators at his side brought up the issue of the Presidential race.
Mr. Dole, when asked by local reporters about the President's economic programs, defended Mr. Bush, saying that "the global economy is hurting." He also said the American economy was "getting better, but it's barely perceptible yet." But quietly Mr. Dole told three veterans of his old division in World War II, the 10th Mountain Division, about a bumper sticker he said he was hearing about. Mr. Dole, who ran against Mr., Bush in the early Republican primaries four years ago, said the bumper sticker proclaimed, "Don't blame me, I voted for Dole."

HEADLINE: STRIKE IS AVERTED AT KEY G.M. PLANT

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 10

 BODY:
An agreement that will save at least 250 jobs at a General Motors plant in Indiana has averted a strike that could have closed every G.M. assembly plant in North America.
The settlement, with United Auto Workers Local 663 at the Inland Fisher Guide plant in the town of Anderson, was announced by both sides late Friday. 
 "I am very satisfied with the agreement," said Max Baer, the U.A.W. shop chairman. "Our main concern and focus was jobs for our plant."
The dispute revolved around General Motors' desire to send parts manufacturing to outside suppliers.
Mr. Baer said that about 250 jobs at the plant had been lost recently through such practices or would soon have been lost but that under the pact they would be retained.
 
Crucial Car Parts
 The union, which represents 3,400 of the 4,300 workers at the plant, notified the company this week that they might strike as early as Wednesday.
The plant in Anderson, 35 miles northeast of Indianapolis, is crucial to G.M. production because it supplies exterior lights to most its cars. It also supplies most models with bumpers.
The agreement does not need ratification by union membership.
"I think it's fantastic," said Betty Morgan, assembly worker, as she came off the second shift. "I didn't think we could afford a strike. A strike would have put a lot of people out of work."
Specific details of the settlement were not disclosed, but the company said it had agreed to accelerate implementation of various local demand settlements.
"We have agreed to a timetable which will balance the needs of the membership with the logistics of installing equipment," said Woody Moore Jr., the plant's personnel director.
The U.A.W. has struck General Motors twice since Aug. 27, both times over issues concerning worker cutbacks.
In one of those strikes, a nine-day walkout by the U.A.W. at Lordstown, Ohio, that forced nine assembly plants to shut down, the use of outside suppliers was a central issue. The other, a four-day walkout at a body-making plant in Lansing, Mich., halted production of the Pontiac Grand Am, the company's second best-selling car.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Complex Calls In Muslim Guards

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10

 BODY:
A short walk from the palms and broad sands of Venice Beach is Oakwood, a square-mile pocket of aging bungalows and condominiums where unemployment, drugs and violent crime are part of daily life.
The Shoreline Crips street gang claims this neighborhood as home turf. So does a gang called V-13. Gunfire is common. Prostitutes and crack are available around the clock. 
 It is here that a group affiliated with the Rev. Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam hopes to accomplish what many residents say the police have not -- the ejection of drug dealers without turning the neighborhood against the Muslims.
Last month, the Los Angeles Police Commission awarded the Nation of Islam Security Agency a permit to patrol 15 federally subsidized apartment buildings in Oakwood. The Muslim agency submitted the lowest of six bids for the job.
 
Government to Pay for Force
 The contract is modeled on one under which Muslims patrol several federally subsidized housing projects in high-crime neighborhoods in Washington, a program that has gained national attention. The Federal Government will provide most of the money for the contract in the form of rent subsidies for residents, which will go to the private company that manages the complex, Alliance Housing Management Inc.
The impetus to bring in a private security agency came from apartment residents, who said drug dealers there were out of control. But Jewish groups have protested the award of the contract to the Muslim group, saying the Nation of Islam spreads hatred of Jews and should not receive Federal money.
David Lehrer, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, likened the Nation of Islam to the Ku Klux Klan. "It is a racist, anti-Semite organization," Mr. Lehrer said. "It's not appropriate to hire them to patrol a federally subsidized apartment building."
The Nation of Islam denies that it is racist, describing itself as a religious group that encourages black pride, economic self-sufficiency and discipline.
Under the contract, 14 unarmed Muslim guards will patrol the 256-unit stucco buildings from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. on Wednesdays through Sundays starting in about a month. Ron Nelson, a spokesman for the apartment management, said the patrol hours might later be expanded, depending on the need. Most of the problems occur at night.
Instead of their trademark suits and bow ties, the Muslims will wear slate-gray uniforms and badges and carry identification.
 
Blacks Welcome Muslims
 The group will be paid $53,676 a month. The Government's increased rent subsidies will cover most of the costs, although the six residents not receiving the Government assistance will see their monthly rent increased by about $150 each, said Regina Hyman, president of the Holiday Venice Tenants Action Committee.
Ms. Hyman and other black tenants were enthusiastic about the Nation of Islam guards, saying that with their emphasis on discipline, they would be a steadying influence for young people.
"The Nation carries respect because they give it," said Ms. Hyman, the mother of three. "They are courteous, and we know they won't just look the other way."
Anthony Michaels, 22, an apartment resident for 16 years, said: "People out here, even the drug dealers, respect the Nation. More than the police."
Mr. Michaels said outsiders use his building to store, distribute and sell crack. Ten bullet holes dot his building's facade, strays from a recent drug-related shootout.
"It's not a gang thing; it's about guys who want to make money," Mr. Michaels said. "The dope is flying. People come by here to do pickups everyday. White customers mostly."
Of the 15 buildings, the police say three are prime drug havens, supplying crack to homeless people, residents and a surprisingly large clientele of young affluent people from Santa Monica, the San Fernando Valley and even Beverly Hills.
The only security at the complex now is provided by one person, who is on duty primarily during the day, and by the police, who Ms. Hyman said patrol the area but rarely go into the apartment buildings.
 
Doubts in Hispanic Groups
 Hispanic groups have questioned how the Muslim guards will get long with the large Hispanic population in the apartment complex and the surrounding community. In particular they cite the language barrier.
About 40 percent of the estimated 1,000 people in the 15 buildings are Hispanic residents, many of who speak only Spanish. Blacks account for nearly 60 percent. The Oakwood neighborhood is home to about 9,200 people, 25 percent of them white, 22 percent black and 45 percent Hispanic.
Ms. Hyman said the majority of Hispanic residents in the apartments favor the Muslim patrols, at least over the police.
But Yolanda Becerra Jones, a director at Catholic Charities in Venice, said she knows several Hispanic families in the buildings who are "more than cautious" about the Muslim guards.
"They are very reluctant to put their two cents in," Ms. Jones said. "All of this is foreign to them. This is more than just a little intimidating. They don't even know what the Nation of Islam is. They don't trust anyone right now. They're very into just trying to get along."
 
'More Calming Environment'
 Abdul Arif Muhammed of Washington, the spokesman for the Nation of Islam Security Agency, said: "We respect every member of the community. It goes beyond just standing guard. We will bring a peaceful, more calming environment."
The Muslim security agency has an office in Los Angeles. A telephone message left for the head of the office was not returned.
In Washington, the Muslims are credited by tenants with improving conditions at two housing projects where they have been patroling for about four years, Mayfair Mansions and Paradise Manor. Tenants generally approve of their work at another complex, Clifton Terrace, where they have been patroling for about a year. Lieut. Kent Setty of the Los Angeles Police Department, who regularly conducts drug sweeps in Oakwood, said the police would get along with the Muslim guards as long as they operated within the law and according to their contract.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
D'Amato's Barrage: Smart Bombs or Smoke?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Like a squadron of angry bumblebees, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's campaign commercials have buzzed for days around the head of his rival in the New York Senate race, circling and stinging Robert Abrams in a shifting mix of attacks so sudden that he can barely breathe before the next sound bite.
Some of the ads are nasty, brutish and short -- just 10 seconds -- yet funny, too. Others are longer -- 30 seconds -- and meaner. No fewer than 10 ads have run on television in the last 25 days, and together with others on radio, they cost about $1 million a week to broadcast in the 10 media markets statewide. 
 These buzz bombs have different shadings, but share two overriding themes: Mr. Abrams is slippery, and he will raise your taxes, big time. And though they often stretch the truth, they may be working.
Mr. Abrams, the State Attorney General, dismisses the ads as gross distortions of his views, but he has watched what the polls once suggested might be a commanding lead slip into a close race, with Mr. Abrams only slightly ahead at best, according to several recent surveys.
"They're just pounding and pounding and pounding," Hank Morris, a Democratic political consultant not working for either camp, said of Mr. D'Amato's ads. "Every time Abrams has a chance to come up for air, they pull him under the water again."
The D'Amato assault has escalated slowly, beginning this summer with friendly radio commercials to polish an image tarnished by years of controversies over what were said to be favors for contributors. Those ads stressed the Senator's reputation for constituent service, chronicling his helping a fisherman and a disabled veteran, among others.
Then, the day after the Democratic primary, he unleashed a series of television commercials, including two testimonials by one of the state's most famous Democrats, former Mayor Edward I. Koch, and stiff attacks on his rival, introducing the tag line: "Bob Abrams: Hopelessly Liberal." To that he has now added, "Bob Abrams: Hopelessly Political."
Can "Bob Abrams: Hopeless" be far behind?
The D'Amato strategy is a testament to his fat war chest -- nearly $4 million when the general election campaign began, compared with $750,000 for Mr. Abrams -- and the short attention spans of voters in this busy political year. The fact is, the Senator's aides say, Mr. D'Amato has so much more money than Mr. Abrams that he can afford to run his ads so often that viewers might easily see them half a dozen times in a week or 10 days -- and after that, the impact diminishes.
 
War of Attrition
 So the D'Amato video mavens have varied the mix -- rotating ads, and they plan to introduce new ones every other day or so. They chose to use three humorous 10-second ads mocking Mr. Abrams as a tax-and-spender -- in which a mother in a kitchen drops and breaks a plate and a mechanic working under the hood of a pickup bumps his head at the mention of taxes -- because they wanted to defeat even the fastest remote-control channel clickers. They would have bought five-second ads, but no station would sell them such short snippets of time.
The Senator's campaign manager, Kieran Mahoney, said of the commercials, "It's going to take a lot of ads to explore the depths of Bob Abrams's liberalism." Privately, a top D'Amato aide was more to the point: "In a war of attrition, the guy with the most soldiers wins."
Such a Gatling gun approach is not uncommon for a candidate with plenty of money, political consultants say.
"We've been doing it for a long time, usually 15, 20, even 35 ads in a campaign," said David Garth, the veteran New York media consultant who is working this year on the re-election campaign of Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican. "It's a question of keeping your opponent off balance, and the Abrams campaign is at a real disadvantage because of the money factor."
Mr. Garth recalled that in the 1989 Democratic mayoral primary, he ran more than a dozen different television ads, most of them 60 seconds, that helped propel his client, Mr. Koch, a wounded three-term incumbent, from 17-point support in the polls to 42 points in just six weeks, though not to victory over David N. Dinkins.
Mr. Garth said that very short ads were tricky to do ("I can't even say hello in 10 seconds"). But he noted that the variations in Mr. D'Amato's ads, as well as their humor, seemed almost a relief in a sour political year, and especially after the Democratic Senate primary campaign, in which harsh ads by Mr. Abrams and the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, attacking Geraldine A. Ferraro often resembled each other.
"Not only were there a lot of negative spots, but the spots looked alike," he said. "If I saw one more box moving from right to left on the screen I was going to go into the shipping business."
But some Democrats say Mr. D'Amato may have done them a favor last week, when he began broadcasting a 30-second ad that uses a news clip of Ms. Ferraro criticizing Mr. Abrams's fund-raising practices during a televised debate in the primary. Ms. Ferraro, angry at her narrow defeat and Mr. Abrams's attacks on her family finances and integrity, has declined to endorse him. But Mr. D'Amato's ad prodded her into making some of her harshest comments against the Republican candidate, and talks continue on an endorsement.
"We came out of the primary with problems, but I think we may have hit a turning point these last few days," said the State Democratic chairman, John A. Marino. "I think this is the kind of thing where Gerry has to look at this and say, 'Al D'Amato doesn't belong in the Senate, and right now there's only one other person who can be there, and that's Bob Abrams.' So I'm optimistic."
An endorsement by Ms. Ferraro could help Mr. Abrams blunt any further efforts by Mr. D'Amato to paint him as a nasty campaigner.
 
Abrams Plans Ads
 Mr. Morris and Mr. Garth said the Abrams camp should not even try to rebut each of Mr. D'Amato's attacks but should create strong new themes of its own instead, since Mr. Abram's daily responses in press news releases or talks with reporters are little match for the commercials' noise on the airwaves. With far less money in the bank, Mr. Abrams is saving whatever advertising thunder he can muster for the final stretch of the campaign; -- and so far he has so far run only two ads, in a handful of markets.
Abrams aides say their advertising is to begin in earnest soon, stressing the Attorney General's affiliation with the national Democratic ticket, which is running well ahead in the state, and Mr. D'Amato's ties to the Bush Administration and the economic policies of the last 12 years, and highlighting Mr. Abrams's support for abortion rights and a national health insurance plan. Mr. D'Amato has zeroed in on this last point as guaranteed to lead to higher personal income taxes, but Mr. Abrams insists he would not favor that.
"We've been spending a lot of time raising money, so that we will have the wherewithal to begin communicating our message," said Ethan Geto, the Abrams campaign director, who also saved the campaign's advertising money for the final two weeks of the primary campaign. "We don't have enough fuel to fly our air force for the entire seven weeks of the battle, so we've chosen to fly it mostly in the final weeks." He added, "I'm encouraged by the fact that after his multimillion-dollar blitz, we're still walking around, and probably ahead of him."

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING;
Will Conner Jump America's Cup Ship and Set Sail for Italy?

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
The so-called hired guns of America's Cup yacht racing, the skippers who sail for countries other than their own, may find that their ranks have swelled when the next Cup match comes around in 1995. Not the least among the new recruits could be Dennis Conner.
Conner has refused to reveal his plans, but there are indications he is being considered as helmsman for an Italian challenge. The possible Italian effort would be backed by Montedison, a multibillion-dollar chemical products firm based in Milan. 
 "Anyone in his right mind would be foolish not to consider an offer," Conner said in a telephone interview on Friday. "But there's no deal."
 
Will They or Won't They?
 Conner declined to comment on whether he had met with Montedison officials. But he alluded to the trouble he has had in recent years raising money for an America's Cup campaign. In the 1992 series in San Diego, he was able to build only one boat while others built four or five.
In recent weeks, the international sailing community has been abuzz with talk of Conner's potential defection. Gerry Driscoll, a former America's Cup skipper who is the San Diego Yacht Club's director for challenger relations, said last week that the Montedison group apparently has not decided yet whether it will mount a 1995 Cup campaign. But Italian officials seem to be testing the waters.
"They are definitely talking to Dennis, and they have talked to Chris Dickson and Rod Davis about skippering a boat for Montedison," Driscoll said. Dickson, a New Zealander, sailed as a hired gun for Japan's Nippon in the 1992 Cup trial races. Davis, an American who grew up in San Diego, competed in the same trials as a helmsman for New Zealand.
Montedison has until Nov. 12, the deadline for all challengers to file bids. The group would be required to pay a $75,000 entry fee at that time. The company declined to comment last week on its Cup plans.
Officials from Montedison met with Driscoll recently to ask for a three-week extension on a decision whether to rent space at the Driscoll Boat Yard. Driscoll rented space at the waterfront site to Montedison's 1992 Il Moro di Venezia syndicate, which won the right to challenge for the Cup.
So far, six syndicates have been accepted as challengers. They include teams from Australia, France, Japan, Russia, Spain and a group from Italy organized by Raul Gardini, the former chairman of Il Moro's challenge.
 
Conner's Experience Valuable
 Gardini, who was chairman of Montedison before being ousted last year in a family feud, has entered his new challenge under the banner of the Europa Yacht Club of Venice. Joining with him is Paul Cayard, an American Cup veteran who was considered Italy's hired gun in 1992.
Without the expertise of Gardini, who is a yachtsman, or Cayard, an experienced helmsman and team leader, the Montedison group may lack direction. Conner presumably could bring the focus the Italians need. But they still must decide whether it is worth the $100 million price tag they are estimated to have spent for their America's Cup effort last time. Montedison, which had revenues of about $18 billion in 1990, reportedly has been in a down cycle for the last year.
Conner, meanwhile, is preparing for his debut in the Whitbread Around the World Race, which begins next September in England. He is building his boat, a 60-foot sloop that is being sponsored by Winston cigarettes, at the Gianni Varasi boat yard in Venice, Italy.
"I might not sail in the America's Cup at all," Conner said Friday. "I've switched my focus to the Whitbread."
It is highly unlikely that Conner would skip a chance to sail in the America's Cup. He has raced six times since 1974 for the United States in the Cup. Five campaigns were to defend the 141-year-old trophy; another was to challenge Australia for the Cup after having lost it in 1983.
Conner's presence on a foreign America's Cup team would greatly enhance the group's chances for success, but it also would undoubtedly strike a heavy blow to traditionalists in the sport, particularly among American yachtsmen.
Through the years, Conner has woven patriotism into the fabric of his campaigns. His boats have been named Stars & Stripes, and his team has sported red, white and blue uniforms. He virtually wrapped himself and his crew in the flag after winning back the Cup in 1987, saying, "This is a great moment for America, a great moment for the Stars & Stripes team." The theme has played well for Conner in corporate America, but now, with the recession, companies have been less willing to step on the Stars & Stripes bandwagon.
"I'm an American, but I'm also a competitor," Conner said Friday.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Walker Seeking Minimum Of Pros

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Oct. 10

 BODY:
LeRoy Walker, who will be elected president of the United States Olympic Committee on Sunday, is already spending much of his time deflecting the Olympic flirtations of market-conscious professional sports leagues in North America.
Walker said today that he would meet next week in Atlanta with David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association, to try to diffuse their differences and work out a compromise, through the USA Basketball federation, that would halve the league's participation at the 1996 Olympic Games. 
 He met with Bill White, president of the National League, in Atlanta at the first playoff game between the Braves and the Pirates. In another scheduled talk, before a Game 6 in Atlanta, Walker will try to convince White that a College World Series team would be a more appropriate Olympic representative than a major league or minor league all-star team.
 
Suspicious of N.H.L. Overtures
 Walker also said that he was suspicious of the National Hockey League's overtures toward the Winter Olympics, and that he was concerned by a public campaign from the league's president, Gil Stein, to use the Games as a method of publicizing the league's quality of play.
"If they say it openly, I'm disturbed about it," Walker said about the N.H.L.'s attitude, expressed in broadcasts by Stein.
"I hope the N.H.L. doesn't throw something together," Walker added. "There has to be some sense of sanity about it. They have to go through the membership."
Any final decision about the involvement of American hockey pros in the Olympics has to be made by USA Hockey, this country's federation.
Walker, speaking to a few reporters between sessions of the United States Olympic Committee Congress, said he was "appalled" at how many people had complained to him about the participation of the Dream Team -- the United States basketball team, made up primarily of N.B.A. players -- in the recent Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.
 
'Like Watching the Globetrotters'
 "After five minutes, they turned off the basketball games," Walker said. "It was like watching the Globetrotters."
When Walker meets with Stern, he said, he expects a degree of cooperation from the commissioner.
"Dave and I both agree to get this behind us," Walker said. "It gets both of us bashed. All we want is what's good for the sport. He would agree not to disenfranchise a whole group of people."
Walker, who was chief of mission for the United States delegation at Barcelona, envisions a United States Olympic basketball team composed of six N.B.A. players and six college players. He does not see that 50-50 option for baseball, because major league baseball would have to disrupt its season for the Olympics and free players from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Canada, Puerto Rico and other participating national teams.
Walker said the College World Series champions, with the possible addition of a few top players, would be a worthy representative of the United States. "They've played 65 games together," he said.
On the eve of his unopposed election, Walker addressed issues beyond the attempted inroads by professional sports. He said the possibility of a new President in Washington did not concern him, that he would expect continued support from a Democratic or Republican administration. He is worried more about raising money in a slumping economy.
"I don't know how long a sponsor like I.B.M. can lay off 20,000 people and then give $40 million to the Olympic movement," Walker said.
Walker said he would continue to push for a $1 check-off for taxpayers toward the United States Olympic Team, but he admitted that opponents of this were legitimately concerned that other worthy organizations, like the Red Cross, could demand the same.
Walker's most passionate issue remained his commitment to some sense of amateurism in the Olympic movement, even in the face of professional league entrepreneurs.
"We have to change, but most of us don't want to lose that feeling of Christmas in wintertime," Walker said. "People believe in Santa Claus, even when it's not true. Let's not lose amateurism completely."

 
 
Olympic Cutback Suggested
 In addition to officer elections, the United States Olympic Committee Board of Directors will decide on Sunday whether to decrease the number of American athletes traveling to future Games. RALPH HALE, a vice presidential candidate and chairman of the Games Preparation and Services Committee, is recommending that the U.S.O.C. cut back the number by no longer filling all maximum quotas set by the International Olympic Committee. Hale would also like to see fewer discretionary picks, avoiding the sort of mess that occurred for the United States in bobsledding at Albertville, France.

HEADLINE: The Need for Federal Earthquake Reinsurance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter Kerr's article "How Big a Disaster Can Insurers Survive?" (Sept. 13) discusses the reasons the insurance industry could be severely impaired by a catastrophic earthquake that might cause $40 billion or more in insured damages. 
 The article fails to explain, however, the real importance of establishing a Federal earthquake reinsurance facility to complement coverage offered by the private sector. Far from being an excuse for insurers not to maintain sufficient capital, or functioning as a "social insurance mechanism," as two of the article's sources contend, such a facility is a vital element of an earthquake-preparedness plan.
There is only a finite amount of capital in the insurance industry, and it would be foolish to believe that a disaster or combination of disasters could not occur that would be beyond the capacity of the private sector to handle. It is for this reason that we and others have advocated creating a Federally chartered reinsurance facility to ensure the capacity would be available for the nation to cope with such a devastating loss.
Such a "reinsurer of last resort" would function much as the Federal Reserve does as a "lender of last resort" to the banking industry. Private insurers would pay commercial rates to the Federally chartered reinsurer for a high layer of coverage that would come into play in the event the industry's losses from an earthquake exceed some predetermined large figure.
With proper foresight and planning, we can establish a mechanism to contain the damages our nation would suffer from a catastrophic quake. This would not be a bailout of the insurance industry by the taxpayers; on the contrary, it would ensure the survival of our economy and financial system when the inevitable catastrophic earthquake occurs.

HEADLINE: What Happened to Campaign Reform?

BYLINE: By The Candidates and the Anger

 BODY:
"It's the economy, stupid." Recent polls demonstrate the wisdom of that blunt sign in Bill Clinton's headquarters. When voters are asked what issue they most want the candidates to talk about, almost 60 percent cite economic concerns as Topic A (compared with only 4 percent for Topic B, education).
Understandably, then, President Bush, Governor Clinton and Ross Perot will devote much of their first debate tonight to hot economic argument. Even so, another issue that provokes voter anger deserves the candidates' attention tonight: reclaiming control of the political system from the grip of money and privilege. 
 Why have voters come to hate politics so strongly? As the Kettering Foundation found in 1991, one big reason is they feel the system is controlled not by votes but by rich special interests. People have become so frustrated that they "talk as though our political system had been taken over by alien beings."
The candidates recognize that anger. Indeed, in his campaign book, Bill Clinton gives it precedence: "We cannot put people first and create jobs and economic growth without a revolution in government. We must take away power from the entrenched bureaucracies and special interests that dominate Washington."
Ross Perot recognizes the anger. In his book, he says that "Our political system has lost its moorings" and urges strict limits on campaign contributions and political action committees.
President Bush recognizes the anger. Last May he brassily professed his belief that "our Nation needs campaign finance laws that place the interests of individual citizens and political parties above special interests." He said that, without blinking, even while vetoing the best campaign reform bill in a generation.
But even putting all the oratory aside, the three candidates have let campaign finance reform slip off the agenda. With all the anger, tonight's the night to put it back. The system's broke; how would they fix it?
Several remedies are obvious. They include campaign spending limits . . . tight limits on PAC's . . . and shutting the "sewer money" loophole that has seen Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton each accept $55 million in public funds while hustling for backdoor $100,000 contributions.
Mr. Perot achieved much of his early popularity by tapping the discontent with money politics. But his reform zeal is shadowed by an obvious anomaly: As a billionaire willing to fund his own campaign, he fails to recognize the need for spending limits and public financing.
Mr. Bush has so far offered only flimsy arguments against spending limits and public financing of Congressional campaigns. After his dismaying veto, voters have a right to know whether, if re-elected, he'd finally budge.
So far, only Mr. Clinton supports comprehensive reform. But reservations remain. If elected, his willingness to stop the flow of sewer money could be severely tested. The Democrats are now raking in more of it, for a change, and party leaders anticipate a bonanza if Mr. Clinton wins.
He could earn credibility now with a commitment that, if elected, this and other political finance reforms would be essential elements of his first hundred days.

HEADLINE: OCT. 4-10: Overridden at Last;
Congress Defies Bush Over Cable Rates

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
It took four years, but as Congress left town last week it finally overrode one of President Bush's vetoes, his 36th. But that was hardly an epochal moment over an issue like abortion, one that defines political fault lines in the capital.
Instead, the override enacted legislation that would reregulate the cable television industry. For Mr. Bush, the issue may have been philosophical -- the idea that regulation is intrinsically bad for the economy was his basic argument against the bill. But for the two-thirds majorities -- 74 to 25 in the Senate and 308 to 114 in the House -- who overrode the veto, that was beside the political point. 
 The question could be seen, as Senator Brock Adams, Democrat of Washington, put it, as "one issue and one issue only -- greed." Cable companies are among the most vulnerable of political targets. So even if no one expects the bill to do more than slow the speed at which rates increase, it was an obvious vote for most incumbents worried about re-election.
The veto was overridden for two reasons: Republicans did not heed pleas to help their President and Democrats delighted in the chance to show, as Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana put it, that "this Congress can deliver for the people of this country.
"If we can't give them a tax break," he said, "we can give them a break in their cable rates."

HEADLINE: Saving the Children Isn't Half Enough

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Shortchanging the World's Children" (editorial, Sept. 17) reminds us that in September 1990 more than 70 heads of state met at the United Nations about the world's children. They set goals and pledged support to reduce the infant mortality rate by one-third and the child malnutrition rate by 50 percent, and to insure basic education for 80 percent. What is regrettable is not just that the United States contribution is falling $100 million short of the stipulated support. 
 The real regret is that the summit's goals are so shortsighted, sentimentally defined and neglectful of real conditions and trends.
In third world countries, where population is growing nearly 3 percent a year, and far outruns the means of absorbing, employing and supporting the annual increments, what will be the result of cutting infant mortality by one-third? It will be mainly a jump in the population growth rate to about 4 percent; and an intensified accumulation of these children in the rural and urban slums festering in poverty, disease, prostitution, crime and other forms of misery, as we see in Peru, Mexico City, Calcutta and much of Africa.
In the stagnant or slow-growing countries, what will be the ocupations for those children who would be saved from early death, strengthened by better nutrition, and educated to literacy and numeracy? They will suffer through their short life expectancy, or revolt impotently or in organized violent movements like Shining Path; or stream into illegal migration -- to the United States, Western Europe or other enclaves of relative prosperity.
The implication here is not to abandon those suffering children. It is rather: (a) to link up remedial actions with preventive actions -- chiefly family planning, contraception, delayed marriage, old-age support (to reduce reliance upon a few surviving children); (b) to plan the remedial actions to stress skill training and well-paying jobs, also housing, medical care and social security, and (c) to program the contributions on a scale suited to remedying these problems, not just to making limited improvements that lead to exacerbated misery.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Row-Housing in Jamaica;
A Home-Building Program Gains Steam

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN housing circles, the talk is of affordability when discussion turns to the new houses for moderate-income New Yorkers that are spreading in well-dispersed neighborhoods citywide. Herbert H. Warman, an architect with offices in Great Neck, L.I., has had to deal with the design aspect of that issue. Design can get short shrift in low-cost housing.
Mr. Warman has designed the houses for a development called Arlington Terrace Homes in Jamaica, Queens. The first phase of Arlington Terrace consisted of semi-detached two-families. But for the second phase, now going into construction, the builder, the Bluestone Organization, based in Flushing, Queens, was asked by Community Board 12 and Borough President Claire Shulman to produce row housing to provide a somewhat higher density. 
 To avoid the monotonous barracks-like look of much new attached low-rise housing, Mr. Warman recessed the buildings behind brick entrances that have common raised porches and separate entrances to the upstairs and downstairs units within. Above the entrances are extended sections of the upstairs units, bearing asphalt-shingle mansard facades and dormer windows.
"In this style of housing, you've got to make every square inch do something, functionally and visually," said Mr. Warman.
Arlington Terrace is doing something in a different sense as well. It is bringing new housing to the heart of what was once called South Jamaica, a name now avoided by housing marketeers because of past associations with junkyards and assorted low-end industrial activities. Most of the land was designated for urban renewal years ago. That revitalization plan had brought forth York Community College and downtown growth and improvement in Jamaica Center, but little new housing until the three-phase Arlington Terrace development started.
Now the development is calling attention to the burst of new-home construction under way in Jamaica, most of it two-family housing. It has been made possible not merely by the existence of subsidy programs but also by the growth of an effective housing-delivery system. That means everything from site clearance and development through financing, construction, sales and on-time delivery of completed homes.
Through the New York Housing Partnership alone, 271 units have been completed and occupied since the late 80's; 423 more are in construction or have designated developers, and developer proposals are being sought for 156 more. That comes to 850 units. The Partnership is a nonprofit corporation that acts as an intermediary between private builders and city government in spurring development on city-owned land.
The Partnership-assisted housing typically gets city and state subsidies totaling $25,000 a unit. More recently, Borough Presidents in New York have committed some of their discretionary funds to help people who must be relocated from old housing in development sites.
IN the wider Jamaica area, not all new construction occurs with public subsidies. M. & S. Development Company, the building arm of E.R.A. M. & S. Realty Group, based in Rosedale, Queens, is building 41 semi-attached two-family houses and a small shopping center in the Rochdale Village section of Jamaica, on Baisley Boulevard and 167th Street. They sell for $185,000 to $220,000, to buyers with typical incomes upwards of $51,000. The architect is John Stacom of Bayside, Queens.
M. & S. Development has built 400 two-family houses, or 800 housing units, over the last eight years on lots in Jamaica, the company said.
"Once you start developing, other people sitting on land begin developing also," said Barbara Alexander, a housing consultant who served as executive director of the Allen A.M.E. Neighborhood Preservation and Development Corporation in Jamaica. "There's a spillover effect."
Through the corporation as community sponsor, about 150 houses were sold in Jamaica, Ms. Alexander said. Almost half went to buyers from outside Jamaica itself. About a third of the buyers hold city or other public service jobs.
The Arlington Terrace houses are marketed through another community organization, Southeast Queens Clergy for Community Empowerment Inc. Barbara Cheatham, its marketing director, said that in the sales program for the first 22-house phase of the development, 14 families had moved in and three others had received mortgage commitments and were waiting for construction completion. Typically, prices are $150,000 to $155,000 and buyers pay 5 percent down and get rent from a tenant of $750 to $900 a month. The buyers need about $12,000 to pay all closing costs.
Part of the delivery system is the financing available to buyers, normally arranged by the builder. In this case the commitment was obtained from Republic National Bank, which is offering favorable terms under what it calls a special program for this development -- 8 percent loans (50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points below the going rate) with no extra points charged at closing.
"REPUBLIC is growing on the retail end," said Phyllis Rosenblum, the bank's community affairs officer. It has also financed Partnership developments in the Williamsburg and Flatbush sections of Brooklyn and the Melrose section of the Bronx.
She also said that at least 40 to 50 percent of potential buyers interviewed had serious credit problems. Financial counseling is a requirement for all borrowers.
As with other lenders to moderate-income buyers, Republic has sought to stretch lending standards for home buyers. The tradition is that housing debt should not exceed 28 percent of income and 36 percent of total debt.
But some lenders have gone to a "33-38" standard. After a four-year experience, Ms. Rosenblum said, there have been no losses or foreclosures. "So far so good," she said.
The family composition of the 17 buyers at Arlington Terrace is mixed. Three are Hispanic, two are Asian and the rest are black. There are six single female buyers, four single males, four husband-and-wife households, one mother-daughter household and one sister-sister household.
The occupations represented include postal worker, transit worker, teacher, nurse, architect, cable-installer, secretary and health-care workers.
For the second phase of construction, the attached housing, the Bluestone Organization is shifting to concrete-plank, fireproof buildings.
"We could have built wood," said Eli Bluestone, "but lumber prices are way up and plank is down."
The attached housing will provide one parking bay for each two-family house. On the street, cars will be able to park between curb cuts. It is not the type of design that makes for a superior streetscape, and it has grown common in most attached affordable-housing developments in the city. It is what the buyers want, the sales people say.
But the growth in attached low-rise housing on 60-foot-wide streets that are not heavily traveled offers an opportunity for improved site planning, in the opinion of Mr. Warman, the Arlington Terrace architect.
Without hurting traffic flow, the city and the developer could engage in an easement exchange: Curbs would be pushed foward toward the house and remain unbroken, and home owners would park their cars facing the curb. The disappearnace of parking pads would lead to a superior streetscape.
"We ought to find a way to increase parking, provide space for more tree planting and landscaping and get the cars out of the way of the pedestrians," Mr. Warman said.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
On the Road? Vote Anyway

 BODY:
About 10 million Americans are away from home each Election Day, according to the Vote America Foundation. The foundation, dedicated to increasing voter participation, reminds those travelers who are registered voters that they can cast their ballots anyway.
Details of absentee voting vary by state so absentee voters should call their local board of elections (usually listed in the blue pages in the back of telephone books) for details. But these are the basics, according to the foundation: To get an absentee ballot by mail, send a letter requesting one at least week before you will be leaving. The letter should include your full name, address at which you are registered, Social Security number, birth date and a signature of your full name. Absentee ballots sent by mail must be postmarked the day before Election Day and be received within seven days of the election. 
 There is another, easier option, recommended by the foundation: voting early. Every state except Pennsylvania allows those who say they will be away from home on Election Day to fill out an absentee ballot at the local board of elections or county clerk's office. In most states, this can be done as long as 21 days in advance. Many states open those offices on the Saturday before Election Day.
In New York City voters can call (212) 867-3692 to find out the number of their local board of elections office. Applications must be requested by Oct. 27 this year.
 Would we be afflicted with four more years of the same foreign policy that does business-as-usual with dictators, and shies from creating an international "right to intervene" when tyrants wage war on dissidents? Two weeks ago, Tim Russert of NBC asked me on "Meet the Press" what question I would put to the President; I wanted to know if he planned to reappoint James Baker as Secretary of State -- which would be a sure sign of no change to come. Within hours, an alert Larry King popped that question to Bush, who said yes. The prospect of Baker and his crew at Foggy Bottom again was a real downer.
 Would defection in 1992 make it harder for a conservative to fight for "the soul of the party" in 1996? Pat Buchanan, building a movement to capture the Republican Party for his isolationist-abroad, intrusionist-at-home nativism, will be able to say he loyally stuck with a ticket he despised. Republicans who bolt in 1992, however, would have a hard time calling on the loyalty of the far right, after the 1996 primaries, to rally behind a reasonable party choice in the general election. The argument for sticking: You don't protect a Big Tent by leaving it.
 Would a second-term Bush, no longer needing to gamble on truckling to the far right, lead his Administration to the forefront of individual rights and personal freedom -- and against the intrusion of Big Government and majoritarian morality? I have been a Bush-watcher for lo these many years, and your guess is as good as mine. My guess is no.
That's where the Bush campaign leaves me and my ilk: we're torn between loyalty and ideology, habit and irritation -- and could go either way. (Is this what life is like for Mario Cuomo?) Neither Perot nor staying home is an option. We will closely watch Bush reveal himself in the final weeks, cock a skeptical ear to the Clinton call and make a decision inside the voting booth -- putting a clothespin in our pocket just in case.

An article in The Times Magazine last Sunday about President Bush gave an incomplete account of Spiro T. Agnew's role in Mr. Bush's 1970 senatorial campaign in Texas. Mr. Agnew, then Vice President, campaigned briefly for Mr. Bush. The author, William Safire, worked for President Richard M. Nixon then. As the article notes, Bryce N. Harlow, a Nixon aide, said Mr. Bush had rejected Mr. Agnew's offer to help. But shortly afterward, the Bush campaign did accept Mr. Agnew's aid for a limited number of appearances.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
D'Amato: 19 Words on Abrams and Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:

THE SCRIPT
Narrator: "Bob Abrams wants a 30 percent increase in spending, and that can only mean higher taxes and fewer jobs."
 
On the Screen: A mechanic is working under the hood of a pickup truck. At the end of the audio track, steam rises from the radiator, and the mechanic hits his head on the hood.
 

Producer: Russo, Marsh Associates of Sacramento, Calif.
 
Accuracy: The ad reaches a conclusion based on Senator Alphonse M. D'Amato's assertion that Mr. Abrams's support for a pending national health insurance plan in Congress would guarantee higher personal taxes. Mr. Abrams maintains that the plan could be financed through a new payroll tax on employers (in lieu of the private insurance premiums they now pay) and new taxes on alcohol, tobacco and corporations.
Mr. Abrams has consistently denied that he favors increased spending. This ad relies on calculatiions by the Senate Minority Leader, Robert Dole of Kansas, that the health insurance bill Mr. Abrams says he supports would require an increase in Federal spending of 38 percent. But Mr. Abrams also favors a decrease in the military budget, which he says would offset any new spending.
Without reviewing the cost implications of where Mr. Abrams stands on all issues, it is impossible to suggest just how much taxes would rise or whether jobs would be lost.
 
Scorecard: With a simple message and clear image, the ad might effectively scare some voters into believing Mr. Abrams's election would result in higher taxes, fewer jobs -- in short, worse economic conditions than now exist.
The strength of the ad is its visual and verbal simplicity, which makes it easily understood by the widest spectrum of voters. But simplicity may also be its greatest weakness, since many voters might not think that 19 words could summarize positions on issues of such importance and seriousness.

Just as Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" attacked the science of speculative metaphysics, which tries to spin a substantial web out of the pure silk of armchair reflection, so Mr. Searle's book takes aim at the dogmas of cognitive science, the ruling philosophy behind much of today's neurophysiology, linguistics, psychology and (above all) artificial intelligence. But such a title would have made it sound ponderous and boring, and Mr. Searle is never that. He likes to tell lively stories about driving, skiing and eating pizzas. His stories often have an explosive polemical point. When he thinks he sees a flaw in what somebody says, he will sidle up behind that person and blow an enormous raspberry.
Not literally, of course, for Mr. Searle writes (and presumably behaves) in a temperate and civilized manner. Still, he pulls no punches when it comes to polemics, which in his case it usually does. The victims of his best-known raspberry -- a little story called the Chinese room argument -- are those who believe that the mind is essentially a computer program and those who believe that a computer able to fool a human into thinking it has a mind really does have a mind. With his Chinese room argument, Mr. Searle suggested that a computer could "give a perfect simulation of some human cognitive capacity" with no cognition whatsoever. As he says in his new book: "Simply imagine that someone who understands no Chinese is locked in a room with a lot of Chinese symbols and a computer program for answering questions in Chinese. The input to the system consists in Chinese symbols in the form of questions; the output of the system consists in Chinese symbols in answer to the questions. We might suppose that the program is so good that the answers to the questions are indistinguishable from those of a native Chinese speaker. But all the same, neither the person inside nor any other part of the system literally understands Chinese."
Since Mr. Searle presented the Chinese room argument in 1980, there have been plenty of objections to it from those whose research projects (and grants) depend on the assumption that the mind is indeed like a piece of software. Daniel C. Dennett, in his recent magnum opus, "Consciousness Explained," dismisses the Chinese room as a mere conjuring trick. But the telling thing is that so many different and incompatible replies to Mr. Searle have been offered. Nobody seems to agree on where he goes wrong, so the suspicion remains that he is actually right. That suspicion should deepen with "The Rediscovery of the Mind."
In this book, Mr. Searle, the Mills Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Language at the University of California, Berkeley, broadens his assault on today's near-orthodoxy about the mind and the brain. Among other things, he rejects the various attempts that have been made to explain away consciousness by reducing it to something else, or by pretending that it does not exist. He thinks that scientists and philosophers have unjustly neglected the subjectivity of conscious experience and that this has made it harder for them to explain some of the workings of the mind. But the most controversial part of the book -- the part that is likely to attract the most interest -- is where he gives several new reasons for rejecting the idea that the brain is a sophisticated digital computer whose software is the mind.
ACCORDING to Mr. Searle, there is no computer in the head, only a brain whose neurophysiological activities cause conscious mental states. And there is nothing unnatural or supernatural about such states; they are entirely natural biological phenomena. It follows, he says, that the way to understand the mind is to look at the neurophysiology of the brain and at consciousness. Talk of computers is simply a red herring.
For many people, that will be hard to accept. The computer has become so powerful a metaphor in our culture that it has taken root in the minds of laymen as well as scientists. It has become entirely natural to describe almost any activity in terms of information-processing; some people even describe the universe itself as a sort of grand, all-encompassing computer. Mr. Searle realizes that in order to combat an idea that has thus become almost an article of everyday common sense, it is necessary to explain why people are so drawn to it. For him, the answer lies in the old joke about the drunk and the streetlight. One night a drunk "loses his car keys in the dark bushes but looks for them under the streetlight, 'because the light is better here.' " Fifty years of research, and huge amounts of money, have bathed the theory of computing in increasingly bright light. But as we try to apply that theory to the mind (and even the universe), Mr. Searle says, "we let our research methods dictate the subject matter, rather than the converse." Meanwhile, the real mind languishes unexamined in the bushes.
For Mr. Searle, the idea of the brain as computer remains, despite all its sophistication and apparent explanatory power, just a metaphor that can mistakenly be taken literally. Consider the following description of digestion, which he quotes from a pharmacological journal: "The gastrointestinal tract is a highly intelligent organ that senses not only the presence of food in the lumen but also its chemical composition, quantity, viscosity and adjusts the rate of propulsion and mixing by producing appropriate patterns of contractions."
This, as Mr. Searle points out, is not bad science, but it is loose, metaphorical science. The gastrointestinal tract is not actually intelligent. When something goes wrong with it, that is not because the gut is stupid, or because it forgets something; taking laxatives is not a form of education. The gut is not literally sensing the chemical composition of the food, it is blindly responding to it. In short, it is not processing information by applying rules, it is processing food by applying enzymes. In this context, the idea that the gut shows intelligent behavior is only a harmless facon de parler that is not likely to lead anyone into serious error. What Mr. Searle claims is that in cognitive science, exactly the same fallacy is committed, but there it does lead to problems.
The brain, according to Mr. Searle, does not process information unconsciously any more than the gut does. It too is a physical organ whose workings should be explained in terms of real physical causes, not in terms of imaginary computational rule-following. The idea of laying bare the brain's workings by spelling out the steps in its unconscious "program" is bogus and superfluous. Indeed, computational talk may divert the attention of scientists away from the bushes -- from learning about genuine neurophysiological activity -- and toward the bright but artificial light of fictitious acts of computation.
Mr. Searle also draws an intriguing parallel between computational accounts of the brain and crude, pre-Darwinian styles of biological explanation. Consider the way plants turn their leaves toward the sun. We can say that this helps them to flourish, but we cannot say that they do it because they want to flourish, as was once imagined. Plants do not want anything. It is just that plants that can do this trick survive, and so they are around today. Once one realizes this, one is left to study the real physical causes of leaf movement (namely, the way plants secrete the hormone auxin) and the general theory of natural selection. Nothing else is necessary. According to Mr. Searle, the computational view of the mind is just as irrelevant as the idea of a plant's desires. To say that a person manages to perceive the three-dimensional features of solid objects, when he has only the two-dimensional images on his retina to go on, because his brain performs various computations on the retinal image by following rules is to introduce a similarly useless and misleading explanation. There is no such computation going on in the brain.
This sounds like colossal cheek on Mr. Searle's part. How does he know that there is no computation going on in the brain? Because, he believes, the idea does not make sense when you think about it carefully. Indeed, it leads to all sorts of ridiculous questions: Who is performing these computations? Who is the user of this computer? Nothing in the neurophysiology of the brain, Mr. Searle argues, corresponds to this phantom user. He contends that the hypothesis that the brain unconsciously performs computations is the same sort of mistake as hypothesizing that plants want to thrive.
One might as well ask those who believe that there is computation going on in the brain how they know that there is. It is surely not observed, nor in any sense discovered. Physically speaking, there is no more reason to suppose the brain is a computer than to suppose that the liver or the gut is one. One can model some of the activities of the brain or the liver on a computer, just as one can model the weather on a computer; but that does not make us think that the weather is a computer. The ranks of the computationalists have probably never had such a powerful challenge as this book. And they will certainly make loud objections, just as they have tried to muffle Mr. Searle's past raspberries. This is not a fight to miss.

HEADLINE: S.B.A. Coming Here to Help Businesses

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
THE circuit riders are here -- ministering to small-business owners. Once a month, representatives from the Small Business Administration district office in Manhattan will set up shop in different Westchester locations to show owners of small-businesses and would-be entrepreneurs how the administration's programs and services can help them.
And since owners of small businesses find it difficult to leave their offices during normal working hours, the center will accommodate them by opening at 4 P.M. and remaining open until 8 P.M., which is a radical departure from the Government's normal 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. workday. 
 The concept for what is known as the S.B.A. Community Assistance Service Center Program was developed by the regional administrator, Michael P. Forbes, who after having talked to local business groups during a seven-week tour of the state this summer, said he realized it was time to bring the mountain to Mohammed.
"Wherever I went, small-business people asked me the same question: 'Can the S.B.A. help me get financing?' " Mr. Forbes recalled. "Without credit, small businesses can't survive. Yet, few of the business people I met with were familiar with the S.B.A. programs that could help them get small-business loans."
 
Program Is 'a Rousing Success'
 Adding that the administration guarantees up to 90 percent of a bank loan to a small-business borrower, Mr. Forbes said the program was begun in July and has so far been a rousing success. "We've assisted scores of entrepreneurs who otherwise would never have been able to visit our field offices; either they can't take the time during the day or the offices are too far away," he said, emphasizing that the centers will provide the same level of service that is available at Small Business Administration offices. Traveling staff members give out information on the agency's programs of financial management and technical and minority small-business assistance.
Explaining that the creation of the assistance centers represents a strong effort by the Government to reach out to local business communities, Mr. Forbes said, "We will set up centers in conjunction with any organized business group such as Chambers of Commerce, women business owners or economic development offices in every community."
Last month, the first meeting in Westchester took place in a conference room in the basement of the Department of Social Services building in White Plains, with the County Chamber of Commerce acting as co-host.
"Westchester, with 29,000 small businesses -- defined as those with two or more employees -- is a dynamic small-business county," Mr. Forbes said. "And there are probably another 20,000 one-man businesses out there that we haven't even counted yet that have the potential to grow. Yet last year, S.B.A. had only 12 businesses in Westchester that obtained guaranteed loans amounting to $3.3 million. That is very little. So far this year, 30 businesses received $6.9 million from the 17 banks, but we should be guaranteeing 200 to 300 loans a year here. But since the Federal Government doesn't market our services or give them a lot of publicity, it's up to us to go out and tell people we're here for them."
One business that got the message is a commercial printing concern in White Plains, Atom Express. The company recently received a loan of $150,000 from the New York Business Development Corporation, with a 90 percent guarantee from the Small Business Administration.
 
'We Wanted to Expand'
 "We wanted to expand," said Louis Castaldi, one of Atom's owners, "and when we saw a building in Mount Vernon that would be ideal for our printing operation, we applied for a loan. And once we provided the S.B.A. with all the information, they got back to us very quickly -- I think it was within five days. Within three months, we got our loan, and now we are going to buy the building and we will be expanding and adding more people."
The S.B.A. has streamlined its procedure, Mr. Forbes emphasized. "At one time it took so long to get a guaranteed loan from the S.B.A. and there was so much red tape with a telephone book of forms to fill out that people got discouraged," he said. "Now, our turnaround time for approval can be as fast as three days."
Ninety-seven percent of loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, Mr. Forbes said, are "solid gold." And for every dollar guaranteed, $20 is returned to the community for goods and services purchased by small businesses, he added. "It's a way to help businesses grow and provide new jobs."
 
A Broad Range of Businesses
 At the first meeting in White Plains, dozens of different types of businesses were represented, said Aubrey A. Rogers, district director of the Small Business Administration. "We had a turnout of 41 people in businesses that ranged from retail stores to construction, textiles and restaurants," Mr. Rogers said. "We were assisted by counselors in the umbrella groups we sponsor. There were representatives from Score, the volunteer group of retired executives, and from the Small Business Development Center, which is a business program at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry that helps people develop business and marketing plans."
Ronald Goldstein, who heads the agency's financial division, said most people want specific information on financing. "The owner of a retail store in northern Westchester, for instance, specifically wanted to know how he could or should go about consolidating the loans he had out with several banks," Mr. Goldstein said. "He also wondered how to raise additional money for inventory. I gave him several different options, and the next day I contacted a bank I thought might work with him. Sometimes the banks need a push."
Herbert Austin, another Small Business Administration counselor at the meeting, said he met with a pharmaceutical distributor who was worried because he was losing so much business to pharmaceutical mail-order houses. "He thought it was time to get into another business," Mr. Austin said. "He thought he had the right skills and knowledge to make a success in the import-export business. He was looking for information and tips. He particularly wanted to know what S.B.A. resources were available to him."
 
The Banker's Role
 Because banks are the ones to make loans to small businesses, a representative from Key Bank in White Plains was on hand to discuss the lender's role in the Small Business Administration's guaranteed-loan program.
"We are fairly new to Westchester, but we've been very active in the S.B.A. lending program across the state," said Toby Brandon, vice president of commercial lending at Key Bank. "We made more S.B.A. loans in the first half of 1992 than we did for the entire year in 1991. Although small-business loans represent only one segment of our commercial lending activity, we know the value of small businesses and we are very receptive to all requests."
Response time is fast, Ms. Brandon said. "Once we provide S.B.A. with all the information, our own appraisal and recommendations, they have been getting back to us in as little as three days."
The next community assistance center meeting in Westchester will be held in Yonkers on Nov. 18, at the Yonkers Public Library at 1500 Central Avenue, Mr. Rogers said. "Anthony Luchese of the Small Business Network Association of Yonkers was the business group active in bringing us to Yonkers," Mr. Rogers added. "Anyone who wants more information may call him at 961-2550."

HEADLINE: Challenges and Charms Of a Toll Collector's Life

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES

DATELINE: HILLSIDE

 BODY:
AN Acura wheeled up to Booth 3 at the Union Toll Plaza of the Garden State Parkway one recent morning. The driver started to hand Ida Lakeland a dollar bill -- and discovered that his window was still closed. "I could have made that easier," he said.
As the rush hour heated up, another toll collector, Bradshaw Jefferson, headed out toward Booth 13, a bright orange vest over his green and yellow uniform. Crossing the lanes, he called out: "This is World War III; it's combat. Every time you walk in front of cars, your life is in someone's hands." 
 For Ms. Lakeland, Mr. Jefferson and the 379 other men and women who collect tolls on the Garden State, it has been a strange kind of year. First there was the effort last spring by some legislators to abolish tolls on the parkway, as well as the New Jersey Turnpike. A public hearing was conducted in May.
But that threat to the toll takers seems to have passed, at least for the present. "Finding an alternative source of revenue to pay for the parkway's $600 million bond debt does not appear viable in the present economy," said State Senator Gerald Cardinale, Republican of Demarest, a longtime advocate of removing the tolls.
Another potential threat is technological. The Union Toll Plaza and the Raritan Plaza have been selected by the New Jersey Highway Authority to test new electronic toll-collecting devices. Once the test booths are in place next year, properly equipped autos will be able to roll through at 10 miles an hour without having to deposit money or confront toll collectors.
Under the new system, called E-Z Pass, drivers who sign up will have an electronic transponder on the windshield. As the car passes through a booth, an antenna will activate the transponder and a signal will be sent to a computer, which will then apply the toll fee to the driver's account. A similar system is now being used for eastbound commuter buses at the Lincoln Tunnel.
But even if the tests of electronic toll collections are successful, said Dennis Ingoglia, a spokesman for the New Jersey Highway Authority, toll collectors will still be essential for those drivers who fail to sign up for the E-Z Pass and for out-of-state motorists, who represent a quarter of all summertime parkway travelers.
About 60 percent of the Union tollbooths are automatic, taking exact change or tokens, but many drivers prefer the manned booths. At Booth 3, a Honda owner smiled at the diminutive Ms. Lakeland, whose short-cropped auburn hair and jaunty appearance belie her 65 years. "I just wanted to hold your hand," he said as he gave her a token.
Ms. Lakeland and her colleagues attend to 1,000 to 2,000 motorists a day. Her 3-by-6-foot station has heating and air-conditioning, but they have little effect, given the open window. There is a seat, but she spends most of her day standing -- it's a more efficient way to work.
She makes change in a fluid movement without pause. When she sees a bill in a driver's hand, her right hand swoops up one of her prepared 65-cent piles of coins; she then takes the driver's bill with two fingers of her right hand and simultaneously drops the change into his hand. Her left hand, meanwhile, is readying new 65-cent piles.
This process takes about five seconds. A receipt request takes another five seconds, as does changing bills of $5 or more.
Vehicles are recorded as they pass through the booth, and a toll collector's collections at day's end are expected to match that record. Sometimes there are extenuating circumstances if the match is not exact.
"You are immobile; the patron is mobile," Mr. Jefferson said. "There is no way I can stop a driver physically if he hands me 30 cents and exits quickly. In some instances, it can be an honest mistake; others, it's like the kid who steals a stale cookie from the cookie jar. He has the satisfaction that he got the cookie."
 
Safety and Air Pollution
 Ms. Lakeland has worked at the booths for eight years, Mr. Jefferson for 17. Among Garden State Parkway collectors, the average length of service is 20 to 25 years. The hourly wage for collectors starts at $8.75 and can rise to $17.76 after four years.
The collectors at Union Plaza expressed little concern about two aspects of their work that might seem difficult to an outsider -- safety and air pollution. Only rarely does a motorist lose control of the car while approaching the tollbooths, they said, and they are protected by a concrete buffer.
Pollution has not been a problem for the collectors, they say, since clean-air laws were enacted -- particularly measures calling for the use of unleaded gasoline. Signs urge bus drivers to leave the booths slowly to avoid a blast of exhaust fumes.
people are nice, but at times they can become very aggressive."
Traffic jams, foul weather, even general dissatisfaction with government can increase the verbal abuse heaped on toll collectors, said Mr. Jefferson, a tall, gray-haired 53-year-old called B.J. by his colleagues. "When people pull into my lanes, I set the distance," he said. "In that brief 15-second span, I'm in charge because if you lose control, you lose your own sense of worth. Once the transaction is completed, you can very briefly interact."
As cars swarmed toward his booth, Mr. Jefferson said: "What gives sanity to the scene is that eventually the cars fall into lines. Getting on line is an extension of a driver's life. No matter where you go in life, you are always going to see a line. To be organized, the world itself has to have lines that go forward. With circles, you wind up in the same place you started."
Mr. Jefferson acknowledged with a grin that he has regular patrons who seek out his booth to wish him well. "The world is odd," he said, noting, "This is a north-south roadway; I have seen people here drive from east to west. The job requires listening and then interpreting a request. Right before Thanksgiving, a man asked to buy a roll of turkeys. I knew what he meant and what was on his mind."
While most drivers view the tollbooth as an unwanted interruption in their travel, Mr. Jefferson said, some welcome the interruption -- particularly if they are lost. "You have to figure out where people really want to go," he said. "If English is a problem, I ask them to write down their destination. Bingo. The problem is solved. If I engage in a dialogue, we will go around in circles. It's quick: shuffle and deal; there is no hesitation."
 
Help for an Ailing Driver
 At times Mr. Jefferson has to switch on the tollbooth's red light to stop and divert the traffic to help an ill driver. He cited a recent example, when a driver suffered a diabetic seizure and Mr. Jefferson cared for him while an ambulance was summoned.
"There is no machine that can do what we do," Mr. Jefferson said. "You can program a machine to react to certain situations, but how does a machine give first aid, deal with a disabled vehicle or accept the toll from someone who only has 34 cents?"
As a general rule, Mr. Jefferson said, he finds the human race lacking in patience: "People rush to get to a place where they don't want to be. They rush to work, and then they hurry to get home. The moment they are home, they get dressed and go out."
Not so Mr. Jefferson. As he pointed out, his three-year-old Pontiac Grand-Am has only 26,000 miles on the odometer. "When I finish work," he said, "I don't want to see an automobile."

HEADLINE: Drum and Bugle Corps Stage Comeback

BYLINE: By TINA TRASTER-POLAK

 BODY:
FOR three hours on a scorching Saturday afternoon, the 60 young members of the Southern Knights Drum and Bugle Corps of Franklinville marched across a grassy field at Bayonne High School's Veteran's Memorial Stadium. At 7:30 P.M. they were to compete in the Garden State Circuit Championships.
In their routine called "Foreplay," percussionists formed a front line; buglers and color guards gathered in a circle. The high-pitched bells reverberated, and the snare, quad and bass drums joined in. 
 As if set in motion by the music, the corps members stepped out of theircircle to form female and male symbols upon the grass before lining up in the shape of a heart. The color guard, flags raised high, seemed to pierce the heart like an arrow.
"The message is that sex comes out of the heart," said Kathy Marsden, the corps director. "It is initiated because a man and a woman fall in love."
There was a time, two decades ago, when virtually every town had its drum and bugle corps, homegrown marching bands usually sponsored by local veterans groups or parishes. Then the corps went the way of doctors' house calls. Some participants say it happened because young people had too many other outlets for their energy, from video games to malls; others blame a decrease in patriotism.
But within the last two years, there have been signs that the local drum and bugle corps is making a comeback. Five new amateur groups have sprouted up in the state. Their style, complete with splashy spangled costumes and routines like "Foreplay," is a far cry from the earlier community corps. The military flavor is gone, and Sousa marches have been replaced by show tunes and rock-and-roll numbers.
Budget cutbacks in school musical programs have encouraged some young musicians to turn to the corps. The tight economy is also reflected in the finances of some of the new corps, whose members' instruments are secondhand and whose costumes are hand-sewn.
 
Feelings of Nostalgia
 The corps directors, some of whom once belonged to community drum and bugle corps, attribute the trend in part to nostalgia.
"People who marched in the early 1960's and 1970's watched it die and that didn't feel too good," said Kirk Demarest, who founded the Spectra corps of Dunellen. "We grew up and got married and then we realized that there was a void. I decided to do this because I wanted to give these kids memories."
The five new corps, all of which competed in the circuit championships in Bayonne, are Jersey Surf of Berlin, which took first place; the Newark Marching 100; the Raiders of Bayonne; Spectra and the Southern Knights.
The newcomers are classified as junior corps, with an age cap of 22, but they are a far cry from such junior corps as the Cadettes of Bergen County, who compete throughout the United States and abroad and have budgets that range up to $800,000 a year.
But what the new bands may lack in skill, experience and bankroll, they make up in enthusiasm. Winding down after his group's victory at Bayonne, Bob Jacobs, director of the Jersey Surf, said he started with $20,000 but he anticipates that the corps will need at least $75,000 this year.
"It's tough to get off the ground," Mr. Jacobs said. "We've tried to keep costs down -- parents have sewn costumes from scratch. We have a lot of secondhand instruments that need to be upgraded. Right now, there are a lot of Band-Aids and duct tape holding us together."
Ms. Marsden, the Southern Knights' director, told how a group of her neighbors in Franklinville -- all former corps members -- had gathered around her kitchen table one night and decided to create a corps. "We wanted to start something for the youth here," she said.
Along the way, some of the volunteers have put in so many hours on the corps, she said, that they have lost their jobs.
"It's like listening to somebody talk about an addiction," she said. "It doesn't necessarily seem logical, but it's something they must do. We have no choice."
 
Grant From City Council
 Jack Drury, a former Newark principal and former corps member, started the Marching 100 with the help of a $90,000 grant from the Newark City Council.
"This is as grass-roots as it gets," he said of his corps. "No experience needed. Just interest and a desire to be responsible." Members range in age from 9 to 14, which is considerably younger than most junior corps.
Devotees of drum corps say that they are not sure why local drum corps faded, but they have their suspicions. "When I came home from Vietnam," Mr. Demarest said, "there was an anti-military sentiment. We didn't want to wear military gear; we didn't want to wear shakos." Shakos are the tall military caps still worn by many corps.
Other corp leaders offered economic explanations. In the 1950's and 60's, they said, youths had little spending money and were likely to stay around the neighborhood. In the boomtime of the 1970's, they were apt to have cars. And Dominick De Senzo Sr., vice president of the Garden State circuit, said that teen-agers used to be able to find summer jobs, which have since turned scarce, giving them more free time.
 
'Great Activity for Saturday'
 Today's junior corps members offer a variety of reasons for taking part. "It's a great activity for Saturday," said 9-year-old Ebony McAllister of the Marching 100 of Newark. "It's better than watching cartoons."
For Jose Caceres, 15, the Newark corps has been a "growing up" experience. "It teaches you that you need to be responsible and pay attention, or it will cost the corps and it will cost you," he said.
At the Bayonne competition, their director, Jack Drury, offered this rationale as he watched the members march by, dressed in the simple yellow sweatsuits the budget allows: "Our goal is to give urban kids more self-esteem, to make them feel that they are part of a team, to make them more wholesome. If they also win championships, well then that's just super."

 BODY:

THE PACIFIC CENTURY
America and Asia in a Changing World.
By Frank Gibney.
Illustrated. 596 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons. $40. 
 SINCE the 1970's, when American shops and showrooms began to fill up with Japanese goods, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of the countries across the Pacific. In the interim, scores of books about the region have been written, and a number of ambitious films and television series have appeared -- at least as ambitious as the 10-part PBS documentary, beginning this week, on which Frank Gibney's thoughtful and discursive survey is based.
And yet America's understanding of the importance of the Pacific, while undeniably growing, is only rudimentary. For there is a pervasive Eurocentricity in the intellectual life of the United States, a prejudice that, not surprisingly, reflects the continuing influence of the European tradition in academic, political, journalistic and commercial institutions in this, as in most other, Western nations. Those afflicted with such a prejudice believe that Western attitudes still dominate the planet and will continue to do so for some time to come.
Mr. Gibney rightly disputes this view. And he has the credentials to back up his position: a journalist for Time, Newsweek and Life magazines, he first covered East Asia in the postwar years, then spent a decade presiding over various Asian editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and since 1979 has directed the Pacific Basin Institute in Santa Barbara, Calif. For him, all the evidence insists that the commercial, scientific, economic and perhaps even spiritual center of the world has shifted significantly. "We can learn much," Mr. Gibney says, from the successes of the Pacific nations -- from Japan, Korea, Singapore, China. Moreover, he insists, "we must."
In presenting this argument, "The Pacific Century: America and Asia in a Changing World" is rather conventional in its approach. And, surprisingly enough, rather circumscribed. It is not, for instance, truly about the Pacific -- all the fine romantic epigraphs from Herman Melville and others notwithstanding -- but is, as its subtitle indicates, about Asia. And more particularly, about that quarter of Asia, from Malaya to Japan, that Mr. Gibney knows well. It is not about Asian Russia, for example. There is precious little about Australasia and virtually nothing of consequence about Oceania. In his introduction, Mr. Gibney apologizes for omitting a discussion of the Latin American Pacific shore.
But what Mr. Gibney does give us, as far as it goes, is fine, and the depth of his knowledge, his half-century of experience in his chosen realm, is evident and valuable. When, after a few early chapters that provide some historical background, he turns to the postwar world, he is able to offer fascinating reminiscences of meeting or observing at close quarters almost all of the grandees of the region, from the anticolonialist heroes of the 1940's to the creators of the present nation-states. His work for the Encyclopaedia Britannica -- especially on the compilation of its Chinese editions -- allowed him extraordinary insight into Chinese society. And his deep knowledge of Japan, gained as a reporter and businessman, yields a multilayered view of this challenger to American supremacy.
But there are gaps, and not merely geographical ones, that are a little trying. Most important, Mr. Gibney gives somewhat less consideration than he might to the Chinese, and in particular the overseas Chinese -- who are, after all, the means by which, as some hysterics believe, the descendants of the Middle Kingdom will one day subdue the whole planet. There could also have been more speculation on the likely symbiosis between Asia's Confucian tradition on the one side and America's technology and innovation on the other, a relationship that will certainly link the countries of the Pacific rim for decades to come. But this subject receives only perfunctory treatment, which is a shame.
Mr. Gibney rightly excoriates Presidents Reagan and Bush for their lack of sympathy with and interest in the Pacific (and he properly applauds the otherwise forgettable Millard Fillmore for his Pacific enthusiasm over a century ago). His recommendations for the future of trans-Pacific relations -- such as his trenchant demand for full American recognition of Vietnam -- are bold and refreshing. But Mr. Gibney's book does not leave one properly sated. There is still the gnawing feeling that this region must yet wait for a treatment that its immensity and importance deserve -- though, for now, "The Pacific Century" is a challenging beginning.

HEADLINE: A DIRECTORY OF CRUISES WORLDWIDE;
A Choppy Maiden Voyage

BYLINE: By STEPHEN DRUCKER; STEPHEN DRUCKER is editor of Styles of The Times.

 BODY:
CALAMITY seemed to be scheduled, like bingo. There was The Morning They Made Coffee With Saltwater, The Day the Swimming Pool Emptied Itself, The Evening the Elevators Became Ovens and The Night the Lights Went Out, to name a few.
Somehow calamities turn into tales, and what one remembers are the ocean and an endearing small cruise ship, the Crown Jewel, on her maiden voyage from Barcelona to New York last summer. 
 As some 600 passengers found out, the term maiden voyage, loaded with images of speed and celebrity and champagne, is a magnificent euphemism.
"The tenor of a delivery crossing is unique," writes John Maxtone-Graham, in his new book "Crossing and Cruising." "All is not only new," he adds, "it is also scarcely unpacked."
Crown Cruise Line, which was still unpacking its ship in midocean, gave no warning that this first cruise might be lacking in finesse. Expectations were high as passengers swaggered with the machismo of the well-traveled through the lounges of Kennedy Airport, en route to Spain.
"How many cruises have you folks been on?"
"Twenty-two."
"Forty-eight."
"One hundred and ten."
During the 14 days of our passage, many people would succumb to disappointment.They had paid to be pampered, and they were not.
I, however, sensed the makings of a good time. The Crown Jewel is an intimate ship, with a traditional atmosphere that spares you the design cliches of many new vessels. Her maiden itinerary, with eight full sea days and calls at Gibraltar, Lisbon, the Azores and Bermuda, was not the usual string of duty-free ports and night sailing.
I found an eclectic group of people, age 15 to 60-something, and some found me with such icebreakers as "So are you here to solve a midlife crisis?" With the cooperation from the weather, and it usually cooperates on the southern route across the Atlantic, I quickly fell into the escapist life known as shipboard.
Aship's whistle, you see, can make me cry. When the hawsers are dropped and a ship floats free from its dock, it always seems to me as if two people are being torn from each other's arms.
The Crown Jewel was not merely sailing from Barcelona. She was leaving, for the first time, the country where she had been built, and she might never be back.
Ships visiting the Olympics filled the harbor, ships that might never meet again, and when it came time for the Crown Jewel to sail, they all said goodbye the only way they knew how: Three long blasts. Short blast. Short blast.
For a half-hour the harbor was filled with the cries of ships. The Crown Jewel had exchanges with the Royal Viking Sun and the Crystal Harmony, with fishing boats and ferries and yachts and dinghies.
And then suddenly we were very alone, surrounded by water. To remind yourself that the world is not so small after all, you need only board a ship in the Mediterranean and consider that it will take two weeks to get to New York.
There are not many opportunities to be in the middle of an ocean these days, and when you are, you are more than likely on the QE2, racing at 32 knots across the North Atlantic for four and a half days, with a strong wind in your face.
A certain breed of ship buff, the sort who likes to travel but doesn't care to arrive (I am that sort), reads cruise schedules specifically for the rare crossing like this one. When a new cruise ship is delivered, or when the cruising seasons change from Caribbean to Mediterranean or vice versa, a "repositioning cruise" results. These cruises tend to have unusual itineraries, lots of sea days and a lazy pace, and they are often bargains.
Crown Jewel passengers liked bargains. They seemed to spend a lot of time comparing what they had paid; indeed no one seemed to have paid list price for a cabin. The range bandied about was roughly $1,900 a person for an inside cabin to $2,700 a person for an outside cabin, including the flight to Europe; single passengers paid another $1,000 or so. By comparison, a one-week Caribbean cruise on the Crown Jewel lists at about $1,800 a person in an outside stateroom.
The Crown Jewel is barely half the size of the QE2, only 537 feet long, so you feel less insulated from the ocean. She carries just 900 passengers even with every berth filled, which is highly unlikely, so that almost every face becomes a familiar face within days.
And because cruise ships are built neither for speed nor for oceans -- one look tells you that this ship is no greyhound -- we cruised at a pokey 16 to 18 knots, slow enough so that you could stand in the pitch darkness of the bow at midnight and feel very, very humble.
The Crown Jewel's design, the exterior by Windell & Riikonen, the interiors by Petter Yran, is in the tradition of ships, not shopping malls. This is a vessel for people who really like the sea; at night, floodlights are trained on the water.
In the tradition of older liners, the stern is a cascade of open decks. A deck atop the bridge is lined with deck chairs; you can enjoy the best view in the house lying down.
For 14 consecutive sunny days, I somehow never crashed the poolside world of SPF 15 and violently colored drinks. I staked a claim on a deck chair in the shade of a lifeboat, where entire days were lost in a state of half-sleep, watching the horizon shift through the railing.
Although someone felt the need for a modest atrium with a white piano, the lasting impression of the Crown Jewel is of tradition, not glitz; of wood, not plastic.
There is an Edwardian-style Palm Court -- favored by bridge foursomes -- with wood decking, clacking wood Venetian blinds and lacy wicker chairs worthy of the Aquitania.
The two lounges and the dining room are ovals, the architectural equivalent of a waltz. They are paneled and fluted in the Art Deco style, and furnished with heavy tub chairs, sometimes too heavy to move.
My cabin, Room 3011, was a standard double decorated in an advanced state of cheerfulness. It was not a room where two would want to linger, but I lingered alone there quite happily. Passengers were not shy about rearranging the elements -- two single beds, a desk and a reading chair -- to maximize the space in their cabins. The bathroom was the usual modular affair; someone should have thought to mold grab bars into the shower for that occasional day when the sea is roiling.
I was positively fascinated by the chintz wainscoting and the chintz swag over the portholes, which aspired to Mario Buatta but came off as decorating with sheets.
Still I was happier in that room than I have ever been in a Manhattan penthouse. I spent many hours listening to the sound of water slapping against hull. By New York I could estimate the ocean swell before getting out of bed.
The stateroom came with the thickest towels I have ever wrapped myself in, as well as a steward who grasped the mechanics of service if not yet all the fine points. He filled the bathroom ashtray with fresh soap every day.
He was also the rather blunt messenger of Tipping Policy. A notice on my bed informed me one afternoon that it is customary to tip at the end of each week. I had never encountered that custom before, nor a steward who supplied a self-addressed envelope.
I decided to tip my way -- at the end of the cruise -- but he was, in his invisible way, insistent. Tipping Policy reappeared on the bed at the end of the cruise. I moved it to my desk. He moved it back to my bed.
Closet space was tight even for one, certainly considering the wide range of possible dress codes for the dining room. These included Casual, Informal, Semi-Formal or Formal. Formal was interpreted by most as black tie but by some as plaid pants.
There were as many opportunities to eat on the Crown Jewel as on any cruise ship, but a maiden voyage is not a cruise to recommend to a glutton. While there was always one course or another praised loudly around the table, the food was inconsistent. It grew better, and the service faster, each night, and certainly every effort was made to please, even when it meant bringing four filet mignons per person in hopes one might be pink. Whoever stocked the kitchen made some obvious misjudgments. On the night the menu finally promised caviar, there was not enough to feed the second sitting, and by the last days of the voyage, breakfasts shrank to basic by cruise standards: juice, rolls, eggs, coffee.
For some reason every cruise passenger expects a Broadway show after dinner. I usually skip these revues, but I found myself not skipping The Ray Kennedy Entertainers, a troupe of seven singer-dancer-actor-models smart enough to play the lounge like a cabaret, not the Shubert Theater.
Also booked into the middle of the Atlantic was a cabaret singer named Smitty, who could smolder or swing with the best of them back in Manhattan. Her crowd was loyal. I had to hear her every day.
Every room had a satellite television delivering snow, two movies or (on a good day) CNN; and there was a library, but you had to be quick. It was stripped of every book before we sailed.
Olga, a psychic who lectured daily to full lounges, was available to read your future, which she could see in a piece of your jewelry. She had a simple explanation for the ship's teething problems. The bad luck could be traced to the peacock feathers in the wall hanging in the atrium. Peacock feathers and water, she said, spell doom.
I might have, but did not, play bingo, try horse racing, "Walk a Mile With Sandi" or sign up for the passenger talent show. As it happened, qualifying for the talent show was easier than I had imagined. One woman declared herself The National Treasure and read an ode to her own greatness in a very shaky voice. She brought down the house.
And when everyone else was asleep, which was usually midnight, there were trips to every corner of every deck to watch the full moon or to look for shooting stars or to try to make sense of a constellation other than the Big Dipper.
Although most cruises are defined by their ports, this one was defined by its days at sea.
When land comes along only every few days, landfall is momentous. Each port on this crossing left a distinct, strong impression: Gibraltar, for its colonial town as much as for its rock; Lisbon, for its hills and its earthiness; Faial in the Azores, for its blue hydrangeas and its volcanic crater and its whiff of Atlantis, and Bermuda, an island that perpetually has its pinky raised.
Most of these ports appeared on the horizon and just got bigger for an hour or so. New York unfolded, like theater, and it took hours. Ambrose Lightship. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and the skyline and, for our arrival, a salute from helicopters and fireboats.
And then the denouement, that awkward lingering on board while the ship is cleared and goodbyes are said over and over again.
At last I was called to disembark. I hurried back to my cabin for my hand luggage, took a long look around and hit the light switch of 3011 for the last time. There was a loud pop, a shower of sparks and a puff of smoke.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
The Driving, Diving Boys of Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone writes frequently about Silicon Valley from Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
Upper-Crust executives in the San Francisco Bay area go to Bohemian Grove for their retreat. The Silicon Valley technology crowd's idea of relaxation is the Consumer Electronics Show. And the executives of the real estate- and construction-related industries that support high technology in the valley get their kicks courtesy of the Kitchen Pass Club.
Last week, for example, members of the club were diving in the Red Sea, just the latest in a string of adventures that dates back more than a dozen years and has included race-car driving, off-road motorcycling, fishing and a rodeo, as well as diving. 
 These are businessmen who grew up in the area when it was still known as the Santa Clara Valley. Their world is less that of lone-wolf entrepreneurs than of social groups engaging in old-fashioned macho hobbies. Many of them are the kind who express politically incorrect attitudes that no longer surface in the boardrooms of their trend-setting clients. Indeed, the Kitchen Pass name, a groaner for outsiders and even some club members nowadays, came from the idea that each member of the all-male club needed permission from his wife to go.
The "club" was formed in the late 1970's, said Dennis Chambers, a partner in San Jose's Commercial Property Services and a founder of the group. "We were just coming out of a recession and five of us decided to celebrate by chartering a bus and going to the Reno air races. We had so much fun, we did it a second year."
Then Jerry Hodnefield, a member who is general manager of Renco Properties in Sunnyvale, suggested the group try his favorite sport, scuba diving, and the gang was off to the Cayman Islands. In subsequent years they would dive in the Virgin Islands, off Truk Island in the Pacific and on the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.
Most of the club's members come from the valley's tight community of developers and those who work with them. By the late-1980's, it had grown to a core of about a dozen, with about 50 occasional participants. Members included bankers, real estate executives, an architect, an insurance executive and men who owned glass and air-conditioning companies.
Then, as now, there were no dues, no newsletters -- nothing formal of any kind. The closest thing to meetings took place when members ran into each other at various social events.
P. Michael Hunt, an insurance executive who has become the de facto leader of the group, said, "So many of the things we do are interrelated -- business meetings, the opera, charity events -- that we constantly cross each other's paths and make plans."
John Davis, owner of Air Systems Inc. of San Jose, a heating and air-conditioning contractor with 125 employees, added: "It's sort of like one of those clubs where you have to be invited. If you show up and they like you, you get invited back."
If beyond their work there was any common characteristic among members of the club, it was that all were about the same age (now about 45), former jocks with a willingness (and the money) to try something new. For example, several of the members had pilots' licenses (Mr. Chambers was an Air Force pilot in Vietnam), and to support their hobby they created the San Jose Jet Center, at San Jose International Airport, for their private jet planes.
One of the younger members, Ken Rodrigues, 39, a San Jose architect who is a former race-car driver, persuaded many of the other members to attend racing school and compete in Winston Cup races. This group often rents a famous track -- like Sears Point and Laguna Seca in California -- for a weekend.
Another Kitchen Pass group has fished for salmon in Alaska, trout in Montana and marlin off Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. Yet another rides motorcycles off-road. And some have created a softball team for league play.
A year ago, Mr. Hodnefield, who owns a ranch in the Sierra foothills, flew in members and their wives for a three-day rodeo that included barrel racing, pole bending and goat tying. While few of the members had ridden a horse before, the rodeo, like everything else the club does, was fiercely competitive.
"We compete in all areas of our life and enjoy it," Mr. Hunt said. "During the car races, several guys crashed because they were trying so hard to win. We have an appreciation for competition and don't give any slack."
As the core members of the Kitchen Pass Club have matured, so has the group. Even the name is used less frequently now that wives participate in some of the more elaborate dives (last week's Red Sea trip, for example, was for couples) and some of the members have gone through a divorce.
Many of the members say the club is one of the most important things in their lives. "I plan my year around the group," Mr. Chambers said. Mr. Davis added: "We all own our own businesses and go our separate ways, so there's usually not much time to build friendships. So this is the way we do it. You can think of it as business relationships that became personal friendships."
And those friendships can be vital these days. The club, born of one recession, is mired in another, the worst in memory.
"It's been a disaster for all of us the last four or five years," Mr. Chambers said. "We're all in the same business and all good friends, so we can all sit around with each other and lament. Frankly, I really think that's helped. And I know that if I get a call from one of them, I'm there fast to help. So is everyone else. That's what this group is all about."

HEADLINE: Reading the Medical Notes From Underground

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Here's the American health problem as seen from my subway seat:
The Laser Medical Association, more than 10 years service, promises to cure your warts and piles. 
 Ring 1-800-WHY HURT, and the Seth Benson law firm will pursue your accident-compensation claim.
Pregnant? We Can Help offers obstetrics, gynecology and abortion privately and confidentially.
Back-pain relief for $20 is available from three chiropractors.
A.C.I.'s free drug-treatment helpline states that health insurance will be accepted as full payment.
Designer braces are offered for the teeth of adults and children.
Newport Cigarettes offers a life "alive with pleasure."
Many of the health issues of the American election lurk in those ads. The tragedies of unwanted pregnancy and hard drug addiction rely on private solutions: in the case of abortion, because the politicians don't want to offend the evangelicals; in the case of drugs, because the politicians see more votes in law enforcement.
The fear of compensation claims is one reason so much defensive and expensive medicine is practiced, although only one complaint in 10,000 actually ends with a payout. Back-pain relief comes from the chiropractors because the American medical insurance system is increasingly unfriendly to chronic illness.
The ads don't even hint at two major problems. Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, medical spending has risen to more than 13 percent of the United States economy. That's more than 1.5 times the Australian level, but key indicators of public health are worse than in Australia.
Tuberculosis is more common in the United States than a decade ago, and death rates for babies among the highest in the Western world. TB and infant mortality are classic markers of poverty, yet Mr. Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton preach private responsibility, saying Americans must learn to take better care of themselves.
The Bush Administration has paid some belated attention to immunization and better maternal and child health services, but has not transferred enough money from more conventional programs to finance them. Mr. Bush's strongest emphasis is on more research. He wants America to "continue to lead the world in . . . development and proliferation of biomedical research and innovative technology." Governor Clinton tried to put nurses into clinics in rural areas too poor to support doctors, but backed off when the Arkansas Medical Society lobbied against him.
Neither candidate seems willing to deal with the research lobby, the medical societies and the insurance industry. American employers traditionally pay medical insurance as part of the wage package, so rising unemployment has increased the number of uninsured people by 11 percent during the Bush Presidency. In a declining economy, that reduces labor mobility because people fear that the next employer may be dealing with an insurance company that wants only young, healthy members.
Young, healthy members make sense when medical insurance is driven by free market dogma. Every
company will seek the low risks and hope that some other company -- or Medicaid -- will pick up the chronic sick and the infirm elderly. Experience rating, which market dogma requires, simply compounds the problems by making services cheap for the well and impossibly expensive for the sick and the poor. Community rating, such as Australia has, says we're all in this together, and being old does not mean being neglected.
To an outsider, Mr. Clinton's policy of insuring everyone without increasing costs, and Mr. Bush's of doing better in the existing framework, look like two slices of pie in the sky.
Because stone throwers from abroad are rarely welcome, honesty requires me to note that the Australian Labor Government is designing its new national health strategy on American models of meaner management. Members of the Conservative opposition plan to hand the system back to the insurance companies and medical societies. Someone should take them for a ride on the subway.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Debate;
BUSH STRESSES HIS EXPERIENCE BUT 2 RIVALS CITE ECONOMIC LAG

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
In the long-awaited first debate of the 1992 Presidential campaign, with his Presidency in jeopardy, George Bush asked the American people last night for more time to right the economy, but his economic stewardship drew withering fire from Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.
White House officials said later that if he was re-elected Mr. Bush planned to dismiss his three top economic advisers, as demanded for months by Republican conservatives outraged over tax increases. They are Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary; Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, the top White House economist. 
 Trailing badly in the national polls and in most big states, the President promised to make James A. Baker 3d, the former Secretary of State who now heads his campaign, the overseer of all domestic programs once Election Day had passed. It was an effort to suggest that he understood the urgency of American economic problems, something many voters doubt, but it also suggested that Mr. Baker, not Mr. Bush, was the man who gets things done.
 
Renews Attack on Clinton
 "Jim Baker is going to put together the economic program for the President," said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. "That means we'll be getting a new economic team."
Focusing on foreign policy, the President depicted himself as the only candidate with enough experience to handle the pressures of the Oval Office, and he questioned the "judgment and character" of Mr. Clinton, his Democratic rival. [Transcript, pages A14-A17.]
He renewed his attacks on Mr. Clinton's role in antiwar demonstrations abroad during the Vietnam era, contending that the Democrat's actions raised grave questions about his fitness to serve as Commander in Chief.
Mr. Clinton, mild-mannered in most exchanges, answered sharply, accusing Mr. Bush of unfairly maligning his patriotism. He recalled the unsubstantiated charges of the late Joseph R. McCarthy and pointedly reminded the President that his father, the late Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut, had been one of McCarthy's early foes.
 
A Vivid Perot
 During the debate, held at Washington University in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton, Mo., and televised nationally, Mr. Bush sought to identify Governor Clinton of Arkansas, his Democratic opponent, with the liberals whose economic programs have proved unpopular with American voters in the past, like Walter F. Mondale, Michael S. Dukakis and Jimmy Carter.
Both the major-party nominees did their best to ignore Mr. Perot, their independent rival, but he was nevertheless a bright, sparky presence in the 90-minute debate, full of pithy one-liners and self-deprecation. He seemed to have a good time, making fun of his big ears, telling the audience he was "not playing Lawrence Welk music tonight" and responding, when Mr. Bush touted his Presidential experience, that "I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt."
Mr. Perot may have gone some way toward regaining at least a bit of the credibility he lost when he abruptly walked away from the race in July. His vivid performance suggested what a power he might have been had he stayed in, but he had little specific to say except on his plan to help reduce the deficit by raising taxes on gasoline by 50 cents over five years.
 
President on Defensive
 Mr. Bush was forced onto the defensive much of the time on economic questions, but he fought back. He produced no new proposals other than still another job for Mr. Baker, who was brought to the campaign when it faltered but has not yet turned it around. Still, his answers were better focused than on many recent questions, and he spoke with verve and authority at times.
For his part, Mr. Clinton managed to tame his tendency to sound like a political-science professor with abstruse, over-detailed answers. He deftly turned a question about family values, a phrase the Republicans have used to try to split the Democratic coalition, into an indictment of the President's vetoes of Democratic bills intended to help younger workers.
Mr. Bush defended the status quo on several subjects, from American troop commitments in Europe to spending on AIDS research, while Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot consistently called for basic revisions in American policies. On the economy especially, the President's insistent optimism left him open to the others' charges that he was complacent and out of touch with the nation.
His intentions with regard to Mr. Brady, Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin were revealed after the debate, as Republican and Democratic officials emerged to provide reporters with interpretation favorable to their candidates. Some saw the move as a sign of desperation, others as an indication that the President realized he had sounded too complacent about the economy.
 
No Big Gaffes
 There appeared to be no major gaffes and no knockout punches. None of the three participants lost his composure or appeared stumped by the questions posed by Jim Lehrer, the moderator, and a panel of three other journalists. The questioners were Ann Compton of ABC News, John Mashek of The Boston Globe, and Sander Vanocur, a freelance television reporter.
If, on reflection, the American electorate decides that the debate was essentially a draw, Mr. Clinton would presumably benefit most. His goal last night was to enable his momentum to roll on, while Mr. Bush and Mr. Perot, trailing, hoped to transform the last three weeks of the campaign.
Three more debates remain, all like the first sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Mr. Bush, Mr. Perot and Mr. Clinton have agreed to square off in Richmond, Va., on Thursday and in East Lansing, Mich., next Monday. Vice President Dan Quayle and his rivals, Senator Al Gore and Adm. James B. Stockdale, are to debate in Atlanta on Tuesday.
Each debate will have a different format, negotiated by the Bush and Clinton campaigns after weeks of argument. Last night's allowed for no follow-up questions and no questioning by the candidates of each other. It was, in fact, not really a debate, but more a joint television interview, with the order of candidates' response determined by lot.
The President's attack on Mr. Clinton's antiwar activities while he was a student at Oxford University two decades ago was part of a concerted Republican effort, so far unsuccessful, to demonstrate that the Arkansas Governor is too slippery for the Presidency.
"It is wrong to demonstrate against your country on foreign soil," said Mr. Bush, who contrasted his service as a carrier-based pilot during World War II with Mr. Clinton's antiwar activities. "It's a question of character and judgment. I couldn't do that. I don't think most Americans could do that."
Mr. Clinton said with asperity, "We need a President to bring this country together, not divide it."
 
Defining the Difference
 In television commercials that were broadcast just before the debate, the Republicans took the same tack in assailing the Democratic nominee's explanations of his attempts to avoid service in Vietnam. In the spots, which will run for several days, an announcer says: "The question then was avoiding the draft. Now, for Bill Clinton, it's a question of avoiding the truth."
The debate opened with the candidates stating what set them apart from the others. Mr. Perot said his was the only campaign initiated by the public. Mr. Clinton said he alone represented change, and told Mr. Bush, "For 12 years, you've had it your way, and it didn't work." Mr. Bush cited experience.
In closing statements, Mr. Perot and Mr. Clinton broke little ground. But Mr. Bush talked of the difficulty of making decisions in the Oval Office and, in a slap at Mr. Clinton, said a President could not oscillate between positions. Not surprisingly, he dwelt on his foreign, not domestic, record.
Twice, with great emphasis, he said, 'I hope I've earned your trust," and added that "a lot of being President is about trust and character."
 
On Taxing and Spending
 A question about taxes to Governor Clinton afforded each candidate a chance to present his broad economic themes in phrases that have become familiar throughout the campaign.
The Governor said his program would increase taxes for families earning more than $200,000. "These are the people who had their incomes go up while their taxes went down" during two Republican Administrations, Mr. Clinton said.
"We've got to have no more trickle down," he said, "no more tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing."
Mr. Perot said that as President he would make it clear that the United States would have to enter "a period of shared sacrifice."
"We've created a mess, and we don't have much to show for it," he added.
 
Shrinking the Military
 The candidates demonstrated contrasting approaches to shrinking the military when asked how many American troops should be stationed in Europe.
Mr. Bush replied broadly, asserting that a sizable force is needed to keep the peace, while Mr. Perot and Mr. Clinton said deeper cuts in troop levels were needed to save money and because European countries were wealthy enough to pay a bigger share of the bill.
Mr. Perot said the United States cannot afford heavy continued spending on troops in Europe, with countries like Germany able to pay a much larger share.
Mr. Clinton was the only candidate to discuss numbers. He said a force of 100,000 troops would be adequate, not the 150,000-troop limit set by Mr. Bush. He said new priorities would redirect military spending and planning in the post-cold war world, with factors like mobility becoming more important than large ground forces.
Asked about the fairness of his proposal to raise gasoline taxes by 50 cents a gallon, Mr. Perot said it would not, as the questioner suggested, punish the middle class. "I know it's not popular," Mr. Perot said. He said higher gas taxes are needed because "it's time to pay the fiddler, and if we don't we'll be spending our children's money."
Mr. Bush said, "I don't believe it's fair to slap a tax on people who have to drive for a living, people who have to go long distances."
 
Bush Espouses Optimism
 Throughout the debate, Mr. Bush repeatedly sought to strike an optimistic note about the economy, a feel-good approach reminiscent of former President Ronald Reagan.
"We've got big problems, but we are not coming apart at the seams," he said in response to a question proposed by a retired worker from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation about whether the United States should have an industrial plan to convert from the cold war to a new era.
Governor Clinton, on the other hand, said the Administration was responsible for not responding to the changing economy.
"There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone," Mr. Clinton said, adding that many of them had lost their jobs because there had been no plan to compensate for declining military spending."
 
After the Cold War
 Mr. Clinton and Mr. Perot offered similar visions of the nation's post- cold war needs: to rebuild the country's financial strength, reduce the former superpowers' nuclear arsenals and help promote democratic societies, especially in the Soviet Union.
"If you're not rich, you're not a superpower," Mr. Perot said. "And you can't convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency."
Mr. Bush seemed to bristle at the notion, implicit in his opponents' advocacy of stern measures on the economy, that America was in decline.
"We are still the envy of the world," he said, "even in terms of our economy." He added: "We've got the best military, and it's keeping the peace. We said peace through strength and it worked. The cold war is over."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Assessment;
Bush Didn't Score the Needed Knockout

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
One way to score a Presidential debate is to ask: What did each candidate need to achieve and did he do it? Measured by that standard, the first of the three Presidential debates was less than a triumph for President Bush and a fair night for his two opponents.
Mr. Bush, still trying to revive his candidacy for re-election with just over three weeks to go, needed a surprise, some reason for voters to change their minds about a President who has become well defined for most Americans over the last four years. He did not achieve it. 
 Gov. Bill Clinton needed to avoid a major gaffe that would slow his campaign, and he did that. He also may have made progress toward another goal -- making Americans more comfortable with the idea of his sitting in the Oval Office.
But Ross Perot definitely got what he wanted -- time on the same stage with the major parties' candidates and an opportunity to offer his peculiar brand of homespun prescriptions for what ails America while the other two attacked each other and fell into a replay of the campaign: Mr. Bush's status-quo message against Mr. Clinton's calls for change.
Mr. Perot re-established himself as a candidate following his on-again-off-again bid for the White House and showed he can be comfortable in the rough-and-tumble world of Presidential campaigning. But he went beyond that: while Mr. Clinton played it safe and Mr. Bush seemed flat by comparison to the other two, Mr. Perot looked like a man who was having a really good time.
 
Evading Attacks
 He grinned over his lectern and made the most of his free air time, emerging the clear winner in the warm-and-fuzzy sweepstakes.
Mr. Perot also showed himself to be the kind of candidate he might have been had he stayed in the race, with his jokes and his direct, authoritative, if fact-free, answers to questions that produced vague responses from his opponents.
Mr. Perot probably made the biggest splash of the night, and it is conceivable now that he can use this new burst of exposure to hurt one of the other two candidates, depending on the state.
But he clearly benefited last night from the way the two major party candidates saved most of their fire for each other. And he has yet to face any real attack from the other two candidates on the obvious questions on which he is vulnerable, including whether his decision to drop out when he was doing badly and then re-enter the race when the dynamics changed made him a quitter.
For now, one of the most evident results of the first debate was that Mr. Bush's insistence on including Mr. Perot in the three Presidential debates may have backfired.
Instead of upstaging Mr. Clinton, as the Republicans had hoped, Mr. Perot joined the Democratic nominee in a two-against-one attack on the President. For the vast bulk of the 90 minutes of the debate, Mr. Bush looked as though he was on the defensive -- when viewers got a look at him at all.
The most obvious result of Mr. Perot's addition to the debate was to cut into the on-screen time that Mr. Bush needed so badly. He was was not even visible to voters two-thirds of the time, while the nation looked at and listened to the other two candidates. And they were using their time to chip away at Mr. Bush's record and credibility.
The addition of Mr. Perot to the political mix enabled Mr. Clinton to etch a strong contrast between his own policies and of those of Mr. Bush, to portray himself as the major alternative for voters seeking a change in the White House.
It took only a few minutes for the debate to settle into the now-familiar pattern of the campaign: Mr. Bush insisted that the economy was not as bad as people think, relied heavily on getting credit for the end of the cold war and campaigned against Democratic candidates of the past.
Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, tried to present himself as a man more in touch with the concerns of average Americans, ready to make difficult decisions but clear-eyed about the challenges. And Mr. Perot devoted most of his time to painting himself as "the people's choice," a hard-charging businessman taking on a greater challenge because Americans want him to.
 
2-on-1 Criticism
 Mr. Perot's presence was evident from the very first question, as Mr. Bush pulled out what his campaign considers his most powerful weapon: experience.
Mr. Perot acidly conceded that Mr. Bush had a point. "I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt," he said.
A few minutes later, Mr. Perot virtually sprang to Mr. Clinton's defense and turned the heat back on Mr. Bush as the President attacked the Arkansas Governor on another favorite Republican campaign issue: Mr. Clinton's antiwar activities during the Vietnam years.
"Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there," he said. "But I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person in your formative years? Or did they occur when you were a senior official in the Federal Government?"
For Mr. Bush, the debate was the latest in a series of attempts at redefinition. He has failed so far to shed the image of a detached President who was powerful on issues of diplomacy and war that no longer seem so pressing, and who is flaccid on more urgent domestic issues.
Tonight, Mr. Bush offered nothing essentially new, sticking to his insistence that the economy is doing better than most Americans recognize. The White House has conceded that this very position hurt Mr. Bush badly in 1991 as he refused to recognize publicly the sluggishness of the economy, but it has nevertheless remained at the heart of Mr. Bush's campaign.
Over and over, Mr. Bush offered the same answers: "We've got it," when asked what he would do to insure a strong military, or "We did it," when Mr. Perot talked about cutting back on long-range nuclear weapons. The President also fogged his answers with esoteric, alphabet-soup bureaucratese.
He repeatedly mentioned the end of the cold war. "We've dramatically changed the world," he said, several times offering this standard passage from his campaign speeches: "Kids go to bed at night without fear of nuclear war."
Looking for ways to persuade Americans that he was committed now to domestic problems after focusing on foreign affairs for much of his first term, Mr. Bush even promised to keep James A. Baker 3d on at the White House after the election, even though he said just a few days ago that he would like Mr. Baker to resume his job as Secretary of State.
Mr. Clinton's challenge was the polar opposite of Mr. Bush's. He must still convince voters that they not only want a change, but that they are comfortable with him -- as a person and as a President.
After months of running an extraordinarily energetic campaign that gave him a lead in the public-opinion polls, Mr. Clinton spent the weeks before the debate engaged in an effort to sit on his lead and leave the fighting to the Republicans.
Last night, Mr. Clinton's performance was more steady than spectacular. Buthe stayed focused on dispelling concerns about his draft record, about his lack of experience in foreign policy and domestic policy at the national level and even about his family. At one point, Mr. Clinton used part of his time to wish his wife, Hillary, a happy 17th wedding anniversary.
Mr. Clinton's desire to avoid any missteps was perhaps most evident in his answer to a question about whether he would make members of the Federal Reserve Board "more accountable." Any real answer -- yes or no -- would have affected the markets and given the Bush campaign a free field of fire. So Mr. Clinton did the only thing he could. He evaded the question.
"Frankly I don't think that's the problem today," Mr. Clinton said, turning to an attack on Mr. Bush's economic policies.

HEADLINE: A Test for Women Who Build Cars

SERIES: Closing Willow Run: New Burdens for G.M. Women -- Fourth article of a series.

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YPSILANTI, Mich., Oct. 11

 BODY:
After everything they have been through, after all the victories won so slowly over the years, there is one more test for the women of General Motors. Sometime next year, the company's Willow Run assembly plant here will shut forever. Seniority is everything when it comes to jobs at other plants, and the women have less of it than their male co-workers.
Now, as she has to be strong all over again, Kelly Arter finds it helpful to remember the foreman she took on 14 years ago. She had just moved up from assembler to replacement operator, the only woman on the job. 
 "Anything he figured I'd get hurton, he'd put me on it," Mrs. Arter, who is 35 years old, recalled the other day. "He had me on the frame line where you used a big, heavy, right-angle torque gun. You had to hang on with both hands or it would rip your arm off. He'd call me a bitch. Then he'd say, 'Have you had enough yet?'
"He hounded me until he figured out I was more stubborn than he was," she continued. "Finally one day he said to me, 'You're one of the best replacement operators I've ever had.' I said, 'That's right.' "
 
Many Obstacles
 The women of Willow Run have done it all -- welding raw metal in the body shop (the hell hole, it is called), loading 70-pound seats, fighting the deadening monotony of the never-ending line, just like the men. But the women, many of them, were often the ones who went home and cooked dinner for their families. They found baby sitters who would cover for them on the 3:30 to midnight shift. And then there were foremen like Mrs. Arter's, and others who made sexual advances.
Now, after finally winning acceptance, the women have to do it all over again somewhere else. Everyone is scared of what will happen to them when they lose what was, with all its hardships, not just a job, but a place in the middle class, a way of life, a family. But the women, many of whom also won their independence at the plant, are once again the most vulnerable. They have less seniority because they did not get in the door at Willow Run until 1968, 12 years after G.M. acquired the plant. And many more of them have the added burden of being single parents.
 
Parity in Wages
 There are 640 women and 3,360 men among the hourly workers at Willow Run. With the union behind them, the women have earned the same high wages and benefits as the men.
Fourteen years ago, Betty Haywood was newly divorced, with two small children, and trying to make ends meet on a $3-an-hour job as a store cashier. Then her mother, who cleaned bathrooms at a Ford plant, telephoned.
"She said, 'They're hiring at G.M.; put in an application,' " recalled Ms. Haywood. She was one of the first women to work in the body shop, where she was routinely burned by flying sparks. "You had families to support," said Ms. Haywood, who is 46 now. "You went where they put you. We had to prove we weren't sissies."
Installing bumpers has allowed Carla Pittman to make up for what she considers her big mistake: at age 18, about to graduate from high school and not married, she became pregnant. "A lot of people told me, 'Look what you've done, you've ruined your life,' " Ms. Pittman said.
At 36, now recently divorced, she has such a severe case of carpal tunnel syndrome -- an affliction caused by performing repetitive motions -- that she wakes up at night with her hands throbbing. Two weeks ago, she was hospitalized with bleeding ulcers. But what Ms. Pittman talks about is her 17-year-old daughter, LaToya, who will graduate from high school next spring. LaToya wants to be a television broadcaster, and Ms. Pittman intends to put her through college.
As a black woman, Ms. Pittman would have faced even tougher job prospects beyond the auto plant. Her responsibilities keep getting bigger. A few weeks ago, after her sister-in-law's house burned in Detroit, Ms. Pittman invited her and her three small children into her two-bedroom apartment. Ms. Pittman is now sleeping on the sofa.
"My mother says, 'Carla, you're always trying to help somebody,' " Ms. Pittman said the other day. "I said: 'Mama, I'm sorry, but this could be me. I have a job now, but I might not tomorrow.' "
For many women, the money from the auto plant was a ticket out of bad relationships. Tammy Killingbeck, who has worked on the line for 14 of her 33 years, said she and many others live by this credo: Never depend on a man.
"Men always leave," said Ms. Killingbeck, whose parents were divorced when she was small. She married at 15, was a mother at 16 and is now divorced.
Ms. Killingbeck was talking the other day over lunch with three friends from the plant. "The thing that scares me the most," said one of them, Velinda Asam, known as Sam, "is losing my independence."
That, said her friends, is also what they fear. Ms. Asam is 32, divorced and raising an 18-month-old daughter, Sara. "I'm afraid I'll end up on welfare," she said.
Julie Allera, another of the women, said, "I'll work two jobs if I have to." She is 31, also divorced, with a 4-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son. Before Willow Run, she did work two jobs, pumping gas and ringing up groceries. Still, two minimum-wage jobs do not add up to one $16.50-an-hour job plus benefits at the auto plant.
Whatever happens, vowed Ms. Asam, who fills brake lines with fluid, she will not become dependent on a man. She moved out of her father's house when she was 18 and newly hired at Willow Run.
She is hoping for a transfer to a plant nearby. In Ypsilanti, she counts on relatives and her best friend, Willie Smith, for moral support and emergency baby sitting. But her backup team cannot follow her to Texas or Tennessee, where there are G.M. plants that will have openings for Willow Run workers.
Ms. Pittman says she has another reason for being nervous about moving to the South: racism. "I feel comfortable at Willow Run," she said.
 
No Guarantees
 While most of Willow Run's workers are expected to get transfers, it is too soon to know who will go where, or when. And, with 21 G.M. plants scheduled for closing by 1995 and additional closings predicted, there are no guarantees that some people will not end up unemployed.
Lynda Kaye-Sennett will start a new job next Monday at a plant in Warren, Mich., but her worries are just starting. Trained as a carpenter, she works in what are classified as the skilled trades. Women in the higher-paying skilled trades are still struggling for acceptance. At Willow Run, there are fewer than 20 women among the 550 skilled tradesmen.
Ms. Kaye-Sennett, who is 38 and is married to an iron worker, has worked at Willow Run since 1986. Before that, she was the only woman pouring hot metal at a steel mill until she was laid off.
"I'm going to have to prove myself all over again," she said. "I know what they're going to say: 'Have you seen the woman? There's a woman carpenter. Did you see her yet? Geez, I wonder if she puts out. If not, she's going to be a bitch.' "
She says she is just glad to be working. In 1988, a co-worker accidentally ran over her left foot with a 12-ton vehicle. "The doctors were saying 'beyond repair,' " she said.
She took off her left running shoe. "I still can't bend it," she said, demonstrating. She laughed ruefully. "I'll never wear high heels again. I love high heels."
 
Talking Things Out
 Bob Harlow, a coal miner's son who is president of the United Auto Workers local that represents Willow Run workers, said that in the last few months, "the women seem to be handling the closing much better than the men."
"It's easier for them to talk about it," he said. "The men think they're supposed to be macho."
Mrs. Arter talks things through with her best friend, Linda Bolden, a former teacher who works on the line. Mrs. Arter and her husband, Doug, both work at the plant. They met when she broke him in on the line (and then wooed him with homemade chocolate chip cookies left in his toolbox). They have two children, and the family must worry about losing two incomes.
Ms. Asam says she cannot afford to break down. "I've got my daughter to take care of," she said. She recently started talking to a psychologist. "I know I need help in handling this," she said.
 
More Seeking Help
 Mr. Harlow has been urging people to visit counselors since February's announcement of the plant closing. A lot of women are. One psychologist, Mary Farrell, says the women from Willow Run who seek her help far outnumber the men.
"The women have to hold things together," she said. "They're incredible survivors. It takes courage just to walk through the door of that plant every day."
Now, as the day when they will walk through it for the last time nears, many women are doing more than just waiting for a telegram from the company informing them that they have been transferred.
Monica Kenny has raised four daughters alone, doing household repairs like fixing the plumbing and still baking bread and sewing costumes for school shows. Now, at age 46, more than 20 years out of college, she is back at school hoping to earn a master's degree in communications.
"When the plant closes, I'm going to be prepared," said Ms. Kenny, who is the recording secretary of the union local, the first woman to hold that post. "I've got to take care of myself." Her first term paper was on negotiating skills for professionals. She got an A.
When a lot of people recall the day General Motors announced that Willow Run would close, they talk about Mrs. Arter sobbing. Her rule had always been: Never whine, never cry.
"I just fell apart," Mrs. Arter said. "I was in this big despair. Finally, I got mad. I said, 'I'm not going to just walk out of here without fighting.' "
Along with her husband, she has thrown herself into organizing union protest rallies and phone banks to help elect Bill Clinton President. She recently completed a Dale Carnegie course. At the graduation party at the union hall, the teacher, Bob Stackpool, announced that her 35 classmates -- most of them men -- had unanimously voted Mrs. Arter the winner of the leadership award.
As they prepare for uncertain futures, Mrs. Arter and many other Willow Run women are emboldened by their past. "I used to be intimidated by office women," Ms. Killingbeck said. "They were all pretty, and they got to wear nice clothes."
Ms. Killingbeck has long blonde hair and calluses on her hands from building cars. "Now I'm proud," she said. "I think, 'We've worked in a factory. We're strong.' "

HEADLINE: Castro Steels a Suffering Nation for Confrontation

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 8

 BODY:
In the kind of consumer bulletin that has become depressingly familiar to Cubans, the country's domestic press agency provided instructions last week on how to make candles. The candles are needed because of electricity shortages, and like scores of other ordinary goods they have disappeared from store shelves.
Other recent press reports have shown how to cure headaches with common plants, for lack of medicine, and how to cook without oil or tomatoes, mainstays of the traditionally rich Cuban cuisine. 
 As Cuba's electricity supply has flickered and waned and skimpy diets have grown poorer, experts on Cuban affairs say helpful hints like these are the more benign signs of a campaign aimed at steeling the population for what President Fidel Castro has begun warning will be a fateful confrontation with American-led global capitalism.
More ominous preparations for this confrontation, they say, are an intensified crackdown on dissent and calls for military preparedness.
 
Defense Brigades Formed
 Almost every month brings an announcement of some new "defense brigade" or other security measure aimed at heightening battle readiness in what is already one of the world's most heavily militarized societies.
Last week, there were inspection exercises "intended to discover possible cracks in the security system" and root out "enemy infiltration," according to the Government-controlled news outlets.
The loss of huge economic subsidies after the collapse of the Soviet Union has plunged the Cuban economy into its worst crisis since Mr. Castro came to power nearly 34 years ago. But with proposals for economic alternatives being rebuffed, and the campaign warning of confrontation becoming increasingly strident, many analysts say Mr. Castro has decided against risking managed change and believes that hunkering down is his revolution's only hope for weathering the country's crisis.
Mr. Castro appears to have concluded that the payoffs for significant political and economic reforms are too far in the future and that the risk that his leadership could be swept away in the upheaval is too great.
"The Americans believe this is their opportunity to crush us," Mr. Castro warned last month. The 65-year-old leader went on to urge his people to commit "the last drop of sweat and the last drop of blood," to defend the revolution, and warned that the "imperialists" supposedly poised to attack Cuba "would get the blood-soaked dust of our earth, if they did not die in the struggle."
 
A War Footing Is Seen
 With his economy unraveling and signs that a population accustomed to decent living standards is wearying of increasing privation, experts say Mr. Castro has chosen to put his country on what increasingly resembles a war footing.
Mr. Castro has seized upon Congress's recent passage of a bill widening the United States' three-decade-old trade embargo on Cuba by banning trade by foreign subsidiaries of American companies. Large rallies have been held around the country at which the bill is cited as evidence of hostile United States intentions toward Cuba.
"Everyone is being kept on their toes, and this serves the regime's attempts to consolidate its hold in extraordinarily difficult times," said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. "All the objective evidence suggests that Cuba is preparing for a state of siege."
Among the clearest signs of what some say is the bunker mentality in leadership circles was the removal late last month of Carlos Aldana, the third most powerful member of the Communist Party and its only senior figure known for his relative moderation.
Mr. Aldana was a cautious reformer who had broad oversight of party ideology, foreign affairs, culture and the press.
"One of the things that keeps this leadership in power is fear, and that is what all of this is about," Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard University expert on Cuba said of Mr. Aldana's dismissal. "They have been spending a lot of energy creating a fear among the population that if things are bad now, they could be much worse."
 
Worried About Party's Fate
 "In Aldana's case, he represented relief from dogmatism," Mr. Dominguez said. "But what Fidel has been working at is circling the wagons and reinforcing the view that if there is change, the elite and the party will suffer the same fate as their counterparts in Eastern Europe."
Economists estimate that in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, Cuba's national income has shrunk by as much as 50 percent in the last three years.
By Mr. Castro's own account, Cuba's purchasing power for imports has fallen to $2.2 billion this year from a high of $8.139 billion in 1989. The country, he said in a recent speech, has lost nearly $2.5 billion in sugar sales to its former patron, the Soviet Union.
Now, he said, instead of being able to purchase 7.5 tons of oil with the proceeds from the sale of each ton of sugar under a heavily subsidized, three-decade arrangement with the former Soviet Union, sales of each ton of Cuba's principal crop, sugar, provide the means to purchase only 1.4 tons of oil.
Harshly affecting nearly every sector of the economy, Cuba's annual oil imports have fallen to about 6 million tons from a Soviet-era high of about 13 million tons. In an additional blow, a lack of money forced Cuba to suspend indefinitely its construction of a large Soviet-designed nuclear power plant that would have reduced dependence on oil.
In deals with former Soviet republics, economists estimate, Cuba has been able to reconstitute only about one quarter of its lost trade with the Soviet Union. More important, what imports remain are at world market prices, not subsidized as in the past.
To stem its economic collapse, Mr. Castro's Government has thrown whatever resources it could muster into a few priority fields like foreign tourism development and biotechnology, which it has hoped would supplant the sugar industry as income sources.
With these investments providing mixed results, Mr. Aldana and many mid-level party officials gingerly urged greater economic and even political reforms. Last year, in an interview with an American reporter, Mr. Aldana indicated that the Communist Party was prepared to allow opposition figures to run for seats in the National Assembly.
 
Crackdown on Dissidents
 Since Mr. Aldana's interview, however, tolerance for criticism of the Government has all but disappeared. Dissidents have been taken from church services by plainclothes agents, and one critic of the Government, Sebastian Arcos, faces a six-year prison sentence in a trial now under way for having written a letter to the United Nations complaining of human rights violations.
In the economic realm, the reforms proposed by party pragmatists like Mr. Aldana were aimed at allowing small farmers to sell their own produce and introducing limited free enterprise by Cuban tradesmen.
But at Cuba's fifth Communist Party Congress last October, Mr. Castro invoked a distaste for inequality as he personally beat back suggestions to allow farmers to market their own produce. At the same time, he pushed through constitutional reforms that allow him unilaterally to declare a state of emergency in case of crises that "affect internal order or the security or stability of the state."
Since then, economists say, the Government has plowed ahead with survival schemes inspired by the inefficient Soviet models of the past, for instance sending as many as 500,000 inexperienced city dwellers for stints of working on huge state farms.
 
Food Supply Sinks
 Cuba's food supply has continued to deteriorate, and many economists who see little evidence of any benefit to production from these emergency measures have begun to suspect that their objectives are primarily political, not economic.
"The more of this we see, the more we have to conclude that this is being done for the control element," said Sergio Roca, an Adelphi University expert on the Cuban economy. "The thrust is to keep people busy, to keep them moving from side to side. Besides that, they can only hope to get some basic foodstuffs at an immense cost."
But given the omnipresence of security forces, which infiltrate and break up dissident movements before they can get off the ground, analysts of Cuban affairs are reluctant to predict Mr. Castro's downfall any time soon. What most agree on, however, is that if the country's economic decline continues unabated, eventual collapse is inevitable.
"The leadership knows it is at a dead-end street," Mr. Roca said. "But they refuse to allow reforms that might succeed at the cost of the own hides, so they argue that this is not the time for change, and meanwhile the country just continues to go down."

HEADLINE: In Wake of Turmoil, United Ways Remain Strong

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
When United Way was reeling last spring from revelations of extravagance and mismanagement at its Washington headquarters, a national poll of past donors found 25 percent saying they would give less money or none at all in the next drive.
Early evidence from campaigns for United Way contributions in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut indicates that pledges are not dropping off sharply. And when they are, United Way officials suggest, the reason is the recession as much as the shadow over the organization. 
United Ways of Tri-State, the largest of the country's 2,200 United Ways, has a goal this year of matching last year's $121,889,292 in donations from employees and corporations -- plus one dollar added "as symbolic motivation," said William A. Schreyer, the chairman of Merrill Lynch who is head of the current campaign for Tri-State, a partnership of 33 United Ways in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
Several major corporations holding early campaigns in the region report that employees seem to be pledging more, although a wave of layoffs in the region means that there are fewer employees to tap.
At the GE Capital Corporation in Stamford, Conn., the campaign raised $420,000, a 20 percent increase, and the company's gift increased 20 percent, to $210,000. The gift from the parent company, General Electric in Fairfield, Conn., will increase to $1 million and a double-digit increase is expected in employee gifts.
The employee campaign at Texaco's executive offices in Harrison raised its goal to $500,000, a 25 percent increase, and the company's gift to Tri-State will be up from $225,000. Warner Lambert in Morris Plains, N.J., is raising its corporate gift to about $400,000, a 5 percent gain, and a preliminary campaign among senior managers is ahead of its goal. Merrill Lynch was increasing its corporate gift to $900,000 from $650,000, and raised the employee campaign goal to $3.2 million from $3 million.
Other companies report they will stay at last year's level: A.T.& T.'s gift to Tri-State will be $1.8 million and no dramatic change is expected in its employee campaign, which raised $6.5 million last year.
One major corporation that is cutting its contribution, Citicorp, has been buffeted by its own problems with management and the economy. "Everyone said with the recession and adverse publicity, it would be an awfully tough campaign," Mr. Schreyer said.
United Way officials say the scandal surrounding William Aramony, who was forced out as president of United Way of America, caused United Ways like Tri-State to rethink the way they plead their case. This year they are underscoring their autonomy, emphasizing that almost all the money they collect is used locally. (United Way of America receives less than 1 percent for training and promotion from its members.)
"These days companies want to know how we work, who we help and how efficiently we do it," said Betty Beene, president of the United Ways of Tri-State, who said the goal was to make sure people see United Way as a group that affects their lives rather than "an amorphous charity."
Changes in Tri-State's promotions this year range from the concrete to the symbolic, including changing the drive's slogan from "give to United Way" to "give through United Way."
 
Giving Some Elbow Grease
 Tri-State representatives have met with executives in boardrooms and employees in cafeterias and garages, including three 3 A.M. sessions with United Parcel Service workers.
United Way partners arranged hundreds of tours for employees to visit community agencies caring for the elderly, children and the disabled to show donors where their payroll gifts were spent. The money raised by Tri-State goes to 1,800 agencies from big organizations like the Red Cross and the Scouts to small, neighborhood groups like the Crown Heights Youth Collective in Brooklyn.
Many companies have chosen to forgo campaign luncheons, substituting a "Day of Caring," in which employees work as volunteers at community agencies. In Bridgeport, employees from General Electric turned out to repair and paint a house where Jewish Family Services provides counseling and help to 2,000 adults and children each year.
United Way of Eastern Fairfield County's event attracted a number of senior corporate executives. Willie B. Edlow Jr., the United Way president, said: "Controversy has been turned into opportunity; we couldn't pay for the attention we are getting."
Clifford Smith, president of the GE Foundation, said, "If anything, this year our people are more committed than ever to the United Way because it supports our local community, our friends and our neighbors."
 
Pooling the Donations
 Tri-State was created 15 years ago to coordinate fund-raising in the region's largest companies. In raising and distributing money, it takes into account the fact that suburban residents frequently commute to city jobs and want their charitable contributions to be used in both locations.
Campaign proceeds are pooled and the 33 partners agree on the share that each will receive, a division agreeable to United Ways like New York or Newark but less attractive to United Ways in economically buoyant communities like Bergen County, which left the partnership this summer, saying it could do better alone.
United Way of New York City is the largest of the 33 partners and received a 38 percent share last year. United Way of Sullivan County is the smallest and received one-tenth of 1 percent of the pool last year.
This year Tri-State will pool campaign proceeds from 164 major corporations, down from 220 because smaller companies or those with operations in one locality, like a medical center, will turn proceeds directly to 1 of the 33 partners -- another change showing money collected locally stays in the community.
Elsewhere in the country, reports from early campaigns are mixed. San Francisco expects to raise significantly more than its $57.2 million total last year, perhaps as much of $66 million. Dallas, whose economy is tattered, says it is running 2 percent behind last year's pace.
United Way has become such an accepted part of the business ethos that after the turmoil surrounding Mr. Aramony, who received $465,000 in salary and benefits, officials at some companies surveyed employees to learn their concerns and then asked United Way to respond.
"We're very upfront about it," said Ms. Beene. "Anyone who has given money has every right to feel angry and betrayed -- until we explain it can never happen again."
After the publicity about Mr. Aramony, Ms. Beene invited scrutiny by Tri-State's board, which then froze the salaries of top executives, including her own of $240,000. The organization plans to move from its Park Avenue office to cheaper or even rent-free quarters.
In the free-ranging discussions at the companies, other grievances surfaced, including complaints that United Way maintains a near-monopoloy, shutting out other charitable groups.
In a move that other companies are watching, J. P. Morgan & Company last year asked its employees to give to United Way, to Earth Share, a coalition of 40 environmental groups, or to both. United Way donations fell off slightly and Earth Share received contributions from employees who had never given to United Way.
Last year Tri-State offered employees in 24 companies the option to direct their gifts to agencies that were not United Way participants. This year it will expand that option to 40 companies. And Tri-State no longer encourages awards to companies with 100 percent employee participation, tacitly acknowledging complaints from some employees about arm-twisting to get them to give.
Peter M. Ostergard, Citibank's vice president for corporate contributions, said United Way needed to direct campaigns not only to the large corporate donors, but to small- and medium-sized companies. "United Way needs as part of its overhauling to really think through where it wants to be in the next century," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Off the Trail -- Visits With Americans;
Have You Heard the One About the Presidential Race That Wasn't Funny?

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Driving through the hilly night shadows at the edge of the city, the cab driver got lost in a joke, one he was telling about President Bush. "He was overseas somewhere -- Iraq? -- and got sick to his stomach, and the really funny part was why he got sick." He paused, groped. "But I can't remember that part."
Take my driver, please. 
 It had been another uneventful night in an occasional but ever more difficult search for political humor in America. If other wanderers can debate the tastiest sparerib cafes of the land, why then a professional witness lately criss-crossing the nation ought to come up with some nasty, deserved laughs at the Presidential campaigners' expense.
Not the homogenized sort rooted in the balanced nightly monologues of television humor that reduces the nation to a vast collegiate sound stage. No, something imbalanced and in person, a mean and lop-sided funniness of the sort Jonathan Swift and Lenny Bruce might have applied to the vastly promising material of the 1992 campaign, all the evasions, squeaks and wheezes of its chief actors and the hard times and gullibility of its groundlings.
 
'All Dead Horses'
 "You got your Dan Quayle, your Murphy Brown, the not inhaling, Gennifer Flowers -- these are all dead horses that none of the club comics want to flog," apologized Chris Drake, proprietor of The Funny Bone here. This is one of the thousands of comedy clubs that dot the land where, professional comics and booking agents on this tight circuit say, there is no room for political jokes this year.
"The recession has hit our business, too," Chris Cipa, one of the comics, explained. "Politics is risky. Most people come to the clubs and pay $20 or so to forget their troubles, not to have a lecture jammed down their throat. A Clinton joke will get a stare, not a laugh, ever since he became the front runner and got respect. And Al Gore is just not funny -- the least funny person in years," he insisted.
A recent night's fare of three stand-ups at The Funny Bone might have had Willy Loman in the aisles grimacing: Hair-loss jokes. Relationship jokes. Homophobic wisecracks. Panhandling jokes. Condom jokes. Airline jokes. Gynecology jokes. Yet lots of laughs from a mixed crowd that stepped in from the madding world of a surrounding shopping mall, a youngish group that seemed sadly preoccupied with romance and mortality.
 
A Stand-Up Exception
 Which is all the more reason to appreciate a stand-up exception to the pathetic rule, Randy Credico. He is a comic who can name and mock a dozen now forgotten friendly dictators of Latin America, a politics addict who would rather joke about the S& L's than S and M. He is so fed up with the politically correct, apolitical state of affairs in the clubs that he has rebelled and lately gathers a few brave political satirists every Thursday night on Manhattan's West Side (you thought Kennebunkport?) for some bootleg, thoroughly imbalanced trashing of current politics.
In a basement hideaway at the West Gate Cafe on Broadway at West 114th Street, working beneath a club booming with Columbia University students whose general taste in humor he abhors, Mr. Credico only starts with the unfunniness of Al Gore, postulating that he was chosen for the ticket as "the only man whiter than Clinton" in a strategy of going for the Jefferson Davis vote. "A Clinton-Gore button -- radical step these days, right? You know, like Fidel-Che?" he said.
On a recent Thursday, the laughter seemed eased by a sense of relief that it could be so easy to mock, publicly and quite unfairly, assorted targets like Senator Alfonse D'Amato's ethics, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman's humorlessness, Senator Edward Kennedy's obliviousness, the parallel vanities of Henry Kissinger and William Kunstler, Patrick Buchanan's secret campaign for the German elections of 1996, radical feminism's woodenness, and the pro-choice lobby's insensitivity toward the Christian evangelical tobacco lobby's need for fresh smokers. Plus the major candidates, rudely roughed up as hypocrites and fools. And a nostalgic tribute to Ronald Reagan in retirement, engrossed in the Reader's Digest condensed version of "Cat in the Hat."
As an average feminist, Lizz Winstead convulsed the place in pleading guilty to the anti-abortion lobby's suspicions about her: "True, that's all we have on our mind. I get up and say, 'Well, I've got to go to breakfast, have an abortion, go to the sauna, have an abortion, wax my car, have an abortion.' "
 
Dropping Children, Not Bombs
 John Stewart was worthy of Swift in positing a scene out of the fact that the United States may be 15th in the world in child education but it is first in weapons technology: "In the next war the bombs will be way too smart and valuable. We'll just have to drop illiterate school children."
Mr. Credico updates by the news cycle, as in his latest tinny-voiced impersonation of President Bush commenting, amid Operation Re-Election Storm, on Governor Clinton's anti-Vietnam-War activities as a young student. "He's a, uh, he's a RADical. Went to MOS-cow. Was there with Stalin, helped build those five-year plans. He was part of the October Revolution."
Fairness? Balance? Well, Ross Perot was included, wavering on whether to vote for himself. "Perot is a French word that means LaRouche," Mr. Credico explained. "Or Reverend Moon, or L. Ron Hubbard, something of that nature. Wonderful guy, isn't he? Makes a lot of sense till he starts talkin'," the comic said, unafraid to wax pernicious about 1992.

HEADLINE: Little Progress as Trade Talks Begin

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Oct. 11

 BODY:
European Community officials reported some progress in trade negotiations with the United States today, but it remained far from certain that a breakthrough would be reached in the long-stalled talks.
Officials provided no details of the day's discussions, which were led by Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, and Frans Andriessen, the European Community's External Affairs Commissioner. Mrs. Hills and Mr. Andriessen were scheduled to continue their negotiations here on Monday. 
 Officials from both sides described the talks as constructive and said they remained optimistic that they could resolve the disputes, which have held up a broader worldwide trade agreement being negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But the talks will have to overcome substantial hurdles. France has pledged to reject any concessions to the United States on agriculture trade, which is at the center of the dispute, and its foreign minister, Roland Dumas, said today that the talks had not made any progress and that he did not expect any deal.
And the Bush Administration, while clearly hoping to be able to bring home another free trade agreement before Election Day, has said it does not plan to offer any new proposals on the farm issues.
If the two sides cannot agree, the United States has threatened to impose $1 billion in punitive tariffs on exports from Europe, a move that would almost certainly doom any hopes of a broader worldwide agreement to liberalize trade.
 
Feeling the Pressure of Deadlines
 "Progress can be reported, but we haven't yet struck a deal," said Ray MacSharry, the European Community's Agriculture Commissioner, who met with United States Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan.
Mr. MacSharry described the negotiatons as "very cordial" but said both sides felt they were working under considerable time pressure. If the United States and Europe cannot patch up their differences in the next several weeks, it would become extremely difficult to complete the wider GATT agreement by next spring, when Congressional authorization for the United States to negotiate under a "fast track" provision expires.
Under the provision, Congress must vote on the trade agreement as a whole, presumably making passage more likely than if an agreement is picked apart point by point.
 
Agricultural Policies at Issue
 The principal sticking points are the subsidies provided by some European governments to growers of oilseeds and the level of subsidized grain exports from Europe. The European nations have also demanded that the United States allow them freer access to its telecommunications market, although phone service in many European nations remains a state monopoly.
Even if the negotiators can reach agreement this week, it is unclear whether the heads of the 12 European Community nations will approve it. The 12 leaders will meet on Friday in Birmingham, England, for a one-day meeting. Germany and Britain are especially anxious for a trade agreement, which they hope will give a boost to their troubled economies.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany may be reluctant to push President Francois Mitterrand of France to accept any deal that would cause him severe political problems at home, especially with Europe still trying to patch up its plans for greater monetary and political unification.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
When Race Emerges as a Political Issue, for Better or Worse

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
Q. WHAT could possibly be worse for black America than to be personified by a convicted murderer who, released on a weekend furlough, rapes a white woman?
A. To be ignored altogether.
Willie Horton, meet "The Invisible Man." The Republican Party, Andrew Hacker wrote in "Two Nations" (Scribners), has "all but explicitly stated that it is willing to have itself regarded as a white party." This year, the Democrats imply that they are unwilling to be regarded as a black party -- particularly one defined by Mr. Horton, the convict furloughed by the 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee, or by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two black Americans whom Mr. Hacker said "played critical roles" in George Bush's victory four years ago. 
 In "Putting People First" (Times Books), the Clinton-Gore campaign manifesto, the closest the Democratic candidates come to mentioning blacks is, appropriately enough, in the chapter on civil rights. "Oppose racial quotas" is the second item of the agenda for "how we can help heal America," followed at some length by a proposal to guarantee "language-minority Americans" equal opportunity.
"It's meant to be a prescription for the entire country, not for one group or another," said Robert O. Boorstin, the campaign's deputy communications director for policy. "An economic strategy that's right for African-Americans is right for white Americans."
Going into last night's Presidential debate, racial and ethnic politics have been largely eschewed, for better and worse. Two Republican targets -- Murphy Brown and Woody Allen -- are white; so are most poor Americans, despite the stereotype. The urban crisis, so compelling last spring with the Los Angeles riots, has been placed on the back burner.
In New York, though, ethnic and racial politics is thriving. The first step in today's Columbus Day Parade was actually taken last week when State Attorney General Robert Abrams, the Democratic nominee for United States Senate, decided not to march. He ceded Fifth Avenue for the day to the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato.
The Senator has been accused of fighting too hard on behalf of constituents -- at least those who have contributed to his campaigns or who are represented by his brother, a lawyer. Last week, Mr. D'Amato branded Mr. Abrams a "sissy." By the time each candidate has thoroughly "dissed" his opponent, they could even leave some voters with the impression that the choice is between a wimp and a pimp.
J. Peter Grace, the 79-year-old grandson of a former Mayor and a New York expatriate, also weighed in last week with gratuitous references to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins. Mr. Grace inexplicably referred to the Governor as "Cuomo the homo" and to the Mayor as "Dinkins the pinkins" -- presumably a chromatic allusion to Mr. Dinkins's political caste rather than to his skin color.
It was the second time in several weeks that the Mayor's color has been singled out publicly. Some angry police officers protesting against Mr. Dinkins referred to his "true color" as yellow. Those who were reported to refer to the Mayor or to other blacks as "nigger" may have unwittingly performed a public service of sorts: as a result, the acting Police Commissioner barred the use of that word or other racial epithets by officers except in unspecified cases of "extreme emotional distress."
Mr. Dinkins's extremely emotional response to the police demonstration contrasted with his more familiar protestations only the week before, when he was asked whether nonblack New Yorkers are biased against him because he is black -- a bias that, to some people, may have been manifested in earlier criticism about his passion for tennis.
"If I had gone to a basketball game, it would be all right," Mr. Dinkins said, and then offered this extraordinary observation: "I think there's a bias against tennis. People don't understand that tennis is a wonderful sport. The King of Sweden played it until he was 85."
The chronologically advantaged King of Sweden, who would be a member of a language minority in the United States, probably never experienced racial prejudice, as Mr. Dinkins has, though. Still, the Mayor insisted, "I've said very clearly, my language was, people aren't biased against me because I like tennis. I said they're biased against tennis."
That was before the police demonstration suggested that regardless of their prejudices about tennis, some people may be biased against the Mayor too. His quandary, like Gov. Bill Clinton's, is to decide when mentioning race helps more than it hurts.
"I don't have any problem when he's talking to black groups," Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem said of Mr. Clinton. "My problem is the campaign and the strategy as it relates to bus trips and speeches given on prime-time television where he is addressing crowds other than African-American. We've got to be courted publicly and we've got to be treated as first-class voters and cannot be taken for granted."
He said he was less concerned, though, that Mr. Clinton might raise false hopes. "That doesn't mean in a bad economy that everybody's going back to work," Mr. Rangel said. "It means our problems will not be ignored, and that's all anybody can ask for."

HEADLINE: Abrams Takes Campaign To Conservative Region

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y., Oct. 11

 BODY:
In a manic, seven-stop trip through the rolling hills and cornstalk countryside of central New York, Attorney General Robert Abrams today branded Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's television commercials as purposeful distortions, his recent Senate filibuster as a cynical attempt to obscure his voting record, and his 12-year Senate tenure as a hemorrhage of jobs, business and hope for New York's middle class.
Supporters met Mr. Abrams, the Democratic Senate nominee, with genuine warmth and rounds of applause at his appeals for national health care, abortion rights and job protection. But others cast a jaundiced eye on the upstate tour and said the Attorney General would have difficulty winning broad support in a predominantly conservative region that Mr. D'Amato has stroked and stumped for years. 
 As the Attorney General's three-car convoy sloshed through a rainy Sunday, grinding its gears toward the 48th hour of a three-day fence-mending and spin-control mission, the Senate race seemed to be shaping up as both a debate over liberalism and a referendum on the Bush Presidency.
Certainly, Mr. Abrams was busy grabbing for the Clinton-Gore team's coattails. Trying to convince skeptical voters that a government run by Democrats would mean more jobs and better health care (without new taxes), he invokes the Presidential ticket at every stop. In at least one speech he even adopted Mr. Clinton's familiar pounding hand motions and his refrain, "We can do it," complete with the Arkansas native's adopted Kennedyesque inflection. It was a lift from a lift, as it were, and no small feat for a man who has never fully lost his broad Bronx accent.
 
'Hopefully Liberal'
 In the college town of Ithaca, especially, supporters seemed pleased with his liberal stands on such issues as abortion and the environment. He was met there with signs calling him "hopefully liberal," a poke at Mr. D'Amato's recent televised attacks accusing Mr. Abrams of being "hopelessly liberal."
But the day brought intermittent rain and uneven responses. While the sun shone in Ithaca and the crowd cheered, in Elmira it rained and the air was filled with thunder and the shouts of several D'Amato supporters who stood across from the local Democratic headquarters screaming, "DAA-MAA-TOE!" and shouting "Bob Abrams -- hopelessly liberal!"
The protesters urged motorists passing by to honk if they supported the Senator. Many did. "Six more years!" shouted one particularly energetic Republican. Not everyone concurred. "What a nightmare," said a man on the opposite side of both the street and the political spectrum.
It was in Cortland, however, that Mr. Abrams had one of his hardest sells. Meeting in a bowling alley to talk with labor leaders and Democratic supporters about the impending closing of a Smith-Corona typewriter factory, Mr. Abrams blamed Mr. D'Amato for failing to protect New Yorkers' jobs. He challenged Mr. D'Amato's record, linking him with the "Reagan-Bush years" and citing statistics showing that New York State has lost more jobs than any other state in the nation. Using a phrase he repeats at every whistle stop, Mr. Abrams told the crowd: "He says he is bringing home the bacon. But we know that's baloney."
He also criticized Mr. D'Amato for a "grandstand show" in his recent filibuster in support of a bill to save the Smith-Corona jobs, which the Senate passed but the House is not expected to act on.
Charlene Bushnell, a 42-year-old who does inspections at the plant and expects to lose her job, said she worries about losing her house and being unable to send her younger daughter to college. "Where am I going to go?" she asked. "Where will everyone go? My mother, my brother and my sisters all work for Smith-Corona."
Over at the bowling alley's sprawling bar, Ken Dombrowski, a self-employed boat repairman, said: "I don't believe any politicians. They all just take your money and run."
That skepticism was shared by George VanAltine, 45, who works at the Akzo salt company, who said: "I haven't registered in 15 years. I haven't liked the way things have been going for that long or longer. The two parties just keep fighting each other."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
D'Amato Defends Trade Pact
 Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato yesterday defended the North American Trade Agreement, which his opponent, Attorney General Robert Abrams, said would cause New York State to lose thousands of jobs. The state exports $900 million in goods to Mexico annually, Mr. D'Amato said, and would benefit dramatically from reduced trade barriers.
Responding to Mr. Abrams's contention that Republican policies had left the state in deep recession, Mr. D'Amato said Mr. Abrams's proposals for economic recovery and health care would drive up taxes and the Federal deficit while causing layoffs, particularly in defense industries. "Why do we lose jobs in New York State? Because of Bob Abrams types of policies," Mr. D'Amato said while campaigning at a Columbus Day parade in Morris Park in the Bronx.

HEADLINE: California Sees First Encounter In Senate Race

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 11

 BODY:
Senator John Seymour and his Democratic opponent, Dianne Feinstein, traded personal accusations and disagreed on taxes, immigration policy and military spending cuts on Saturday in the first debate of their Senate campaign.
But Mr. Seymour, the appointed Republican incumbent, and Ms. Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco and former candidate for Governor, did have points of accord: they agreed on cutting Federal spending across the board, specifically for Congress, and agreed that job creation and the economy were their top priorities. 
 Mr. Seymour, a former State Senator who was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson 20 months ago to serve the remainder of his Senate term, has been trailing Ms. Feinstein in the polls. Analysts say his problems stem in part from the unpopularity of President Bush and Governor Wilson in the state.
Mr. Seymour made the most pointed personal attack of the 60-minute debate, broadcast on television and radio stations around the state, saying Ms. Feinstein voted to release 22 murderers from state prison while serving from 1962 to 1966 on the California Board of Women's Terms and Parole.
 
'Issue of Character'
 Ms. Feinstein did not respond directly during the debate, but later said that parole rules were different then under an indeterminate sentence law and that "I was regarded as one of the tougher members of that board."
During the debate, Mr. Seymour also said a lawsuit against Ms. Feinstein by the Fair Political Practices Commission, contending that she failed to follow the rules in disclosing the source of $8.3 million in loans and contributions to her 1990 campaign for Governor, "is an issue of character, is an issue of integrity." Ms. Feinstein dismissed the issue as "mistakes of a bookkeeping and clerical nature," and responded that Mr. Seymour's private real estate and development companies had been sued 22 times by dissatisfied business associates or customers.
On taxes, Mr. Seymour made a no-new-taxes pledge, while Ms. Feinstein repeated that she would "not support tax increases in the below-$200,000-wage-earning range." But she said she would support raising taxes on the wealthy because "the very rich got a huge tax break in the 1980's."
On military spending, Mr. Seymour again endorsed a $50 billion cut over five years, while Ms. Feinstein called for a $135 billion cut. And on immigration policy, Mr. Seymour called for hiring 1,500 additional Border Patrol officers, while Mr. Feinstein proposed using Army personnel returned from Europe and Asia "as an adjunct to the Border Patrol."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Some Leading Clients Favor A Shift In Selling Strategies

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va.

 BODY:
SOME of America's largest, most influential advertisers are shifting their marketing strategies, the departing chairman of the Association of National Advertisers says, as they return to advertising intended to bolster brand images over the long term and forsake price-cutting and other promotions meant to generate short-term gains.
"We're beginning to see some people move in that direction," L. Ross Love said in an interview before the start here of the group's 83d annual meeting and business conference. "It's not a mass movement yet, but we're seeing a turn." 
 Mr. Love, who is also the vice president of advertising at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, might be accused of bias, since it was P.& G. that set the wheels turning with a decision last November to cut back on promotion spending on some of its packaged goods. But since then other consumer-product giants have followed suit, including Colgate-Palmolive, Kraft General Foods, Chesebrough-Ponds and Kimberly-Clark.
"The A.N.A., along with a lot of people in the industry, is pushing hard on this issue of investing in advertising," Mr. Love said. "I see many companies asking the question, 'What do we need to do to build the value of our brands?' The answers are, better products and better advertising. That has changed from 10 years ago, when the answer was to spend some more on promotion."
The conference, which carries the theme "The New World of Advertising" -- no doubt because it runs through the Columbus Day weekend -- began yesterday at the Homestead and will continue through tomorrow.
It is, of course, not the only conference that in recent years has pondered this prickly issue of advertising versus promotion. The subject has dominated meetings of advertisers, agencies and media as the economy continues to meander between recession and sluggish recovery.
The reason is that in hard times, companies like the association's members, which account for almost 80 percent of regional and national ad spending, fervently believe they must sell their products fast, fast, fast. The future, they reluctantly conclude, must take care of itself -- an attitude that, their advertising agencies are eager to assert, only serves to erode what those products mean to consumers.
The speakers at the conference include Solomon Dutka, chief executive at Audits & Surveys Inc., a New York market research company. During his presentation tomorrow, Mr. Dutka is expected to describe methods for evaluating the effectiveness of advertising, which, he contends, often gets too much credit when sales soar and too much blame when sales sour.
Mr. Love, who is completing his term as the association's 1991-92 chairman, said promotions centering on price cuts were particularly pernicious.
"If you go to the store and find that the product you want does not happen to be on sale," he said, "and you pay the full shelf price, you feel cheated.
"That's not good; that doesn't build brand loyalty. Better to let all your customers have a fair price, not just those who happen to be there when you have deep-cut sales."
This marketing strategy is known as everyday low pricing.
Mr. Love's successor as chairman is scheduled to be elected today. Harry E. Davis, director of communications in the external affairs department at E.I. duPont de Nemours & Company in Wilmington, Del., is expected to become the 1992-93 chairman; he has served as vice chairman for the last year.
Richard A. Garvey, vice president of marketing at Lego Systems Inc. in Enfield, Conn., is likely to be elected to succeed Mr. Davis and be named 1992-93 vice chairman.
The conference is expected to draw around 525 people, an association spokeswoman said. About 450 attended last year and about 430 in 1990. It was unclear whether travel plans would be disrupted by the strike at USAir, which serves the Hot Springs area; the carrier planned to resume a full schedule by today.

HEADLINE: New York a Hard Town for High-Tech

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Willow Peripherals, a small high-technology company, is in many ways a typical Silicon Valley start-up. But the view from its windows is not of sleek glass buildings on landscaped grounds, but of bars and razor wire.
Willow, founded by a group of young New Yorkers, sits under the shadow of the Bruckner Expressway and the Triborough Bridge in the South Bronx. When the intrepid entrepreneurs set up there in 1986, the lure of the South Bronx was dirt-cheap rent, $3 a square foot. 
 After struggling early on, Willow seems to be on the verge of success, with revenues expected to reach $4 million this year and a work force of 25 people. Today, it has growing pains that cheap rent does not cure.
"Ideally, we would be located in Silicon Valley or someplace like that," said Valerie Gardner, Willow's chief financial officer. "The expertise, the conferences and the engineering community in our field are elsewhere."
The company's struggle to recruit engineers and software designers says a lot about why there are not more such high-technology companies in the city and why so many New Yorkers trained in the computer sciences have moved elsewhere. While other cities set about in the 1970's and 1980's to establish environments that would nurture high-tech start-ups, New York seems to have missed the opportunity.
"I don't think we can become a big company here, because there aren't a lot of resources to draw on in New York for computer firms," said Hank Williams, the 27-year-old president of the Pastel Development Corporation, a company in the SoHo district of Manhattan that makes Daymaker software, a sort of computerized Filofax organizer. "It's shocking to me how many talented people in the field flood out of New York City."
 
'Even Salesmen Refuse to Come'
 Willow's founders insist that the image of the South Bronx as a caldron of inner-city crime and chaos is mostly an outdated stereotype. But they acknowledge that the company's South Bronx address is a liability in recruiting the engineers that it needs. Many lose interest at the first mention of the South Bronx. Others make an appointment for an interview, take directions, and never show up.
"Sometimes, even salesmen refuse to come," said William Bares, the chief designer at Willow, which markets specialized computer products that convert the electronic impulses that generate computer images into signals that can be displayed on a television screen or stored on videotape.
Mark Seiden, a 42-year-old computer programmer, is typical of the high-technology experts who have left New York. A graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, Mr. Seiden lived in the city for 30 years, but reverse commuted to jobs at I.B.M. in Westchester County and elsewhere. "There were no computer jobs in New York," he said.
Now a roving high-technology contractor, Mr. Seiden lives in San Francisco and maintains a residence in Connecticut. He still travels to New York on jobs but does much of the work from the other side of the country, using computers, telephones and electronic mail. "I'm a telecommuter now," he explained.
 
'Missed the Boat'
 Thousands of software programmers and computer engineers work in New York. But they tend to be employed in the computer departments of big companies or by satellite companies that service the bigger companies in the region. Far fewer work for independent, merchant companies like Willow or Pastel.
And it is clusters of such independent little companies that have generated the job growth and economic vitality in the traditional high-technology hubs like Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, and along Route 128 outside Boston, and in more recent successes like Research Park Triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina.
"New York really missed the boat in high technology and advanced manufacturing," Samuel Ehrenhalt, Commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the New York region, said.
During the 1980's, with the city's economy buoyed by the boom in financial services and real estate, there seemed to be little need for strategic thinking in other sectors.
And the urban redevelopment work in areas like the South Bronx focused on providing work in distribution, crafts and moderately skilled manufacturing jobs, according to John Patterson Jr., president of the South Bronx Overall Development Corporation, a private development agency. The approach has been successful in bringing in and retaining many businesses, creating an estimated 20,000 jobs in the last two decades.
But the traditional approach to economic development, rooted in a "bricks-and-mortar" mentality, provides assistance mainly for acquiring conventional assets like large factories or heavy equipment, experts say. That approach tends to short-change high-technology companies that would be helped most by government-backed grants for research, product development or marketing.
 
Costly for the City
 The neglect of high-tech development has been costly for New York. For example, employment in electrical, electronic equipment and instruments -- a catchall category that would include companies like Willow -- has declined in New York to 19,000 in 1992 from 42,000 in 1979, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
On its own, after a series of setbacks, Willow seems to be defying the odds. It began in the field of computer-to-video conversion by selling mainly to the professional market, like the television networks that need to convert computer information quickly to video for displaying images for weather maps or news maps. The special-effects houses serving Hollywood have also used Willow's products for work in movies like "Universal Soldier" and "Sneakers."
Recently, the company has moved to the more general business and institutional market by introducing a laptop converter that allows everyone from insurance salesmen to teachers to shift images from laptop computers onto television screens.
Willow's ambitious plans for the future depend on moving into the consumer market, linking computers and television, with products that are cheaper and smaller, perhaps even paring its converters down to a cluster of silicon chips that would fit on the boards of laptop and notebook computer makers.
 
Resolving the Location Issue
 Company executives say they are talking with a couple of major computer manufacturers -- they will not name them -- about some form of partnership to supply them directly with converters.
"If that strategy works, we could have a real winner here," said Len Vignola, a venture-capital veteran who began serving as Willow's chief executive this year.
To grow, Willow must be able to attract "the high-grade engineers that are the lifeblood of a company like this," Mr. Vignola said.
So sooner or later, the location issue must be addressed by Willow's five young executives who own 70 percent of the company -- Mr. Bares, Ms. Gardner, Jonathan Vall, Howard Alexander and Calvin Berger.
"We came here for economic reasons, because the costs are low," said Mr. Vall, the president. "Will we stay here? I don't know."

HEADLINE: Review/Opera;
Triumph and Tragedy In 'Christophe Colomb'

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Events of the historical magnitude of Columbus's voyage across the Atlantic often inspire flights of the imagination that offer a perspective and perhaps a kind of truth that scholarship cannot approach. It may be, too, that an insightful work of art can retain its currency longer than a scholarly study, if only because by nature it presents symbols rather than specifics.
This year's quincentenary has yielded comparatively few new works in honor of Columbus's arrival: two films and Philip Glass's "Voyage," a meditation on discovery that opens tonight at the Metropolitan Opera. But there is also a related backlist, and on Saturday evening at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, the Brooklyn College Opera Theater gave the belated New York stage premiere of Darius Milhaud's grandly scaled 1928 opera "Christophe Colomb." 
 A collaboration with the poet Paul Claudel, this unusual specimen moves back and forth through time, looking at and around Columbus in 17 scenes. Triumph and tragedy are interlaced: When, in the final scene, we see Columbus standing in a shaft of golden light and basking in a Te Deum, his flag planted before a group of awed natives, we know the extent to which this moment of personal glory contrasts with an embattled past and future. And Claudel's text -- sung here in an English translation by Arnold Perry -- reminds us of the disastrous consequences Columbus's arrival had for the Americas' inhabitants.
Milhaud's compelling, vital score makes luxurious use of a large chorus and exploits the orchestra's full range of color. Even moments of introspection seem to have an inexorable forward thrust, and when there is action or conflict, the music is propelled by a combination of driving energy and an inventive use of texture and idiom that keeps the listener wondering where the music will lead.
The destinations are often surprising: stretches of polytonality and pointed dissonance sitting comfortably beside passages harmonized with a heavenly sweetness; brassy allusions to Spanish music, celebrating Columbus's departure from Cadiz, give way to a complex, multi-layered percussion and choral section that portrays the Aztec gods, who try to fend off Columbus's arrival.
There are few arias as such. Isabella and Columbus have extended dramatic soliloquies; peripheral characters -- of which there are more than 40 -- have their say mostly in ensembles.
The production was economical and inventive. John Scheffler's set was a raked disk (part compass, part navigational map) flanked by two rough-hewn wooden jury boxes for the chorus and raised pulpits for a priestly narrator and Columbus's conscience. Mr. Scheffler's costumes took perhaps too broad a cue from the work's temporal rootlessness: 19th-century military tunics, modern tuxedos and even a bit of leather were seen alongside 15th-century dress.
Edward Berkeley's stage direction, sometimes sensibly straightforward, sometimes quirkily Expressionistic, had its virtues, although the student cast had problems with some of its more abstract elements. At its best it presented the story as a series of tightly choreographed dream sequences. There were several standouts in the huge cast. David Parsons, a strong baritone, was fully at ease with both the tense and the lyrical elements in Milhaud's music, and made Columbus's pained discontentedness palpable. Louisa Jonason's powerful, attractive soprano was well suited to Isabella, and she gave a wonderful account of the queen's prayer after the reconquest of Granada.
Jerald Hughes put a bright, firm tenor to good use in a handful of the smaller roles, and there were also worthy contributions by Robert Hancock, Atanas Zaprianov, Steven Kleitz and Lynne Hayden-Findlay. David Foil was the narrator.
Richard Barrett conducted. There were moments when the chorus and orchestra were not fully aligned -- an inevitable pitfall in a work this complex -- and there were times when the orchestra overpowered the stage. But for the most part Mr. Barrett drew a performance of extraordinary fluency and vigor from his student forces.
