HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY BILL FOR HEALTH CARE SIGNED BY FLORIO

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Six months after a Federal judge outlawed New Jersey's system of paying for hospital care for the poor, Gov. Jim Florio today signed into law a plan to pay for the care by diverting $1.6 billion in unemployment insurance money.
Critics of the plan, who include hospital officials, business groups and labor unions, say it will not restore the state's health-care system, but merely delay its possible collapse until after the 1993 gubernatorial and legislative elections. 
 The legislation, known as the Health Care Reform Act of 1992, passed this afternoon in the Republican-controlled Assembly, 48 to 23. For a while it seemed that the complicated legislation would unravel after six Senate Republicans withheld their votes tonight, leaving it one vote short of passage. But after a two-hour recess, Senator John J. Matheussen, a Republican who had voted against the measure, changed his vote, and the bill passed the chamber, 21-17. Governor Florio signed the bill shortly after 11 P.M.
While the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, described the legislation as "a pilot program for a national health plan," opponents attacked it as flawed in many ways.
 
Displeasure in the Galleries
 Union leaders say it will imperil the soundness of the benefits system for the jobless at a time when New Jersey's unemployment rate, at 8 percent, is among the highest in the nation.
Business leaders say a provision for a new levy on payrolls, meant to protect the unemployment fund if it drops below a certain level, amounts to a "back-door tax." And urban hospitals, which have more poor and uninsured patients than suburban hospitals, say they will be penalized, and many of them forced out of business, by a provision to deregulate how hospital rates are set beginning in 1994.
That fear brought Sister Jane Frances of the Order of Sisters of Charity, the president and chief executive officer of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, to Trenton with several busloads of hospital workers to protest the legislation.
They sat in the galleries and whistled, cheered and applauded at length when the Democratic minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, who led the unsuccessful opposition to the bill in the Assembly, warned that it could push large teaching hospitals to the brink of bankruptcy.
Mr. Haytaian, the leader of the overwhelming Republican majority that was instrumental in writing the revisions with the grudging acquiescence of Governor Florio and his chief advisers, gaveled the tumult to silence and warned, "That will be the last outburst -- otherwise we will clear the gallery."
To finance uncompensated hospital care, other states have decided to tax hospitals, those who provide health care, or have instituted so-called sin taxes on products like cigarettes. Other states' efforts to solve their health-care problems have been slowed or derailed by the recession, most notably in the case of Massachusetts, which had to scale back a law entitling all residents to health insurance by April of this year.
Almost all the opponents of the New Jersey law say that politics, not sound policy considerations, drove decisions to put into place important sections of the legislation in 1994 -- after the 1993 gubernatorial and legislative elections.
But the most controversial part of the plan is a provision to pay for health care with $1.6 billion diverted from unemployment taxes paid by employers and employees. The law will funnel $600 million to health care in 1993 and $500 million in each of the following two years.
The program would be eliminated after three years. By that time, supporters of the plan say, most of the indigent patients will be cared for under state-subsidized or low-cost private health insurance or by hospitals absorbing more of their bad debt.
With the gubernatorial election less than a year away, the proposal to divert unemployment taxes was the least onerous idea politically for both Mr. Florio and the Republican legislative leaders, the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and Mr. Haytaian.
With a reserve of $2.4 billion, New Jersey's unemployment trust fund is second only to California's. The state collects $1.2 billion a year in contributions from employers and employees, but because of the high unemployment rate will pay out $1.4 billion this year, state officials said. Labor groups, led by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the health-care plan could weaken the fund.
The State Chamber of Commerce also threw the weight of its considerable lobbying powers against the plan.
"This legislation is a back-door payroll tax," the Chamber said in a letter to legislators before the start of debate today.
Another section of the new law will create New Jersey Shield, a state-subsidized health insurance program for low- and moderate-income residents. The state will appropriate $500 million for the first four years of the program, beginning in 1994, and $200 million a year afterward. The law will also require that all insurance companies doing business in New Jersey offer health insurance to anyone without regard to age, gender, health or geographic location.
Even though the proposal had been promoted as a bipartisan effort, all Democrats in both chambers voted against the measure.
Mr. Florio, a Democrat, and the Republican-controlled Legislature were working to pass the plan under a self-imposed deadline that expired at midnight today along with the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund, the state's old system of paying for hospital care for indigent patients.
They were forced into action in May when Judge Alfred M. Wolin of the Federal District Court in Newark struck down part of the plan under which New Jersey had paid about $750 million annually to cover hospital expenses for 823,000 uninsured and indigent patients.
The state had paid for the plan, known as the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund, by including a 19.1 percent surcharge on the hospital bills of all insured patients, except for the 40 percent who are covered by Medicare.
Judge Wolin had given the Legislature and the Governor until the end of June to work out a new plan. But New Jersey officials bought extra time to work out a solution by appealing to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The appeals court has yet to rule in the case.

HEADLINE: New Jersey and New York Collide In New Competition to Lure Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Open economic warfare broke out between New York and New Jersey today after Gov. Jim Florio announced a statewide program under which New Jersey would take partial ownership of commercial buildings in exchange for helping to pay for outfitting the buildings and moving tenants into them.
Vincent Tese, New York State's director of economic development, said New York would retaliate by starting, within two weeks, a marketing program aimed specifically at persuading New Jersey companies to move across the Hudson. He had previously threatened to begin such a program in response to New Jersey's growing aggressiveness in wooing New York businesses. 
 "We will be targeting New Jersey firms that for whatever reason are looking to change locations either within or outside their borders," he said. "Then New Jersey will wind up spending money keeping firms they've got, and it's not going to be a pleasant situation for them."
Mr. Tese's remarks, in an interview, also suggested that the clash could jeopardize some workings of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. An agency of the two states, the authority operates the ports, the World Trade Center, the three major airports in metropolitan New York and tunnels and bridges between the states.
New York's marketing campaign would represent the final collapse of a so-called nonaggression pact signed in October 1991 by New York State, New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut. In the pact, the four governments agreed not to engage in negative advertising about each other in trying to woo companies. The four also vowed to avoid development programs designed exclusively to lure companies from the others.
Officials of the three states and New York City hoped at the time that the pact would serve as the first step toward broader cooperation in regional economic development. But severe job losses suffered by the states have caused them to increase financial incentives to keep companies or persuade them to relocate in their respective areas.
Reacting to Mr. Tese's plans to go after New Jersey companies, Barbara W. McConnell, New Jersey's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, said, "It sounds like sour grapes to me. He is the one who is going to strike the first blow in terms of negative advertising and soliciting New Jersey companies. We're not targeting New York companies as Mr. Tese said."
Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of New Jersey's Economic Development Authority, said the real estate program Governor Florio announced today could involve expenditures of as much as $50 million during the next year. That would be in addition to some $6.6 million New Jersey has agreed to invest in Newport Tower, a new, 36-story office building here that had been without tenants.
 
A Cable Network Moves
 In September, New Jersey agreed to pay $6 million to help a subsidary of the First Chicago Corporation move most of its operations, which employ 1,000, from lower Manhattan to 240,000 square feet in Newport Tower. In return, the state will get a stake of as much as 8 percent in the building, which is owned by The Limited Inc., a retailer based in Columbus, Ohio.
At a news conference today at Newport Tower, New Jersey officials said the state would invest an additional $600,000 in the building and would receive an additional 1 to 2 percent stake. The latest investment is to help prepare 47,000 square feet for USA Networks, a cable television company.
USA Networks is moving its post-production division and the operations of its two cable TV channels -- the general entertainment USA Network and its new Sci-Fi Channel -- from Manhattan and Hauppauge, L.I. About 10 jobs will be transferred to Jersey City from each location. Company officials said they then intend to hire about 80 more people.
The company's headquarters, which employs about 250, will remain at 1230 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan, said Stephen A. Brenner, a senior vice president.
New Jersey's real-estate-investment program will be financed by the state's new $224 million Economic Recovery Fund. State officials insist that the fund's main purposes are to provide badly needed capital for small and medium-size companies already in New Jersey and for construction projects like a performing arts center in Newark and the expansion of the Atlantic City airport.
 
Using Port Authority Money
 But New York officials have been outraged by New Jersey's use of the Economic Recovery Fund to attract New York companies. What is especially galling is the source of the fund's money: bonds that essentially will be repaid by New Jersey's share of rental income from 2.1 million square feet in the World Trade Center.
New York State agencies had vacated the space, and it was re-leased at higher prices. Under a 1990 arrangement, the Port Authority is to pay each state a total of $597.6 million by March 2021. New York's share, about $14 million this year, is going into the state's General Fund.
"The whole idea of the Port Authority is to build regional strength," Mr. Tese said. "Moving firms from one side of the river to the other is hardly building regional strength. We think that's a misuse of Port Authority money."
Ms. McConnell retorted, "New York is getting the same amount of dollars and could have created the same kind of program that we did." New Jersey officials insist their main aim is to prevent companies in the tristate region from moving elsewhere.
Governor Florio denied that New Jersey has violated the nonaggression pact. "There's room for legitimate competition," he told reporters. Is the fund being used to steal jobs from New York? "Obviously, I wouldn't characterize it that way," he said.
His statement announcing the program nonetheless made it sound that way. "Our Real Estate Partnership Program pools every proven real estate development strategy in the Economic Development Authority's arsenal in an all-out effort to attract corporate, technical and support services to our side of the Hudson River," the statement said.
Several other states, including New York and Connecticut, have venture capital groups that take ownership positions in mainly start-up, high-technology companies.

FERNANDEZ FACES BOARD'S DEFIANCE 
In defiance of the city's Schools Chancellor, the members of a school board in Queens boycotted a meeting intended to resolve the bitter dispute over a curriculum that teaches first graders to accept gay people. The refusal frees the Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, to take action against the board of District 24. He could chose to supercede the board and impose the curriculum in the district's schools, or to suspend its members outright. Mr. Fernandez said he would make his decision today. B3.

The measure, which has the support of Mayor Dinkins and the Council leadership, is expected to win approval from the full Council in a vote scheduled for Dec. 17. B3.
 
PROVIDING AN ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON
Gilbert Acevedo, a former New York City police officer and addict who was thrown off the force, is on the front lines of an idea that criminal justice experts say is increasingly important in a national penal system in which 7 of 10 prisoners have abused drugs and in a state like New York where half of all new prisoners are convicted of drug offenses. He is a counselor in a program that offers first-time offenders a trade: instead of prison, a residential drug-treatment center for free through Phoenix House, the national drug-rehabilitation organization.

HEADLINE: 1,475 Laid Off Under Pratt's Plan for Cuts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 30

 BODY:
Pratt & Whitney laid off 1,475 employees today under a previously announced plan to cut 4,800 jobs before July, company officials said.
Pratt, the aircraft engine division of the United Technologies Corporation, must eliminate the jobs because the continuing slump in the aviation industry has led to a sharp drop in orders for engines and spare parts, said a spokeswoman, Peggy Ford. 
 "We have to resize our company for the smaller market," she added.
Pratt notified 840 hourly workers in East Hartford, 250 in Middletown, 235 in North Haven and 150 in Southington that they would be laid off on Jan. 31, Ms. Ford said. They will be paid until then, but will not be required to return to work after the Christmas holiday.
The company has not decided where the next round of layoffs will come, but no announcement will be made until after Jan. 1, she said.
About 80 workers demonstrated outside the company's East Hartford plant this afternoon to protest the layoffs. Some said they thought the company was planning to shut down the East Hartford plant by 1995 and leave only a repair shop. The company denied that.
Pratt announced in January that it would eliminate 5,000 jobs by 1995. But in October, the company said it had to cut 4,800 jobs before next July because of the continuing slump and increase the total number of planned layoffs to 7,200.
There have been two rounds of layoffs since then. At the end of October, the company employed 20,900 workers in Connecticut and 40,800 worldwide.

HEADLINE: Widened Trade Deficit Posted for 3d Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The nation's merchandise trade deficit widened sharply in the third quarter, to $26.54 billion, even though exports climbed to a record level, the Government said today.
The deterioration points to what many economists say could be a big threat to a sustained United States recovery. The growth in American exports, one of the few bright spots of the last three years, is faltering at the same time that Americans' demand for foreign goods is picking up. 
 In today's report, the Commerce Department said that the deficit in the July-to-September period was 8.1 percent higher than a $24.56 billion deficit in the April-June quarter. It said the deficit was also 42.6 percent higher than the $17.22 billion deficit in the first three months of the year.
 
 
Largest Since '90
 The deficit was the largest since a $27.8 billion imbalance in the fourth quarter of 1990.
The quarterly report, which measured merchandise trade on a balance-of-payments basis, underscores a trend already evident in the monthly merchandise trade numbers. The quarterly report makes several minor alterations from the monthly numbers, for example, excluding Government military sales and gold shipments.
In the July-September quarter, exports did climb by 3.1 percent, to an all-time high of $110.81 billion. But the increase followed a decline of four-tenths of a percent in the April-June quarter. For most of this year, exports have been essentially flat as demand has waned in Europe and other important American markets because of spreading economic weakness overseas.
Imports rose 4 percent in the third quarter, also posting an all-time high of $137.35 billion.
 
 
Lower Aircraft Sales
 On the export side, sales of manufactured goods and other nonfarm items accounted for two-thirds of the increase, although farm sales were also up during the period. Strong increases in foreign demand for computer products and telephone equipment were offset somewhat by a sharp decline in sales of civilian aircraft.
Nearly all of the increase in imports was in consumer goods, which have risen strongly for five consecutive quarters. By region, the biggest surge in imports came from China and newly industrialized countries in East Asia.
Petroleum imports increased $1.3 billion, or 10 percent, to $14.2 billion in the third quarter. Both prices and the volume of shipments were up.

HEADLINE: U.S. Taxes Steel From 12 Nations

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
American steelmakers won the first round today in their struggle for tougher protection from imports, as the Commerce Department imposed temporary import taxes on steel from 12 countries.
The action came as the department determined that France, Italy, Germany, South Korea and eight other countries had given their domestic steel producers a range of special loans and other financial deals that provided them an unfair advantage in the United States steel market. 
 The decision on new import taxes is subject to extensive review by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission before the duties become permanent. But the action may signal the direction of a more commercially important decision, to be released on Jan. 27.
 
 
Ruling Due on Dumping
 The department will rule then on whether 20 countries are selling steel at unfairly low prices in the United States, a practice known as dumping. The nation's two largest foreign suppliers of steel, Japan and Canada, were never accused of unfair subsidies by American steelmakers, but they have been accused of dumping.
Today's announcement is also likely to inflame United States-European relations further. Six of the 12 countries cited today -- Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain -- are members of the European Community, whose Washington office issued a blistering statement.
"The U.S. Government is using legitimate trade policy instruments, but they're being exploited to harass foreign competition and divert world trade flows, blaming imports for what are primarily domestic problems of the American steel industry," the community said.
 
 
New Blow to French
 France, Italy and Spain are likely to be particularly angered. They were singled out for especially steep duties by the Commerce Department, and their farmers are also among the angriest about an agreement between the United States and the community 10 days ago to limit farm subsidies.
 The French Embassy had no immediate comment today. But Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's Minister of Industry and Foreign Commerce, forecast the French reaction in a speech in September, when he called for the European Community to take unspecified measures in retaliation for any American duties.
The 12 nations punished were the six European Community countries plus Austria, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea and Sweden.
The temporary import duties ranged from just 64-hundredths of a percent of the wholesale price of carbon steel plate from Thyssen Stahl, Germany's biggest steelmaker, to 90.09 percent for corrosion-resistant carbon steel from Hojalata y Lamina S.A. de C.V. of Mexico. The overall level of the duties was in line with the expectations of industry experts, including very low duties on shipments from South Korea and Germany.
Before becoming permanent, the duties must be reviewed and confirmed by the Commerce Department next spring, and American steel producers must convince the International Trade Commission that imports are a significant cause of their financial problems.
Pierre F. de Ravel d'Escalapon, a lawyer at LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae in New York, who is representing several large European steelmakers in the case, said he thought the temporary duties would be reduced later, as has happened in many previous cases.
"I am confident that the rates will change in the final determination because in the final, Commerce has the obligation to say exactly what it does and give reasons," he said.
 The duties are retroactive to midnight last Friday. Importers are allowed to post bonds for the temporary duties. They would lose the bonds if the duties are confirmed in the final determination next spring and they would get all or part of the bonds back if the duties are canceled or reduced.
Congress has written a complicated system of trade laws that sometimes defies economic logic and makes it easy for the Commerce Department to rule in favor of industries seeking protection from imports that are subsidized or dumped.
Steel imports were limited until March 31 by a nine-year-old system of informal quotas. The Bush Administration allowed this to expire because the system violated free-trade rules and the domestic steel industry decided that duties might offer more protection than the quotas, which have become less effective as American producers have won back market share in many types of steel.
A temporary duty of 20 percent or more is typically necessary to make a country's steel shipments uncompetitive in the American market. The Commerce Department imposed such steep duties on one or more foreign steelmakers in 17 of the 30 legal complaints about subsidies that American steelmakers filed last summer.

HEADLINE: They Will Gladly Take a Check

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Victoria Keyes, a nurse at Children's Hospital here, pays a check-cashing store roughly $13 every two weeks to cash her paycheck of about $500.
A bank would charge far less, but there is not one within walking distance of her house in the poor Washington neighborhood of Anacostia. Miss Keyes, who makes $24,000 a year, closed her last checking account because her bank started requiring minimum monthly balances in lieu of service fees -- neither of which she could afford, she said.
 
Turning Away From Banks
 Miss Keyes knows by experience what consumer groups have come to conclude: the deregulation of financial services in the 1980's has made banking services unavailable or beyond the financial reach of many low-income people. Many have turned instead to cash-checking outlets that consumer-rights groups and state regulators accuse of widespread price gouging. 
 Faced with stiffer competition after deregulation in the early 1980's, banks raised fees and imposed minimum balances to offset the higher interest rates they were then paying depositors. Many of them closed unprofitable branches, which were often in low-income neighborhoods.
Security Pacific, for instance, closed 21 branches in Los Angeles between 1980 and 1989, 71 percent in low- and moderate-income communities, where household incomes are below $35,000, according to a study by Communities for Accountable Reinvestment, a Los Angeles-based coalition that monitors banking practices in low-income areas.
Check-cashing outlets, which do not take deposits but charge fees for cashing checks and issuing money orders, have multiplied to fill the void. "In four years," said John P. Caskey, an economist at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, "the industry appears to have doubled."
More precisely, there are an estimated 5,000 check cashers nationwide today, up from 3,000 in 1988, according to the National Check Cashers Association, a trade organization. Although some of the shops rely on word of mouth in the neighborhoods where they operate, an estimated 4,000 of the outlets formally advertise their services.
 
Fees Are the Issue
 A study by Mr. Caskey for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., estimated that the industry in 1990 cashed 150 million checks worth $45 billion, mainly for people making between $18,000 and $25,000 a year. The check cashers took in $790 million in fees on those services.
The fees are the point of contention. Largely unregulated, check cashers, commonly known as "welfare banks" because of the large number of public assistance checks they process, charge more than banks. A 1990 study by the Consumer Federation of America showed that most charged from 1 to 3 percent of the value of a check to cash it. But some services, the study found, charged as much as 20 percent -- or $20 for a $100 check.
 
Weighing the Options
 Although banks have had to raise certain fees, according to the American Bankers Association, about 70 percent still charge no more than $3 a month on basic accounts.
"Consumer groups don't view these outlets as good options for low-income consumers because of the gouging that occurs," said Michele Meier of Consumers Union.
But many people prefer doing business at these outlets because banks would require them to have money in a checking account to cover the amount of a check -- money that fewer people have, as the number of families living below the poverty line has risen about 46 percent since 1978, to 35.7 million in 1991.
Several consumer groups, including Consumer Action and the Consumer Federation of America, are pushing for Federal legislation that would require banks to cash the checks of people who do not have accounts, offer more basic low-fee bank accounts and cash government checks free or for a very small fee, so that many more people could be brought back into the banking system. Several states are also considering such requirements, though only Connecticut has a law requiring banks to cash government or payroll checks.
Community groups and lawmakers also are agitating to strengthen and better enforce the Community Reinvestment Act, the 1979 law that requires banks to serve all communities equitably.
 
Regulatory Efforts
 Bills to regulate check cashers are pending in several states. "There needs to be much tighter regulation of check-cashing facilities," said Ken McEldowney, president of Consumer Action in California, a member of the Consumer Federation of America. California passed a law in September placing a 3.5 percent ceiling on check cashers' fees.
Seven other states have ceilings on check-cashing fees, but even some of the lowest -- 1.1 percent in New York, for example -- do not make using check cashers economical, consumer groups say.
"In New York, check cashers cost consumers two to three times more than banks, which is not fun for low-income consumers," said Mark Green, the New York City Consumer Affairs Commissioner. Mr. Green's department is preparing the third installment of a report on the state's check-cashing industry called The Poor Pay More.
States with regulations often have a hard time enforcing them. A study by New Jersey showed that although the state's ceiling on fees was 1 percent on in-state checks, one woman who did not speak English was charged $25 to cash a $268 Social Security check -- a fee of about 9.4 percent.
 
Improving an Image
 Members of the industry argue that they provide a necessary service in many communities, and they resent stereotypes of bullet-riddled storefronts owned by shady characters who feed off the poor.
"We think that's an image that needs to change," said Ray Hemmig, owner of ACE America's Cash Express in Irving, Tex., which has 240 stores nationwide. "We tend to be much more like a bank lobby, more upscale and more located in the suburbs."
The industry has indeed started to evolve. Though most outlets are still individually owned and operated, national chains like ACE are cropping up, with many of them now moving into the suburbs. ACE, for instance, says 70 percent of its customers have bank accounts -- an indication, it says, that convenience, not cost, is the main consideration for its clients. The fact that most of these outlets have longer hours than banks is another draw.
The range of services has also broadened. First appearing in the Depression because of banking problems and the phasing out of cash paydays by employers, the businesses specialized in cashing checks. Now, many also sell postage stamps, money orders and lottery tickets, and allow customers to wire money through Western Union or other types of electronic money transfers. Many will give cash-advance loans on individual income tax refunds. Some even dispense food stamps, under contract to the state.
 
The Fees Add Up
 In Victoria Keyes's Washington neighborhood of Anacostia, there are only two bank branches. An alternative is Capitol Check Cashing, in a strip mall on Alabama Avenue. It is owned by Peter Smilovsky, who has three other shops in Washington.
Until a few weeks ago, Janice Gore was one of Capitol's regular customers. Ms. Gore, a 39-year-old grandmother who receives welfare payments, recently arranged to cash her checks at a neighborhood liquor store where a friend works.
For the previous six years, however, she paid Capitol a fee of 2.8 percent, handing over $12 from each of her monthly $437 Supplemental Security Income checks and about $11 of her $409 Aid to Families With Dependent Children check. She then paid an additional 59 cents for each money order to pay her rent or phone bill.
"It was too expensive, but I had no other choice," Ms. Gore said, explaining why she went to Capitol for so long. "You're living from month to month, and a lot of people -- the banks -- won't take my checks."
 
A Check Casher's Defense
 Peter Smilovsky says that his is not a gouging operation. He says he makes only a small profit and he has rent, insurance and security to pay for.
"No one is forcing these people to come in here," he said. "The fees are posted; we don't hide it." Mr. Smilovsky adds that if check cashers were closed down, people like Ms. Gore would have nowhere to go.
The study under way by the New York City Consumer Affairs Department has found that 30 percent of bank branches in the poorest fifth of neighborhoods in Brooklyn, grouped by ZIP code, were shut down between 1978 and 1990. In the Bronx, the figure was 50 percent. In the most affluent areas, only 15 percent of existing branches closed.
Some poor neighborhoods now have more check cashers than banks, Mr. Green said.
But Congressional efforts to require banks to cash Government checks and offer low-cost accounts have been blocked by banking lobbyists, said Nancy Coffey, a spokeswoman for Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio. Mr. Metzenbaum has sponsored many of the measures, the most recent of which, in 1991, was killed after an eight-hour Republican filibuster.
Banks argue, however, that they are simply trying to keep their operating costs from rising and protect themselves from fraud involving welfare checks.
Virginia Stafford of the American Bankers Association said check cashers might always be popular because some people just did not like banks and the record-keeping involved. "We've concluded that there will always be a portion of the public who will never come to banks," she said.

The gain in the Dow outpaced the broader market averages. Still, the Nasdaq composite index and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at record levels. The Nasdaq gained 3.24 points, to 652.73, while the S.& P. 500 rose 1.19 points, to 431.35.
Advancing common stocks outnumbered declining issues, 1,137 to 665, on the Big Board. Shares of computer, electrical equipment, international oil and retail companies were up the most. Trading was robust at 237.6 million shares, compared with 106 million on Friday, when the exchange closed early for the Thanksgiving weekend.
"The Dow seems to be finally catching up with the other market averages," said Edward Collins, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America.
The Dow industrials are about 3.3 percent below their all-time high of 3,413.21, set on June 1.
Among the most active issues, I.B.M. rallied 2 1/4, to 68 1/4, on reports that sales of the company's new personal computers were exceeding expectations. An analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company raised his rating on I.B.M. to "speculative buy."
Texas Utilities, which goes ex-dividend today, gained 1/8, to 42 5/8, as investors sought to capture the next dividend payment.
Blockbuster Entertainment rose 1/2, to 17 1/2. Shamrock Holdings sold 3.13 million Blockbuster shares yesterday for about $53.6 million. Shamrock acquired about 4.14 million Blockbuster shares for the sale of two retail record chains to Blockbuster.
Syntex declined 5/8, to 22 1/8, on continued concerns about sluggish earnings. Analysts reduced earnings estimates after Syntex last week reported a first-quarter loss of $6.1 million.
Comptronix rose 3/8, to 8 3/4, in over-the-counter trading in a rebound from last week, when the stock tumbled as much as 22, to near 6. On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating reports that three senior officers had overstated profits and intentionally misstated financial results.

HEADLINE: China Threatens Contracts Reached by Hong Kong

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 30

 BODY:
China significantly raised the stakes today in its dispute with Britain over Hong Kong by declaring that all contracts signed by the territorial Government and not approved by Beijing will become invalid when London ends its rule there in 1997.
The Hong Kong Government responded immediately that the declaration violated the Chinese-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the Basic Law, the documents that govern the transition period and guarantee economic and political freedoms to the territory for 50 years. 
 "According to the Basic Law, contracts which are valid under Hong Kong's existing laws will continue to be valid and recognized and protected by the Hong Kong special administrative region, provided that they do not contravene the Basic Law," the Hong Kong Government said in a written statement.
It was the first substantial step taken by China to retaliate against British plans to bring greater democracy to Hong Kong, plans that Beijing says violate the agreements it signed with Britain. But China's international standing and credit-worthiness could be reduced if its retaliatory steps are widely construed as violating the agreements.
 
Confusion and Concern
 Even if the announcement does not derail the plans for a peaceful transfer of control over the territory, it is certain to cause confusion and grave concern among a wide variety of local and international companies that do business with the territorial Government. The Hong Kong Government has signed thousands of contracts that could be affected.
"The implications could be very broad," said an American businessman in Hong Kong who refused to be identified. "If you've done business with the Hong Kong Government, which is itself a large contractor, you have to ask yourself: What is the validity of that contract?"
By undermining Hong Kong's authority to issue contracts extending beyond 1997, the Beijing statement seemed particularly intended to prevent Britain from continuing its efforts to build a new airport and a new container port in the territory.
The Hong Kong Government recently announced that it would pursue plans to build a new airport even if China did not give its final approval to the proposed financing arrangements, and the Hong Kong legislature approved an initial allocation of funds last week by a narrow margin.
"It's horrific," Emily Lau, a Hong Kong legislator, said of the Beijing move in a telephone interview. "They're intimidating the Hong Kong people. They're trying to bring Hong Kong to its knees. They will resort to anything."
The Chinese announcement was made after the Hong Kong stock exchange was closed for trading today. The stock market index lost 2.9 percent of its value today in reaction to a far more limited Chinese threat made on Friday -- that it might not honor contracts relating to the new container port.
Today's statement said: "According to the Sino-British joint declaration, Britain's administrative power over Hong Kong will terminate on June 30, 1997, and it will then have no right to handle any affairs after the date. Accordingly, all contracts, leases and agreements signed or ratified by the Hong Kong British government will be valid until June 30, 1997."
The statement added that aside from certain land leases, "other contracts, leases and agreements signed and ratified by the Hong Kong British Government which are not approved by the Chinese side will be invalid after June 30, 1997."
Beijing said it would "take a positive attitude in examining and approving contracts, leases and agreements after June 30, 1997."
Today's announcement reflects the extreme irritation that China feels toward new British proposals to make the territory a bit more democratic, coupled with Britain's increasing willingness to make decisions about Hong Kong without Beijing's approval. Since the new Hong Kong Governor, Christopher Patten, took office in July, Britain has taken a much more confrontational approach in dealing with China.
Mr. Patten proposed in October that election rules be changed to expand the number of people who can vote for legislative seats representing Hong Kong industries. China disagrees with the proposal and is infuriated that it has not been given a veto over the changes.

HEADLINE: U.N. FOLLOWING UP ACCORDS FROM RIO

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 30

 BODY:
After difficult negotiations between industrialized and developing countries, the two sides have agreed on the make-up and the powers of an agency to monitor how governments live up to the promises they made in June in Rio de Janeiro at the first Earth Summit.
Under an informal agreement reached by assembly delegates last Wednesday, a new 53-member group, the Sustainable Development Commission, will regularly scrutinize the environmental records of all nations, hearing evidence from both governments and private groups like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. 
 Though the commission is viewed as a linchpin of the accords reached at the Earth Summit, it will lack the power to make governments respect their pledges to insure that future economic development is environmentally sound. Like the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, on which it is modeled, the Sustainable Development Commission will rely on publicity and international pressure to make countries keep their promises.
The industrial nations will nominate 19 of the 53 members, Africa and Asia 12 each and Latin America 10.
 
Winners and Losers
 The agreement brings the two sides very different benefits and disadvantages.
More-advanced developing countries, including India, Malaysia and Brazil, initially opposed outside scrutiny of their industrial policies. But in the end they agreed because the commission will eventually their financial advantage, diplomats here said.
And a commission that enjoys the confidence of industrial nations could exert political pressure on them to provide the extra aid they promised in Rio to pay for maintaining higher environmental standards in developing lands.
That aid would include cleaner technologies and an expansion of a special World Bank fund called the Global Environmental Facility. There was also a general pledge, from which the United States disassociated itself, to double the annual share of aid, to seven-tenths of 1 percent of the industrial world's economic output.
 
The Main Tasks
 The resolution setting up the commission is to be adopted by the General Assembly next month. It says the commission's main task is to monitor how countries carry out Agenda 21, which is a blueprint for cleaning up the environment and encouraging development in an environmentally sound manner, and a global consensus on forest management. The latter document recommends that countries assess the impact of economic development on their forests and take steps, individually and jointly, to minimize the damage.
Separate Rio conventions to protect plant and animal species and curb global warming have their own procedures for compliance.
The Sustainable Development Commission is to meet twice a year, in New York and in Geneva. Its secretariat will probably be located in Geneva and directed by Nittin Desai of India, who served as deputy to Maurice Strong of Canada, the secretary general of the Earth Summit.

Canadian Drug-Price Shift Said to Cost $3.2 Billion

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
An American pharmaceutical economist said yesterday that repeal of a Canadian prescription drug law would cost Canadians $3.2 billion (United States) in the next 17 years by protecting the prices of 42 drugs.
The products, made by 20 American and European manufacturers, would gain from two months to 13 years of added patent protection under the proposal, staving off competition they would otherwise face from generic copies. 
 The economist, Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, the director of the Prime Institute of pharmaceutical management and economics at the University of Minnesota, developed his projections in advance of testimony scheduled for today at a hearing in Ottawa by a parliamentary committee studying the potential effects of repealing the drug-pricing law.
Repeal of the law is required under provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was initialed in October by officials of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Mr. Schondelmeyer said that Merck & Company, which makes 9 of the 42 products affected by the change, could have additional Canadian sales of $1.04 billion in the next 17 years. He estimated the nine Merck drugs would have total Canadian sales this year of about $201 million.
Mr. Schondelmeyer also said the Janssen unit of Johnson & Johnson and Glaxo Holdings of Britain each had four drugs that would benefit from the proposed changes.
 
Drug Maker Disputes Analysis
 But Michael Tarnow, president of Merck Frosst Canada, a unit of the American company, said Mr. Schondelmeyer's analysis was "totally unrealistic and unprovable."
Mr. Tarnow said many of the 42 products would face generic competition in Canada under the changes proposed by the Canadian Government. He said Merck's heart treatment Vasotec, Canada's largest-selling drug, with sales estimated at $96 million this year, was already up against a Canadian generic version of Capoten, a similar drug made by Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Mr. Schondelmeyer's analysis was commissioned by the Canadian Drug Manufacturers Association, a group of generic drug makers, which could face heavy potential losses if the Canadian law was changed.
Mr. Tarnow of Merck, who was also scheduled to testify at the hearing on behalf of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada, said Mr. Schondelmeyer's numbers relied upon unrealistic assumptions that growth in sales at current drug prices could be maintained in the face of rapidly growing competition.
Mr. Tarnow said that only 16 products, not 42, would be affected by the proposed law. If generic copies became available at prices 25 percent below original brands, he said, the combined added cost to Canadians for all 16 would be $110 million to $125 million over the next five years.
"Once you get past 1997," Mr. Tarnow said, "there is no way of estimating sales, because you can't estimate the impact of competition."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Managers Look to Europe's Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Major institutional fund managers seem to favor European bond markets and the American dollar right now, according to a new quarterly survey by Merrill Lynch. The American bond market, with its uncertain outlook ahead, gets just a neutral nod.
The Merrill Lynch survey shows that a lot of big fund managers still hope to take advantage of the capital gains possible in European bonds as prices rise with the decline in interest rates. Yet, at the same time, they are worried enough about a rising dollar erasing their profits from abroad that they are trying to hedge this risk by loading up on dollars now. 
 Michael Rosenberg, the manager of international bond research at Merrill Lynch, said the survey also indicated that the dollar might be in line for a temporary fall because so many fund managers had bought the dollars they need.
 
Dollar Could Weaken
 This means that as the year draws to a close, the dollar-buying could taper off and the American currency weaken. Mr. Rosenberg noted that in nine of the last 12 years, the dollar has fallen in the last two weeks of the year in the light trading around the holidays and the closing of financial books.
In trading in New York yesterday, the dollar closed at 1.5909 marks to the dollar, down from 1.6005 on Friday.
The bet on rising prices in European bond markets has worked out. Interest rates in Europe have fallen since the September currency crisis, which forced Britain and Italy to withdraw from the European monetary system and finally got the Germans to ease interest rates a little.
But recently, the Germans have been sending out signals that interest rates will not fall further soon. This means that the rally could be stalled for some time.
Yesterday, the president of the German central bank, Helmut Schlesinger, said he understood that his European neighbors wanted interest rates to fall further to help revive their struggling economies. But he said in an interview with the daily paper Frankfurter Allgemeine that "as the situation is now, with monetary growth as strong as it is and still substantial price rises, we cannot comply with such wishes."
 
British Rally Over?
 In Britain, interest rates have already been cut sharply -- from 10 percent in September to 7 percent last month -- so much of that bond market rally there may be over for now.
In bond trading in Europe yesterday, prices were down in Britain, France and Germany by a quarter to a half a point on long-term bonds.
The Merrill Lynch survey, based on reports from 84 fund managers in the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia and Japan, measured how much managers had altered their basic or standard allocations of funds in bond and currency markets around the world. When they were at their standard allocations in particular investments, the survey counted them as being neutral. When they were above their standard allocations, they were considered overweight; when they were below, they were underweight.
On the dollar, 71 percent of the funds are overweight, 9 percent are underweight and 20 percent are neutral. The overweight is up from 50 percent in September, which gives some indication of the buying that has helped lift the dollar more than 14 percent against the German mark and other European currencies since then.
 
Germany Is Favored
 Based on the survey, funds have been cutting back on their exposure to bonds in Britain, Japan, Canada and Australia. But they have been increasing their exposure to bonds in Germany and in European markets with high interest rates that are expected to fall, including Spain and Italy.
In Germany, for example, 43 percent of the funds are overweight, while 27 percent are underweight. But while these funds like the German bond market, they are less happy with the German mark, where 32 percent are overweight while 41 percent are underweight.
Britain is the market that has been rejected on two counts, bonds and currency. Forty-four percent of the funds are underweight British bonds while only 19 percent are overweight. On the pound, only 4 percent are overweight while 74 percent are underweight and 22 percent are neutral.
This is the lowest overweighting of the pound in the four years that Mr. Rosenberg has done the survey and leads him to conclude that the pound may be ready for a little rally because it has been so "oversold."
 
Treasury Market
 The Treasury market was little changed yesterday after a day in which prices of bonds and notes declined early and rebounded in the afternoon.
Recent economic data are indicating that the economy is a little stronger, but investors and traders are still caught in a trading range that awaits some more definitive direction. That might come on Friday, when the Labor Department releases the employment report for November.
In late trading, the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was offered at a price of 10012/32 , down 1/32 to yield 7.59 percent, the same as Friday, when prices dropped sharply. Prices of Treasury notes were down slightly except for the three-year note which was up 1/32 to yield 5.33 percent, down from 5.34 percent. The discount rates on Treasury bills also rose.

Sharon Steel in Bankruptcy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Sharon Steel Corporation, which has laid off almost all of its 2,700 workers this year, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today.
Sharon had previously filed for Chapter 11 in 1987 and was sold to Castle Harlan Inc., an investment banking firm, in 1990. 
 Earlier this year, company officials said that low steel prices and a sluggish economy were causing Sharon Steel to lose about $3 million a month.
Because of the mounting losses, the company delayed payment of some bonuses and employee stock ownership payments. It also became delinquent in utility bills, and was sued by the Pennsylvania Power Company for $8 million in unpaid electric bills.
A clerk in the Federal Bankrupcty Court in Pittsburgh said the company had filed today. She declined to disclose any details of the documents.
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code allows companies to reorganize while protecting them from having to pay creditors immediately.
John D. Fry, the president of Sharon Steel, and Malvin Sander, the company's lawyer, were not in their offices today, according to their secretaries.

Fluor to Sell Doe Run Lead-Producing Unit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Fluor Corporation said today that it planned to sell its money-losing Doe Run Company, the nation's largest producer of refined lead, which will result in a charge against profits this year.
The charge of $95 million includes reserves to cover associated environmental liabilities. 
 The company also said it would adopt new accounting standards for retirement benefits, which will result in a one-time charge against yearly earnings of $35 million.
 
'Somewhat of an Albatross'
 The move to sell Doe Run was praised by analysts, who said Fluor's lead and coal holdings over the last decade had hurt the company's appeal to investors when compared with other engineering and construction concerns like Jacobs Engineering and Foster Wheeler.
"This was somewhat of an albatross," said Steve Dobi, an analyst with Smith Barney, said of the Doe Run operation.
Doe Run, based in St. Louis, has 900 employees who operate six lead mines and four smelters, two of which melt recycled batteries. Its principal market is car batteries, so its fortunes are tied to those of the automobile industry.
Any buyer would assume the company's unspecified environmental liabilities. The company has four sites listed as Federal Superfund sites for cleanup of hazardous wastes and is not in compliance with clean air standards at two smelter sites.
"It's a very dirty business," said Hugh Holman, an analyst with Alex Brown. "Many lead-producing areas are Superfund sites. That clearly will be an issue in the sale."
Analysts estimated that Doe Run, including its liabilities, would sell for $190 million to $225 million. Doe Run expects operating losses of $17 million this year on revenue of $100 million, its worst performance in five years. About 300 of the company's workers have been on strike since August.
Lead prices have been depressed by oversupply because of dumping by republics of the former Soviet Union as well as lower demand because of the global recession.
Analysts said Fluor was considering several means to sell Doe Run. Among them are making an initial public offering, spinning the unit off to shareholders or selling it to a third party. Fluor hired Merrill Lynch as its adviser and hopes to have a deal completed within a year.
Doe Run is the last remnant of Fluor's ill-timed $2.2 billion acquisition in 1981 of St. Joe Minerals, a zinc, gold, lead and coal producer. Hurt by the 1980's decline in oil prices, Fluor reversed its diversification strategy and began to restructure. Since 1984 the company has sold $750 million in assets, excluding its St. Joe lead and coal properties. Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., plans to retain its coal mines, which yield a low-sulfur variety sought by utilities.
Fluor shares gained 25 cents each today, closing at $46.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Drops Below $20 a Barrel For First Time Since Spring

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Crude oil prices dropped below $20 a barrel yesterday to the lowest level in seven months as traders reacted with disappointment to OPEC's plan to cut its petroleum production.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced last week that it would limit its oil output to 24.58 million barrels a day and agreed to individual quota limits for each member. 
 But that was not enough to steady the teetering oil market at the Mercantile Exchange in New York.
The futures contract for crude oil to be delivered in January closed at $19.89 a barrel, the first time since April 22 that prices dropped below $20. The contract lost 38 cents.
Analysts said that OPEC's accord was not enough to lift prices and that the quotas might be exceeded early next year. In addition, Ecuador withdrew from the group, becoming an independent producer that pumps at a rate of 320,000 barrels a day.
OPEC's October output has been put at 25.13 million barrels a day.
"If production does level off near 25 million, I don't think it is that excessive given the current level of crude inventories," said Morris Greenberg, an analyst at the WEFA Group.
Heating oil prices fell again because of ample supplies and relatively warm seasonal weather. The December heating oil and gasoline contracts expired at the close.
December heating oil expired 1.07 cents lower at 56.07 cents a gallon, and December unleaded gasoline fell 0.26 cent, to 54.72 cents a gallon.
Also at the Mercantile Exchange in New York, platinum prices surged because of the growing unrest in South Africa, the world's leading producer of the metal. Data reflecting signs of a recovery in the American economy also helped platinum. The January contract rose $5.90, to $363.20 an ounce.
Coffee prices jumped on speculative buying and hopes that the continuation of talks by the International Coffee Organization in London would produce an accord. March coffee gained 2.65 cents, to 73.00 cents a pound, at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
Both orange juice futures and cotton futures rose at the New York Cotton Exchange. The start of the potential freeze season in Florida prompted another rally, with January orange juice up 2.05 cents, to 102.60 cents a pound. Cotton prices rose, with March cotton up 1.42 cents, to 58.12 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Speculation It Has Peaked Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most other leading currencies yesterday as dealers speculated that it had peaked against the German mark.
Gold prices moved modestly higher. Gold for December delivery finished at $334.30 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, up 30 cents from Friday's close. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $334.60, up a dime from Friday's late quote. 
 Currency dealers said activity in the foreign exchange markets was light and mostly limited to end-of-the-month bookkeeping transactions. A lack of any market-moving news also made for a quiet session, said Zlatko Glamuzina, vice president and chief dealer at Banco di Sicilia in New York.
He said the market seemed less preoccupied with the possibility of a cut in German interest rates, which would weaken the mark. For some time, traders anticipating such a rate reduction had been buying dollars.
The dollar settled in Tokyo yesterday at 124.75 yen, up 0.55 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 124.45 yen. And in New York, the dollar was quoted at 124.70 yen late yesterday, up from 124.45 yen late Friday.
The British pound, meanwhile, was quoted at $1.5140 late in London, up from $1.5105 late Friday. The pound fetched $1.5165 late in New York compared with $1.5085 late Friday.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.5915 German marks, down from 1.5980; 1.4340 Swiss francs, down from 1.4405; 5.4055 French francs, down from 5.4275; 1,394.00 Italian lire, down from 1,395.00, and 1.2872 Canadian dollars, up from 1.28645.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.5940 German marks, down from 1.5975; 1.4370 Swiss francs, down from 1.4408; 5.4137 French francs, down from 5.4215; 1.7920 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7965; 1,393.50 Italian lire, down from 1,395.50, and 1.2859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2850.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Cleanup Industry Expects Growth

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
THE passing of the Bush Administration and the likely demise of its regulation-diluting Council on Competitiveness are generally considered good news for companies in the environmental business, analysts say. Although they caution that the coming Clinton Administration is not likely to fulfill all of the promises made on the campaign trail, mainly because of economic constraints, analysts say the Government's tone will shift in favor of environmental projects.
"We are clearly going to see more enforcement of regulations in the new Administration, more hazardous waste cleanup and maybe more funding for waste water plants," said Vishnu Swarup, an analyst at Prudential Securities Research. The industry has been weak for the last two years as a result of the economic recession and lax regulation, he said. 
 Grant Ferrier, editor of the newsletter Environmental Business Journal, said growth in the environmental industry slowed sharply in the 1990's after gaining at a 20 percent annual rate for most of the 1980's. Growth slowed to 10 percent in 1990 and 2 percent last year, he said.
Now the San Diego-based publication is projecting a return to higher growth in an industry that ranges from garbage collectors to high-tech engineering and consulting firms. Total revenues in the industry are expected to grow to $174 billion by 1996, from about $120 billion currently. That is $28 billion more than the Environment Business Journal estimates the industry would have generated in revenue if the Bush Administration's policies had continued for four more years.
If nothing else, the sharp slowdown provides an indication of how dependent the environmental industry is on Government policies. And without a strong spur of enforcement, many companies were able to defer cleanups, the installation of pollution-control equipment or the substitution of new materials to control pollution.
The slowdown in spending for cleanup and preventive projects dashed beliefs that the environmental industry was recession-proof. At best, analysts say, it is recession-resilient, but by no means immune to downturns in the economy. "The recession did prove that a majority of environmental expenditures are discretionary," Mr. Ferrier said.
Even though the election appears to have improved the overall outlook for environmental companies, support still seems weak for recycling. A Massachusetts initiative to promote recycling by requiring that packaging materials contain specific percentages of recycled materials by specific dates failed by a margin of 59 to 41. Heavy advertising paid for by producers of packaging and materials like new paper and plastic was largely responsible for the defeat, but the vote showed that the public will abandon environmental ideals in tough times if the costs seem high.
Recycling in general has not become as successful as the eagerness of states and cities to separate household trash might indicate. For one thing, the recession has depressed the price of new materials, making it hard for recyclers to make a profit.
The unexpectedly slow growth of recycling may help companies that collect and dispose of solid waste, argues Marc Sulam, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company.
"There has been a change in sentiment to the whole group," he said. "Growth is coming back to the waste industry."
Mr. Sulam is recommending Waste Management Inc., which is involved in so many areas that it has been called the "mutual fund of the environmental industry," and Browning Ferris Industries. Both fit three criteria for companies he thinks will be successful as the economy improves.
Both are large and well capitalized and in a position to gain market share. Both have landfills and incinerators that are ready to accept large volumes of waste. And both have used the recession as a time to improve management.
Mr. Swarup of Prudential also said he liked Waste Management and Browning Ferris, saying their stock prices should appreciate as higher tipping fees at landfills add to earnings. He said he expected Waste Management's shares to rise 15 to 20 percent over the next two to three years. The stock traded as high as $46.625 earlier this year. Yesterday, it closed at $40.125, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Browning Ferris may have even more upside potential, Mr. Swarup said. It traded for more than $48 a share as recently as 1990, but fell as low as $16.875 late last year. Yesterday, the stock closed unchanged at $24.75.
Mr. Ferrier of the Environmental Business Journal notes that both companies offer recycling systems to go with their garbage collection and disposal services. He said that Waste Management and Browning Ferris were likely to lose money at recycling, because markets have been limited and prices poor, but that recycling makes the companies more politically attractive. Other companies mentioned as good environmental plays include Sanofil, Midamerica Waste Systems, Rollins Environmental Services and Chemical Waste Management.

Capital Spending: A Mixed Message

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
IN the midst of the uncertainty about the American economy, capital spending -- the money that Corporate America invests in factories, machinery and other equipment -- has shot up. That should herald the approach of a strong recovery, after nearly four years of stagnation. And maybe it does. But capital spending has surged without yet creating new jobs. And the economy needs many new jobs to boom.
Capital spending has risen not because companies are expanding and adding workers, but because they are replacing old equipment. Roughly 25 percent of the $20 billion jump in capital spending since last spring, for example, has been used to replace old tractor-trailer trucks. Most of the rest has gone for new computers, communications gear and other office devices. Advances in technology have made the new equipment faster, smaller, and more efficient than that which it replaced. And, above all, it is labor saving. 
 "You can argue that these investments cost jobs in the short term, but they make companies more productive and competitive over the long term, and in time that will create jobs," said Adrian Dillon, vice president of planning at the Eaton Corporation, which makes components for trucks and machinery.
What Mr. Dillon described is the job growth that in theory should eventually trickle down from stepped-up capital spending. If new equipment holds down a shoe company's labor costs and thus allows the company to forgo price increases for its products, then sales should rise as people flock to the cheaper shoes. As sales rise, the company expands, building new factories or expanding old ones. In either case, new workers are hired.
But there is an obstacle to this process: weak demand. A shoe manufacturer who has cut prices might increase sales and take on workers as he expands. But his growing sales would come at the expense of some other, higher-priced shoe manufacturer forced to cut staff as his sales declined. Not until American consumers increase their total purchases of shoes can one manufacturer expand sales without displacing sales of another.
That might in fact be happening now. Total purchases in the American economy, not only of shoes but also of many products, might finally be rising at a healthy clip after failing to do so for nearly four years. Retail sales have gone up since October. So have home sales, and industrial production is up a little. What's more, disposable income -- the money people have to spend after paying their taxes -- has risen lately for those Americans who do have jobs. They presumably can afford to buy a little more for Christmas.
But American business is reluctant to believe that the improvement in sales will blossom into a strong recovery, and this reluctance is evident in the Commerce Department's data on capital spending. Since last spring, outlays for new equipment have risen to $380 billion, at an annual rate, from $360 billion in the first quarter, the level that had prevailed since 1990. But special factors made 1992 a good year for capital spending.
Truckers, for example, had put off replacing their vehicles. Lately, however, the credit crunch has eased and banks have become more willing to make low-interest loans for purchases of tractor-trailers, which carry most of the nation's freight. The blossoming of new technologies in telecommunications -- particularly in mobile phones and facsimile devices -- has also encouraged companies to replace older, less efficient equipment.
But they have resisted expansion. Net new investment -- to build a factory or expand an old one and equip them with machinery and computers -- has fallen. It took an especially sharp dive in 1991, after paper and chemical companies completed major expansions.
The American economy, weak as it is today, is growing faster than net new investment, which is at its lowest level since World War II, totaling less than 10 percent of the annual outlay for plant and equipment. What's more, for every Colgate-Palmolive, which recently opened a pet food factory in Richmond, Ind., there are half a dozen companies that close plants. And this has been going on for a decade, shrinking the nation's industrial base.
President-elect Bill Clinton proposes to reverse this trend through a tax credit that would reward companies only for what they spend on net new investment. These companies would then add workers for their new and expanded plants. But even without a tax incentive, the reluctance to expand might soon disappear, says Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant.
"The whole history of capitalism is that you overdo expansion, as we did from 1967 until 1982, and then overdo the cutback until you fall short of capital stock," he said. After a decade of closing plants and laying off workers, the United States might finally be on the verge of a new expansion -- one that would begin in the Clinton years, even without help from the new President.

The Subject Was China
 It was breakfast at Hermes yesterday for 50 executives from the fashion and retailing worlds. They were there for the latest in an occasional series of breakfast meetings at the 57th Street store at which leading members of the international business community share views on various topics.
The guest speaker at the event was Peter Woo, chairman of World International Holdings Ltd. and Wharf Holdings Ltd. of Hong Kong, who discussed the economic potential of trade with China. 
 "The Chinese love foreign goods," he said to the group, which included Myron E. Ullman, co-chairman of Macy's; Jerome Chazen, the chairman of Liz Claiborne, and Massimo Ferragamo, who heads his family's company, Salvatore Ferragamo International, in the United States. "Vuitton opened a shop in Beijing and is selling like hotcakes.
"But you must realize you're trading not with one country but with 30 separate provinces, and there must be mutual trade. If you export to China, you must also buy from China. They don't want someone just selling to them. They want trading partners."
That should not be a problem for Hermes, said Chrys Fisher, the president of Hermes U.S.A. "We have four company-owned stores in Hong Kong," he said. "We haven't opened any stores in mainland China yet, but we get cocoons in China that we ship back to France, where the silk is woven for our scarfs and ties."
Mr. Fisher then presented an Hermes tie to Mr. Woo, who accepted it with glee.
"I'm wearing a borrowed tie," he said, laughing. "I arrived last night from London without one."
 
Save Some, Give Some
 Devotees of sample sales will have a chance this week to contribute to charity while saving money. Samples Inc., a company that operates sample and stock sales in Manhattan for a variety of clothing manufacturers, is holding a benefit sale Thursday through Sunday with merchandise from two dozen makers of men's and women's wear.
"This is our first benefit," said Richard Rosenthal, the president of Samples. "We decided that instead of doing individual sales of the leftover fall merchandise, we'd do one giant sale under one roof and give a percentage of sales to three AIDS charities. Our goal is to raise between $200,000 and $300,000."
The manufacturers will donate 10 percent of their sales; Mr. Rosenthal will contribute 10 percent of his profits from the event, and shoppers will be asked for a $5 donation to attend.
There will be women's wear from designers like Bettina Riedel, Christian Francis Roth, Richard Mishaan, Lauren Sara, Zang Toi and Carmelo Pomodoro, who died of AIDS on Oct. 1. The men's-wear makers to be represented include New Man, Falke and Wilke-Rodriguez. The money raised will be divided equally among the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS and the Gay Men's Health Crisis.
The sale will be held at the Ramada Inn Penta, on Seventh Avenue between 32d and 33d streets. Information: (914) 738-8972.
 
An Opening, an Award
 Fashion people will have two chances to dress up in their party best next week. On Monday night, the reopening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute will be celebrated at a benefit dinner-dance and preview of this year's exhibition, "Fashion and History: A Dialogue." Dinner will be held in the Museum Restaurant, which will be transformed into a 1950's Parisian haute-couture salon.
On Dec. 9, it's off to the Pierre, where Hunter College will present its first Woman of the Year Award to Helen Galland, an alumna who was president of Bonwit Teller from 1980 to 1983, then founded her own marketing and merchandising company.

HEADLINE: For the American Center in Paris, A New Home and a Bitter Dispute

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The American Center, which has for decades been an honorable if humbly scaled Paris forum for visiting American artists and a place to learn English, has embarked on an extraordinary expansion. Now in handsome temporary quarters, it is to reopen next September in a new building, designed by Frank Gehry, that promises to be of unusual architectural distinction as well as a major Paris site for exhibitions and performances. 
 But the road to the reopening has not been smooth. Afflicted by the worldwide recession, the privately supported center's board of directors recently dismissed the entire professional artistic staff. The question now is whether the center overreached in spending most of its money on monumental architecture -- which in turn raised expectations in the international arts world -- rather than on a more balanced agenda that included an endowment and programming.
The dismissed staff members, most of them Americans well connected in New York and national arts administration, were unwilling to discuss their grievances openly, given their delicate contractual negotiations with the center. But they see center officials as having betrayed the expanded mandate they themselves set with their decision to build the Gehry building.
The center's administrators, on the other hand, are convinced that their decision to commission Mr. Gehry was a wise one. And they are desperate that the staff dismissals be perceived by the public and potential donors on both sides of the Atlantic as the only prudent response to a difficult situation not of their own making.
 
Laying Down the Line
 To that end, a confidential internal memorandum was sent on Nov. 5 to top center officials suggesting ways to answer questions ranging from possible breaches of contract to board resignations to withdrawal of pledges to threats to the center's tax status to "confusion of leadership."
At issue is the dismissal of Adam D. Weinberg, who has been the center's artistic and program director since 1990 and was formerly director of the Whitney Museum of American Art at the Equitable Center in New York. Also dismissed were Denise Luccioni, the center's French curator of performing arts, and two other Americans: Lucinda Furlong, the curator of media arts, and Michael Tarrantino, adjunct curator of visual arts.
In addition, an ambitious exhibition of commissioned new works planned by the New York-based Martin Friedman and entitled "Landscape as Metaphor" was to open the center and to complement the Gehry building. It has now been put in limbo, although Mr. Friedman and Henry Pillsbury, executive director of the center, said they hoped to present it later.
"We have to be extremely careful," said Mr. Pillsbury, a theater director who has been involved with the center for 27 years. "We've got to go forward with the resources we have in hand. If we do the Friedman show, we want to be able to do it right."
But James Clark, the executive director of the Public Art Fund in New York, who worked with Mr. Weinberg on a recent center exhibition, saw things differently. "The perception in the United States is that Martin Friedman and Adam Weinberg have been mistreated," he said, "and that Michel Reilhac will not find many people who will want to work with him."
Mr. Reilhac is the center's French general manager, just below Mr. Pillsbury on the executive pecking order. The dismissed staff is convinced that Mr. Reilhac has exercised de facto control of the center for at least a year, and that his elevation is intended to court French patronage.
Mr. Pillsbury, Mr. Reilhac and Judith Pisar, the chairwoman of the center, deny any such shift in power relationships or that the center is de-emphasizing American artists. Mr. Reilhac conceded that there had been talk of alternative ways of organizing the center, but said he had never sought a larger role in its administration. Nonetheless, a "proposed basic program structure," signed and dated "Michel Reilhac Nov. 1992," has circulated among the staff and board members.
All sides do agree on some things. One is their pride in the new building, which in typical Gehry fashion blends wit, style and functionality. Another is that the center is indeed having financial difficulties.
After its founding in 1931, the center puttered along honorably on the Left Bank, offering language courses and providing opportunities in Paris for all manner of important American dancers, composers and performers, among them Merce Cunningham, Sam Shepard, Steve Lacy, Joseph Chaikin, John Cage, Trisha Brown, Philip Glass and Tom Johnson.
 
In a Redeveloped Area
 By 1987, however, the old quarters had grown overcrowded and shabby. Instead of renovating and expanding them ("It's hard to raise money for a face lift," said Mrs. Pisar), the center sold the building for 220 million francs (more than $40 million at today's rate) and negotiated a favorable arrangement with the city of Paris for its new home. The American Center is to be a central element in the city's plan to develop the former manufacturing area of Bercy, along the Seine in the east of Paris.
Mr. Pillsbury said Mr. Gehry had designed his building "from the inside out," deciding what spaces were needed and then letting its fanciful shape, basically two eight-story structures huddled around a central courtyard, emerge from the ingenious juxtaposition of the required elements.
The center's French-American board set about to raise an endowment of $25 million and committed itself to annual operating expenses of an additional $5 million to $8 million. A $5 million matching grant from Frederick R. Weisman, a Los Angeles art collector, philanthropist and Gehry patron, got the endowment drive under way, and $3.5 million more has been pledged.
But here difficulties set in. The recession, which hit France later than America, made fund raising difficult. The dollar fell 20 percent against its 1987 value. And the French board members, used to a system in which Government support is paramount, were deficient in raising additional money, partly, as Mrs. Pisar put it, because the center has no natural "constituency" in France.
 
Delays by the City
 Delays in the city's part of the Bercy development, which have pushed back the completion of the surrounding plaza and park until mid- to late 1994, further dampened enthusiasm for a gigantic opening festivity in mid-1993.
Mr. Pillsbury and Mrs. Pisar say the Gehry building was always intended to generate income for the center through the language and arts classes, restaurant and gift-shop profits and rentals. The rentals will be from the center's theater, studios and exhibition spaces as well as some or all of its 26 residential apartments, which, if endowed, are to be offered free to visiting artists and scholars.
For Mr. Weinberg and his staff, this emphasis on rentals represents a betrayal of the center's artistic mission. Mr. Pillsbury stresses that the center was always organized to support itself in this way: 85 percent of the income at the old Boulevard Raspail quarters was earned. The hope in the new building, he said, is to rent the spaces to compatible organizations: applied arts like fashion, film and photography; computer groups; educational conferences, and the like. He said the projection is that of the $5 million initial annual operating costs, $4 million will be earned.
"We're not a museum," Mrs. Pisar contended. "We deal with all the art forms. The Friedman show was taking on these enormous proportions and becoming frightfully expensive. As chairman of the board, I felt we had to take fiscal responsibility and not blow everything on one show. We had employed a staff to handle this exhibition. Now that we are not doing the exhibition, it was not feasible fiscally to keep them on."
 
'It's Not Professional'
 For Mr. Weinberg's staff, the board should have committed itself to the program plans they had developed and then raised the money to carry them out. The staff said its proposals to modify the plans were ignored.
"They panicked," said one staff member. "They should have stuck to the vision that made them build the building. They're just not up to it. We were hired to make the whole thing look professional, and it's not professional."
Mr. Gehry, speaking from his office in Los Angeles, was naturally concerned that his building be finished in good order. "Henry Pillsbury is the guy I came to the dance with," he said. "As long as Henry's there, I feel good."
The architect, who helped the center with its fund raising, said: "I offered to cut back on things and they have refused to do that. They could take the stone out of the foyer and save $1 million, and maybe pay for the Friedman show, but that would trash the building."
No one wants to undermine Mr. Gehry's vision. The real issue now seems to be whether his building, by its very grandeur, demands a comparable ambition of programming or, as Mrs. Pisar put it, the center can "open very slowly" and focus attention on the architecture.
"The building is the star," she said. "Artists will come in and go out year after year, but what's going to last is that building."

HEADLINE: Present Since Atom Was Split, Physicist Reflects on Turbulent Era

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
HE was active at the start 50 years ago and is still at it today. No other scientist has been as intimately involved in the zigs and zags of the nuclear era, helping build the world's first reactor, flying on the atomic strike against Japan, leading America's bomb makers during the cold war, developing civilian power plants and lately working to speed the dismantling of East-West arsenals.
Dr. Harold M. Agnew has been active, sometimes even radioactive, at nearly every juncture since man first kindled a sustained nuclear reaction on Dec. 2, 1942. While no titan of discovery or invention, he has long wielded power and influence, sometimes as a Presidential adviser and always as a gregarious hawk, as restless and unpredictable as the era he helped to define. 
 "We did pretty good," the 72-year-old physicist said on a recent flight between Moscow and Kiev, his blue eyes steely. "We brought a quick end to a devastating war and maintained the peace, and eventually saw democracy prevail. That's something you can hang your hat on. That's what we set out to do, and that's what we accomplished."
Dr. Agnew's life amounts to a tour of the nuclear age, its ups and downs, rewards and dangers, fascinations and fears. It is also a study in optimism, some would say delusion. Despite the mixed blessing that unlocking the atom turned out to be, Dr. Agnew, like so many nuclear pioneers, still foresees a positive role for the atom in the decades ahead.
"His life has been remarkable," said Dr. Robert S. Norris, a historian of the nuclear age. "Harold has been witness to, or a participant in, most of the milestones of the nuclear era. He's known all the major figures and was a key player himself. And for better or worse, he's basically been pronuclear from day one."
And proud of it. He autographed the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. He served two terms in the New Mexico State Senate, happy to tell colleagues he was simultaneously building some of the world's deadliest arms. As president of a major reactor manufacturer, he fought to revitalize the nuclear power industry after the debacle of Three Mile Island.
Not that he's a drudge. He loves to joke, especially at his own expense. He revels in such idioms as "peachy keen" and "hog heaven." Occasionally he's a ham himself. But most of all, he is proud.
In an interview Dr. Agnew noted that near the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the birthplace of the bomb in the mountains of New Mexico, where he labored and led for some three decades, cars can occasionally be seen bearing bright orange bumper stickers. "Harold," they read, "come back."
Harold Melvin Agnew was born in Denver on March 28, 1921, the only child of a Scotch-Irish stonecutter. An athletic boy, he took to basketball, swimming and softball, pitching his team to a Denver championship. Fascinated by science, he majored in chemistry at Denver University, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1942 and won a scholarship for graduate study at Yale.
The war intervened. A teacher of his at Denver University, Joyce Stearns, was drafted into the secret wartime effort to build an atomic bomb and was told to recruit bright students. Young Agnew in early 1942 was assigned to Enrico Fermi, a Nobel laureate from Italy who helped direct the bomb project and was affectionately known by colleagues as the Pope.
At the University of Chicago, Dr. Agnew did "grunt work," as he puts it, using radium sources to make scientific measurements and getting a hefty radiation dose. "I broke out all over in red dots," he recalled. Redirected because of the health danger, he helped pile 50 tons of uranium and 385 tons of graphite bricks in a squash court to build the world's first reactor, known as Chicago Pile One, or CP-1. "We wore suits and ties, even for stacking," he said. "My knees were black."
The aim was to build a structure in which speeding subatomic particles known as neutrons would split uranium atoms in two, releasing more neutrons to redouble the splitting process.
On a cold, blustery Chicago day, Dec. 2, 1942, Dr. Agnew and a few dozen other people gathered around CP-1 to see if it could sustain a chain reaction, to see if the application of nuclear fission was more than a dream. From the squash court's balcony, Fermi called for control rods to be pulled out. Recording pens jumped as splitting atoms released a frenzy of speeding neutrons. It worked. CP-1 ran as a reactor for just a few minutes, releasing barely enough energy to kindle a cigarette. But its success meant that, in theory, the human race now had the means to light or ignite the world.
 
Early Days at Los Alamos
 Dr. Agnew, recovering from the radiation and enjoined from further reactor work, was sent with his wife, Beverly, to help find a way to harness the power of nuclear fission for a bomb. He arrived in March 1943, at Los Alamos, a remote and inaccessible spot atop a heavily forested mesa. The secret site had no jails, no sidewalks, no garages and no paved roads. Dr. Agnew and his wife shared a bunk house with another couple and a man who cooked nothing but Chinese food, even for breakfast.
At Los Alamos Dr. Agnew helped assemble and run a particle accelerator used to study the odds of neutrons striking different kinds of atomic nuclei, data vital to judging the merit of various bomb designs.
When the world's first nuclear blast lit the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, Dr. Agnew was already far away, preparing for the bombing of Japan. He was "aching" for the run, he recalled, because many friends had died in the war. On Aug. 6, he boarded a B-29 bomber that flew parallel to the Enola Gay, whose single atomic bomb was inscribed with autographs and messages, some obscene. "Greetings to the Emperor," read one.
Dr. Agnew and two other scientists were charged with measuring the size of the shock wave, and thus the bomb's power. Just after the bomb began to fall on Hiroshima, three radio-carrying pressure sensors were dropped on parachutes from his B-29. Dr. Agnew and his fellow scientists zeroed in on the signals. Suddenly, the cabin was lit by white light. Seconds passed. Meters on the radio receivers jumped as the blast wave hit the senors. Then the B-29 itself lurched violently.
"That was a worry," Dr. Agnew recalled. "Nobody had flown through one before." After the wave receded, he and his colleagues took turns peering out a small window at the mushroom cloud and the damage on the ground. With some foresight, he had brought along a 16-millimeter Bell & Howell movie camera that he used to record the scene.
As it turned out, Dr. Agnew was the only person who had witnessed the whole undertaking, from pile to weapon to Hiroshima. He was 24 years old.
 
Developing the Hydrogen Bomb
 After the war, he returned to Chicago to study with Fermi, living at the Fermi residence for six months until he found housing for himself and his family. He got his Ph.D. in physics in 1949.
Returning to Los Alamos, Dr. Agnew joined the hunt for a technical edge over the Soviet Union, which had shaken Western experts by exploding its own atom bomb in 1949. He helped develop the hydrogen bomb. The first one, weighing a staggering 65 tons, was successfully tested in 1952. Dr. Agnew worked to perfect so-called "dry" hydrogen bombs that were much lighter and thus deliverable over long distances as weapons.
His test explosion on a Pacific atoll in March 1954, code-named Romeo, had a force more than 700 times that of the Hiroshima bomb. One minute into the blast, the mushroom cloud was already more than eight miles high and climbing fast.
Years later, Dr. Agnew suggested that world leaders periodically witness such an event. "What'll impress them is not the flash, not the size of the cloud and not the boom," he said. "It's the heat. If they're about 25 miles away, they will get very antsy, 'cause they'll get hotter and hotter, and they will worry that maybe somebody's made a mistake. The heat. Really scares the bejesus out of you. After that the chances of their ever using a bomb would diminish rapidly."
 
A Safety for Nuclear Trigger
 In the early days, armed guards were the main barrier to the theft or unauthorized use of bombs. The weapons could be fired by whomever possessed them. This casual security turned increasingly risky in the late 1950's as American nuclear arms were placed in Europe and horror stories began to emerge. In one case, the only protection for key weapons in Germany was an 18-year-old private with a rifle.
After joining a Congressional fact-finding trip in Europe, Dr. Agnew wrote Washington in January 1961 to warn of "serious problems" and to propose the development of "a coded arming control device" for weapons that only central authorities, however distant, could activate. President Kennedy, inaugurated that same month, ordered all nuclear weapons in Europe to be equipped with permissive action links, or PALS, which block arming circuits until proper codes are entered.
Dr. Agnew oversaw the change, serving as scientific adviser to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe from 1961 to 1964. By the time he left, the new safety systems were widely used, part of the electronic control network that ran all the way to the President.
Returning to Los Alamos, Dr. Agnew was named head of the weapons division, overseeing development of such arms as a thermonuclear warhead for the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile. In 1970, he became director of the 7,000-person lab, urging his colleagues onward and touting their handiwork in Washington. "Harold was a very aggressive salesman," recalled Dr. Raemer Schreiber, then a Los Alamos official.
Dr. Agnew took his outspoken views to the Oval Office in 1978, advising President Carter against a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. Such an East-West stoppage would have ended the development of new arms and, more importantly, Dr. Agnew argued, reduced confidence in the potency of the existing arsenal. The White House eventually dropped the ban idea.
 
Advocate for Nuclear Industry
 Upon retiring from Los Alamos, Dr. Agnew sought to boost civilian nuclear power. In March 1979 he became president of General Atomics, a San Diego-based maker and developer of innovative reactors. Late that same month, the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania underwent a near disaster after a cooling accident, sending shock waves through the nuclear industry.
Dr. Agnew was aghast at the public outcry. "If those of us who know the facts were doing our job," he told a rally of nuclear proponents that October, "the American public would know that nuclear energy is safer, cleaner and cheaper than any other form of energy."
Today, having retired from General Atomics in 1985, he still thumps for new reactors, accusing the nuclear industry of blocking disaster-proof models. "The technology being pushed is 50 years old," he charged. With admiration, he says the Japanese in 10 years will probably start selling an inherently safe reactor, sparking a nuclear renaissance.
 
Defusing Fusion
 With the cold war's end, Dr. Agnew, who lives in Solana Beach, Calif., has increasingly worked to speed the elimination of nuclear arms. A year ago, he and other American bomb makers met with their Russian counterparts in Moscow and Kiev, seeking ways to undo their handiwork safely. The meeting was a first. The Russian bomb designers, many of whom had never before met a Westerner, treated Dr. Agnew like a god, some happy just to be near him, some eager to be photographed with him.
"We have to start out on the basis of trust this time," Dr. Agnew told a reporter on a flight from Moscow to Kiev. "We never did before, and we never got anywhere. I think we'll get drastic reductions if we have faith and respect in these people."
A top Russian bomb maker on the trip entrusted Dr. Agnew with a four-page letter for President Bush warning that the old Soviet weapons complex was dangerously corrupt and inept. Dr. Agnew delivered the letter to the White House by hand.
This year, Dr. Agnew worked behind the scenes to urge the United States to buy bomb-grade uranium from scrapped Soviet nuclear arms in order to bolster the shaky Russian economy and reduce the risk of nuclear war, accident and theft. In late August, the White House announced a plan to buy at least 500 metric tons of the material in a deal worth several billion dollars.
The Russian bomb material is to be diluted into fuel for nuclear reactors that make electricity, turning a potential nightmare into a bonanza.
Dr. Agnew contends that the nuclear era has resulted in far more good than bad. He says that for a grade it deserves an A. "It could be a AAA," he adds, "if they'd get going with these new reactors."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Let's Share, Ravitch Tells Baseball's Owners

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
While baseball club owners ponder whether to reopen their collective-bargaining agreement with the players, they are also wrestling with a comprehensive proposal for extensive sharing of their local revenue among all 28 clubs.
The revenue-sharing proposal, presented by Richard Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive, has prompted most of the clubs opposed to the idea to oppose the contract reopener as well. This division creates uncertainty as to what the owners will do at a scheduled meeting on the matter next Monday in Louisville, Ky. 
 "I see it pretty much down the middle," said Douglas Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates, a member of the Player Relations Committee's board of directors. "There are as many who want to reopen as don't want to reopen for a variety of reasons."
 
Expiration Date: End of 1993
 The labor contract that came out of the owners' 1990 lockout expires at the end of 1993, but either side can reopen it a year early by giving notice to the other side by Dec. 11. The Players Association has said it will not reopen. Earlier this year, it was almost certain that the clubs would reopen, but now they don't even know what they will do.
Complicating the issue is the revenue-sharing plan that Ravitch included in a comprehensive proposal to the owners last month for a new economic system for baseball. The proposal also includes revenue participation with the players and the use of a salary cap, ideas that management proposed in the 1990 negotiations.
Many clubs oppose extended revenue sharing, but others strongly support it. Further, the players' union has said that before the clubs ask the players to solve their economic problems, the owners should help one another.
Claude Brochu, the managing partner of the Montreal Expos, said he believed baseball needed a partnership between players and clubs and also within ownership. The type of revenue sharing to be employed among the clubs, though, is a difficult matter to resolve, he acknowledged.
"There is any number of variations," Brochu said. "I think it has to be one where everybody has a chance to earn a reasonable profit. Everybody should have a chance to be fairly compensated. I think it has to provide for a level playing field. All of these elements have to be answered."
Brochu said a club's opinion of Ravitch's proposal would depend on "where you're coming from."
"I think he's done some really good work," he said.
 
Share and Share Alike
 Ravitch declined yesterday to comment on, or provide details of, his revenue-sharing proposal. Many owners also said they could not discuss the proposal. But one owner, speaking generally about it, said the plan calls for clubs to share on a percentage basis all local revenues -- ticket sales, television, radio.
"It's a question of what formula you use," the owner said. "At least half a dozen have been bounced around."
Another owner described the plan as moderate, not radical.
The clubs already have a form of revenue sharing. On a national level, they share television and licensing money. On a local basis, visiting teams receive a share of the gate receipts. In addition, when a team's game is shown on cable television, the team it plays gets a share of the cable revenue.
That share of local revenue, however, is minuscule. Further, the American and National leagues currently have different sharing arrangements. In the American League, for example, the visiting team gets 20 percent of the receipts from all tickets sold; in the National, the visiting team receives a flat 44 cents for each turnstile admission.
 
Yankees Would Feel Effect
 Under the Ravitch proposal, the wealthier teams, those with larger local television contracts, would share considerably more of their income. The Yankees, for example, would not retain for their own use the bulk of the MSG cable contract that pays them an average of $40.5 million a year.
The Yankees and most other large-market teams are generally opposed to such an extensive sharing of local revenue. Recognizing that reopening the labor agreement would almost certainly entail acceptance of the idea, most of those clubs are opposed to the reopener.
Haywood Sullivan of the Boston Red Sox said he believed some form of revenue sharing was inevitable, but added: "In its present form we have some problems with it." He declined to discuss specifics.
The owners had been scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday in Louisville, but they have been summoned one day earlier to settle the reopening issue.
Carl Barger, president of the Florida Marlins, called Ravitch's total proposal "a very constructive approach that embodies revenue sharing within the whole parameter of tryng to deal with the whole labor problem."
"We're trying to digest it," he said. "It's not an easy thing. Everybody is trying to put it in their own context." Carl Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, who is viewed as one of the five hard-line members of the six-member Player Relations Committee board, favors both revenue sharing and reopening.
Nelson Doubleday, on the other hand, opposes both issues. A co-owner of the Mets, he cited the difference in franchise prices as one of the reasons he objects to sharing more of the Mets' revenue with clubs.
"What did we pay for our franchises?" he said. "You cannot say you have to give something away when we paid X amount of dollars and someone else paid X minus 100. Right now, the New York Mets share revenues. When a team plays us when we're on cable and every time a visiting team comes in, we pay them something. If that isn't revenue sharing, I don't know what is."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
High Court to Take Up Case on Large Punitive Awards by Juries

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether a jury's award of punitive damages can be so excessive in comparison with the actual damages as to violate the constitutional guarantee of due process of law.
The Court's action was a surprise, coming less than two years after the Court last addressed the issue of punitive damages with a 7-to-1 decision that did little to curb the broad discretion juries have traditionally exercised over damage questions. 
 Since that March 1991 ruling, in a case called Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Haslip, the Court has refused to hear dozens of challenges to punitive damage awards, and the issue has remained one of urgent concern to insurance companies, manufacturers and critics of the liability system.
The case the Court accepted today is an appeal from a ruling issued this year by the West Virginia Supreme Court. In unusually colorful language, the state justices upheld a $10 million punitive damage award against an oil company, which a jury found to have caused $19,000 in actual damages by bringing a frivolous lawsuit against another company.
In his opinion upholding the award, Justice Richard Neely said that in his view punitive damages should ordinarily be no more than five times greater than the compensatory damage award. But he said that in this case the defendant had been "really mean" and thus deserved to be assessed punitive damages of more than 500 times the actual harm the company was found to have caused.
Whether it was that rhetorical approach or some other factor that attracted the High Court's attention to this case is impossible to know, since the Court does not explain its decisions to grant or deny review. The Justices may have been looking for a case with which to revisit the issue in light of several studies indicating that the vaguely worded limits that the 1991 decision set on jurors' discretion have had little or no effect on curbing lopsided punitive damage awards.
Justice Harry A. Blackmun's majority opinion in the 1991 case concluded that the protections of constitutional due process do apply to punitive damages and that "extreme" awards might be unconstitutional. The decision instructed states to establish procedures to make sure that juries exercise discretion "within reasonable constraints."
The new case, TXO Production Corporation v. Alliance Resources Corporation, No. 92-479, began as a dispute over the rights to drill for oil and natural gas on a 1,000-acre tract in McDowell County, W. Va.
TXO, which later merged with the Marathon Oil Company, now the USX-Marathon Corporation, had agreed to pay Alliance, which leased the property, $20 an acre for the rights. But TXO then brought a lawsuit, saying there was a problem with the title to the property. Alliance, asserting that the lawsuit was frivolous and a bargaining ploy, countersued for slander and won the large award.
There are two separate constitutional due process issues in the case. One is procedural, asking the Court to decide whether the West Virginia court established the procedural safeguards against excessive jury awards that the Supreme Court's 1991 decision appeared to require. The second question asks the Court to resolve the substantive issue of whether the $10 million award was so disproportionate as to be unconstitutional. The case will be argued in the spring.
There were also these developments at the Court today:
 
Old Policy and New
 President-elect Bill Clinton's promise to withdraw the current executive order on the treatment of Haitian refugees has put the Court at risk of wasting time because the Court has agreed to hear the Bush Administration's defense of the current policy in a case due to be argued in February.
After Mr. Clinton's election, lawyers representing the Haitian refugees asked the Court to suspend further work on the case until after Inauguration Day to give the new President a chance to make the case moot. Without comment, the Court denied the request. Justices Blackmun and Souter dissented, also without comment. The case is McNary v. Haitian Centers Council, No. 92-344.
The Court has not yet announced whether it will hear another case that presents a similar problem in a different area of policy. The Bush Administration is appealing a ruling by a Federal appeals court in California that reinstated a lawsuit by a lesbian Army reservist, Dusty Pruitt, challenging her discharge for violating the Army's regulation against homosexuality. In reinstating the lawsuit last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the Army had not provided adequate justifications for its policy.
The Bush Administration's appeal, Cheney v. Pruitt, No. 92-389, argues that the Army should not have to defend its policy and that the lawsuit should have been dismissed. President-elect Clinton has said he will lift the bar against homosexuals' serving in the military.
 
Cable Television
 Accepting an appeal from the Federal Communications Commission, the Court agreed to decide the validity of a section of the 1984 Federal law that provides a regulatory framework for cable television.
The law permits cable operators who serve residential customers in one building or in a group of buildings owned by a single individual or company to operate without a local license, while requiring other operators to have a license. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the distinction violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.
Because it is extremely unusual for a court to invalidate an economic regulation on equal protection grounds, the case, F.C.C. v. Beach Communications, No. 92-603, is important beyond the rather narrow regulatory dispute that it involves. The broader issue is whether the Federal courts will be scrutinizing regulations of this sort more critically than in the past.

HEADLINE: A Winner in the War of Attrition for Pentagon Suppliers

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROANOKE, Ala.

 BODY:
As far as Josephine Finley and her employer were concerned, the nation was on a war footing from September until near the end of November.
A small American flag attached to her work station at the Terry Manufacturing Company here identified the seamstress as one of 32 workers who were trained to move with the finesse of a rapid deployment force from producing uniforms for McDonald's to sewing camouflage battle dress for the United States Army. 
 With all the nimbleness from 16 years of apparel-factory experience and oblivious to the din of 100 whirring sewing machines, Mrs. Finley worked to meet her production goals although it was only a mock war alert, a two-month Pentagon experiment in how fast production could be increased at one small company.
The experiment was the idea of Roy D. Terry, the company's president. He reasoned that with both the end of the cold war and cuts in military spending he and other suppliers could no longer expect the military to keep their factories filled with large numbers of workers by ordering a continuous stream of uniforms that would in turn be stored until needed.
 
Guaranteed Orders
 So Mr. Terry came up with the idea of cross-training to keep some of his 300 employees familiar with the military work and to give them experience in rapid change-overs. He will also keep special equipment ready for a military emergency. In exchange, he said, the Defense Department agreed to guarantee a constant level of orders for three years, though at about half the level of his previous business with the Government.
Mr. Terry's goal was to stabilize his work force as military spending declined, while the Defense Department saw a possible prototype of how to maintain, in leaner times, a production ability at a host of suppliers that could be immediately increased in an emergency. For the workers, livelihoods were at stake.
"I've got a daughter in college, and it's expensive," Mrs. Finley said, echoing the personal financial concerns of co-workers. "I had to have some assurance that we wouldn't be laid off in the years to come in order to feel more comfortable about things, and it looks like Mr. Terry has come up with a way to keep us from suffering. I thanked him personally for that."
McDonald's, the apparel company's largest commercial customer, also agreed to the arrangement, reasoning that even though it could mean interrupting the fast-food company's supply of uniforms, it would also mean a more efficient and stable supplier in the long run.
 
More Drastic Effects
 Experts agree that the more drastic and seemingly intractable effects of declining Pentagon spending are being felt at the closed military bases and idled assembly lines producing airplanes, communications equipment and weapons.
Those kinds of companies, said Robert Molino, executive director of the Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia, would not be able to adapt as easily as Mr. Terry's. Many of those manufacturers, he said, had to expand their imaginations to come up with commercial applications that would be an alternative to shrinking their military businesses.
Still, the outcome of the experiment at Terry Manufacturing will be important to a wide variety of factories producing staples like clothing, food and medical supplies. With their low-wage, labor-intensive operations, these small companies are often the backbone of the economy in small communities around the country, as Terry is in this east Alabama city.
Mr. Molino, whose agency buys $3.5 billion a year in apparel, food and medical supplies for the United States military installations worldwide, said the experiment with Terry Manufacturing was the first of a series of ideas that the Defense Department would be adopting to meet changing needs.
 
U.S. Pays for Equipment
 Similar experiments to cut down on the storing of food and medical supplies are already under way, but Mr. Terry's project was the first aimed at manufacturing. As part of the experiment, Mr. Molino said, the department was helping the company buy and install new computerized equipment not only to make his business able to answer a military alert, but also to make it more efficient over all.
"The grand world war" in which all the nation's production capacity is harnessed to a single purpose "is getting less an less likely," Mr. Molino said. "The rapid deployment, short duration action is the wave of the future, and in many ways your readiness has to be more keen for that kind of operation."
Mr. Molino said his agency expected to reduce apparel orders by 40 percent in the near future. Without some guaranteed business, he said, Mr. Terry's company would have found itself in a brutal competition with other apparel manufacturers.
 
Rivals Watching Closely
 Many of Mr. Terry's competitors who have yet to plan for the leaner times are closely watching the experiment for clues to what they, too, can do.
One of those is the Centre Manufacturing Company, about 50 miles north of here in Centre, Ala. "We are probing around in the dark to try to find new ways to survive," said Warren B. Dotson Jr., the company vice president.
For its 40 years Centre Manufacturing has made nothing but heavy military coats for the United States Army. With expected declines in military spending, Mr. Dotson said, "it is not an easy transition."
For one thing, he said, the quest for new commercial business was difficult since much of the low end of the apparel industry has long been moving to overseas factories with lower production and labor costs.
Beyond that, Mr. Dotson said, his company has never had a marketing or sales force because its products were specially produced for a single customer. It is a situation that the Defense Department encouraged over the years to have a ready industrial base.
 
Not Many Good Situations
 "We are trying to move into foreign markets and are postponing the day we will have to retool," Mr. Dotson said, expressing some envy about Terry Manufacturing's better prospects. "Mr. Terry found a good situation, but there are not very many of those situations to go around."
Terry Manufacturing is a 30-year-old, $17 million-a-year business, which occupies four buildings in what was at one time the city's segregated black high school. As Mr. Terry, who is black, walks about the complex, he points to rooms where he took English and math. They are now filled with workers at sewing machines or at long tables cutting stacks of material into front panels, sleeves and collar pieces.
Mr. Terry acquired the buildings about 10 years ago when his military work began. Until recently, the Defense Department work represented about 60 percent of his business.
 
Quick Increase in Output
 Under the mock war alert that began on Sept. 4 and ended Nov. 20, Mr. Terry had to quickly shift newly trained workers from McDonald's production lines to military production lines. The idea was to quickly increase his output of 45,000 garments a month by 20 percent.
Mr. Molino said the company had exceeded the goals by getting up to the increased production level faster than anticipated and sustaining that level longer.
Because of his success, Mr. Terry, who runs the company with his brother Rudolph, can expect $30 million in nearly guaranteed business over the next three years. As for his contracts with McDonald's, Mr. Terry managed to subcontract it to other manufacturers for the duration of the experiment and set up similar arrangements in the event of a real national emergency.
"I like to call them my national guard of sewing machines," Mr. Terry said as he looked about the buzzing factory floor.
Nearby, Mrs. Finley fed the camouflage-print fabric into a mechanism that automatically folded the seam edges at a precise quarter-inch before sewing a double stitch to bind it. Across the room, others like Julia Phillips fed triangle-shaped button tabs for the battle dress jackets into computerized sewing machines.
"I didn't use to think about what would happen with cutbacks, about the short weeks and the layoffs," said Ms. Phillips, who added that Mr. Terry in meetings with employees had explained the reasons for the cross-training experiment. "This cross-training is going to help us keep the work, and at least I know I will have a job a couple of years from now."

HEADLINE: Mum's the Word if Seeking Post From Clinton

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Beyond the talents required for high Government employment, the people who want to work for Bill Clinton need a particularly rare skill: the ability to broadcast their interest without making noise.
The President-elect and his aides have put out the word that those who are too open in campaigning for posts in the new Administration will be disappointed. 
 That explains why some leading Democratic politicians are fighting their natural talkative impulses and slipping in and out of Little Rock, Ark., without so much as a picture-taking session.
As they wait, or hope, for that fateful call from the President-elect for a job, or at least an interview, those in the know are heeding an old Japanese saying that goes something like this: The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.
Or to put it bluntly: He who talks too much gets nailed.
 
'The Less Said, the Better'
 So as the growing parade of prospects marches one by one into the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock this week, do not expect announcements from Mr. Clinton's aides, or news conferences arranged by the job seekers. Even the people conducting background checks have been made to sign confidentiality pledges.
"The less said, the better," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "We're trying to preserve people's privacy and the Governor's flexibility."
The speculation will probably be heightened next week, as Mr. Clinton plans to return to Washington on Monday and Tuesday to meet with newly elected members of Congress, among others, his aides said.
The only way anyone knew that former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona was meeting with Mr. Clinton last week was that he was spotted going through the lobby of The Capital Hotel in Little Rock. He agreed to have dinner with a group of reporters, and was as voluble as always, until the conversation turned to things like the Cabinet -- the Interior Department or chief of staff to be exact.
 
'I'm as Mum as the Rest'
 Suddenly, Mr. Babbitt was speechless. Pressed today for details, he would only say: "We had a good talk. We talked about an hour. Beyond that, I'm as mum as the rest of them."
Mr. Babbitt did allow, though, that in one respect he had an edge over many job seekers: "I understand the difficulty for people who are looking for jobs who may not know the President-elect. I know the President-elect, and for precisely that reason, I have not been out campaigning. And, therefore, have no comment."
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas fed speculation about his prospects for Treasury Secretary when he slipped in and out of Little Rock last week without saying a word to reporters, or, apparently, even to his press secretary. "I've heard zip," said Jack R. DeVore Jr., Mr. Bentsen's spokesman. "First time in 21 years."
After surprising many when he was picked as Michael S. Dukakis's running mate in 1988, Mr. Bentsen knows full well that no candidate, or incoming President, wants to appoint someone who is perceived as too much of a self-promoter. Nor does the candidate want the world knowing every step of his decision making.
 
Cancel That Interview
 "The worst thing for anyone at this stage would be to talk too much to the press," Mr. DeVore said. "There are jerks who make careers, or at least enhance their careers, by getting a drumbeat in the press going that they're up for a job. Then they hold a press conference and say they turned down a job that they were never offered."
Yet some people cannot always help themselves. Richard D. Turner of the South Shore Bank of Chicago had a public relations company call reporters in Washington last week to alert them that he was being interviewed today by transition officials to head the Small Business Administration and was available to chat with reporters.
But perhaps someone warned Mr. Turner to lower his profile a bit because the public relations company abruptly canceled the interviews, and Mr. Turner was no longer taking calls.
And George McGovern, the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1972, probably did himself little good when he let it be known last week that a high-ranking Clinton aide put his name under consideration for United Nations Ambassador or Agriculture Secretary.
On the other end of the spectrum are would-be appointees who may be afraid to say anything. At a recent conference in Washington sponsored by the Economic Policy Institute, many participants were mystified that four of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers did not speak as scheduled: Robert Rubin, Roger Altman, Ira Magaziner and Robert Shapiro. The only one from the top team of Clinton economic advisers who spoke as scheduled was Derek Shearer of Occidental College.
This concern with secrecy is nothing new for Mr. Clinton or past Presidents. Many Democrats speculated that Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana damaged his chances of being picked as Mr. Clinton's running-mate by acknowledging on national television that he was in the running.
Harry C. McPherson, the counsel to President Lyndon B. Johnson, recalled that the President nearly changed his mind on appointing Walter E. Washington as the first Mayor of the District of Columbia when the news got out.
"You want to keep your options open for as long as possible," Mr. McPherson said. "When word gets out that you're about to appoint old Joe, you don't have that any more."
Joseph A. Califano, a close aide to Mr. Johnson, wrote, "L.B.J. said he was not going to appoint someone who couldn't keep his mouth shut."

HEADLINE: Milestones of the Nuclear Era: A 50-Year Overview

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and MATTHEW L. WALD

GRAPHIC: Photos: Dec. 2, 1942: An experiment that changed the world
The first sustained nuclear reaction made by man was achieved at the University of Chicago by Enrico Fermi in a secret wartime project, opening the nuclear era. The atomic pile, in a squash court, contained 385 tons of graphite and 50 tons of uranium. The breakthrough involved a chain reaction in which speeding subatomic particles called neutrons split apart uranium atoms, which then released more neutrons to continue the splitting process as well as creating copious amounts of heat. The reactor in this case sustained a chain reaction for just a few minutes, producing a tiny flicker of energy.
 
THE COLD WAR AND PROLIFERATION
For U.S. and U.S.S.R, nuclear weapons kept the peace
 
During the cold war, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. built up vast nuclear arsenals ready for delivery by bombers and by missiles launched from land and submarines. At the risk of engulfing the world in catastrophe had they been used, these fearsome arsenals successfully deterred direct conflict between the superpowers throughout. Their purpose now served, the arsenals are being cut down. The more likely threat of nuclear war now comes from the other countries that have or may acquire nuclear weapons.

BOMBS
 
1942 TO 1945
 
Los Alamos: brains ehind the bomb
 
JULY 16, 1945
First blast
 
The first nuclear bomb, known as "The Gadget," was detonated just before dawn in the central New Mexico desert. Its force was equivalent to about 20,000 tons of conventional high explosives. All atom bombs are fission weapons, splitting heavy atoms to liberate nuclear energy. The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 were atom bombs, the former powered by uranium, the latter by plutonium. Atomic bombs are still found in nuclear arsenals around the world, especially in smaller weapons.

1943 to present
Weapons fuel factories
 
The first practical use for nuclear reactors was to make plutonium for nuclear arms. In Washington State, construction began in 1943 on two giant reactors, which went critical a year later. Speeding neutrons in these reactors turned uranium into plutonium, a highly efficient bomb fuel. Eventually America built 14 bomb-production reactors. Because civilian reactors have a latent capability for such work, they are carefully regulated around the globe to bar military diversions.

1946 to present
Test explosions
 
The post-war testing of weapons began in the Pacific in 1946 to help perfect new arms. Atmospheric blasts were forced underground in 1962 by an East-West treaty. To date, the United States has conducted more than 900 explosive nuclear tests.

NOV. 1, 1952
The hydrogen bomb
 
The United States detonated the world's first hydrogen bomb, code-named Mike, its blast causing the Pacific isle of Elugelab, one mile in diameter, to disappear. The bomb's power was calculated to be equal to 10.4 million tons of high explosive, some 700 times as great as the on Hiroshima bomb. H-bombs work by concentrating the high heat of an exploding A-bomb at their core to fuse isotopes of hydrogen that release even more of the energy stored in the atomic nucleus. They are still widely deployed in missiles and bombers, even as many are disassembled amid East-West arms cuts.
 
PROPULSIVES
 
1954 to present
Nuclear submarine
 
The U.S.S. Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine, was launched in January 1954. More followed, with many still out there. Since their engines need no air, nuclear subs can go vast distances without surfacing. Submarine sinkings, it is estimated, have littered the sea floor with at least a dozen reactors. The U.S.S. Nautilus sailed until 1980.
 
1956 to 1961
Nuclear bomber
 
The first nuclear-powered jet engine screamed to life in Idaho in 1956, discharging mildly radioactive exhaust. It was to power an atomic bomber that would fly for weeks or months without refueling. The effort cost more than $1 billion and involved 14,000 people in seven states before it was canceled in 1961, made obsolete by missiles that could reach their targets in minutes.
 
1959 to 1973
Nuclear rocket
 
Government scientists fired up the first ground-based nuclear rocket-engine experiments in 1959. Firings of about 20 different reactors were conducted over the years, but no nuclear engine ever flew into space. The program was canceled in 1973 as the space effort was cut back after the Moon landings.

1961 to 1964
Nuclear ramjet
 
In May 1961, the first nuclear ramjet engine roared to life in the Nevada desert, meant to power a supersonic cruise missile that would fly at treetop level to drop bombs on Russia. It was canceled as too costly and dangerous.
 
JUNE 1953
Practical power from a nuclear reactor
 
Navy prototype produced useful amounts of energy for a lengthy period. First used in submarines, the pressurized-water design came to dominate the civilian nuclear industry.
 
ENERGY
 
Electricity "too cheap to meter" for our children

DECEMBER 1951
The first electricity from nuclear power.
 
An experimental reactor in Idaho lit a few bulbs, generating the first electricity from nuclear power. In July 1955, Arco, Idaho, became the first city in the United States to be atom-powered, if only for one hour.
 
APRIL 1965
Space reactors
The United States lofted the first nuclear reactor into space, SNAP-10A (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power), the only one America orbited. From 1968 to 1988, the Soviet Union launched 33 reactors, the majority to power spy satellites. Most of them are still in space, inoperative. In 1978 Cosmos-954, fell, showering Canada with radioactive debris.

U.S. nuclear industry springs to life, and wilts
1973 was the high-water mark of the reactor industry; 41 are ordered, but 32 of them are eventually canceled; 39 more were ordered over the next five years, all later canceled. Enormous investments vanished; the Long Island Lighting Company spent more than $5 billion over 25 years on Shoreham, and sold it to a state agency for $1.

Some Atomic Mishaps
 
Kyshtym, Sept. 29, 1957. A tank of high-level nuclear waste exploded in the southern Urals, contaminating thousands of square miles.
 
The Stationary Low-Power Reactor, Jan, 3, 1961. The Stationary Low-Power Reactor (SL-1), an Army prototype near Idaho Falls, exploded, killing three technicians and exposing dozens more to radiation. Investigators later theorized that it was a murder-suicide.
 
Fermi reactor near Detroit, Oct. 6, 1966. A metal plate came loose in the reactor, 30 miles southwest of Detroit, and blocked cooling water, causing a partial melt-down.
 
Three Mile Island, March 28, 1979. Mechanical failures, design flaws and operator errors at Three Mile Island's unit 2 ended with a partial melt-down, turning a $700 million asset into a $1 billion liability and prompting thousands to flee the Harrisburg, Pa., area.
 
Chernobyl, April 25 1986 Chernobyl 4 reactor exploded and burned after technicians disconnected safety equipment. Thirty-one firemen and plant workers were killed.
 
Nuclear energy around the world
 
In 1991, nine countries generated a third or more of their electricity from reactors. But economics and political opposition in the United States have stopped new reactor development. Opposition has also slowed the industry in Germany and Japan. Taiwan and South Korea are still growth markets, but Third World acceptance is slow.

HEADLINE: Bill's List;
Hard Truths for Better Days

SERIES: Bill's List

BYLINE: By Peter G. Peterson; Peter G. Peterson is chairman of The Blackstone Group, investment bankers.

 BODY:
We have spent the last couple of years undergoing a reality check. No, it's not morning in America. No, we can't have it all. Yes, deficits matter. We can't just grow our way out of them. Traditional values such as hard work, savings, education, workmanship and investment really work. Indulgence, debt, indifference, greed and instant gratification don't.
The reality is that there is no free-lunch growth policy for the 1990's. The reality, as candidate Bill Clinton reminded us, is that reviving the steady improvement of our living standards requires more investment in everything that enhances long-term productivity growth: equipment, infrastructure, research and development, retraining, education and preschool care for inner-city children. The reality is that we must save more to afford this investment, that such savings mean sacrifice and that the struggle will take at least a decade. 
 Bill Clinton certainly possesses the intelligence and political and consensus-building skills needed to get America saving, investing and growing again -- provided his political environment gives him a fighting chance. Dominating the environment is a Congress torn between wanting to do right by our future and wanting to avoid electoral suicide. The public must work to bring the two courses into alignment. It is the task of the Concord Coalition, which Paul Tsongas, Warren Rudman and I founded, to help in this effort.
The Administration must establish the principle that the best short-term stimulus strategy must be a long-term economic program that also guarantees step-by-step deficit reduction in the 90's. By winning over markets, the media, producers, consumers and, above all, the voters, such a program will reduce long-term interest rates and thus stimulate short-term growth.
Americans need to feel confident that we're heading in the right direction. If the current (and zesty) recovery suffers a relapse, we may need to "front-load" some of the investment outlays and incentives for the sake of short-term stimulus. But we cannot lose sight of our ultimate objective.
If long-term numbers point toward national savings, productive investment and genuine deficit reduction, Bill Clinton will find it easier to create optimism and hope; if they don't, a one-term Presidency may follow. Remember, now that the Democrats control the White House and Congress, they will be held fully accountable for the consequences of their policies. No excuses this time.
We offer President-elect Clinton this advice: Let your mantra be long-term, investment-led growth grounded in fiscal discipline. Give the public and financial markets the sense that eliminating the deficit really matters.
Crusade for growth in world trade. Vigorous growth is the only safeguard to prevent the global economy of the 90's from veering toward a trade-implosion whirlpool reminiscent of the 30's. Urge approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. After committing the nation to a pro-savings, anti-deficit trajectory, push the whole industrialized world toward lower interest rates, greater demand-side stimulus and freer trade. With America's fiscal house in order, you can lead a program of coordinated global growth. You will have new leverage over Tokyo's budget and trade surpluses and be able to help Europe surmount its growth-strategy stalemate and truculence at trade talks.
Get America's private sector investing again. Enact a focused investment tax credit and a research and development tax credit. Propose a capital gains tax cut for productive assets held long-term -- not as a sop to "trickle-down economics" but as an incentive for owners and creditors to extend their horizons into the 21st century. We must pay for these measures. Fairness dictates that such payment include higher taxes on the well-off.
Get America's public sector building again. Propose an ambitious public-sector infrastructure program in which funds will go to projects that truly enhance productivity. We need to bring bridges, highways and sewage systems up to 20th century standards -- and to pioneer the magnetic-levitation train and fiber-optic network technologies that promise to be the standard of the 21st century. Avoid pork-barrel "investments" for powerful Congressmen by instituting the Japanese practice of pre-planning the best potential investments. Pay for the program with a phased-in gasoline tax and user fees, not more debt.
Design and fight for a cap on the yearly growth of Federal spending. Meet such a cap by taxing welfare for the well-off while assuring households near the poverty line that their safety net will not be touched. And enunciate clear budget rules that force taxpayers to pay for whatever spending growth occurs.
Insist that equity in the distribution of benefits to today's adults must always be balanced with equity to tomorrow's adults, who stand to inherit an unthinkable $17 trillion in unfunded Federal benefit liabilities, primarily for Social Security, Medicare and Federal pensions. Today's children also stand to inherit an accelerating entitlements bill that threatens to wipe out half or even more of their taxable payroll when they reach midlife. We cannot let that happen.
To close the deficit and finance the investment agenda, additional revenues must play a role. Your Treasury Secretary-designate should determine what consumption tax would best help balance the budget while promoting private-sector savings and treating all income groups fairly. What about a progressive value-added tax? Or the consumed-income tax the Nunn-Domenici commission proposed?
Put the middle-class tax cut on the back burner. We can't afford it right now. A tax policy that boosts consumption and reduces savings tips our national balance sheet in the wrong direction. In the long term, it will neutralize efforts to invest more in the economy. In the near term, it could trigger sharply higher interest rates that would wipe out any stimulative impact. Jittery bond owners will grind their teeth at any hint of a replay of the buy-now, pay-later 80's.
Set up bipartisan commissions now to deal with long-term issues that have too long been deemed untouchable: comprehensive health care and entitlements. Teach America that the economy cannot thrive in future decades without addressing the spiraling cost of health-care technologies, and the aging of our population.
These are tough challenges. But they offer Governor Clinton a chance to be a great President. Happily, we and our offspring would reap the benefits of that greatness.

HEADLINE: Conditions in Iran Are Far From Improving

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In 1979, most Americans were surprised by the fall from power of the Shah of Iran. For decades the United States news media had assured the public Iran was on the road to progress and would soon join the Western world. The Islamic Revolution of 1979 showed Iran to be a third-world country, underdeveloped and with an illiterate population, that had squandered its wealth on the whims of its ruler.
"Teheran Journal: Sophistication Sets In: Head Scarves by Chanel" (Nov. 13) is a case of deja vu. You soothe our concerns about the practices of the fundamentalist regime in Iran by telling us: "Music plays from loudspeakers in hotel lobbies, at homes and in taxis. Sale of video tapes and music cassettes are booming. People line up at movies and amusement parks." Also, "Restaurants around town are serving nonalcoholic 'Islamic beer.' " 
 "In an eight-day tour," you inform us, "it became evident that Iran and Iranians are loosening up."
This narrow view of present-day Iran masks the dramatic plunge in the standard of living of Iranians during the last decade -- a period in which the local currency has lost 95 percent of its dollar value.
You could have described how people on fixed incomes are coping with the inflation. What is it like to be required to buy and bring your own medical supplies for surgery in a hospital? What is the true nature of the quasi-official corruption visitors complain about? Who are the bene-
factors of the "private foundations" holding billions of dollars of confiscated property -- with accountability to no one?
To what extent is the political arena the exclusive realm of the clergy, their relatives and associates? As far as we know, even former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, the man who ushered the mullahs into power, and his Islamic group are barred from publishing their newspaper and participating in elections.
The fate of secular opposition groups has been much worse. Those not executed are in prison or have been terrified into silence. Opposition leaders living outside Iran are being systematically eliminated.
In the last two years Kazem Rajavi, a leader of the Mujahedeen, was murdered in Geneva. Abdul-Rahman Ghassemlou, leader of the democratic Iranian Kurdish movement, and his colleagues were assassinated in Vienna. Cyrus Elahi, a monarchist, was killed in Paris. Shapur Bakhtiar, the Shah's last Prime Minister, was decapitated in his Paris apartment. The entertainer Fereidun Farrokhzad, was stabbed to death in his apartment in Bonn because of comments about the regime. Two months ago Sadegh Sharafkandi (who replaced Dr. Ghassemlou as Kurdish leader) and his associates were machine-gunned in a Berlin restaurant.
I hope you will inform your readers in future about essential issues in Iran and not Chanel scarves and "Islamic beer."

HEADLINE: Thievery and Extortion Halt Flow of U.N. Food to Somalis

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The port is closed, a ship with 10,000 tons of food for the starving has been diverted to Kenya and cocky teen-age guards with assault rifles loll around the docks demanding cash even though aid convoys have ceased to move.
"Everything we've done here promotes rule by the gun," said Russ Ulray, a frustrated logistics officer for the United Nations World Food Program, who is deskbound these days. 
 The shelling of a United Nations vessel last week by forces of one of Somalia's warlords, the growing threats of violence at the port, and now the prospect of United States troops to protect aid workers, have put much of the United Nations effort to feed tens of thousands of Somalis on hold.
Clan warfare and looting are viewed as the paramount problems of the relief operation, preventing delivery of food from Mogadishu and country airstrips to the nation's hungry.
But even before operations came to a standstill, the effort had largely become hostage to a more complex system of theft and extortion involving port workers, truck drivers and avaricious security guards.
Some Somalis have suggested that United Nations officials have been naive, caving in too easily to ever-greater cash demands from guards and truckers and failing to devise incentives to insure that supplies arrive at their destinations.
Today United Nations warehouses are brimming with food and medicine, but the trucks stand idle.
A surge in looting in Mogadishu in the last month has coincided with the arrival of larger amounts of food, convincing many relief workers that bigger aid shipments mean more plunder for the greedy, not more sustenance for the needy.
United Nations officials acknowledge the possibility that 80 percent of United Nations food that has moved through Mogadishu, the main port, has disappeared through theft, ambushes and extortion.
And this, they add, despite large expenditures on security.
The so-called security guards, mostly teenagers with sunglasses and "I Am the Boss" T-shirts, have been clamoring for larger compensation.
"At the port we were paying by check twice a month," Mr. Ulray said. "Now they want it in cash every four days. They come demanding it with four technicals, and they say what they want in a relatively threatening way -- so it's given to them."
"Technicals" are the souped-up jeeps with machine guns that all aid agencies hire to protect supplies.
The United Nations also has 500 guard troops here from Pakistan, but they are not allowed to shoot unless they are fired on.
 
A Debate Over Numbers
 In mid-October, the former United Nations special representative to Somalia, Mohammed Sahnoun, said that up to 40 percent of the donated food was being stolen by gunmen. Last week Andrew S. Natsios, the coordinator for humanitarian affairs for the United States Agency for International Development, said 80 percent was being looted or lost to extortion.
Many aid officials, including those with the United Nations, said the estimate of 80 percent was excessive if all the food brought into Somalia by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations was counted. The Red Cross has suffered less from looting than the United Nations has, they added.
The United Nations pays $150,000 every month to maintain the port with 900 security guards and 11 jeeps with armed fighters, according to Jim Stearns, the deputy head of CARE, the international aid agency, which also organizes the delivery of United Nations food in Somalia. Guards' families are also allotted food from the aid shipments.
 
Jeeps and Trucks
 As well as now being paid in cash, the security staff also receive more food for their families. From the last United Nations ship, the guards got 240 tons of the cargo aboard the 4,000-ton ship. "That's what it says on paper," Mr. Ulray said. "It's the demand on top of the 240 tons that is the killer."
If the food leaves the port in southern Mogadishu on a truck convoy, it is accompanied by a battalion of jeeps with fighters hired by the trucking contractor, often one jeep for every two and a half trucks, United Nations officials said. The jeeps and their guards can cost from $75 to $120 a day each; much of that is spent by the fighters on khat, a plant they chew that has some of the properties of amphetamines.
The security guards may accompany a shipment to a warehouse in the city's southern sector, which is controlled by one clan leader, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid; or to the city's northern sector, which is controlled by Mohammed Ali Mahdi, who describes himself as Interim President, or perhaps 150 miles inland to a distribution point where starving Somalis gather in the hope of nourishment.
When the convoy reaches a checkpoint, there are often more payouts. The gunmen at the checkpoint between the south and north of the divided capital originally demanded 20 tons of food per ship.
"They don't keep track of the ships," Mr. Stearns said, "so it becomes 20 tons per convoy. You've got no choice but to acquiesce to the demands, because metaphorically you've got a gun at your head every time, even for five bags of rice at the port."
The United Nations has suffered more losses and faced more blackmail than some other organizations for several reasons, several Somalis contend. For example, the United Nations food dispatchers are poor negotiators, they said.
Ahmed Duale, the manager of the SITT Transport Company, a major trucking concern that transports food for the Red Cross, said he had created incentives against looting.
For example, a truck owner with a vehicle in a Red Cross convoy was paid 700,000 shillings, or about $120, he said. But he was fined 50,000 shillings, or about $8, for each bag looted. That did not leave much room for losses on a 200-bag truck.
By contrast, Mr. Duale said, the United Nations paid only 400,000 shillings, or about $60, to the truck owners, a low amount that invited stealing.
"In the middle of a ship-unloading for the Red Cross, truckers deserted me to go to the United Nations ship, even though they were only getting 400,000 shillings there," he said. "The drivers said they could take 50 bags to make up for it. The United Nations is too lenient and has no control."
Another prominent Somali businessman, Hussein Dimbil, who has not been involved in trucking the food, said he blamed both the United Nations and the Somali contractors.
"If a trucker says $100 a ton, the United Nations should go somewhere else," Mr. Dimbil said. "But if you say O.K., they will ask for more. I think the organizations have been too weak and too generous."
Mr. Dimbil said that outsiders in Somalia, including relief organizations, should bear in mind a Somali saying: "If you don't look after yourself personally, you don't care for life."
More roughly translated, he said, the working motto in Somalia is, "You have to be greedy for yourself."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN, ADMITTING ECONOMIC DISTRESS, ASKS FOR PATIENCE

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 1

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin, opening a session of the Russian Congress, acknowledged today that his economic changes were shriveling the living standards of most Russians. But he insisted that a change in course was not the answer.
In a speech to 1,041 deputies in the glittering Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr. Yeltsin asked for "a respite of a year to a year and a half" from the disputes over his program, but preliminary skirmishes suggested that the session would not pass peacefully. 
 Mr. Yeltsin also proposed a nationwide referendum on a new Constitution that would finally define the powers of the executive and the legislature.
 
Murmurs, Not Cheers
 "The transformations in Russia have lately become a subject of controversy and fierce struggle," he said. "Colossal political overloads and confrontations among various political forces have become an evil plaguing Russia's economy. The inability and the unwillingness to look for compromise is turning into a serious factor impeding the reform."
The President's appeals drew only a skeptical murmur, as did a proposal to have the state replenish savings accounts wasted away by inflation, an idea that seemed intended to attract waning public support for the Government's drive to create a free-market economy.
The two other main speakers at the opening session of the highest legislative body in Russia -- the Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, and the president of the Constitutional Court, Valery Zorkin -- also spoke in alarmed terms of the crisis enveloping the nation and called for joint efforts to resolve it.
 
A Different Remedy
 But their prescriptions clashed sharply with those of Mr. Yeltsin, and it was a measure of the mood in the hall that Mr. Yeltsin drew by far the weakest ovation.
Mr. Khasbulatov, a leader of the opposition, was fervently applauded when he declared that there had been a "complete collapse of Government economic policy." He accused the Government of trying to impose an "American model" on Russia instead of a "socially oriented market economy" for which it was more suited.
Mr. Zorkin, making the first appearance before the Congress by a representative from Russia's highest court, delivered an emotional appeal to the deputies to halt the disintegration. "We have slid into poverty, and impoverished people have never formed a basis for a law-based state," he said to a hushed assembly. "Save Russia! Russia is in your hands!"
How the Congress might proceed was the subject of animated and widely differing speculation in the ornate halls and nooks of the Kremlin. The session is likely to last at least a week.
But the strong statements by Mr. Yeltsin's two antagonists and the early jousting indicated that the main battles will be less over this Government than over how future governments would be formed.
The President's basic appeal was for a period of stabilization during which Congress would give him considerable leeway in economic and administrative matters. He asked also that a law on government be postponed until a new constitution is adopted.
In exchange, Mr. Yeltsin would agree not to seek an extension of his special power to impose edicts and would agree to have his candidate for Prime Minister approved by the Congress.
The issue is especially focused on future governments because the extraordinary powers to govern by decree, which Congress gave Mr. Yeltsin a year ago, expired today.
 
Balancing Vetoes
 Last month Mr. Yeltsin vetoed a measure adopted by the smaller sitting Parliament that would require the legislature's approval of a Prime Minister. It was this discussion that Mr. Yeltsin especially wanted to postpone.
But Mr. Khasbulatov has indicated that he will bring the bill requiring such approval before the full Congress, and foes of the current Cabinet won a vote today on adding to the agenda a separate discussion on the Prime Minister. Unlike the sitting Parliament, the Congress cannot be overruled by the President.
The procedural skirmishes that mark the opening day of Russian Congresses confirmed that neither the die-hard foes of the Government nor its supporters have enough votes on their own to have their way.
The hard-liners failed in attempts to raise the issue of Mr. Yeltsin's impeachment and to prevent the Acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, from speaking on Wednesday; they argued that it is the President who must take responsibility for economic policy.
The disposition of the forces also confirmed that the deciding vote belonged to the center and its new coalition, Civic Union. Many of the coalition's primary positions were laid out today by Mr. Khasbulatov, the powerful Speaker, suggesting that he would ally himself with the centrists.
Most deputies agreed that the President's speech was somewhat more muted than those of the past. Though his delivery was as vigorous as ever, the confessions of hardships and the calls for compromise reflected a leader in trouble.
"We must say directly that for the majority of the population, the reforms are for the moment only increasing the problems and difficulties," Mr. Yeltsin said. And again later: "Against the background of considerable deterioration of living standards of most of the population, a rapid and in many aspects unjustified social differentiation is making itself acutely felt."
 
Placing the Blame
 Mr. Yeltsin argued that the deputies were much to blame for the laggard pace of change through their constant opposition to the Government.
"How many contradictions could have been removed, how many mistakes avoided, if the Supreme Soviet had abandoned its attitude to the Government as to a junior?" he asked.
At the same time, Mr. Yeltsin insisted that he had no intention of trying to dissolve the Congress, which was elected in 1990 under the old Soviet Union, as some of his supporters have demanded.
"Let me make known my stand on this," he said. "Starting the stabilization period by destroying any of the supreme institutions of power is absurd."
Mr. Yeltsin also extended an olive branch to Civic Union, whose core is the Union of State Industrial Managers, by inviting cooperation from "business people and industrialists."
The Yeltsin proposals drew skeptical comments. Vasily Lipitsky, a leader of Civic Union, said the deputies would not likely support a proposal that "narrows the scope of the Parliament and deprives deputies of any levers of influence over Government activities."
Mr. Khasbulatov did not directly reject Mr. Yeltsin's request for a respite from criticism or opposition. A stabilization period was needed, he said in his speech, "but it would hardly be correct to allow a deviation from the constitution and the laws during this period."
He also joined in the call for civil concord, but in a formulation that was hardly enthusiastic: "We are doomed to be united by the current situation."
Such comments contributed to speculation that a compromise was in the making. But Mr. Khasbulatov's speech, and the enthusiasm it generated in the hall, made clear that the struggle for the fundamental shape of the reforms was well under way.
 
Defining the Problem
 Following the arguments of the Civic Union, Mr. Khasbulatov declared that the fall in economic production was the "No. 1 problem." Mr. Yeltsin, in contrast, had declared the main problem to be inflation.
The difference was central to the debate. Civic Union, and Mr. Khasbulatov, have argued that the state should intervene to brake the fall in production by propping up state industries and reimposing some controls on prices. Mr. Gaidar, the Acting Prime Minister, recently declared that there would be no revival of extensive Government interference or controls on the economy.
Which way the Congress leaned was clear. But whether it was prepared to change the orientation of reform was far less clear. The betting in the hallways was that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gaidar would prevail, but at what cost and with what wounds, nobody was prepared to predict.

HEADLINE: Transition Team Stalled on Ethics Rules

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 1

 BODY:
Nearly three weeks after President-elect Bill Clinton said tighter ethics rules for Administration appointees would be forthcoming, transition officials acknowledged today that they were having trouble producing the restrictions.
The timing is important because aides said Mr. Clinton is on the verge of making his first round of appointments, with announcements for major economic posts tentatively planned for late next week, after he returns from a two-day trip to Washington. Before accepting a position in the new Administration, candidates would presumably want to know how their lobbying would be restricted after they left Government, one of the issues to be addressed by the rules. 
 George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said at a news briefing today that the delay was simply because officials had "to get all the lawyers working on it." He said he hoped the restrictions, intended to slow the pace of Administration officials' leaving Government and lobbying the Administration, would be completed by Christmas.
 
Complicated Rule-Making
 Other transition officials, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said developing the rules was far more complicated than expected.
The only elements of the rules that were certain, the officials said, are what Mr. Clinton promised in the campaign: that some appointees would sign a pledge not to lobby agencies within their responsibilities for five years after leaving office (the current ban is for one year), and that the officials would have to agree never to become registered agents on behalf of any foreign government.
But the officials, who said a draft of the rules has yet to be completed, explained that questions still needed to be resolved over critical issues like what level of appointees should be subjected to the rules. As many as all of the 3,000 political jobs in the Administration could be covered by the rules, they said, or only the top 700 posts that are mostly at the Cabinet or sub-Cabinet levels. Another important unresolved issue, they said, is defining what constitutes lobbying an administration.
"There's not a big internal fight about pulling back," said one official. "But it's very complicated stuff. Unlike the transition ethics rules, this is going to bind everyone."
 
Appointments Before Christmas
 Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "Hopefully, we'll have a fair amount of the Cabinet positions done before Christmas."
Other aides to Mr. Clinton said that before Thanksgiving he submitted a short list of initial appointments for background checks and that in most cases more than one name was given so there would be alternate choices. The officials said separate background checks of the same individuals were being conducted by lawyers hired by the transition office and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Clinton's decision-making has been so closely held that only a handful of his advisers know whom he is selecting for important positions, aides said.
So far, the Clinton camp has asked the F.B.I. to screen dozens of potential appointees but has only requested full investigations on fewer than a half-dozen candidates for high-level jobs, including some Cabinet posts, law-enforcement officials said today.
The transition officials said the economy policy cluster of announcements would likely include the heads of the Treasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget, the Commerce Department, the Council of Economic Advisers and Mr. Clinton's economic security counsel.
 
Perot Invitation Questionable
 In addition to underscoring that the economy is his top priority, the officials said Mr. Clinton wanted to announce the economic appointments first so the names would be out before the economic conference economy that he has called here for Dec. 14 and 15. Invitations to more than 100 people will be sent later this week, the officials said.
Organizers of the event said they had made a preliminary decision not to invite Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who made the deficit his priority in his run for President. With Mr. Perot on hand, as one Clinton adviser said: "It would become a huge political event. We wouldn't accomplish anything and it would be an impossible situation."
The organizers also said they would not invite the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said last week that he expected to be included.
Mr. Clinton spent most of his first full day back from his California holiday in the Governor's mansion. He met with Vice President-elect Al Gore and other close advisers and also with Donna Shalala of the University of Wisconsin, a possible candidate for Education Secretary.

HEADLINE: Hostility Greets Students at Black School in White Area of Detroit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1

 BODY:
When the virtually all-black Malcolm X Academy moved into a virtually all-white pocket of Detroit this fall, the reception was so hostile it reminded many people of Little Rock in 1957, not Detroit in 1992.
About 30 police officers patrolled the school and a police helicopter circled overhead. 
 "It made me feel unwelcome," said 10-year-old Matthew Weaver, who is now unlikely to ever forget his first day of fifth grade.
Malcolm X Academy is one of three public elementary schools in Detroit created last year as educational alternatives for urban black boys, who have historically been at risk of academic failure. The academy, like similar schools in Baltimore, Milwaukee and Portland, Ore., teaches an African-centered curriculum that emphasizes black achievements.
 
Raising Self-Esteem
 Educators say the curriculum raises the self-esteem of black children, and that in the long run will help keep those children interested in school. But school officials also contend that all children can benefit from such a curriculum. So far, however, only one of Malcolm X Academy's 470 students is white.
"I don't think it is any place for a white kid to go to school," said Wayne Earhart, 29, a leader of the opposition to Malcolm X Academy. "They teach the kids that blackness is the center of the universe."
Deborah McGriff, the Detroit superintendent of schools, said, "As a school district we are committed to African-centered education, not only in the acadamies, but to infuse African-centered concepts across the entire curriculum."
The district has started three more academies since the first three opened and, because of a Federal judge's order, all six are open to girls as well as boys. They are public "schools of choice," to which parents from across the city apply. Students are selected through a lottery, although one-fourth of the spaces are reserved for neighborhood children.
 
Attendance Put at 98%
 Parents and educators say the schools have been successful so far; as evidence Clifford Watson, the principal of Malcolm X, pointed to a 98 percent attendance rate at his school.
Last year Malcolm X Academy shared space with another elementary school in a different part of Detroit. The school district decided to give the academy its own building and selected a closed elementary school in Warrendale, a white working-class neighborhood, because it would cost less to renovate than other sites.
But many Warrendale residents opposed the move. At a chaotic meeting of neighborhood residents and school officials last August some shouted, "I don't want niggers in my neighborhood!" and "Go home!"
Some residents complained at the meeting that black children bused to the academy would make their neighborhood unsafe, diminish property values and scare away whites. They demanded that children coming to class be frisked.
"We don't feel a need to do security checks on 5- to 11-year-olds," said Ms. McGriff, who is black. Her response was met by boos from residents.
After the meeting vandals spray-painted white swastikas on Malcolm X Academy's new building. Bomb threats were made against the school. On several occasions, Warrendale residents picketed the school before classes began in September.
"I heard people say, 'If you open that school we will burn it down,' " said Malaika Kenyatta, whose son is a fourth grader at Malcolm X. "I took those threats very seriously."
Despite their fears Malcolm X parents voted overwhelmingly to stay, saying that to back down would set a bad example for the children.
Since the school opened the animosity has continued. Parents patrol the school daily along with round-the-clock guards. They have reported several incidents: Eggs and rocks have been thrown at school buses. The words "white power" were spray-painted on a school wall.
"Even now, they ride by and hurl threats and racial slurs at the security guards," said Tandrea Black, whose son is in fourth grade. "They holler, 'Niggers go home!' "
 
Bottom Line Is Racism
 Mrs. Black said she had tried to explain all this to her 8-year-old son Ellis. "I told him they don't want you out there simply because you are black," she said. "I told him: 'You hear Mommy talk about racism. This is it.' "
Yvonne Hicks, president of the Warrendale Community Organization, which is trying to repair the rift with the school, said the bottom line is racism.
"The kids are in, and people have seen that their worst fears are completly unfounded," said Ms. Hicks, who is white. "You are going to find racist people no matter where you go. It is inbred."
Some Warrendale residents are trying another approach. They recently asked the Michigan Board of Education to investigate the academy and its African-centered curriculum. They have also hired a lawyer and plan to file a lawsuit charging that the academy violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution by teaching religion and by creating separate and unequal schools.
 
Focus on Curriculum Change
 These neighborhood residents insist their actions are not racist. They say they are not seeking to close the academy, but rather, to change its curriculum. They contend that the students meditate every day and observe a religious holiday called Kwanzaa.
Dr. Watson, the principal, said there is no meditation. Students do recite the Malcolm X Academy pledge daily, instead of the Pledge of Allegiance, which one parent said "wasn't written for us."
The Malcolm X pledge goes: "We at the Malcolm X Academy will strive for excellence in our quest to be the best. We'll rise above every challenge with our heads held high. We'll always keep the faith when others say die. March on till victory is ours: Amandla!"
The last word means "power."
Instead of Halloween, students celebrate Heritage Day, dressing up like black historical figures and giving speeches about them. The academy also honors the birthdays of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the abolitionists Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, the singer and actor Paul Robeson and the black nationalist Marcus Garvey, as well as Malcolm X.
This month the students will celebrate the seven days of Kwanzaa, which means "first fruits of the harvest" in Swahili. The holiday, cultural rather than religious, focuses on seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, co-operative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.
But beyond the issue of "religion," the Warrendale residents' broader concern is that the African-centered curriculum excludes whites. That the school is named after a man who once called white people "devils" also bothers some residents.
"They are placing so much emphasis on the needs of the African-American kid in this city," said Terri Zyskowski, a 28-year-old Warrendale parent. "They have needs, but so do all the other kids. They say they had to learn a Eurocentric way and now it's their turn. As I see it, their curriculum is distorted."
Parents and educators say the academy's main thrust is to educate students in mathematics, reading and writing. But beyond that, teachers supplement conventional textbooks, which rarely mention the accomplishments of blacks, with lessons that stress black achievements and try to correct the practice of overlooking African history.
"Science books talk about the work of Thomas Edison or Sir Isaac Newton," said Dr. Watson, holding up a fifth-grade science text. "But you won't find a black scientist named in this book. Why couldn't you have a Lewis Latimer or a Mae Jemison?" Mr. Latimer was an inventor and engineer who worked with Alexander Graham Bell in developing the telephone; Ms. Jemison is the first black female astronaut.
Discipline is strict at Malcolm X Academy. Students wear uniforms, and Dr. Watson routinely reminds boys to tuck in their shirts.
Behind all this is the goal of raising the students' awareness of their cultural heritage to encourage them that they can succeed in school.
"In my old school they didn't teach us hardly anything about African-Americans, except in February during Black History Month," said Matthew Weaver, the fifth grader at Malcolm X. "Here, they do it every day. And that's important to me."

HEADLINE: YUGOSLAV PREMIER TO CHALLENGE SERB

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia announced today that he would attempt to unseat the Serbian republic's hard-line nationalist President, Slobodan Milosevic, in elections set for Dec. 20.
Mr. Milosevic is widely held to be the person most responsible for the bloody aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia, and the candidacy of the federal Prime Minister, Milan Panic, is the strongest challenge to Mr. Milosevic's grip on power here since he took over as Serbia's Communist Party chairman in 1987. 
 "All that he offers is fear, division and confrontation," Mr. Panic said at a news conference here this afternoon. "Our economy is in a shambles. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Inflation is out of control. Our children have no future."
"War rages out of control, yet Milosevic has done nothing," Mr. Panic said. "Milosevic is doing everything to keep it going."
 
Move to Block Candidacy
 The 62-year-old Mr. Panic was born in Serbia but emigrated to the United States and made a fortune in the pharmaceuticals industry. He was appointed Prime Minister in July by the Yugoslav Parliament, which is controlled by Mr. Milosevic's party, even though Mr. Panic has consistently expressed opposition to the aggressive Serbian nationalism that has been the cause of most of the bloodshed in neighboring Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is widely believed that Mr. Milosevic calculated that Mr. Panic would serve as a fig leaf for the Serbian nationalists, and even persuade the United Nations Security Council to end trade sanctions imposed on the Serbian-dominated rump Yugoslavia at the end of May, without threatening Mr. Milosevic's control. But opinion polls taken by local newspapers indicate that Mr. Panic is now more popular than the Serbian President.
Mr. Panic promised again that he would work to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has brought this country international isolation.
In an attempt to block Mr. Panic's candidacy, Serbian election officials announced today that the Yugoslav Prime Minister would not be able to stand in the Serbian presidential election unless he can show by Wednesday afternoon that he has been a resident of Serbia for one year. The residency law was passed Nov. 3.
 
Milosevic and Defeat
 Before taking leave from his pharmaceuticals company in July, Mr. Panic was a resident of California.
"I was born a Serb," Mr. Panic said. "I am a Serb. I live in Belgrade, and I am the Yugoslav Prime Minister. Of course I am eligible."
Despite his popularity, Mr. Panic has no party affiliation or solid political base. But the leading opposition coalition, whose candidate for Serbian President is Vuk Draskovic, announced today that it would throw its support to Mr. Panic if he is ruled eligible.
Western diplomats expressed concern that Mr. Milosevic, who maintains control of the governing Serbian Socialist Party as well as Serbia's television network, major newspapers, major enterprises and secret police, will not accept an election defeat.
"Even if Panic wins, there are reasons to fear that Milosevic will not accept defeat by democratic means," a Western diplomat said. "His exercises in democratic politics are only a game."
Mr. Panic's announcement came as international condemnation of Yugoslavia grew and the war in Bosnia continued to rage despite a weekend cease-fire agreement between Serbian and Croatian commanders.
The United Nations today halted humanitarian aid flights to Sarajevo after a United States military aircraft was struck by small-arms fire. United Nations officials said that the aircraft, the second United States aid plane in three weeks to be struck by fire since the airlift operation began in June, was slightly damaged and that none of the crew was injured.
Sarajevo radio reported fierce fighting today between Serbian and Bosnian forces at the towns of Gradacac and Tesanj, asserting that 56 people had died in the battles. Clashes were also reported at Orasje, Maglaj, Bihac and Doboj.
Serbian shells also fell on the western suburbs of Sarajevo, local news reports said.
In Geneva today, the United Nations Human Rights Commission condemned Bosnia's Serbs as primarily responsible for the atrocities in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The commission called on the international community to judge whether the Serbs' forced expulsions of hundreds of thousands of Bosnian Muslims from their homes amounted to "genocide."
Yugoslavia was the only country in the 53-member commission to vote against the resolution, calling it "one-sided and exclusive."

Call to Arm Bosnian Muslims
 JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 1 (Reuters) -- King Fahd of Saudi Arabia opened an Islamic conference today by calling on the United Nations to allow Bosnian Muslims to arm themselves against Serbs.
 The King told the foreign ministers of the 47-member Organization of the Islamic Conference that although Saudi Arabia continued to support United Nations resolutions, "we see that achieving justice dictates allowing Bosnia and Herzegovina to acquire weapons for its legitimate self-defense."

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Weighing Policy Shift

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a letter released today told a key Congressman that the central bank was seriously considering reducing its targets for money supply growth next year.
Such a move would underscore the Fed's seriousness about combating inflation, but would also probably upset politicians who fear that it could hurt economic growth. 
 For the last two years, the White House and Democrats in Congress alike have repeatedly battered the Fed over monetary growth that has fallen below its targets, saying this has been an important factor in the weakness of the nation's recovery from recession.
 
A Balancing Act
 Economists generally agree that slower growth in the money supply helps reduce inflation but also slows economic growth, while faster money supply growth aids economic expansion but can also fuel inflation.
One Fed governor insisted in an interview today that "our view of what the appropriate stance of monetary policy is has not changed one iota."
But in interviews before Mr. Greenspan's letter became public, other Fed officials suggested that reducing monetary targets could actually end up promoting economic growth. By reassuring the financial markets that it will persist in being tough on inflation for the long term, they indicated, the central bank might have more leeway not to raise interest rates to combat inflation.
 
An Alternative View
 Still, several economists said that the Fed might be more ready to raise interest rates if it adopted a lower monetary growth target. The reasoning is that if the money supply grows faster than expected and thus rises toward the top of the target range, the Fed might feel compelled to raise rates. This discourages lending and helps reduce money supply growth.
"I think the markets would view this as another reason for the Fed not to ease," said David M. Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York securities firm. "If they lower the target and the economy starts to pick up, it might then feel it has to tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later."
Mr. Greenspan's statement about the possibility of lowering targets came in a letter to Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee, responding to Mr. Gonzalez's complaints on monetary policy.
In his letter, Mr. Greenspan sought to explain why money supply growth had fallen below expectations. He also said that growth in economic output had been higher than Fed officials and most economists would have expected, considering how slow the growth in the money supply has been. This, he suggested, was causing the Fed to rethink how much growth in the money supply was needed to obtain a desired rate of growth.
Mr. Greenspan's letter said that any change in money supply targets "would be largely of a technical nature" to take account of the changing relationship between economic growth and growth in M-2, the most closely watched gauge of the money supply. He said such a move would not be "indicative of a change" in the Fed's "desired or expected outcomes for the performance of the economy."
Fed officials insisted such a move would be consistent with their desire to encourage sustained growth while keeping inflation in check.
In an interview today, David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said, "I think it would just confirm that we have a long-term strategy trying to make sure there is enough monetary accommodation and stimulus to allow the real economy to grow to its real potential but not allow inflationary pressures to develop."
 
Speculation on Motive
 But some economists suggested that any move to lower monetary growth targets might be aimed in part to deflect criticism: lowering the targets would make it easier for the Fed to hit them.
And in his response to Mr. Greenspan's reply to him, Representative Gonzalez complained that lowering the targets could "jeopardize the chances for a strong recovery."
Mr. Greenspan noted in his letter that M-2 grew at a 1.75 percent annual rate during the first nine months of this year, well below the target of 2.5 to 6.5 percent growth. Fed officials pointed out, however, that the money supply grew at a 2.5 percent rate during the first 11 months of the year.
Mr. Greenspan said one reason for the slow growth in M-2 was that many people were moving money from short-term deposits, which are considered part of M-2, into mutual funds, which are not part of M-2.
Although the Fed stressed that any move to lower targets would be technical in nature, several economists said such a move could upset the coming Clinton Administration and the Democrats in Congress.
"I'm puzzled why the Fed wants to take on this bear right now," said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor who is chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "It seems impolitic. Why antagonize the Congress by even suggesting that you might follow a monetary policy that's more restrictive?"

HEADLINE: Thomas Gambino: It's All in the Name

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The Apparel Industry Chapter of the American ORT Federation's cocktail party next week will have all the trappings of a typical $150-a-person fund-raiser: An elegant three-color invitation. An open bar. A buffet with smoked salmon and chefs carving away. But the guest of honor will not be so typical: Thomas Gambino.
Yes, the Thomas Gambino who pleaded guilty at his corruption and racketeering trial nine months ago, the Thomas Gambino who prosecutors say is an organized-crime captain and the Thomas Gambino who promised to get out of the short-haul trucking business in the garment industry after paying a $12 million fine. 
 The president of the Apparel Industry Chapter, Sidney Reiff, said Mr. Gambino and his wife, Frances, were chosen because Mr. Gambino was "instrumental in this industry." To hear Mr. Reiff tell it, it did not matter that Mr. Gambino was a reputed organized-crime captain. "What the Government does, the Government can go ahead and do."
"Look, he's not in jail," Mr. Reiff said. "He's been generous in other endeavors." Mr. Reiff said he could not recall that Mr. Gambino had ever given money to the Apparel Industry Chapter himself. But he said the Gambino trucking companies had made donations in the 25 years since the chapter was set up.
Mr. Reiff refused to talk about how the Apparel Industry Chapter had choosen Mr. Gambino, saying the details were "immaterial." But he said there was no quid pro quo: Mr. Gambino had not sought the award in return for the promise of a big gift.
As for the man who agreed to the Gambino plea bargain, his spokesman had only a one-sentence reaction to the idea of honoring Mr. Gambino at the cocktail party. "The guilty plea speaks for itself," said Gerald McKelvey, the spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.
Foundation officials point out that the Gambino family has given generously to charitable organizations like Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park, L.I., where the $2 million Gambino Medical and Science Foundation Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit was dedicated last year. It was New York State's first such unit for children.
The Apparel Industry Chapter is one of 50 that raises money for the 112-year-old federation, which says it supports vocational and technical schools with 220,000 students in 38 countries.
The federation began to train Eastern Europeans to be carpenters and seamstresses. Now about half of the students are in Israel, and the emphasis is on 20th-century careers like word processing and robotics.
With financial support from agencies like the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, the federation has also helped with skill-building programs in Africa. The federation says that its team in Chad is helping farmers increase crop yields, and it is also running community health projects from Argentina to Uruguay to Zaire.
 
Fund-Raising Names
 The Apparel Industry Chapter turned to Mr. Gambino to help keep the money coming. "We attempt to find somebody who is willing to allow us to use his name to raise some funds," Mr. Reiff said. He said the group raised about $90,000 at a reception last year, when the guest of honor was John Pomerantz, the chairman of Leslie Fay, a women's clothing manufacturer. The year before, the guest of honor was Ted Schatzberg, the president of Party Formals After Five Inc.
"If it's a recognizable name, a name in the industry we can raise funds off of, fine," he said. Referring to Mr. Gambino, he added: "We're not delving any deeper. It's a worthwhile charity from our point of view and it must be a worthwhile charity from his point of view or he wouldn't have gotten involved."
The federation itself called the choice of Mr. Gambino and his wife as next week's honorees "an independent decision of that chapter."
"I don't know that the national organization has a feeling about that," said Avi Feinglass, the federation's spokesman.
The national organization was well aware that the Apparel Industry Chapter was honoring Mr. Gambino, though. "I'm a national officer" as well as the chapter president, Mr. Reiff said. "Nobody tried to dissuade me."
 
Disposing of Business
 But with the reservations trickling in -- Mr. Reiff said he was hoping for a crowd of 125 to 150 people -- the effort continues to get Mr. Gambino out of the short-haul trucking business for good.
After Mr. Gambino pleaded guilty to antitrust charges that stemmed from a sting operation begun by undercover state police officers, Robert W. McGuire, a former New York City Police Commissioner, was named to dispose of that part of what prosecutors said was an empire that gave the Gambinos a stranglehold on the garment business.
"We are looking at potential buyers," said Alice T. McGillion, speaking for Mr. McGuire.
Even when that happens -- Ms. McGillion said Mr. McGuire has until early next year to work out the details -- some Seventh Avenue hands say the Gambinos' presence will still be felt.
"On the street level, the same players are still there," said Alan Milstein, editor and publisher of Fashion Network Report, a publication that caters to the garment trade. "One could almost surmise that it's business as usual."
But not for Herman Bubendey, manager of the 500 Club, at 500 Seventh Avenue, where next week's reception is to be held. The Gambinos, he said, are not regular customers.
"It's possible they've come here before," he said. "When a member brings them in, what can you do?"

HEADLINE: In Searching for Scholarship Funds, the Advice Is: 'Do It Yourself'

 BODY:
Tough economic times and the rising cost of a college education, which can now top $20,000 annually, have produced a boom in computerized scholarship search operations.
For fees ranging from $50 to $250, these operations offer customized lists of corporate and foundation grants for which a student might qualify. The services scan electronic data banks of thousands of scholarships and match ethnic background, religion, intended career choice, or other criteria to the individual applicant. 
 But many educators believe that such services are a waste of money because similar financial aid information is accessible at public libraries, high school guidance offices and college financial aid offices. "At the very most, these firms save you a couple of hours of research in the library," said Madeline McLean, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.
Moreover, students are increasingly able to conduct their own computerized scholarship searches at no cost or at a minimal cost because more academic institutions and libraries are installing electronic financial aid data bases.
 
List of 45,938 Scholarships
 Charles Khoury, director of guidance at Ridgewood High School in Northern New Jersey, said his school purchases scholarship search computer software for $210 annually from Peterson's, a Princeton, N.J., publisher of college and career guides, and the program lists 45,938 private scholarships and grants.
"The level of specificity is pretty good," Mr. Khoury said. "We can't find a scholarship based on whether you're left-handed or right-handed, but if you're a white Catholic female and want to study nursing, we can find something for that."
The College Board, a higher education research group, has developed a computer program on comprehensive financial aid that should be available, for $395, this month. The program will enable a family to calculate how much of a child's education it will be expected to pay, based on Federal guidelines, as well as to search for state and private scholarships and loans from among 3,000 programs, said Maureen Matheson, executive director of the College Board's guidance publishing unit.
Last year, college financial aid totaled $30.8 billion, including government grants and loans, and helped about half of all college students pay for their education, according to the College Board.
Ms. Matheson said the board was prompted to computerize financial aid information partly in response to widespread complaints about scholarship search operations from educators, students and consumer groups.
 
'Information Questionable'
 "The quality of the information these services provide is questionable," said Carrie Getty, vice president of operations at the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York. Very few of those who paid the search companies' fees actually found scholarships, she said. In some cases, the scholarships the companies listed no longer existed or the deadlines had passed, Ms. Getty said.
Often, she said, the services did not make it clear to students that they would have to complete scholarship applications themselves. And Ms. Getty said the companies rarely made good on promises of cash refunds or savings bonds if scholarships were not obtained.
As a result, the Better Business Bureau issued unsatisfactory ratings in September to 20 of 21 scholarship search services that it had examined in New York City. The lone company that was not rated unsatisfactory was Data Search in Manhattan.
Nine other search operations about which the bureau had received calls had closed before the consumer group contacted them, pointing up what Ms. Getty said was the fly-by-night quality of the search operations.
 
Disappointed Student
 "It was a learning experience," Sylvia Alvarado said of her dealings with a now-defunct New York City scholarship search company. The 22-year-old Brooklyn resident, who studies accounting at La Guardia Community College in Queens, wrote a check for $89 to Money For School in August 1991 after calling the company and being assured that it had helped other students obtain financial aid.
Ms. Alvarado said that all she received was a booklet listing some corporate scholarships and general financial aid information. She also said she was unable to get the refund promised if she was not satisfied with the services provided.
Some of the search operations defended themselves by saying that it is impossible to tell how successful their services are because they do not know whether students follow through on applying for scholarships.
Students and parents are often lured by what college aid experts say are misleading advertisements sent through the mail or posted on campus bulletin boards. Typically, companies promise to help students tap vast amounts of scholarship money that supposedly goes begging every year because no one eligible applies.
The thousands of search companies that have sprung up nationwide are typically franchise-like businesses, which pay a parent company to conduct data searches. Most of the search businesses examined by the Better Business Bureau had such arrangements with one of three parent companies, all of which are under government investigation for either deceptive marketing practices or advertising claims.
 
Big Operation Shuts Down
 One of the most widely used, Academic Guidance Services of Mount Laurel, N.J., has been charged by the Federal Trade Commission with questionable marketing techniques, including overstating licensees' potential earnings. After the Federal District Court in Trenton temporarily froze the company's assets last July, it ceased operations, said a commission lawyer, John Cook.
The company had 17,000 to 18,000 licensees nationwide (each was charged an initial fee of $495), and 1991 pretax income of $5.8 million, Mr. Cook said. When it went out of business, he said, "most of the licensees I talked to refunded students' money" and shut down. Some stayed in business by switching to another parent processing company, he said.
Another parent company, called Money for College and based in Granada Hills, Calif., has been sued for fraud by the Wisconsin Attorney General. Jim Haney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Attorney General, said the company had overstated earnings potential to licensees and provided scholarship lists that were outdated or inaccurate.
Money for College did not responded to several telephone messages seeking comment about the accusation.

HEADLINE: Revision Discussed for One-Day-Old Health Plan

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Ushered into law with marginal political support and faint praise from its creators, New Jersey's new health care system already has brought talk of major revisions and the threat of protracted legal fighting.
Gov. Jim Florio signed the sweeping overhaul of the state's health care system Monday night, only minutes after the Republican-controlled Legislature approved the package of bills, which includes a plan to pay for hospital care for the poor by diverting $1.6 billion from the state's unemployment insurance fund. 
 "We have averted a crisis that could have shut down New Jersey's health care system at midnight Dec. 1," Mr. Florio said. "At the same time, we have enacted far-reaching insurance reforms that will help make sure no one in our state has to lie awake at night wondering how they would pay the bills if someone in the family gets sick.
"The new method of paying for the care of those who can't afford it is far from perfect. But it was the only option that the legislative process made available."
 
Amendments Expected Soon
 Although the Governor had acquiesced, none of his Democratic colleagues in the Legislature did. They voted against the package, and the Republican leaders in the Senate were forced to cajole a freshman Republican, who at first had abstained, to supply the deciding vote.
The measure passed, 48 to 23 in the Assembly and 21 to 18, with one abstention, in the Senate.
The Democratic minority leader in the Assembly, Joseph V. Doria of Bayonne, predicted that the issue would be back before the Legislature within weeks, saying: "I think politically the Republicans will have to amend it immediately, before we have total chaos."
There are at least three amendments under consideration, according to Democrats in the Legislature. One is intended to help hospitals, especially those in urban areas, that are expected to suffer financially.
Provisions of the amendment would create a floor under which deregulated hospital rates could not fall. It would also establish a fund in the State Department of Health to help pay expenses for teaching hospitals and provide for state money to make up for anticipated Medicaid losses.
 
'Nice Try' Category
 A second amendment would give the Legislature more power to oversee the new system. As it stands, the new legislation diminishes the regulatory role of the Insurance Commissioner, the Public Advocate and the appropriations committees of the Legislature.
The third proposal would guarantee that people in inner cities and other areas that might not be served by insurance companies would still have access to medical care.
Faced with a Federal court ruling in May that outlawed the state's 12-year-old system of paying for charity health care, the Governor and the legislative leaders used the opportunity to revamp the entire system.
Pushing their own ideas on health care and borrowing ideas from other states, they produced a package unlike any other plan in the nation.
"This legislation places New Jersey in the 'nice try' category," said Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization.
He described some of the legislation as "noble sounding" but the overall plan as full of loopholes.
Under an "open enrollment" provision, for example, the package assigns every health insurer in New Jersey a quota of customers based on its market share. Up to that quota, the company must accept customers without regard to age, sex, health or geographic location. A company that fails to do so must pay a large subsidy to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey, which now insures most of the state's high-risk customers.
"It's easy to say in the Legislature that this will work," said Mr. Hunter. "It's a lot harder to make it work at the kitchen table with the insurance agent sitting across the way."
He said there were a number of ways insurance companies could circumvent the law. For example, he said, they can advertise only to low-risk groups, so that customers they do not want might not think of applying to them.
The changes agreed upon by Mr. Florio, the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, were influenced as much by politics as by the need for reform.
Finding a source of financing for charity hospital care was the major and most pressing issue, and with both gubernatorial and legislative elections less than a year away, the Governor and the Republican leaders avoided any direct tax increase. Instead, they settled on a Republican idea, tapping into the unemployment fund, an idea that has been criticized as a "back-door tax."
The financing source would be eliminated -- or in legislative terms, "sunset" -- after three years, to be replaced by state-subsidized or low-cost private health insurance or by a system in which hospitals would simply absorb more of their unpaid bills.
"The major shortcomings, as I see them, are structural, not philosophical," said Senator Richard J. LaRossa of Trenton, who abstained on the bill, citing problems with the funding mechanism. "The system sunsets, uses a highly questionable funding source and simply does not make genuine changes on a system that is hemorrhaging and bleeding businesses, patients, insurance companies, hospitals and consumers in New Jersey to death."
The state A.F.L.-C.I.O., which along with the state Chamber of Commerce had opposed the use of unemployment insurance money, said today that it would try to have the courts overturn the package.
The regional administrator for the Federal Department of Labor, Thomas E. Hill, had advised the state in October that it was "inadvisable" to divert money from the unemployment trust fund. But an official in the office said today that the new legislation did not violate Federal guidelines.
"Legally we cannot intervene," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The New Jersey Legislature is perfectly within its rights."

More evidence of economic pickup emerged today as the Government's main forecasting index posted an advance of four-tenths of 1 percent for October after two straight monthly declines.
The broad-based, albeit modest, rise in the index of leading indicators came as the Commerce Department reported a 1 percent gain in spending on new construction for the month. And in a third report, this one covering November, an index of manufacturing activity by the nation's purchasing managers showed a sharp jump to 55 percent from 50.6 percent. [Page D2.] 
 Analysts were generally encouraged by today's statistics. The data came after last week's report on gross domestic product for the July-September quarter showed a hefty upward revision to a growth rate of 3.9 percent. In addition, there has been a steady reduction in recent weeks in first-time claims for jobless benefits.
Still, most economists remained skeptical to one degree or another about the prospects for vigorous expansion in the months ahead. Some cited the impending disappearance of special factors that have helped fuel the gains in the economy, while others pointed to such drags as the Federal budget deficit.
"Before you get too excited, you better at least wait for the employment numbers" for November, which are to be released Friday, cautioned Maury N. Harris, chief economist for Paine Webber Inc.
He said the current situation and its economic data reminded him of the period around Memorial Day, when there were similar gains. "Then, in early July, kerplunko," Mr. Harris said, referring in particular to unexpectedly poor labor-market results for June when payrolls shrank and the unemployment rate spurted three-tenths of a percentage point.
Lawrence A. Hunter, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement that the rise in the leading indicators showed the economic growth in the third quarter to have been "no fluke" and predicted that the economy would grow at about a 3 percent pace for the first half of 1993. Stil, that rate is below par for the early stage of an expansion, and he questioned whether even that could be sustained.
 
Some Special Factors
 The economy in recent months has benefited from the spending related to cleaning up Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and from a reduction in withholding of income taxes, but those stimuli will soon wear off. After that, Mr. Hunter said, "the economy will still be beset with policy problems that have plagued it the past three years -- increases in costly regulations, rapidly rising Federal spending and increased taxes on businesses and individuals."
Of the 11 components of the leading indicators, 8 expanded during October, although for 2 of them, consumer expectations and money supply, the rise was so small as to round to zero. And of the three that declined, the biggest factor by far was an easing of prices -- not entirely unwelcome -- of goods especially sensitive to the business cycle.
Another plus was the fact that the companion indexes of coincident and lagging indicators also advanced in October, the first time since March 1990 that all three composite indexes gained in the same month.
The rise in the coincident index, an approximation of current economic activity, was four-tenths of 1 percent. This followed two straight declines and matched its best performance since February.
The lagging index climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent, making two gains since July after falling for 18 straight months.
The chief contributor to the leading index's October gain was weekly jobless claims, which dropped sharply. Lesser improvement came from a longer workweek, a rise in unfilled factory orders, higher contracts and orders for plant and equipment, new factory orders for consumer goods and materials, and a rising volume of building permits.
Besides the decline in sensitive materials prices, the negative factors were faster deliveries by company suppliers and lower stock prices, subsequently reversed, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
In what was mainly a reflection of a longer workweek, a revision of September's decline put it at one-tenth of 1 percent instead of the drop of three-tenths originally reported.
All three available components of the coincident index -- nonfarm payrolls, personal income and industrial production -- rose in October, fueling speculation that the National Bureau of Economic Research will soon declare an official end to the recession that began in July 1990.
A private forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research posted a jump of nine-tenths of 1 percent in October as gains in monetary and consumer-attitude components continued to more than offset weakness in the labor market and in macroeconomic gauges, a reversal of earlier readings.

1993: So-So Growth, Low Inflation

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A consensus forecast of leading bond market economists released yesterday said the economy would grow moderately next year, inflation would remain low and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond could decline to around 7.25 percent.
The forecast for interest rates, however, depends on a big if: whether the new Clinton Administration will produce a credible deficit-reduction program along with its proposals to stimulate the economy. 
 "We need to believe the campaign promises on the deficit," said James Annable, an economist of the First National Bank of Chicago and co-chairman of the group of 11 economists who did the forecast for the Public Securities Association. "Without that we'll see trouble in the bond market."
 
The Deficit Factor
 Any visions of rising deficits, which are bad for bond traders, investors and speculators, would cause problems for the bond market. Higher deficits mean more government borrowing, which can push interest rates higher. Deficits also raise fears of rising inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments.
The importance of the deficit factor is easy to see in another forecast yesterday by an economist not on the association's panel. It calls for the yield on the 30-year bond to be 7.75 percent in the fall of next year. The forecaster, Paul W. Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates, put his bond yield forecast a full half-percentage-point higher than the 7.25 percent seen by the 11-member panel in part because he has less confidence in the Government's ability to produce an effective deficit-reduction proposal.
Mr. Boltz said that Mr. Clinton's promise to stimulate the economy was not easily reconciled with cutting the deficit significantly. And this fact, he argued, has created "an unease in the financial markets."
Mr. Annable, who used to work for the Congressional Budget Office in Washington, is familiar with past attempts and failures at credible deficit reduction. Despite such efforts, Government red ink swelled to a record high in the 1992 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and should set another record in the 1993 fiscal year.
 
Have Times Changed?
 But Mr. Annable, in response to a question, said he had more confidence in the new Administration and Congress because times had changed.
"It is now such a serious problem that the Administration realizes it," he told a group of reporters at the morning presentation of the consensus forecast. And when pressed on why past record deficit levels did not create the same urgency, he replied, "The deficit wasn't constraining choices as it is today."
These are among other points in the consensus forecast, which is the first produced by members of the Public Securities Association:
*Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, will be 3 percent next year, the same as is forecast for this year.
*Economic growth will be 2.2 percent year over year, compared with a forecast of about 2 percent this year.
*The unemployment rate will be 7.3 percent for 1993, as economic growth will create some new jobs but not enough to bring the rate down significantly from this year. In October, the unemployment rate was 7.4 percent.
*The budget deficit for the 1993 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, will be a record $340 billion, compared with $290 billion for the 1992 fiscal year. Much of the increase will be from spending to bail out more savings and loan associations.
The group also urged that the Clinton Administration and Congress decide soon on the effective date for the investment tax credit the President-elect is expected to propose. Until that date is set, many companies are likely to delay any new investments in plants or equipment, the group said.
 
Treasury Market
 In another volatile day, the price of the 30-year bond rose while the prices of shorter-term notes fell as investors and traders focused on more news showing that the economy may be on a stable path of growth. The discount rates on Treasury bills also rose.
The price of the 30-year bond was up11/32 , to 10023/32 , to yield 7.56 percent, down from 7.59 percent Monday.
As as been happening for the last few weeks, economic data showing the economy a little stronger than is expected have hurt the shorter end of the bond market. This is because a stronger economy would mean there is no chance of a further cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the signs of growth indicate to some that the time when the Fed might raise short-term rates seems to be moving closer.
The 30-year bond has fared better because recent economic data still show that the inflation rate is low and there is little chance of any kind of surge in the near future.
The case for a stronger economy was supported yesterday by a rise of four-tenths of a percent in the index of leading economic indicators in October and a jump in the National Association of Purchasing Managers index of buying activity to 55 in November from 50.6 in October.
In addition, analysts interpreted comments from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as another signal that the Fed would not cut short-term interest rates any more. Mr. Greenspan said the Fed was considering lowering the growth range targets for a key money supply figure. If the Fed did this, money supply growth, which is now at the bottom of the range, would be comfortably within the range, erasing any need to cut interest rates.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction yesterday of 49-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Purchasers' Survey Finds an Upturn

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The manufacturing economy expanded robustly in November, led by sharp increases in new orders and industrial production, according to a monthly survey of the nation's purchasing managers.
The report, along with other data released yesterday by the Commerce Department, provided additional signs of economic recovery, economists said. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of economic activity increased to 55 percent in November, from 50.6 percent in October. The November reading was the highest since May, when the index stood at 56.3 percent, and was the second highest this year. It was also the second consecutive monthly increase.
A reading above 50 percent indicates that the economy is expanding, while a reading below 50 percent is a sign of contraction.
The monthly index is compiled from a survey of more than 300 purchasing managers at a wide range of industrial companies. It is considered important because its release early in each month provides one of the first significant indicators of economy activity in the previous month.
This month the purchasing managers' report came on the day the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 1 percent in October. The department also said yesterday that the Government's major economic forecasting barometer posted its largest increase in five months, rising four-tenths of 1 percent in October.
"It seems that economic activity in the manufacturing sector is expanding somewhat more rapidly now," said Andrew F. Brimmer, a former governor of the Federal Reserve who is now president of Brimmer & Company, a consulting firm in Washington. "This is reinforced by the rise in the purchasing managers' index in new orders, which suggests that future economy activity will also be stronger than it is currently."
The association's index of new orders rose sharply, to 60.8 percent in November, from October's 55 percent. Economists said the increase would lead to higher production.
"The surge in new orders in November was sufficient to boost the overall growth in the economy to a level not seen since May," said Robert J. Bretz, the director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. and the chairman of the purchasing managers' survey committee. "The vigorous growth significantly slowed the decline in employment in the manufacturing sector, while inflation was kept at bay."
Indeed, production continued to grow with the association's production index rising sharply in November, to 60.1 percent, compared with 54.3 percent in October.
The association's price index dropped to 41 percent in November, from 44.9 percent in October. It was the lowest level for that index since July 1991, when it stood at 39.8 percent. The report said only three industries reported paying higher prices in November: furniture, apparel and transportation equipment.
The association said employment figures improved in the manufacturing sector with the employment index rising to 48.7 percent in November, from 44.8 in October.

HEADLINE: Yields on Money Market Accounts and C.D.'s Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields offered on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the seven days beginning today are mixed locally and flat to slightly higher outside the New York area, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
The likelihood that rates on deposits will rise significantly anytime soon is remote, said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. "There are those who believe that a rate rise will emanate from the incoming Administration's plans of increased spending, but already there are analyses from the Clinton camp that there will be no quick turnaround for the economy." 
 He added, "With credit restrictions hampering the consumer sector from spending, it may fall on government spending to add the spark."
 
Earlier Impact on Loans
 Analysts say any rise in interest rates will probably affect loan rates before deposits.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, the average discount rates were up for the eighth consecutive week. The auction is often viewed as a sign of how banks might adjust their rates on savings.
The average rate was up slightly for a three-month bill, to 3.31 percent, from 3.27 percent the previous week, while the six-month bill rose a single basis point, to 3.46 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
In the New York area, the combined yield averages for commercial and savings banks, show a money market account down 2 basis points, to 2.75 percent, while three-month and six-month C.D.'s are both 2 basis points higher, to 2.87 percent and 3.02 percent, respectively.
The largest changes this week are at Crossland Savings, which is lowering the average yield on its market account 30 basis points, to 2.75 percent, and at Chase Manhattan, which is raising the yield on its three-month C.D. 20 basis points, to 2.89 percent. At the Republic National Bank, the new yield on a six-month C.D. is 3.30 percent, up 25 basis points.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks are nearly the same as the previous week. The average money market account yield is unchanged at 2.68 percent, while the average six-month certificate of deposit is up a basis point, to 2.99 percent.

Ex-Official Is Named A Director

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Clayton K. Yeutter, the one-time United States trade representative and Agriculture Secretary, today was named to the board of Texas Instruments Inc., the computer chip maker.
A spokeswoman said the Dallas-based company would pay Dr. Yeutter the yearly fee of $40,000 that each of its 14 other directors receives, plus other fees of at least $5,000 or $10,000 for each of various committees on which he might serve. 
 Dr. Yeutter, 61 years old, who was deputy chairman of the Bush-Quayle campaign, led trade talks with the Japanese Government in 1986 that produced an agreement to increase sales of foreign-made semiconductors in Japan, directly benefiting Texas Instruments.
 
Accord on Chip Trade
 Japanese companies dominated the market at the time, and American chip makers had accused them of illegal "dumping" of Japanese memory chips in the United States market, sapping sales and profits of American chip makers. Dumping refers to the practice of selling products in foreign countries at prices below manufacturing costs.
An agreement signed last year by representatives from Tokyo and Washington called for sales of foreign suppliers to reach at least 20 percent of Japan's chip market by the end of this year. Sales penetration by foreign suppliers was 16 percent at the end of June, according to the United States trade representative's office.
Texas Instruments was in 1986 and is still today the largest foreign chip supplier in Japan. "Certainly the dumping goal was achieved, and we did see some improvement in opening Japan's market," said Terri West, a spokeswoman for the company.
Jerry R. Junkins, the chairman and chief executive of Texas Instruments, said Dr. Yeutter's role in the 1986 trade talks had "absolutely nothing" to do with his selection to the Texas Instruments board. Mr. Junkins said Dr. Yeutter, whose other corporate directorships include Conagra Inc. and the Oppenheimer Funds, had been sought as a director because of his diverse background in government and industry.
 
'Value, Strength and Experience'
 Mr. Junkins added that he had worked with Dr. Yeutter on the board of Caterpillar Inc., where Dr. Yeutter once was a director. "I saw firsthand the value, strength and experience he adds," Mr. Junkins said. "His is the type of leadership counsel that we look for in directors."
Dr. Yeutter, who has a Ph.D. in agricultural economics and a law degree, both from the University of Nebraska, expects to rejoin the Caterpillar board next year as well as return to the board of the FMC Corporation.
In addition to being the nation's trade representative, a Cabinet-level post, from 1985 to 1989, Dr. Yeutter was Agriculture Secretary from 1989 to 1991. He was previously president and chief executive of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a senior partner at a law firm in Lincoln, Neb.

Dollar Makes Broad Retreat Despite Signs of Recovery

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday, even though two Government reports showed that the United States economy was picking up.
Gold prices rose. Gold for December delivery finished at $335.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, up 80 cents from Monday's close. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $334.90, up 30 cents from Monday. 
 In New York, the dollar fell to 124.15 Japanese yen late yesterday from 124.695 late Monday. Earlier, in London, the dollar closed at 124.40 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 124.72 yen, from 124.75 yen on Monday.
In New York, the British pound rose to $1.5475, from $1.5165 late Monday. In London, the pound rose to $1.5365, from $1.5140 late Monday.
 
Two Pieces of Good News
 The index of leading economic indicators, the Government's chief economic forecasting gauge, jumped four-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said. And The National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index on manufacturing rose to 55 percent, a big jump from the 50.6 percent level of October.
Curtis Perkins, a currency trader at Chemical Bank, said that the good economic news showed short-term improvement, but that questions remained about future conditions. Traders are waiting for the monthly unemployment report on Friday before making significant moves based on the economy, he said.
Traders also said the dollar was somewhat affected by the German central bank president's renewed vow yesterday that his nation would not cave in to world pressure and ease interest rates until domestic conditions permitted such a move.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.5735 German marks, down from 1.5915; 1.4045 Swiss francs, down from 1.4340; 5.3655 French francs, down from 5.4055; 1,393.00 Italian lire, down from 1,394.00, and 1.28225 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2872.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.5805 German marks, down from 1.5940; 1.4135 Swiss francs, down from 1.4370; 5.3895 French francs, down from 5.4137; 1.7775 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7920; 1,398.50 Italian lire, down from 1,393.50, and 1.2848 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2859.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Seen Widening

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
In parting shots on foreign trade, the Bush Administration today accused China and Taiwan of manipulating their currencies to gain unfair advantage and predicted that a sluggish world economy would send America's trade deficit rising rapidly this year and next.
The Administration's gloomy assessment was that the merchandise trade deficit, which shrank in 1991 to an eight-year low of $65.4 billion, would hit $75 billion this year and exceed $100 billion in 1993. 
 The forecast represented a reversal from a report just six months ago when the Administration was still confidently predicting that the trade deficit, which has been declining for the last three years, would show further improvement.
The new assessment blamed "weaker demand than previously foreseen in Europe and Japan" for the change
The new report said that the problems highlighted six months ago involving China and Taiwan had not been corrected. China's reported currency manipulation comes at a time when the United States trade deficit with that country is soaring rapidly.
Through September, the United States deficit with China was $13.4 billion, second only to America's deficit with Japan of $33.9 billion. The deficit with Taiwan ranked third at $7.6 billion.
Under a 1988 law, the Administration is required to provide Congress with a report on the country's trade prospects and name countries unfairly depressing the value of their currencies.
A weak currency promotes a country's trade performance by making foreign goods more expensive while lowering the price of that country's exports.

HEADLINE: Twice Appreciated When Given Just Once

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
WHILE it has always been possible to give a gift by making a donation to charity, the knowledge that good has been done in one's name may be satisfying only to the truly generous or the materially sated.
Increasingly, though, businesses and organizations are selling products that benefit others by giving a percentage of sales to a political or social cause. A wine maker is contributing money to help save eagles; African elephants are the beneficiaries of some garlic farmers, and sales of chocolates are being used to help preserve the rain forests. 
 Pay heed, though. Some ambitious marketers are sure to exploit this nascent trend by professing to give generously to some worthy cause. Read labels carefully. A vague statement about the company's donations to anonymous environmental groups, for instance, should arouse suspicion. A label that specifies the amount of the donation or at least the name of the beneficiary is much more reassuring. But even then, amounts of donations vary greatly. Some companies give as much as 40 percent of their profits to causes; others give just 1 or 2 percent.
Many of the products sold to produce more than profits are food and personal-care items, and they are more often found in catalogues than in stores. But greater variety is beginning to appear, and non-profit groups are becoming more familiar with marketing.
Some of the groups that raise money for social change, like Oxfam and Cultural Survival, are trying to show that consumers need not benefit to the detriment of producers. They are trying to change the whole wage structure in countries that produce luxuries sent here. They pay producers higher-than-usual wages, or bypass importers and distributors, sending more profit back to those who did the work.
Most of the products sold partly to help produce social change are intended to reach a high level of perfection on several grounds: fair wages for the producer, environmentally safe packaging and materials, and value for the consumer. Some even manage to come close to those goals.
Greenpeace, the environmental group based in Washington, sells a line of clothing made from organically grown cotton without dyes. Profits from its catalogue and its stores in Provincetown, Mass.; Key West, Fla., and San Francisco go to support the group's environmental agenda.
Although ordinary cotton is promoted for its virtue as a natural fiber, half of the pesticides used worldwide are used in growing cotton, said David Leeson, manager of the Greenpeace store in Key West, which like the store in San Francisco carries a large selection of the cotton clothing.
Among his offerings are a one-piece striped outfit for a baby, $25; an adult tank top, $16, and a polo shirt, $37.50. The organic cotton clothes, which are more expensive than their chemically grown counterparts because organic cotton is double the price, can be ordered from his store by calling (305) 296-4442, or from the San Francisco store at (415) 474-1870. The Greenpeace catalogue can be obtained by calling (800)456-4029.
Oxfam, an international organization that tries to promote economic self-sufficiency around the world, has a holiday catalogue with food, clothing, jewelry and household items, many made by artisans in Central and South America. An alpaca cardigan, made in Bolivia of natural undyed wool, comes in one adult size and features a scoop in the front. It is $98.75. The catalogue or merchandise can be ordered at (800) 639-2141.
The Pride Company, a new clothing company in San Francisco, that says it plans to donate some of its profit to gay and lesbian groups, is offering a long white cotton terry robe, made by Martex, available with embroidered gay and lesbian symbols, like the rainbow flag or the pink triangle. It is $75, available from Pride at (800) 568-5880.
Food gifts that offer a dual reward are especially easy to find. Sherry-Lehmann, the wine store at 679 Madison Avenue, near 61st Street, has a line of moderately priced wines called Bald Eagle, made for the company by California winemakers. The 1991 sauvignon blanc is $5.29 a bottle; the 1991 chardonnay is $7.49; and the 1990 cabernet sauvignon is $6.45. A Save the Eagle Sampler of 12 bottles is $76.95. The company sells about 2,000 cases of Bald Eagle wine a year, and in the last two years has contributed "a significant bulk" of the more than $4,000 in a special Bald Eagle fund, said Ronald Dodson, president of the Audubon Society of New York State.
Toucan Chocolates, an assortment of milk and dark chocolate with cashews, brazil nuts and caramel, can be found at many stores nationwide, including Terra Verde Trading Company at 72 Spring Street in SoHo. Some of the proceeds go to Cultural Survival, a Cambridge, Mass., group that tries to help native people around the world remain self-sufficient. The chocolates can also be found in many catalogues, including Seventh Generation, at (800) 456-1177, and the National Wildlife Federation, at (800) 824-3553. A 12-ounce box is $18.95.
Oxfam's Mascao Chocolate, billed as "The Chocolate of Fair Trade," contains cocoa grown by small farmers in Bolivia, sweetened with sugar grown by small farmers in the Philippines, and turned into confections in Switzerland. A package of three four-ounce bars -- milk chocolate, praline and hazelnut -- is $10.50, available at (800) 639-2141.
Cloud Nine sells chocolate bars, and donates 10 percent of its profit to Cultural Survival. A gift set of six bars wrapped in corrugated packaging with a raffia tie is $12.50 and can be ordered from Cultural Survival at (617) 621-3818.
Enviromints are small chocolate squares embossed with the images of endangered animals. One and a half pounds are $14.95, from the National Wildlife Federation at (800) 824-3553. The federation raises 37 percent of its revenue from product sales.
The Harvest coffees from the Thanksgiving Coffee Company are organically grown in Mexico, Peru and Guatemala. For each package sold, the company contributes 15 cents to economic development efforts in those countries. The company also offers its organically grown Coffee for Peace pack: four pounds, either regular or decaffeinated, for $17.95. Orders can be placed at (800) 648-6491.
The Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle donates $2 to Care on each sale of its Care coffee sampler. The money goes to children's programs in Kenya, Guatemala, Sumatra and Java. The four-pound sampler is $18.95 and is available from Starbucks stores, including those in Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Chicago; Los Angeles; San Francisco; San Diego, and Denver, and from the catalogue, (800) 445-3428.
Christopher Ranch in Gilroy, Calif., is giving 5 percent of the sales of its elephant garlic to Wildlife Conservation International's effort to publicize the plight of the endangered African elephant. Elephant garlic has larger, milder cloves than the more commonly available type. In the last six months, the ranch has raised $10,000 with its garlic sales. The garlic, which sells for $1.99 to $2.99 for a large bulb, can be found at many supermarkets nationwide, including A.& P., Lucky, Safeway and Pathmark.
The non-endangered animal in your life can chow down on Moon Over Vermont All Natural Dog Biscuits, made by Applebrook Farms of Westford, Vt., and available through Cultural Survival, which gets part of the proceeds, at (617) 621-3818. Also benefiting Cultural Survival, and available from the group, is a Rainforest fruit and nut mix for humans to munch, $8.95 for a 12-ounce can.
Community Products Inc. in Montpelier, Vt., a company started by Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream to help create social change, offers a line of snacks called Rainforest Crunch that are available in many catalogues and stores, packaged in colorful tins. Included in the line are chocolate chip cookies, popcorn, and nut crunch. The profits are used to help make the rain forests sustainable through activities like nut harvesting rather than cutting and burning for transformation into plantations and ranches. The products can be ordered at (800) 927-2695 or through many catalogues, including Seventh Generation, at (800) 456-1177.
Another rain-forest company focuses on the pleasures of the skin rather than the tastebuds. Rainforest Essentials Ltd., which contributes 40 percent of its profits to Cultural Survival, makes a line of soaps and personal-care products. A bar of green soap, made from aloe vera and from oils from the copaiba tree in the Amazon rain forest, has a subtle, fresh smell; three four-ounce bars are $11.95. The company, which also offers gift packs with shampoo and body lotion, sells its products at retailers like Macy's in New York and California, some Nordstrom stores, Terra Verde in New York and the Nature Company, and through catalogues like Seventh Generation.
Cookbooks have often been used to raise money for various groups. A good Hanukkah gift for anyone trying to update traditional cuisine would be "California Kosher," put out by the Women's League of Adat Ari El Synagogue in North Hollywood, Calif. It is $19.95, not including postage and handling, from the Women's League at 12020 Burbank Boulevard, North Hollywood, Calif. 91607.
Sales of the "Native Indian Wild Game Fish and Wild Foods Cookbook," published by Fox Chapel Publishing in Lancaster, Pa., benefit the Indian women who contributed to the book. The book, which includes recipes like Black Walnut Souffle, Indian Fry Bread and Clover Soup, is $19.95 from Fox Chapel at (800) 457-9112. The same publisher offers "Treasured Mennonite Recipes," and the royalties go to the Mennonite Central Committee's projects in third world countries. It is $11.95.
A calendar with the recipes of well-known American chefs is being offered by Share Our Strength, a hunger-relief organization in Washington, founded by people in the food business. The calendar, which benefits the group, costs $10 and is available in many bookstores and gift shops, or by calling Share Our Strength at (800) 222-1767.
For children, Share Our Strength is selling a book called "Home," a collaboration of 30 authors and illustrators of children's books who have produced short stories and poems that center on feelings about home. It is $16, in bookstores nationwide.
Children can get a variety of art supplies, and a way to organize them, with the Chock Full Color Box, $19.95, a colorful jungle-motif box filled with water colors, pastels, brushes, coloring pencils, markers, a sharpener and stickers. It is sold through the Company of Women catalogue, which was started both to promote businesses owned by women and to raise money for the Rockland Family Shelter, an agency in Rockland County, New York, that serves victims of domestic violence or rape, and the homeless. To order: (800) 937-1193.
For bird-watching or just careful inspection, the National Wildlife Federation offers binoculars for children, in two sizes: one, for children 3 years old and older, for $12.95, and another, for children 7 and older, for $13.95. They have unbreakable plastic lenses and bodies. The federation also sells a fabric globe that when turned inside out reveals a fuzzy little elephant. The globe elephant, $19.95, benefits the federation, and also comes with a pledge from its manufacturer that 25 square feet of endangered rain forest in Costa Rica will be preserved and protected. Available from the National Wildlife Federation at (800) 822-9919.
For around the house, lightweight, natural beeswax candles are made by homeless men and women at A Candle in the Window, an organization in New York that provides jobs for the homeless. The candles, $6.50 for two or $13 for four, are sold at Body Shop stores throughout the country, or through its catalogue at (800) 541-2535. From Oxfam is a basket made in Zambia, woven from a root, patterned in earth tones. Suited for holding anything from mail to dinner rolls, it is $63 from Oxfam, at (800) 639-2141.
The lives of women are captured in the 50 songs included in "Great Ladies of Song," a two-tape or compact disk collection from the Company of Women that includes original pop hits by Peggy Lee, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday and others. It's $29.95 on CD, or $18.95 on tape, at (800) 937-1193.
Finally, from the Company of Women, for $4.75, is a small refrigerator magnet with a big sentiment: a reproduction of the Rosie the Riveter poster used during World War II, and the message "We Can Do It!"

HEADLINE: Kentucky Chickens With Je Ne Sais Quoi

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Ky.

 BODY:
FOR the last year or so, flocks of French chickens have been pecking and scratching their way from the gentle hills of southern Kentucky to some fine dinner tables. They are the only French chickens being raised commercially in this country.
It was the doggedness of David Wilson, a former squab farmer, that brought these chickens here. Mr. Wilson, whose easy bluegrass twang is peppered with phrases like "raison d'etre," became intrigued with French chickens nearly five years ago after some of the chefs who were buying his squabs kept telling him how good they were. 
 "I went to France and also to England to see what this was all about," he said. "I came back very impressed with what they were doing."
After a trip to Europe in 1988 he tried raising American chickens a la Francaise for about a year and a half but was not satisfied with the results. "American chickens are bred for their breast meat, so they look like small turkeys," he said. "They don't have the flavor and texture of French chickens."
So now he is importing French chickens, which are being raised with plenty of room to run around outdoors. They are not fed antibiotics or other chemicals, nor are their beaks and claws clipped. The day-old chicks land first in Quebec, where they spend four weeks in quarantine before they are allowed to cross the American border.
"You really have to want to do this," Mr. Wilson said. "Our poultry industry has wisely set up barriers to protect against disease and also for economic reasons. We were fortunate to find a quarantine facility in Canada that we could work with."
Wilson Fields, the company based in Louisville that Mr. Wilson organized with a group of investors, brings in 4,500 hybrid Breton chickens every 18 weeks. Mr. Wilson explained that livestock breeding must be very carefully controlled, which is why he continues to import the chicks instead of simply breeding his own.
"The breeding part is best left to the experts," he said. "We are bringing in the parent flocks and we sell the chickens we grow from their eggs." Each flock can breed for 40 weeks, producing up to 700,000 chickens, or about 17,000 chickens a week. Currently, 60 percent of the chickens are sold in Canada, with the rest going to restaurants and supermarkets, mainly in Kentucky.
These chickens require 66 days to reach market weight of about three-and-a-half pounds dressed, compared with 39 to 42 days for American chickens. The difference is due to the breed and their diet of corn and wheat, which contains no growth-inducing drugs.
The Wilson Fields flocks are distributed among 17 farmers in the southern part of the state near Bowling Green who had been raising industrial chickens. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture played matchmaker between the farmers and Wilson Fields.
It appears to be a very happy marriage, said Leon and Laverne Kessler of Exie, whose farm just happens to be off Fry Ridge Road.
"We've been in the chicken business for 30 years," Mrs. Kessler said. "I like doing this, with 2,000 birds in a barn and letting them run outside, much better than having 13,000 inside all the time with the ammonia odor. We used to have six fans running all the time, and now we only need two, so it uses less energy."
When the doors to the Quonset hut-style barn opened, the mostly white chickens milled around outside, some pecking at gravel, others venturing out into the carefully fenced green meadow beyond.
"There is enough room at each farm to give every chicken two square meters of space," said Missy Camp, vice president of the company. "That's the minimum standard the French allow for free range. There are very few farms in this country that comply with that."
The Kesslers also have a small flock of handsome black chickens called acco noir, also from France, and some purebred brown Breton chickens. These take 81 days to reach market weight and are being raised on a very limited basis.
Not only is Mr. Wilson breaking new ground when it comes to raising chickens in the United States; his new federally inspected processing plant here, about 50 miles east of Bowling Green, also operates differently from any other plant in the country.
The chickens are first anesthetized with carbon dioxide before killing, which Wilson Fields says relaxes them and improves their texture. The birds are briefly scalded three times in progressively cleaner water to facilitate the removal of the feathers. This process is said to minimize bacterial contamination, compared with the usual single scalding.
The United States Department of Agriculture requires that the internal temperature of chickens be cooled to 38 degrees in no more than 16 hours after slaughtering, to prevent deterioration. The quickest method is to plunge the birds into cold water, which reduces the temperature sufficiently in less than an hour. But there is the potential for bacterial contamination, even in cold water.
At Wilson Fields, the chickens are placed on V-shaped racks for two hours in a room with circulating chilled air. The racks prevent the chickens from resting in any fluids. As a result, there is almost no excess moisture when a package is opened.
What Mr. Wilson is doing seems to be worth the effort. The chicken is extremely flavorful, with a succulence unmatched by the typical American chicken. Tests at the University of Kentucky have shown that the chickens have thinner skins, less exterior fat and juicier flesh than standard American chickens.
The chickens, labeled Wilson Fields la Belle Rouge (brown chickens are called reds in the industry), are mostly sold whole, trussed for roasting and without giblets, and mostly to restaurants. The chickens are also sold at a few Kroger stores in the Louisville area for $2.69 a pound; typical commercial chickens are less than a dollar a pound.
Some chefs who are using the chickens include Kathy Cary, who owns La Peche and Lilly's in Louisville, Mark Militello of Mark's Place in Miami and Dean Fearing of the Mansion at Turtle Creek in Dallas. "You can even tell the difference in a chicken pot pie," Ms. Cary said.

HEADLINE: With New Food Marriages, People Who Hate Decisions Never Have to Make Them

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
AND now, for the generation that begs for choices but hates to choose, here's Mix-In Cuisine.
There is ice cream with candy mixed in. Cookies with ice cream sandwiched between them. Chocolate bars with cookies crumbled in them. A cheese spread with jalapenos and corn chips mixed in. At grocery stores in Columbus, Ohio, one of the nation's test-market capitals, familiar snacks, desserts and convenience products have been nudged aside by a new generation of packaged foods that combine several products or even well-known brand names, like Hershey's chocolate pudding with York Peppermint Patties mixed in. 
 Food purists may wring their hands as individual flavors are melded, blended and merged. But those stymied by choice can put aside the Prozac and let their local supermarket soothe at least one conflict of modern life: choosing between discrete forms of edible indulgence.
For those loath to commit even to something as simple as corn flakes or Rice Krispies, Kellogg's offers Cris pix, cereal puffs that have corn on one side and rice on the other.
Those torn between meat and cheese can make sandwiches with Hormel's pepperoni-flecked cheese slices.
In the brave new world of have-it-your-way packaged food, one need not suffer a moment's indecision between fruit juices. Not when Dole has created Pine-Passion-Banana juice, when Chiquita has blended kiwi, plum, strawberry and grape juices in its Calypso Blend, and when Ocean Spray has combined all manner of exotic fruits with its cranberry juice.
"Products like these make avoiding decisions a virtue," said Art Siemering, the publisher of the Food Channel, a newsletter that tracks trends in the food industry. "You don't have to choose. You don't have to worry about what you might be missing. You can have it all."
At least that's what food manufacturers hope.
"Whenever profits are down, companies scramble to expand the equity in their brand names," said Dr. Susan Strasser, the author of "Satisfaction Guaranteed" (Pantheon, 1987), a history of marketing in America. The classic example is Arm & Hammer baking soda's move from the pantry shelf to the back of the refrigerator when it was marketed as an odor absorber. And now Knox gelatin is being used to fortify Strong Nail Cutex, a nail-polish remover.
And the gelatin market has diversified in edible areas, too. In the custardy netherworld where the impulse to eat something healthful competes with the urge to indulge in something sweet, Jell-O puddings now compete with similarly packaged yogurts, as well as puddings made by Hershey (with flavors ranging from Kisses to Chocolate Almond, along with the York Peppermint Pattie).
Dr. Strasser said the current recession had fueled a frenzied brand-name parthenogenesis of late. In addition to its puddings, Hershey has introduced Hershey's Cookies 'n' Mint, the first permutation of its classic milk-chocolate bar since almonds were added nearly a century ago. The bar, which is mildly flavored with mint and riddled with crunchy bits of dark chocolate cookies, "is Hershey's way of making sure customers don't stray," Dr. Strasser added.
"If they can sate the cookie and candy impulse in one package, they insure that Hershey's makes the money, not Keebler," she said.
George Rosenbaum, the president of Leo J. Shapiro, a market-research group in Chicago, acknowledges the economic sense of broadening brand appeal but said that the mix-in phenomenon was the second stage of a response to a shifting psychosocial market. Initially, he said, "radical dietary changes were authenticated for health reasons, and that forced some brands to update the equity in their names."
In a fat-fearing world, is it any surprise then that Land O Lakes butter and Skippy peanut butter will lend their names to cookies?
Facing similarly lean times, the alcoholic-beverage industry has responded with shelves of premixed offerings that range from Seagram's Gin & Juice to Bacardi's rum-and-fruit-juice Breezers and Jack Daniel's Lynchburg Limeade and Downhome Punch.
"Facing the fact that they have well-known names whose original products are not necessarily popular with the current generation," Mr. Shapiro said, "these brands either expanded into a market where indulgence is a given, tried to take on the trappings of healthfulness or looked to supply convenience."
What's more, he said, profits from processed food products, including all the mix-ins, are up to 20 percent higher than they are for individual ingredients, because companies charge more for them.
Merging brand names and updating images, Mr. Shapiro said, have long been ways of protecting a given market. But the mix-in phenomenon is something new. And most marketers agree that the idea has generational appeal.
The indecisiveness and self-indulgence that have long characterized the baby-boom generation led to a "profound willingness to reinvent and recombine foods," Mr. Shapiro said. They became even more adventuresome, he added, when faced with the strictures of health concerns.
Dr. Strasser calls the same appetite "the insatiable urge for new." This appetite is driven by a sense of adventure and a taste for variety. But even more, the mix-in market craves individual attention, the accommodation of idiosyncratic or bizarre tastes.
The mix-in concept was pioneered two decades ago by Steve Herrell, who founded Steve's Homemade Ice Cream in Somerville, Mass. There, customers routinely waited in line for 30 minutes for custom-blended ice-cream toppings. One customer would order Heath bars crumbled into coffee ice cream. Another would ask that Oreo cookies be smushed into vanilla-bean ice cream. Another wanted M & M's and cookies worked in.
Like the $7 manicures that began appearing around the same time, the $3.50 customized ice-cream cone was an affordable indulgence. More important, as the servers at Steve's scooped and blended ice cream and mix-ins on their marble counters, the customer also had the sense of being mogul-for-the-moment or at least king-of-the-cone.
"As soon as Steve's and Ben & Jerry's started making inroads in supermarkets, we started to see mix-ins moving into candies, other desserts and salty snacks," said Lynn Dornblazer, the publisher of New Product News in Chicago, a magazine for the grocery industry. "Now we are seeing yogurt packaged with granola to mix in and mix-in entrees."
Mr. Siemering of the Food Channel predicts these offerings are just the beginning. Customers, he said, "are crazed for variety, but they don't want to choose." He predicted that mix-ins would be the driving force of new grocery products in the next few years.
Call it the succotashing of cuisine.
"Girl Scout cookies in candy!" gasped 17-year-old Rita O'Leary, a high school student in Columbus, when she spotted a six pack of Hershey's Cookies 'n' Mint on the shelves of a local Kroger supermarket.
Through its spokeswoman, Bonnie Hinkson, Hershey denied any such inspiration. "We were simply looking for a new taste and texture to put in the familiar bar form," she said.

Pay Dips at Hot Corner, Second Base and Outfield

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Not everyone who plays major league baseball is making more money than ever. According to salary information given to the Players Association executive board at its meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., yesterday, the average salaries of shortstops, third basemen and outfielders decreased this year. Not since 1987 have so many positions lost money.
The overall 1992 major league average soared, rising 20.8 percent to $1,028,667, the first time the average reached $1 million. Fourteen clubs averaged more than $1 million compared with eight last year. 
 The union average, as usual, was higher than the average computed by the Player Relations Committee for the clubs. The two sides figure certain parts of players' salaries differently. The clubs' average is $1,012,424, a 19.8 percent increase.
 
Averages Are Slipping
 The P.R.C. computed the median salary at $392,500, meaning half of the 772 players on major league rosters or disabled lists Aug. 31 earned more than that figure and half earned less.
The 18 shortstops who played 100 or more games (the union's qualifying level) saw their average drop from $1,146,403 to $1,142,552; the average for 21 third basemen fell from $1,151,853 to $1,056,778 and 63 outfielders had their average slip from $1,523,408 to $1,517,606.
In the previous four seasons, only two position groups had their average salaries decrease, but in 1987, shortstops and third basemen were the only ones whose averages didn't drop.
The highest-paid position this year was designated hitter, $2,415,591; relief pitcher the lowest, $853,096, the only one not at $1 million.
Toronto, seventh last season, was No. 1 in the team salary standing, supplanting Oakland. Atlanta took the largest economic leap, rocketing from 19th ($686,340) to 6th ($1,280,689) in the players' computations, an 86.6 percent increase.
The Cleveland Indians produced the steepest plunge, 26.8 percent, from $446,250 to $326,537.

HEADLINE: George Bush's Unfinished Business

 BODY:
Though President Bush may be brooding about his defeat, rewarding work awaits him in his final weeks. One major priority is to complete a task nobly begun -- disarming the nuclear-armed republics of the former Soviet Union.
He will have powerful allies should he decide to finish that task. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar recently went to Moscow and Kiev to move the disarmament deal along. But the job can't be done without the President's help. And it ought not to wait until Bill Clinton takes office. 
 There are two objectives to meet. One is an agreement on deeper cuts in Russian and U.S. nuclear arms. The other is persuading Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty and dismantle their weapons.
The original Start treaty would have reduced Russian and American warheads to about 7,000 apiece. But an agreement reached in June would lower the ceiling on warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 each, and ban multi-warhead missiles on land.
Russia has finally responded to a U.S. draft treaty codifying the June agreement. Moscow has said it will seek changes to allow it to reduce the number of warheads on its missiles, thus avoiding the costs of building new single-warhead missiles and silos to shelter them. Washington can afford to be accommodating if it can verify the changes Moscow is proposing.
Actual disarming could be held up by Ukraine, which has yet to ratify the Start treaty and sign the Nonproliferation Treaty, as it promised. It has also been threatening to hold onto its 176 multi-warhead missiles unless it gets adequate compensation and some form of security guarantee.
Mr. Nunn and Mr. Lugar suggested useful ways to meet Kiev's demands. Under their plan, the U.S. would foot the bill for dismantling Ukrainian missiles and pay its share for the uranium extracted from warheads now in Ukraine. The two Senators also want Russia and the U.S. to cooperate in extending reasonable security assurances to Ukraine.
But they rightly warn that Ukraine risks political and economic isolation if it fails to carry out its nuclear pledges.
Now it's up to Mr. Bush to close the deals with Russia and the other nuclear republics. He could leave no finer legacy than to complete the task he has begun -- diminishing the nuclear danger.

ROBERT KOTLOWITZ, former senior vice president and director of programming and broadcasting at WNET, Channel 13 in New York, has been named to a senior fellowship at the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center at Columbia University. Mr. Kotlowitz, who is now an editorial adviser at WNET, will use the fellowship to work on a book analyzing the impact of public broadcasting and will join the program, an independent affiliate of Columbia University, in January.
"For me it is a chance after many years at the station to step aside and look at what has happened in two decades," he said. "There is a powerful feeling that it has a constituency that has grown over the years and that does not really share economic and cultural values but is spread throughout the population. The common denominator is curiosity. I want to see how true that is and what it means." 
 Other 1992-93 fellows at the center include TERRY ANDERSON, the former hostage and Associated Press Middle East correspondent, and JAMES HOGE, the former publisher of The Daily News in New York. The Freedom Forum Media Studies Center was established in 1984 as a center for the study of mass communication and technological change.

HEADLINE: Europe's Doldrums;
Disputes Are Stalling the Search for Union -- Will Talks Next Week Get It Restarted?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
A year after optimistically setting course for monetary union later in the decade, the 12-nation European Community is riven by economic, monetary and political divisions, raising doubts whether it will ever become anything more than the single trading market due to take effect Jan. 1.
Instead of crowning that achievement by starting to carry out the ambitious treaty on currency union and closer foreign policy cooperation they agreed to a year ago in the Dutch city of Maastricht, the Europeans find themselves being driven apart. 
 A spreading and deepening recession, and the resulting political strains, have made French, German, Italian and British leaders all deeply unpopular.
Cutbacks in the generous social and labor benefits that many Europeans came to expect during the sheltered years of the cold war are increasing their leaders' unpopularity even further.
[Not all developments affecting European cohesion are negative, though. In Berlin Wednesday, the lower house of the German Parliament voted to ratify the Maastricht treaty, a step that Chancellor Helmut Kohl hopes will make it easier for Denmark, a dissenter in its first treaty referendum in June, to reconsider and accept the accord in 1993. Page A12.]
The next opportunity to chart a course out of the morass will come when European leaders gather in Edinburgh on Dec. 11-12, but even on such a basic community issue as trade they have been at odds, with France threatening to veto an agreement to reduce agricultural subsidies that is the prerequisite for a new global trade accord.
"The mood in all of Central Europe is that the world is collapsing all around it," a senior Western official commented in Vienna the other day. "All the political leaders seem to be at the end of the cycle, and all the major countries are in a period of economic decline. The result has been a crucial collapse of political credibility in Western Europe."
 
Europe's Biggest Failure
 Many Europeans look eagerly to President-elect Bill Clinton's administration to provide American leadership in coping with the social and political chaos that took them by surprise after the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The war in the Balkans is seen as the biggest European failure, with the European Community no more able to agree on effective measures to halt or deter Serbian aggression than the American-led NATO alliance. Instead of the common defense policy they aimed for in the Maastricht treaty, the European countries cannot even agree to send troops to trouble spots like Bosnia and Herzegovina or Somalia, with the Germans arguing that their Constitution forbids it.
European leaders say they remain committed to the treaty and to its principle of closer economic and political cooperation, but with a Danish rejection now standing, the treaty's future is unclear.
Even if it is finally ratified by all 12 countries and goes into effect, its major provisions for a common currency by 1999 and broader welfare and social benefits in most countries now seem destined to remain dead letters in the face of economic penury everywhere, officials from most of the major countries privately concede. All that seems certain now is the creation of a single European market on Jan. 1 that will allow the free flow of goods, services and capital.
Two weeks before the Edinburgh meeting, the 12 have not even been able to agree on a financial package for a modest redistribution of wealth among themselves that they agreed on a year ago, with richer Northern European countries like Germany and Britain now pleading that budget difficulties make it hard for them to make big sacrifices for poorer neighbors like Greece, Spain and Ireland.
Nor is the pessimism just over economic issues. At a thronged Thanksgiving Day service at St. Paul's Cathedral, the United States Ambassador to Britain, Raymond G. H. Seitz, said: "In these days of historic change, we should remember that peace is not the natural order of things. It is an act of political will."
The longest era of stability in Europe this century ended three years ago when the Berlin wall came down and Communism began to collapse in the rest of eastern Europe.
Until then, the Western Europeans, safely protected from the threat of Soviet aggression by the American security umbrella, built a community of rich and prosperous welfare states.
Now, with the cold war behind them and unity before them, many countries are acting as if nothing really needed to change. Even in Germany, which absorbed 16.5 million people from the formerly Communist eastern part of the country in the 1990 reunification, well-off burghers from the west do not see why they should help their eastern cousins by giving up any of the generous benefits they became used to during the cold war.
Eastern German politicians like Wolfgang Thierse, an opposition Social Democrat, keep saying that real sacrifice, not just belt-tightening, will be required to make unification work smoothly, but nobody has yet started to pay real attention.
 
Financial System in Chaos
 Heavy German borrowing unleashed inflation, and the German central bank jerked up interest rates, sending chaos through the European financial system just as most countries were sinking into recession.
With the Maastricht treaty, they tried to move closer to economic and political union anyway, agreeing to establish a common currency as early as 1997. The economic strains and uncertainty about whether the French would reject the treaty in a referendum in September became too much for the European monetary system to handle.
Italy and Britain were forced to pull out, and Spain has twice had to devalue, despite the narrow French approval of the treaty in the referendum. Now new political uncertainty caused by the threat of a French veto over a new global tariff and trade agreement is putting pressure on the French franc and causing some to have second thoughts about the viability of the whole European monetary system.
"Most of the Maastricht provisions will clearly never happen," a British official said. German central bankers agree that a single European currency is an unrealistic prospect as long as European economies are as far apart as they are now. Things are likely to get worse, they say, as Germany, too, enters recession.
The first six months of next year threaten to be even more chaotic, with the trade talks unlikely to have been completed and the presidency of the European Community going to the Danes on Jan. 1 before they have even decided whether to be part of the Maastricht process.
The community decided this year that negotiations on letting Austria, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and possibly Switzerland become members could begin only after the Maastricht treaty had been ratified by all 12 existing members. The Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, said in Vienna last week that he hoped talks could begin anyway in January even though ratification will not be complete.
An aide to Prime Minister John Major of Britain said here, "We'd like to get agreement at Edinburgh to start negotiations on expansion in January, but we don't think we'll get it."
Delay on letting in these prosperous would-be members, in turn, puts off the day when new democracies will even be allowed to apply.
But giving the Eastern Europeans, the Russians, the Ukrainians and other former Soviet lands hope for the future is seen as a crucial challenge. Germany, which is closest to the social and economic turmoil and the first stop for refugees, is increasingly anxious and deeply unsettled, with a deadly neo-Nazi backlash against the arrival of about a million asylum-seekers over the last three years.
The Austrian Defense Minister, Werner Fasslabend, sounded the alarm in Vienna this month about a "zone of instability like nothing in the past hundred years" that extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Despite Austria's usual neutrality, he said, the country could join the defense arm of the European Community, the Western European Union, if it became a member.
This organization, foreseen as the nucleus of a common European defense, is now enforcing naval sanctions against Serbia in the Adriatic Sea and recently admitted Greece as its 10th member. NATO countries, most of whose European members also belong to the Western European Union, have also provided troops and military equipment to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Balkans.
But as Col. Andrew Duncan of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London said, "NATO has no desire to become a supranational peacekeeping force." And instability in Central Europe seems a lot less threatening and more distant from London than it does from Bonn or Berlin.
"It doesn't actually affect the lives of any country more than one country away from it," he said. As long as the turmoil seemed safely at arm's length from most Western countries, they would be unlikely to become any more involved in trying to halt it than they were in Yugoslavia.
"We have no deterrence to that sort of conflict because nobody's prepared to do anything about it," Colonel Duncan said.
The only way this would change is if the United States took the lead. Some American diplomats in Europe think it should. "We have a choice like the one we had in 1946 and 1947," one said. "That was a postwar situation; this is a postwar situation. If we just sit back and let them fight it out, Europe is going to turn into a big problem for us."
Others are not so sure. The only thing everybody agrees on is that Europe is not likely to provide the Clinton Administration with a foreign policy holiday.

HEADLINE: INSURERS, IN SHIFT, ASK U.S. TO REQUIRE COVERAGE FOR ALL

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
In a sharp break from past practice, the health insurance industry called today for a new Federal law that would require coverage for all Americans, define a basic set of benefits and try to contain health-care costs by limiting tax breaks for the purchase of insurance.
The board of directors of the Health Insurance Association of America, representing 270 commercial insurers, adopted a policy statement today declaring that "the insurance industry itself needs reform." 
 The industry has often been described as an obstacle to change in the nation's health-care system. But with the new proposal, to be announced Thursday, the industry signals its willingness to accept sweeping changes, many of them similar to those proposed by President-elect Bill Clinton.
 
Details to Be Worked Out
 Details of the insurers' proposal remain to be worked out. Many of the unresolved issues are contentious. But Democrats and Republicans as well as business executives and labor unions agree that the nation must do something to help the 35 million people who do not have health insurance.
In a separate action today, the association adopted a policy stating that the health insurance industry would treat AIDS like any other physical illness. Current practice varies; some insurers have tried to avoid paying claims for AIDS and related illnesses.
Carl J. Schramm, president of the association, said the health benefits proposal was in the long-term financial interest of insurance companies. For more than a year, the insurers have been denouncing proposals for a Government-run program of national health insurance that would minimize the role of private insurers.
 
'Enlightened Self-Interest'
 "This is probably the only way you preserve the private health insurance industry," Mr. Schramm said. "It's plain-out enlightened self-interest."
The insurers, like Mr. Clinton, endorsed the idea of universal coverage, mandated by Federal law, along with new measures to control costs, including a larger role for the Government in supervising fees charged by doctors and hospitals. But the insurers did not support Mr. Clinton's proposal for an annual limit on all health spending, public and private.
The Health Insurance Association is one of many business groups that have offered to cooperate with Mr. Clinton since his election. Many of these groups previously opposed overhauling the health-care system but now say they see major changes as inevitable and want to help shape the results to their liking.
Ian M. Rolland, chairman of the board of directors of the association and chief executive of the Lincoln National Corporation, in Fort Wayne, Ind., said the new proposal was "radically different from positions taken by the industry in the past."
In Little Rock, Ark., Judith Feder, health policy coordinator for the Clinton transition team, welcomed the new proposal and described it as "a major turnaround" for members of the health insurance industry.
"It suggests they are willing to participate in the process of health-care reform," she said. "They seem to be demonstrating a commitment to universal coverage and cost containment, which we've not seen before."
The insurers' proposal may help break a logjam that has blocked Congressional action on comprehensive health legislation for the last two years. Dozens of bills died earlier this year amid partisan squabbling in the election campaign.
In announcing his candidacy on Oct. 3, 1991, Mr. Clinton said he would "take on the big insurance companies" in an effort to control health costs. He repeated that vow hundreds of times in the campaign.
The insurers' new position, unlike the old one, would require health insurance coverage for all Americans and limit the amount of tax-free health benefits that employees could get from their employers.
The proposal would require employees to pay a tax on the value of health insurance exceeding the standard package of benefits. This proposal is noteworthy because companies rarely propose a new tax on their own goods and services. Revenue from the health insurance tax would be used to help finance additional coverage for poor people, fewer than half of whom are now covered by Medicaid.
 
Four Main Elements
 The industry's new proposal, set forth in a discussion paper adopted unanimously today by the board of the association, is incomplete. But the proposal has these four main elements:
*Through unspecified tax incentives for employers and tax penalties for consumers who do not purchase insurance, the Government would require all Americans to buy "an essential package" of health benefits. If the Government fails to achieve universal coverage in this way, then "it may become necessary to require employers to help finance such coverage," the insurance industry said. Most big companies already provide health benefits to employees, but 30 million workers and dependents have no coverage.
*The Government would help define the essential package of benefits. The package, though not described in detail, would go beyond minimum benefits and would meet "most of the needs of Americans" for doctors' services and hospital care. Private insurers would agree to provide the standard coverage, regardless of a person's medical history.
*The open-ended Federal subsidy for health insurance would be curtailed. If employers bought insurance covering more than the essential package of benefits for their employees, the premiums paid for that extra coverage would be treated as income to the employees, and they would have to pay income tax on it. The core benefits would still be tax-free. Under current law, none of the employer-provided health benefits are taxable. Economists say these tax breaks contribute to the costly overuse of health care, by encouraging companies to overinsure their employees.
*The Government would work with insurers and providers of care to reduce the immense variation in payments to doctors and hospitals. Private insurers and Government programs would eventually have to pay similar amounts for the same services in the same geographic area. Medicaid and Medicare, the programs for poor people and the elderly, now usually pay less than private insurers.
Mr. Schramm said this recommendation "represents a sea change because it implies that insurers are willing to consider a larger role for Government in overseeing the prices charged by doctors and hospitals."
 
Shift Costs
 The Health Insurance Association said the standard rates would help stabilize health-care prices and would prevent the Government from shifting costs to patients with private insurance.
The insurers are eager to promote competition in the health-care market, but recognize that a decade of competition has not restrained the growth in medical prices, now rising twice as fast as other consumer prices. The association has not decided on the proper balance between regulation and free-market competition, one of the most delicate issues in any plan to revamp the health-care system.
The Federal Government has already established fee schedules for doctors and hospitals under Medicare, and some private insurers have begun to use similar price lists.
In January, President Bush seriously considered taxing a portion of the health benefits received by some workers. But he abandoned the idea after Republican members of Congress warned him that such a tax would cause a political uproar on Capitol Hill. The commercial insurance industry is now offering a similar proposal.
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, chairman of the National Governors' Association, said Tuesday that governors wanted to limit the tax deductions that employers could take for the cost of providing health benefits to workers. At present, there is no limit on such deductions.
The new proposal, describing the insurers' vision for the next decade, was drafted by a committee of the Health Insurance Association headed by G. David Hurd, chief executive of the Principal Financial Group, in Des Moines. Mr. Hurd endorsed Mr. Clinton in September, saying the Democratic candidate "will take a progressive view of national health care reform" while preserving a big role for private insurance.
The association began developing the new policy in February. The board took straw votes on it in September, two months before the Presidential election.
"This policy has been in the works for a long time," Mr. Schramm said. "We would have taken these positions whether Bill Clinton won or not."
In an interview, Mr. Rolland, the chairman of the Health Insurance Association, said: "There is a general recognition within the industry that we had an image problem and needed to address it. The desire to be regarded more favorably by the public has led to a lot more receptivity to change. We recognize that there will be significant change and that defense of the status quo is just not a viable strategy."
Under its plan, the association said, "no one would have to worry about losing insurance coverage because of bad health or switching jobs."
The package of essential benefits would be the same for rich and poor alike. But people could buy additional coverage to supplement the package, just as many elderly people buy private insurance to fill gaps in Medicare.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Proposals"
 
Universal coverage. Through tax incentives and penalties, the Government would require that Americans have health insurance.
 
Essential benefits. The Government would help define "an essential package of benefits." Insurers would provide coverage, regardless of a person's medical history.
 
Insurance tax. To hold down costs, the Government would limit tax-free health benefits.
 
Cost control. Private insurers, Medicare and Medicaid would eventually pay similar amounts for the same services in the same geographic area.

HEADLINE: Resort (Not Too African) for Rich Tourists

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUN CITY, South Africa

 BODY:
You are in Africa, but in no particular place.
The drizzling rain forest says the latitude is tropical. But that grove of pendulous baobab trees, still adjusting to their new home just across the lagoon-sized swimming pool, implies savannah. The architecture is neither Luxor nor Marrakesh nor Kalahari game lodge, but something of each, only more so. You are a bit lost. 
 You are, in fact, in the Lost City, the most audacious and most deafeningly hyped theme resort in the Southern hemisphere, at least.
 
Crocodiles at the 13th Hole
 This is Africa as it might have been had Steven Spielberg and Donald Trump conspired to reinvent the continent for a clientele of wealthy sheiks: a drought-proof, disease-free, nonviolent and nondenominational, $210-a-night-and-up Africa with a three-story water slide, an ocean where a panic button stops the waves if a swimmer gets in trouble, a nightly volcanic eruption (featuring "non-allergenic smoke"), a golf course with live crocodiles in the 13th-hole water hazard.
And -- because history in Africa is so troublesome -- the resort has its own myth, involving a peaceloving, rich, environmentally correct and watersport-loving tribe of founders known as the Ancients.
 
Casino Impresario's Vision
 The Lost City, which opened this week, is the brainstorm of a son of immigrants from Russia who has made a fortune peddling high-priced fancies to South Africans, and who now, with the political awakening of the region, intends to peddle them to the globe.
It is a $300 million gamble that when white rule gives way to democracy in South Africa, tourists will storm the subcontinent in a spending frenzy, and that they will want to experience Africa, as long as it is not too -- African.
"I believe that people aren't going to travel all the way to visit us here in South Africa to see what they could see elsewhere in the world," said Sol Kerzner, the South African hotel and casino impresario, musing over his 62-acre fantasy from a veranda of its hotel, the Palace, a colossal, snicker-defying cathedral of blushing towers and blue domes, elephant tusks and kudu gargoyles and thousands of individually pre-cast concrete palm fronds.
"And consequently I began to visualize ----"
The developer clicked his silver worry beads, recalling his vision, now executed here with the aid of a California architect and a Texas design team.
 
Sun City's Neighbor
 "I saw a major African jungle with rivers, with waterfalls, with what you would expect in a jungle, and that the concept would revolve around that, and the animals of Africa," he said.
This white man's fantasy of Africa is 100 miles northwest of Johannesburg, within another white man's fantasy of Africa -- Bophuthatswana, one of four nominally independent tribal homelands invented by South Africa's racial scientists in the apartheid heyday as repositories for unwanted blacks.
Bophuthatswana's independence is not taken seriously by any country except South Africa, or, for that matter, by those of its citizens who are not on the payroll of its authoritarian ruler.
Thirteen years ago, when this homeland was still newly minted, Mr. Kerzner built here the Las Vegas-style Sun City complex as a place where South Africans could escape the Puritan constraints of their own society to enjoy gambling and bare-breasted chorus lines in an interracial setting. It, and Lost City, are two hours' drive from Johannesburg.
 
Politics Becomes Tricky
 The apartheid fiction of the independent black homelands has been an asset to Mr. Kerzner's casino empire, which also has resorts in the ostensible states of Ciskei and Transkei. Homeland law liberated Mr. Kerzner from the anti-gaming laws of the motherland, from the South African trade unions that are banned here, and from the tediously accountable ways of democracy.
Bophuthatswana's dictator, Lucas Mangope, for example, did not need to fret about protest from the drought-stricken farmers and one-pump villages of the region when he agreed to build the new water lines that deliver the 2.6 million gallons of water a day to water the Lost City's gardens, fill its artificial lakes, and flush the toilets in its 338-room hotel.
But Bophuthatswana is not the refuge it once was. First the anti-apartheid cultural boycott of the mid-1980's put Sun City off limits as a venue for world-class talent. Then a recession and a proliferation of unregulated mom-and-pop casinos in South Africa whittled Sun City's gambling revenues.
Now with South Africa on the verge of majority rule, homeland politics has become tricky in a way that must make Mr. Kerzner yearn for the simple, imaginary civilization of the Lost City's ancients.
 
Threat of Embarrassment
 Bophuthatswana and other homelands are expected to be reabsorbed into a South Africa governed, most likely, by the African National Congress. Until that happens, Mr. Kerzner must hedge his bets, keeping simultaneous peace with his present and future rulers, who despise each other.
Mr. Kerzner has befriended senior dignitaries in the African National Congress, but the congress's local representatives still accuse him of maintaining the Mangope regime with Sun City tax revenues and of bolstering the pretense that Bophuthatswana is a separate country.
The tensions between the homeland regime and its foes in South Africa present Mr. Kerzner with a constant threat of embarrassment.
The week Mr. Kerzner opened his resort to scores of freeloading journalists, Bophuthatswana planned to hang three convicted murderers, provoking an outcry from human-rights advocates in South Africa, where the death penalty is suspended. The hangings were stayed, reportedly after an appeal from a Sun City executive, for 90 days, until well after the opening of Lost City and the million-dollar golf tournament and Miss World pageant that are billed here in early December.
 
Betting on Tourist Dollars
 That is one woe postponed, but there are others. South African churchmen have harangued Bophuthatswana for its lack of political freedom. The African National Congress local has warned it might disrupt the Miss World pageant if it turns into a showcase for Bophuthatswana's "independence." Workers angry over layoffs at other hotels in Mr. Kerzner's Sun chain are contemplating a boycott of the Lost City.
Worse yet, Mr. Mangope has hinted he may resist giving up power to the new South Africa, creating the kind of political crisis that tends to give international tourists cold feet.
"The fact of the matter is we operate here," Mr. Kerzner said, irritably rejecting the notion that Sun City is "propping anybody up." "The de facto issue is that President Mangope is the president, he has a government, they have statutes, and we have to operate within those statutes.' '
Mr. Kerzner is betting that, whoever comes out on top, all will be forgiven in the craving for tourist dollars to underwrite an even grander reinvention, that of South Africa.
"At the end of the day," the mogul said, "whoever governs, you don't want to be governing a wasteland."

HEADLINE: Educators Seeking Common Ground Under Clinton

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Usually fractious education groups here have found education principles they can all support, hoping to capitalize on President-elect Bill Clinton's longtime interest in education.
Representatives of 21 major national education organizations have been working together since September to devise a list of education goals they could support. Today, 18 of the groups sent the document to Congress. 
 But gathering the signatures for it illustrated just how difficult it is for the educational community to work together. Some organizations declined to sign, saying their needs did not mesh with those of the other groups.
The American Federation of Teachers was one of the last signers, deciding only late today to support the principles outlined in the document. "They just really wanted to go through it and make sure it jibes with the A.F.T. interests," said Janet Bass, a spokeswoman for the teachers federation.
Michael Edwards, manager of Congressional relations for the National Education Association, the other major teachers' union along with the A.F.T., said his organization would submit its own document to the House and Senate education committees.
The Council of Great City Schools, representing the nation's major urban schools, also declined to sign the document.
 
Groups' Recommendations
 Still, according to Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers and a leading force behind the document, this is the first time that the education community has got together on a legislative effort of this magnitude.
The groups' recommendations include better coordination between what students learn in school and their jobs after high school, more emphasis on helping students learn new technologies, and increased support for early childhood development programs.
One reason the education groups have tried to work more closely on this, Mr. Ambach said, is that they felt the new Administration would be more supportive of education interests than the previous two. He also said tough economic times had forced the groups to work together.
"For 12 years the education organizations have had to play defense against Reagan-Bush, and now there is an opening to move on a major agenda," Mr. Ambach said. "We must have the education team going in the same direction." His organization represents the top state officials responsible for education in each of the 50 states.
The main focus of all the education groups is the reauthorization next year of the elementary and secondary education acts, the principal Federal education legislation. This year it delivered $10.9 billion to the nation's school districts.
When the legislation was originally passed in 1965, the nation's education focus was on supporting disadvantaged students. Recent education research and analysis suggests that along with issues of equity between rich and poor districts, the whole educational system needs upgrading.
 
Main Disagreement
 The main area of disagreement among the education groups is on whether the legislation should simply be reauthorized, with only the spending levels to be debated, or whether it should be the vehicle for redefining the Federal role in education. Mr. Clinton supports national education standards and national testing, but that emphasis makes some groups nervous.
Mr. Ambach said the incoming Administration offered the usually divisive education community an "extraordinary, exciting" opportunity because Mr. Clinton, as Governor of Arkansas, was the leading Democrat in helping to write and establish the national education goals issued by the National Governors Association and the Bush Administration in September 1989.
Congressional aides say the shift to cooperation among the education groups could be helpful in drafting and passing education legislation with a minimum of conflict next year.

HEADLINE: World Events Force Clinton to Divert Attention to Foreign Affairs

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 2

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton, who had the luxury of running a political campaign that focused on the domestic issues he knew best, is now grappling with a transition period that has forced him to address the shifting grounds of foreign policy.
Today he talked to Caribbean leaders and to President Bush, who briefed him on the status of a United Nations resolution regarding military intervention in Somalia. 
 Aides to the President-elect insist he is still spending most of his time selecting a Cabinet, a process that he has kept secretive. But as political turmoil grows in Russia and international intervention becomes more likely in Somalia, the few public pronouncements that have emerged from the Clinton transition team have been about anything but the domestic economy.
 
Foreign Affairs Catch-Up
 "There are a series of challenges out there that a new team coming in would need to understand -- not only the nature and essence of the problem, but also understand the kind of urgency they would have to deal with," said a Bush Administration official involved in the transition.
Some of Mr. Clinton's advisers admit privately that events have caught the Clinton transition team somewhat off guard. While Mr. Clinton has sought to devote the interregnum to quiet deliberation about the shape of his new Government, the Bush Administration's actions abroad, especially asking the United Nations to send troops to Somalia, have forced much recent scrutiny of the new President to center on his weakest area of expertise.
But others involved in advising Mr. Clinton on foreign matters have said they expected much of the current activity and that the President-elect has spent relatively little time on it.
 
International Phone Calls
 "Foreign policy is not the type of issue you can always plan or manage like formulating a budget or putting together your Government," said Nancy Soderberg, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Clinton.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton has taken time from his schedule to receive telephone calls from President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and a number of other world leaders including President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, President F. W. de Klerk of South African and the the African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao of India, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine, Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea, President Francois Mitterand of France, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Prime Ministers John Major of Great Britain, Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece and Kiichi Miyozawa of Japan.
 
'We Have Only One President'
 "We're in regular contact with the Administration, and it's fairly continuous right now," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director. "Again, we have only one President. It's President Bush's responsibility right now to work with the U.N. and to make that policy."
When Mr. Clinton has ventured to speak about foreign policy matters, he has been equally cautious.
He has said he generally supports the President's decision to send American troops to Somalia to insure the safe delivery of relief supplies. He sent a spare, one-paragraph letter of support to President Yeltsin in advance of his meeting with the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow this week. He has stayed as far out of the fray as he can on the question of what the United States' continuing role should be in the internal conflicts in the Balkans.
And today, he said in a speech to a meeting of Caribbean leaders that he rejects "those who would use violence against democratically elected governments," presumably a reference to the leaders of Haiti, who came to power after ousting President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
He used the speech, delivered by satellite, to transform the discussion about foreign policy into one about the domestic economy, a tactic he used successfully during the campaign.
"We cannot hope to be fruitfully involved in the things which you are discussing today unless we are strong enough to be an economic leader," Mr. Clinton told the conference on trade, investment and development in the Caribbean.
But even in his statement today, he stopped short of using the harsh language he had employed in his campaign. A few months ago, he was often highly critical of the Bush Administration's refusal to allow Haitian refugees to stay in the United States as the victims of political persecution.
Samuel Berger, who is heading Mr. Clinton's foreign policy operation, speaks every day with Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser. The Central Intelligence Agency has set up an office in Little Rock from which to deliver a copy of the National Intelligence Daily to Mr. Clinton.
The President-elect also receives a daily 15-minute oral briefing on security matters that aides say is the same one Mr. Bush gets at the White House.
It is clear that Clinton aides are not entirely in the loop on the most delicate matters being decided in Washington. Earlier this week, when the United States was circulating a draft copy of a United Nations resolution concerning joint action on Somalia, top Clinton aides knew nothing about it.
But they may not be entirely unhappy with such circumstances.
"In many cases, there are instances where they would just as soon see this President go ahead and make the decision and relieve them of the need to do so," the Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Colorado Faces Boycott Over Its Gay-Bias Vote

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Furious that Colorado voters appeared to sanction bigotry against homosexuals, some tourists are canceling plans to come to the Rockies and a television production company picked another state to shoot a movie.
"This is too blatant an act to ignore," said Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, referring to voters' approval of a binding referendum that repealed ordinances in Denver, Boulder and Aspen that barred discrimination against homosexuals and forbade any city in the state to pass similar ordinances. "This is a basic violation of civil rights." 
 The women's group has canceled its 1,500-member convention that had been scheduled for Denver in November 1993. In addition, the Atlanta City Council banned official travel to Colorado, and other cities, including San Francisco, are taking steps to follow suit.
Reaction to the November vote has already cost the state at least $10 million in lost tourism from four canceled conventions, said William Burford, an economist at Denver University.
 
$5 Billion From Tourists
 Tourism is to Colorado what corn is to Iowa. It generates about $5 billion in revenue a year here.
"If I were the tourist people, I would be very nervous right now," Mr. Burford said.
Although the resorts in Aspen say rooms and lodges are virtually all booked around Christmas, the glitzy ski community has taken out advertisements in newspapers, including Variety, to proclaim its opposition to the anti-gay-rights vote.
This is a state that has always enjoyed its image as a beautiful land where tolerant, progressive people live in a casual atmosphere. It has always been considered rather hip to be a Coloradoan.
Now suddenly the anti-gay-rights vote has cast an entirely different image: a backward state that wishes to discriminate.
"You hear people now say, I'm ashamed of being from Colorado," said Deborah Milo Cornelius, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Tourism Board. "A lot of people are still in denial. They just can't believe this has happened."
 
Family Values Group
 The push for the amendment was led by a conservative group called Colorado for Family Values, which contended anti-discrimination laws amounted to special rights that would lead to higher quotas in affirmative action programs.
Business and political leaders have been meeting to devise ways to avert the losses in Arizona because it did not have a holiday in recognition of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. That state lost an estimated $500 million before it finally voted last year to honor the civil rights leader.
The Colorado vote has provoked much debate among Hollywood people, many of whom own property in Aspen or spend a lot of time at the resort. Some celebrities say they will not set foot in Colorado, but others have balked at the idea of a boycott, arguing that Aspen is a beacon of progressive values.
Talk of a possible boycott of Colorado was raised last week by the singer Barbra Streisand, who later seemed to back away from it.
Denver's Mayor, Wellington Webb, who has acknowledged that results of the vote on Nov. 3 could seriously harm the state's $5 billion a year tourism industry, has been campaigning against any boycott wherever he can find an audience.
He arranged to be on the Arsenio Hall show tonight to make the case that a boycott would be unfair and counterproductive.
 
Boycott Seen as Unfair
 He noted that voters in Denver, Boulder and Aspen, places that would suffer most from any boycott, voted against the referendum. Those cities have filed suit in Federal court, saying the measure violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
"Before you're critical of us, ask yourself two questions," Mayor Webb said. "Does the state in which I live have a gay rights law? Could a similarly worded referendum have passed in my state?"
Only seven states have laws that ban discrimination in jobs or housing on the basis of sexual orientation.
The Mayor also warned that people resent being lectured by outsiders, so that a boycott would probably hamper efforts to overturn the anti-gay-rights measure, known here as Amendment 2.
 
Conferences Canceled
 In addition to the women's labor union group, others who have canceled conferences here include the American Association of Law Libraries, the National Center for the Social Studies and the National Organization for Women.
A television production company, Laurel Entertainment Inc., which had considered Colorado as a site for a new Stephen King movie, has decided to go elsewhere because of the referendum.
"Frankly, it was neck and neck between yourselves and another state until recently," Richard P. Rubinstein, Laurel's president, wrote to the Colorado Film Commission, "when a new factor surfaced and swung the decision away from Colorado, i.e. the passage of what we consider to be anti-gay legislation by the majority of Colorado voters."
In another protest, Armistead Maupin, a gay author, canceled a stop in Denver on his book tour.
Susan Anderson, the head of the Gay and Lesbian Community Center in Denver, said a boycott would "send a message to other states" that might be considering an anti-gay-rights measure. But she also expressed concern that "we're hurting the wrong people," by refusing to come to Denver, Boulder or Aspen, places where the measure was soundly defeated.
Rather than a boycott, the tennis star Martina Navratilova is considering another response. Ms. Navratilova, who is gay, has vowed to move from Aspen if the measure is not overturned.
"I will not pay taxes in a state that does not recognize me as an equal citizen," she wrote in a recent article in USA Today.

HEADLINE: Kennebunkport Journal;
Bushes' Retreat Is in Transition, Too

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Dec. 1

 BODY:
The election returns had barely been tabulated before some shopkeepers on Dock Square began marking down the George Bush coffee mugs and T-shirts. Raymond Crepeau, a local car dealer, has been doing a brisk trade in used Secret Service minivans -- low mileage, discounted, and a story to pass on to the grandchildren.
After 12 years in the national spotlight, residents of this coastal community in southern Maine are preparing for life after Jan. 20, when its most famous summer resident becomes plain Citizen Bush. Some of the changes were already evident when Mr. Bush returned to Maine to spend the Thanksgiving holiday at his vacation home on Walker's Point. 
 Only a handful of reporters and photographers kept a vigil outside the Cape Arundel golf course, where the President slogged through 18 holes despite a chill fog and heavy drizzle.
The journalists will be missed, sort of. The townspeople have enjoyed the attention even while maintaining the requisite air of Yankee diffidence.
The sightseers will be missed, too, especially by the souvenir merchants and fast food purveyors. Shops like the Mountain Tops have turned a nice profit on T-shirts featuring the likenesses of President Bush, his wife, Barbara, and their dog, Millie. The Old Salt's Pantry has done well peddling a relish labeled Bush Sauce ("Excellent With Quail").
But nobody will miss the demonstrators, who turned up whenever the Bushes were in residence to clog the narrow streets, chant slogans, wave signs, blow whistles and otherwise inspire the locals to keep indoors or leave town.
"It's always been a resort, so we were used to the crowds," said Town Clerk Janet Winters. "But the demonstrations were the major change. We had Act-Up and pro-life and pro-choice and Lithuanian rights -- any reason that somebody could think of to come by, they did. We had the broccoli bunch for a week."
Even though the town is losing a President, residents seem confident about its commercial future.
"It's going to be fine," said Karen Arel, executive director of the Kennebunkport Chamber of Commerce. "The summer crowd was coming here long before Bush was President, since the 1800's. In 1988, before he was even elected, we had our best year."
Ms. Arel expects family vacationers and crowd-shunning regulars who avoided coming when the Bushes were in town to take up the slack next year in the big motels where the journalists and White House staff members have stayed. She said her office is receiving up to 50 calls a day from people out of state seeking lodging reservations for the 1993 season.
Sgt. Gary Ronan of the police department said that he and his colleagues would miss the overtime pay that came with Presidential visits but that otherwise he does not envision much of a dislocation after Mr. Bush leaves the White House.
The police force, which consists of 11 officers, was not expanded for the Summer White House years. Security for the Bush family is provided by the Federal Government, and state troopers are brought in to help with crowd control when necessary.
Kennebunkport has a year-round population of less than 3,500. Even in normal times, that can swell to about 25,000 in the summer, leaving traffic snarled in the tiny downtown area.
No one doubts that Mr. Bush will continue to spend summers here, as he has almost every year since he was a child, and the Secret Service will continue to provide protection for him once he leaves office.
But local residents, who seem genuinely fond of the Bushes (he carried the town with 50 percent of the vote while the state went for Bill Clinton), expect to see more of them. The President and his wife avoided the downtown area in recent years because of the disruptions their visits touched off.
"He'll be more accessible," Ms. Arel predicted. "Before, even as Vice President, he felt free to shop and eat in the village or visit the American Legion and speak on a Memorial Day. Barbara would go to the florist and into the dress shops. Then they stayed away."

HEADLINE: A Study's Answer to the Costliest Drug: Economize

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The annual cost of treatment with what is often called the world's most expensive drug can be cut by hundreds of thousands of dollars a person simply by giving smaller doses more frequently, a study concludes.
The drug, Ceredase, is the only treatment for Gaucher's disease, a rare inherited illness most common among descendants of Eastern European Jews that causes swelling of the liver and spleen. 
 The drug, approved by the Federal Government last year, is extremely expensive, in part because it is extracted in tiny quantities from human placentas. The first year of treatment costs about $380,000 for an adult who is administered the recommended dose.
But researchers from the Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, Calif., found that by changing the schedule of doses, patients do as well on one-fourth the recommended amount of medicine.
 
One Maker Under the Law
 The treatment was discovered and initially tested by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. It was later developed and brought to market by Genzyme Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
The company sells the medicine under the Federal Orphan Drug Act, which offers financial incentives and seven years of exclusive marketing rights for finding medicines for rare illnesses. The high cost of Ceredase is sometimes cited by critics of the law, who say it encourages unreasonably high prices.
The latest study, conducted by Dr. Michael L. Figueroa and others, is being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Gaucher's disease, which afflicts an estimated 20,000 Americans, results from a genetic defect that interferes with an enzyme needed to break down a kind of fat. As a result, these fats build up in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The severity of the disease varies greatly. It can be fatal, especially when symptoms begin in childhood.
Ceredase replaces the missing enzyme. One unit of the medicine costs $3.50 and contains four-millionths of an ounce of liquid. A medication plan worked out by doctors at the National Institutes of Health recommends that people receive 60 units for every kilogram they weigh. The guidelines suggest the medicine be given every other week for most patients.
This adds up to $380,000 a year for an adult who weighs 70 kilograms, or about 150 pounds.
The Scripps researchers theorized that because the medicine disappears quickly from the bloodstream, it could be given far more efficiently if it was split into many small doses. They found that 2.3 units for every kilogram taken three times a week works as well.
"Cost was uppermost in our minds when we did this, because our patients could not afford the enzyme," said Dr. Ernest Beutler, the senior author of the study.
A spokeswoman for Genzyme, Donna LaVoie, said that new guidelines being developed by the National Institutes of Health suggest cutting the recommended high dose in half after the first year of treatment and cutting it further as time goes by.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Plummet 10.3%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell sharply in October, the first drop after five monthly increases, the Commerce Department said today.
The 10.3 percent drop in sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 600,000 came after a huge upward revision in September's figures to the highest sales rate this year. 
 Housing industry analysts pointed out that the Government has regularly revised its sales figures upward for more than a year, and they suggested that October's figure was likely to be changed to show a smaller fall.
The Commerce Department said September sales jumped 7 percent, to an annual rate of 669,000, surpassing January's 667,000 rate, for the strongest monthly sales this year. The department previously estimated that September sales fell 1 percent from the August rate. With the revised figure for September, sales of new homes had risen for five straight months until October's drop.
 
Firming Market
 "They've pushed these figures up every month now since August 1991," said David Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. "Our own monthly survey of builders in early November shows that after a second-quarter relapse there has been a firming of tone in the market and gradual increases in sales."
The 10.3 percent drop in October sales was the sharpest since an 11.5 percent decline in March. It was concentrated in the Northeast, where sales fell 43.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 55,000.
 In other regions, the monthly sales drop from September was much smaller -- down 6 percent in the South, 4.9 percent in the Midwest and 1.2 percent in the West.
 After a quick start at the beginning of the year, sales of new homes slackened in the second quarter to an average annual rate of 561,000. But in the third quarter, sales recovered to 637,000 a month on average.
 October's annual sales rate was 14 percent higher than the 526,000-unit annual rate in October 1991.
 Housing is a big part of the economy. The industry is a big employer, from construction to real estate sales and furnishings. The buying of homes also measures consumers' optimism.
 Builders are counting on total new home sales of 600,000 in 1992, after a depressed 1991, when sales were only 509,000. For 1993, builders estimate that sales will rise to 675,000.
 "Higher interest rates in October are a worry, particularly if the rise was based simply on an expectation of what a Clinton Administration might mean for rates," Mr. Seiders said.
Lower mortgage rates and stable prices have made houses more affordable. But sales of new homes have struggled, with interest remaining most intense in the market for lower-priced existing homes.
 The real estate industry said last week that sales of existing homes climbed 9.1 percent in October, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.6 million, the highest level in nearly four years.
Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, said mortgage rates would probably stay level for the rest of this year and rise modestly in 1993.
 The average price of a new home in October rose to $152,600 from $142,300 in September, while the median price was $125,000, up from $119,000.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Slightly Higher But Focus Is on Strong Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly higher yesterday, with the focus of trading firmly on European currencies and the high-flying German mark. Gold prices rose, with the spot price on the New York Commodity Exchange up 80 cents, to $335.90 an ounce.
The mark surged against the French franc, Italian lira and Danish krone, prompting central banks to intervene to support the weaker currencies. 
 European central banks have been forced to raise interest rates and intervene to protect currencies that have come under speculative selling pressure. The aim is keep them in line with each other under the ranges set in the European monetary system. With German interest rates relatively high -- and other European nations in recession -- the mark has benefited at the expense of its neighbors' currencies.
 
10-Week Low for Franc
 While the interventions helped restore stability, dealers feared speculators would return with a vengeance to drive the franc, lira and crown down.
The French franc, viewed as key to the survival of the exchange-rate mechanism in the monetary system, fell to a 10-week low of around 3.415 to the mark. It recovered to 3.4072 in late New York trading.
Guy Pasquier, a dealer at Credit Lyonnais, said the French franc got an immediate lift from the German central bank's intervention. But many traders wondered about the depth of the Bundesbank's resolve to help the embattled French currency.
In New York, the dollar ended at 1.5740 marks, up from 1.5730 late Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.17 Japanese yen, down from 124.72 on Tuesday. Later in London, it rose to 124.35 yen. In late trading in New York, the dollar climbed to 124.42 yen from Tuesday's close of 124.15.
In London, the British pound rallied to $1.5500, from $1.5465 Tuesday. It edged up further to close in New York at $1.5525, compared with Tuesday's close at $1.5485.
In New York, the dollar eased to $1.2810 (Canadian), from $1.2818 (Canadian) Tuesday.

IN "Catch-22," Joseph Heller's surrealist novel about World War II, G.I.'s who went to the infirmary with fevers above 102 degrees were hospitalized. Those with temperatures below 100 were sent back to the barracks. And those in between were parked on a bench until their fevers went up or down.
Waiting to see which way the economy's temperature turns is no laughing matter for millions wondering whether they will have jobs next year. But one can still glimpse irony in Bill Clinton's fiscal choices. The candidate swept into office by voters demanding that something -- anything -- be done to cure the recession is discovering that a lot of economists think it would be prudent to sit on the bench. Indeed, the President-elect may end up with the task of deflecting enthusiasm for an instant fix into budget reforms with an enduring but very slow payoff. 
 To everyone's surprise -- and George Bush's post-election chagrin -- the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9 percent from July through September. That is the best quarterly gain since 1988. And while it is not the big leagues compared with other recoveries, Charles Schultze of the Brookings Institution thinks it is about as much bounce as could be expected from a relatively shallow recession.
The catch is that healthy growth has yielded virtually no change in total employment. The jobless rate is stuck at 7.4 percent -- higher than it was in February, when more than a third of New Hampshire's Republican primary voters expressed their disgust with the economic policy-as-usual by rejecting George Bush in favor of Pat Buchanan.
Job creation always lags behind growth during recoveries, because employers initially respond by demanding more work from underemployed people already on the payroll. But the lag this time is exceptional.
If Bill Clinton's luck holds, the employment dam will soon burst as corporations become convinced that the recovery is not another false start. That explains why Mr. Clinton is apparently planning to wait until January to make up his mind about the need for fiscal stimulus.
For what it is worth, though, the consensus forecast is for growth at the high end of the 2 to 3 percent range -- enough to keep the recovery going, but not enough to ratchet down unemployment by more than a few tenths of a percentage point next year. In fact, Paul Krugman of M.I.T. estimates that it would take three years of 3 percent growth to push unemployment below 6 percent.
Is slow but steady good enough? Ed Yardeni of the investment firm C. J. Lawrence speaks for many business economists when he argues that under the circumstances budget-busting fiscal stimulus would be bad economics and problematic politics.
"It looks like we have self-sustaining growth," he commented. "Why risk overheating the economy," he asks, thereby setting the stage for another recession before the 1996 election?
One answer is that the voters expect Mr. Clinton to do better. But Mr. Yardeni is skeptical. The President-elect's real worry, he suggests, is not the people without jobs, but the far greater numbers who watched unemployment drift higher through the Bush years and feared they would be next. As long as the jobs trend turns clearly positive, Mr. Yardeni argues, the President is on safe political ground. And he might even be applauded if, as Mr. Yardeni predicts, more productive businesses start raising wages to keep up employee morale.
Mr. Schultze is reluctant to give up on short-term stimulus if the alternative is years of less-than-full employment. But he would use it only as the decoration to an otherwise unattractive package of long-term deficit-reduction measures -- an increase in income taxes at the high end, perhaps, plus an attack on entitlements that benefit the affluent. And he would offer only the sort of stimulus that served long-term productivity goals. A short list would include tax credits for investment, and higher spending for infrastructure or training.
 Such a linkage would please the Perot crowd -- or, at least, those who actually paid attention to Mr. Perot's message. But it is difficult to see how any President could pull it off in a reasonable time. It is one thing to ask for speedy passage of stimulus that simply put money in people's pockets. It is quite another to invite Congress to fine-tune the economy, even as legislators swing an ax at the great spending lobbies.
One plausible linkage strategy might be to start with a temporary tax credit for investment, and then make credible deficit reduction the price for extending this popular business tax break. At worst, the economy would end up with temporary kick when it still might do more good than harm. At best, it might be also serve as the catalyst for serious budget reforms.

Yields Up on Money Funds But Level of Assets Is Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were up slightly in the latest week, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report's most recent survey.
After declining for three consecutive weeks, tax-exempt yields moved up, as assets slipped by $159 million, to a total of $98 billion. Analysts said a heavy supply of new short-term municipal paper that reached market in the last few days was more than likely to affect yields this week. 
 The average number of days left to maturity of securities being held in fund portfolios fell to 62, from 64.
The seven-day average compounded tax-exempt yield was up a basis point, to 2.21, with the simple yield up a like amount, to 2.18 percent. Donoghue's statisticians calculate that over the course of 30 days, the average compounded yield is 2.22 percent, with the simple yield at 2.20 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Making no assumption for state taxes, the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield this week for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket comes out to about 3.07 percent, and 3.20 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management was still outperforming the others, yielding 2.84 percent this week, or about one basis point lower than its yield in the previous survey.
 
Taxable Yield: 2.81%
 Among taxable money market funds, the average seven-day compounded and simple yields were both up three basis points, to 2.81 percent and 2.77 percent, respectively.
Assets of taxable funds were off by $12.2 billion, to a total of $475.9 billion. Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, assessed the situation this way: "Market yields, because of rising interest rates in short-term Treasury securities, are outperforming money market fund yields. As a result, investors are being drawn to other short-term investments and I expect that money market rates soon have to raise their yields if they are to remain competitive."
Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios slipped to 62, from 63.
The Dreyfus Basic Money Market was the top-yielding fund for the week, at 3.72 percent. Among government-only funds, United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services in San Antonio, had the best yield, at 3.90 percent.
This week, bank money market accounts, which compete directly with the funds, were yielding an average 2.77 percent.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Lumber Prices in Retreat On Weak Home Sales Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lumber futures prices plummeted yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the Government reported that new home sales had fallen after five monthly gains.
Although many analysts consider the report an unreliable predictor of building activity, it was enough to bring on profit taking in a market that had risen sharply in recent days. 
 On other commodity markets, hog futures fell sharply and cattle were mostly lower.
 
Two-by-Fours Tumble
 Spruce two-by-fours for January delivery tumbled the permitted daily limit of 5 cents, to $248.90 a board foot, in Chicago, ending a four-day advance in the lightly traded market. The loss wiped out nearly half of the $10.80 gain posted in the previous week on signs of tightening supplies and economic recovery.
Analysts said yesterday's report from the Commerce and the Housing and Urban Development Departments of a 10.3 percent drop in October home sales was a shock.
"The expectation was for a bit of improvement, with the improvement in the general economy and the lower interest rates," said Curt Cunningham, president of the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. He said futures traders had also responded to increased availability of lumber from wholesalers at prices below those asked by sawmills.
The home sales data are often revised and are considered a less important indicator of future lumber demand than the monthly report on building permits. Nevertheless, "we didn't need much of an excuse to start taking profits after the last three or four days," Mr. Cunningham said.
Bud Merrill, lumber analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Eugene, Ore., agreed that the report offered an excuse for profit taking. He said he did not believe that the market's recent upward trend had been broken.
Pork futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on signs of rising pork belly stocks and worries that a seasonal rise in pork loin prices had not developed. Moreover, traders expect increased hog production to result in record pork production in December, said Chuck Levitt, Shearson's senior livestock analyst.
Cattle futures ended mostly lower in a relatively quiet performance after strong gains last week. Live cattle for December delivery ended 0.10 cent lower at 76.42 cents a pound; January feeder cattle fell 0.08 cent, to 83.77 cents a pound; December live hogs dropped 0.88 cent, to 44.12 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies fell 0.95 cent, to 38.62 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Prediction for Clinton Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's economic stimulus program will provide a small lift to the economy next year, enough to make only a tiny dent in the unemployment rate, the nation's top business economists predicted today.
While Mr. Clinton has promised to focus like a "laser beam" on the economy once in office, the survey by the National Association of Business Economists found that analysts at some of the country's largest companies held decidedly low-key expectations for what the incoming President will be able to accomplish. 
 The association said the median expectation of 41 professional forecasters surveyed in late November was that Mr. Clinton's program would result in a slight, two-tenths of 1 percent increase in economic growth next year when compared with what they would have expected had President Bush won re-election.
While Mr. Clinton is still formulating his short-term economic program, he has indicated that two key elements will be investment tax credits for businesses and a rise in spending on roads, bridges and other public works projects of around $20 billion next year.
In a $6 trillion economy, such a package would represent only a small dose of fiscal stimulus, analysts said.
But the business economists group said it hoped Mr. Clinton would not listen to advisers who are urging him to take a bolder approach in an effort to get the unemployment rate down more quickly.

HEADLINE: A Couple Builds a Home So Healthful It Passes the Sniff Test

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

DATELINE: KIRKLAND, Wash.

 BODY:
ON the shore of Lake Washington here, six miles from Seattle, is a nearly $2 million condominium with hand-painted wallpaper in the dining room, a coromandel screen in the living room, and a pure silk comforter on the bed. But what really makes this home different is that the three-bedroom apartment and all its contents were selected to create an environment that does not make one of the owners ill.
John Shimer is one of many Americans who have environmental illness or multiple chemical sensitivities. When he smells fumes from some paints, automobile exhaust or ammonia, for example, his vision blurs, his speech slurs and his head aches. 
 Dr. Richard Thomas, director of human toxicology and risk assessment at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., said there are "probably millions of Americans who suffer from environmental illness, and have varying degrees of this problem, but we cannot substantiate the figure."
Mr. Shimer became sick in the winter of 1989, when he was working as a fund-raising consultant in a client's office in a new building in Seattle. "I walked like a little old man," said Mr. Shimer, who is 49 years old. His client quickly moved him to another rented office, but he didn't feel better because he had already become sensitized, said his doctor, David Buscher.
Dr. Buscher, a specialist in environmental medicine in nearby Bellevue, first saw Mr. Shimer in March 1990. Within a month, he had diagnosed Mr. Shimer's condition as multiple chemical sensitivity. As part of his treatment, Mr. Shimer stopped working, detoxified his body through medication, exercise and therapeutic saunas, and tossed out his polyester comforter, pillows and cotton-poly sheets. "Anything petroleum-based is the kiss of death for me," he said.
Finally, he and his wife, Cay Fortune, an interior designer, sold their house in Medina and moved into the new apartment last March.
In designing a new home to be a safe shelter in a world otherwise poisonous to him, Mr. Shimer was lucky. He was unemployed, but Ms. Fortune was working, they had the proceeds from their Medina house, and he had disability insurance, he said.
In July 1990, they paid more than $1 million for the concrete shell that would enclose the lakefront 3,016-square-foot condominium in a new luxury development. The interior cost $700,000 more, of which $100,000 went to consultants and for many special elements to make the home free of irritants to Mr. Shimer: a furnace/ air-conditioning system with triple filters, special glues, nontoxic grout, custom paints, upholstery and cabinetry, and a double layer of vapor barriers to seal the apartment.
"You can do the same with less money," Mr. Shimer said. "If you plan a $100,000 home, you have to add in another 7 percent for the extra low-toxicity features."
James Olson, a Seattle architect whose firm, Olson/Sundberg, also designed the galleries of the new Seattle Art Museum, designed the apartment. It has wood doors in a Shoji-screen style, gleaming maple floors, and a dropped ceiling of wood-framed translucent plexiglass panels that also look like Shoji screens. "We wanted to keep materials in their natural state, in keeping with the Japanese philosophy, where wood is usually admired for its natural beauty," Mr. Olson said.
For the architect, the project was a lesson in which materials can be toxic and which are not. When Mr. Olson showed his clients the first drawings, the couple screamed, "Oh, no!" Mr. Olson thought they hated the design but "they were objecting to the smell of the ammonia from the blueprints," he said. From then on, the architect let the drawings air a day or two before presenting them to his clients.
Before building began, Mr. Shimer started sniff-testing, which was advised by Dan Morris, an environmental engineer in Clinton, Wash. "The reason I recommend the sniff test is that everybody's body is different," Mr. Morris said. Mr. Shimer sniff-tested more than 50 products -- paint, sealants, adhesives -- a process that continued until last January.
Mr. Shimer and Mr. Olson asked the developer, Skinner Development of Seattle, to coat the inside of the concrete shell with a nontoxic, water-based sealant to prevent the emission of gases by curing agents in the concrete. Mr. Shimer sniff-tested sealants after they were kept in a cookie tin for four days. He would inhale vapors, and Ms. Fortune would write down any symptoms. "Sometimes I got dizzy, sometimes I got headaches, sometimes my respiratory system closed up as if I was having a violent asthma attack," Mr. Shimer said.
Mr. Shimer said he is thriving among antiques, because the 18th-century Korean tansu chests, and the 17th-century English partner's desk, years ago emitted whatever gases they contained, long before anyone was aware of environmental illness.
New wood didn't bother him, either, but stains, varnishes and some other finishes caused problems. The finish he finally chose for the floors and cabinets is water-based. In the bathroom, the counter and walls are sheets of Corian, a synthetic material, rather than tile, which would have required grout and yet more sniff-testing. The floor is marble.
The walls are either painted or covered with paper. "Oil-based paints can have 30 to 40 chemicals," Mr. Morris said. "Most water-based paints have 12 to 15 chemicals, but the most problematic are those with biocides, which prevent mold."
The solution? To use custom paints without biocides, which cost $20 a gallon. "If the humidity in the home is kept under control, there should be no mold growth, even without the biocides," Mr. Morris said.
Mr. Shimer isn't sensitive to the hand-painted wallpaper in his dining room, but most wallpaste makes him sick. Ms. Fortune discovered clay-based adhesive. "It's an old-fashioned paste that wallpaperers used to use before they had all those so-called wonderful adhesives," she said.
For Mr. Shimer, who just finished writing a book on financial investment, the fabric of choice is cotton. He dresses in cotton, sleeps on cotton and sits on cotton. The sofas and chairs were stuffed first with cotton batting, then wrapped in a barrier cloth of organic cotton, which prevented any seepage of pesticides that might have been used on the batting when the fiber was still in the fields. Slipcovers are cotton, as are the sheets and pillowcases. The comforter, however, is silk, inside and out.
To keep out gases from the concrete shell and the insulation, there are two vapor barriers. Sheets of polyethylene were taped together on the studs, under the plasterboard. The second barrier was made by covering the plasterboard with a special paint that prevents vapors from penetrating the wall. "Neither of the barriers is perfect," Mr. Morris said, "so two barriers were needed." They cost $2,000.
The furnace/air-conditioner was put in a closet. It has a filter that looks like cotton batting and that filters out large particles of dust; an activated charcoal filter that absorbs chemicals like formaldehyde, and a third, which looks like a paper coffee filter, that traps fine dust particles. The filters cost $2,500 a year to replace.
For a household designed to be free of irritants, there is the surprising presence of Snowball, an American Eskimo dog, a new breed. He was Ms. Fortune's before the couple married two years ago, and his dander does not make Mr. Shimer suffer. Horses bother him, but Snowball, no.

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols

 BODY:
Morality in all its interpretations is a volatile issue in video stores. This week, for example, The New York Daily News quoted the business publication Inside Media as saying that Blockbuster, the nation's largest video chain, had refused to stock Woody Allen's film "Shadows and Fog" and that the store "was offended by the whole Allen-Mia Farrow mess."
Blockbuster, which has more than 2,500 outlets, does not stock NC-17 films and promotes itself as a family video center. But the Inside Media article reported that Carol Feinberg, a senior vice president of the chain, denied that the absence of "Shadows and Fog" from its stores had anything to do with Mr. Allen. The article also said that Ms. Feinberg declined to explain why Blockbuster stores didn't stock the film. 
 In an interview yesterday, Ms. Feinberg said that Blockbuster makes hundreds of buying decisions every month and that "Shadows and Fog," a film rated PG-13 that was released by Orion in October and is No. 26 on Billboard's best-renter list, "just didn't make it" as a rental prospect and was rejected for business reasons.
Many distributors and other people in the business say that Blockbuster and other video stores are boycotting "Shadows and Fog" and another new Orion release, "Article 99," because of Orion's deal with McDonald's to sell the film "Dances With Wolves" only at McDonald's restaurants and not at Blockbuster or any other video store. Ms. Feinberg denied there was such a boycott.
Beyond the contentions about "Shadows and Fog," the case illustrates increased sensitivity about the content of films being offered in video stores. Dealers report that unrated versions of films with added sex scenes outsell the R-rated tapes by margins of eight to one. One example is "Love Crimes" starring Sean Young. Other groups say there is an equally strong demand for more family-oriented material.
One such group is the Dove Foundation of Grand Rapids, Mich., which identifies films it considers appropriate for family viewing. Dick Rolfe, Dove's managing director, said that of 15,000 films the foundation has reviewed, 720 are suitable for family viewing and that only 400 to 500 of these are commonly available in stores.
As examples of current Dove-approved films on tape, Mr. Rolfe mentioned "The Rocketeer," "Home Alone," "Father of the Bride," "Sister Act" and "Hook." Mr. Rolfe said that Dove advocated altering films to eliminate obscenities and other material it regards as offensive.
No studio has agreed to alter films as Dove suggests, but at least one company, Prime Cut Entertainment of Mission Viejo, Calif., plans to distribute what it considers the next best thing: so-called airline movies, or R-rated films that the studios have sanitized for viewing on flights and on network television.
John J. Lee Jr. of Prime Cut said that about three dozen such films are released each year. "My Cousin Vinny" is the perfect airline film, he said, because altering only a little dialogue makes the movie meet airline standards.
Mr. Lee said his interest was commercial, not ideological. He described the primary audience for airline movies as millions of 8- to 15-year-olds who can't use their parents' video store cards to rent R-rated material, as well as parents who like R-rated films but not to watch with their children.

 Detective sergeants Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) dig deep for the vigor that propelled them through the first two "Lethal Weapon" films. This time, though, the team seems tired. Murtaugh is on the verge of retirement and Riggs, the cutup and renegade, seems more bored than rambunctious. Buildings explode and bodies are blown apart, glass shatters, and bullying police antics seem particularly insensitive in the wake of the Rodney King case. In sum, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, Richard Donner's film "celebrates a luxurious kind of destruction and disorder that can only appear mindless amid today's realities."

 An American intelligence unit has encounters of a strange kind in the snowy Ardennes Forest during the last winter of World War II. Two bodies, one German and the other American, are found frozen together upright as if they'd been dancing. Skirmishes with the enemy never happen as the Americans withhold attack and the Germans turn away and withdraw. In his second film, Keith Gordon uses arresting images to turn William Wharton's novel of war as surreal muddle into a "very fine screen adaptation" (Canby).

Some Best-Renting Films
In a Hot Market
Video rentals have surged over the last two months, a survey of dealers and consultants by Billboard magazine shows. Reasons cited include a better economy, lower rental fees and strong titles at the top of best-renter lists. Here are some movies from last week's top 10 on Billboard's list of top renters.
BATMAN RETURNS. Tim Burton's cartoonish tale of evil doings in Gotham City is one of several hits priced to sell that are also best renters. 1992. Warner. $24.98. LD, $39.98. 2:06. CC. PG-13.
SISTER ACT. Emile Arolino's film about a lounge singer (Whoopi Goldberg) who hides out in a convent to elude the mob was an unexpected hit in theaters but no surprise in video stores, where it is both a best renter and best seller. 1992. Touchstone. $19.99. 1:40. CC. PG.
FAR AND AWAY. Ron Howard's film tells the story of two Irish immigrants (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) who cross America. 1992. MCA/Universal. $94.99. LD, $39.98. 2:18. CC. PG-13.
THE CUTTING EDGE. Doug Dorsey (D. B. Sweeney) and Kate Moseley (Moira Kelly) quit bickering long enough to win the figure-skating gold medal at the Olympics. 1992. MGM/UA. $94.99. LD, $29.98. 1:42. CC. PG.
DEEP COVER. An undercover agent (Larry Fishburne) becomes a participant in the drug world he's supposed to be investigating. 1992. New Line. $94.95. 1:52. CC. R.
THUNDERHEART. In Michael Apted's film, a companion piece to his documentary "Incident at Oglala," a Government agent (Val Kilmer) investigates a murder on a Sioux reservation. 1992. Columbia Tri-Star. $94.95. LD, $34.95. 1:59. CC. R.

HEADLINE: WHERE TO FIND IT

BYLINE: By Terry Trucco

 BODY:
UNLIKE most shopkeepers, Joanna Doniger expects her customers to return their purchases. And during the holidays, her busiest season, they bring back beaded bustiers, taffeta skirts and sequined evening gowns after wearing them just once.
One Night Stand, Ms. Doniger's five-year-old Manhattan dress shop, specializes in women's evening wear to rent, everything from billowy ball gowns to slinky cocktail dresses. And though she refuses to stock evening trousers ("too hard to fit," she said) and white debutante-style gowns ("too hard to keep snappy"), she has almost 800 dresses, sizes 2 to 14. 
 "Nobody ever sees everything, because things are always out on hire," she said, patting the flounce on a little black Terence Nolder number.
For decades, the garment-rental business, always bustling during the holidays, consisted mainly of men's tuxedos. But in recent years, new types of rental services have begun, offering everything from women's party dresses in velvet and chiffon, to Santa suits with optional padding, the ultimate holiday rental. Basic rules apply for most rented garments. Clothing is dry cleaned before each rental. A security deposit is required. And last-minute rentals, while not advised, are usually possible.
The women's evening-wear rental business grew with the grand-style entertaining of the 1980's. And the recession has kept it going. Rentals at One Night Stand average $200 to $250 for dresses that retail for $1,000 and up. Fees for gowns rented for a business occasion are tax deductible, Ms. Doniger said.
Women want "black, black and more black," she added. Customers are also starting to ask for long dresses again. Still, her most popular rental is a short, stretchy sequined sheath, in black, naturally, by Pamela Dennis.
"It's strapless and sexy, with no pronounced waist," Ms. Doniger said. "But you can add a black chiffon jacket to make it safe."
ONE NIGHT STAND 905 Madison Avenue near 72d Street, New York 10021; (212) 772-7720. By appointment.
 
Especially for the Bride
 Dresses for hire by Carolina Herrera and Victor Costa, among others, hang on the racks at Just Once in Manhattan, renters of women's evening wear for five years. But wedding gowns, the apex of formal attire, make up nearly half of the shop's stock of 400 dresses. "My customer is the bride who is 30 or older," said the shop manager, Debra Urban. "Instead of spending $8,000 for a wedding gown, she rents one for $700 and buys a dining-room table instead."
Ms. Urban rents regularly to the growing number of brides from Japan who want lavish dresses for weddings at the United Nations chapel.
Most of Ms. Urban's evening dresses are short, though a recent creation by Liberatto, the shop's own designer, features a quilted silk faille top and a long, narrow skirt. Evening-gown rentals range from $85 to $325, wedding-gown rentals from $250 to $700.
JUST ONCE 292 Fifth Avenue, near 31st Street, New York 10001; (212) 465-0960. Hours: Monday through Friday, 10:30 A.M. to 6:30 P.M.; Saturdays by appointment.
 
In the Expectant Interim
 When she was pregnant with her first child, Loretta Chiavetta discovered it was both challenging and costly to find suitable evening wear. So her three-year-old company, Formal Expectations, based in Pleasantville, N.Y., specializes in dressy attire for mothers-to-be. "About 90 percent of my stock is black in sequins, velvet or chiffon," she said. Most of her dresses also display some leg. "When you're pregnant you still want to show something," she said.
She stocks over 250 pieces, including separates to mix and match. Rentals range from $75 to $95.
FORMAL EXPECTATIONS (914) 769-0883. By appointment.
 
For Those Jolly Old Elves
 There's only one true Santa Claus, of course, but would-be helpers, or imposters, can choose from five types of classic red-and-white suits at Allan Uniform Rental Service, a 32-year-old concern in Manhattan. The fully lined deluxe model ($125) comes in red velvet, while budget-minded Santas can opt for velour or corduroy ($75). Wig, beard, belt and boot coverings are included, with optional stomach padding ($20). Men's sizes range from 42 to 60.
ALLAN UNIFORM RENTAL SERVICE 152 East 23d Street, near Lexington Avenue, New York 10010; (212) 529-4655. Hours: Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Fund-Raiser Aiding Rematch For a Mayoral Bid,

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Keeping financial pace with the man he wants to replace, Rudolph W. Giuliani raised almost $1 million last night for his mayoral rematch against David N. Dinkins next year -- no small achievement for a Republican in New York City, where Democrats hold a 5 to 1 advantage in registered voters.
Altogether this year, Mr. Giuliani has raised nearly $2.5 million, roughly equal to Mr. Dinkins's total. At the same time, he has been busy soothing the rank-and-file party leaders who were irked by his standoffish approach in 1989. That means that he will almost certainly avoid the kind of costly primary challenge that set him back then, and that Mr. Dinkins faces from his fellow Democrat, City Council President Andrew J. Stein. 
 Mr. Giuliani's success in smoothing feathers was symbolized by the inclusion of the city's five county Republican organizations on the committee for his fund-raiser at the Sheraton New York last night. All five have agreed to lend their names, though only the Brooklyn organization has so far endorsed him. All that, the county leaders said, makes it highly improbable that Mr. Stein, who had wooed Republican support, could win the backing of the three counties' organizations he would need to get on the Republican ballot.
 
Call for Change
 "This election should not be about skin tone but moral tone," Mr. Giuliani said last night, in a challenge to Mr. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor. "We will argue that white and black New Yorkers should put race aside and support the candidate that offers the chance we need for better services, more economic progress, cleaner streets, more orderly public spaces and hope for our children. This administration offers the minority community, like the rest of the city, little more than symbolism."
But the symbolism of the recent tensions between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights stood out at the dinner where Assemblyman Dov Hikind of Brooklyn was among the guests on the dais. At Mr. Dinkins's fund-raiser on Monday, Mr. Hikind was outside the hotel, leading a group protesting the Mayor's handling the Crown Heights unrest.
Labor Secretary Lynn M. Martin also spoke, telling the crowd: "You need a mayor. You just don't need change, you need a mayor."
Peter J. Powers, a lawyer and longtime friend who managed Mr. Giuliani's last campaign, in which the former United States Attorney lost to Mr. Dinkins by just 2 percentage points, said before the dinner that the campaign was pleased with its fund raising so far, especially coming just weeks after its party lost the White House. He said the dinner -- at which tickets sold for $500 or $1,000 a plate -- would take in $900,000, on top of the $1 million raised at a similar party last spring and $500,000 from smaller events.
"We're surprised at the numbers, because we figured we might raise $500,000 at this dinner, because it comes right after the election and it's hard to raise money at holiday time," he said.
Mr. Powers said he hoped the early fund raising would help the campaign avoid some of the problems of three years ago, when many Republicans criticized Mr. Giuliani for fielding an inexperienced staff and being unwilling to reach out to local Republican groups, preferring to stress his lone-wolf image as a crusader.
 
Courting Support
 Before taking on Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani had to stave off a bitter primary challenge from Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir, whose candidacy was backed by the party's conservative wing, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
This time, Mr. Giuliani has not only sought the advice of a wide range of New York political figures from both parties, but has been holding serious discussion about hiring David Garth, the media maven and political guru who was instrumental in electing two New York mayors, John V. Lindsay and Edward I. Koch, and last month helped another Republican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, win a come-from-behind re-election.
"We've talked with David," Mr. Powers said. "We've not made any final decisions yet." Mr. Garth's aides said he had no comment.
This fall, Mr. Giuliani swallowed his earlier distaste for Mr. D'Amato and endorsed his re-election, and expects his support next year.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Calls for New York and New Jersey to End Rivalry

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo yesterday appealed for peace in the economic war between New York and New Jersey and called for the two sides to meet. But he also said he was prepared to do battle if New Jersey continued to woo New York companies with financial incentives.
"They slug you. You slug them. That's primitive," Mr. Cuomo said. "Well, what should you do? You should sit down with New Jersey and say, 'Look, this is foolish. You're going to rip us and we're going to rip you. You're going to cost us money. We're going to cost you money. Let's get together. Let's make a region that's more attractive, which is what we've talked about for years.' " 
 Mr. Cuomo's comments at a news conference in Albany were the first he has publicly made about the fight that has erupted over New Jersey's increasing use of financial incentives to attract companies. Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey announced yet another incentive program on Monday.
 
States Choose Weapons
 In an interview last night, Vincent Tese, New York State's director of economic development, said New York was proceeding with plans to begin a marketing program aimed at persuading New Jersey companies to move to New York. "If we let them get away with this, it becomes an untenable situation for us," he said of the New Jersey incentives.
If New York begins the campaign by mid-December as vowed, it would kill the so-called nonaggression pact signed by New York State, New York City, Connecticut and New Jersey in October 1991. The pact was billed as the first step toward broader cooperation in regional economic development.
While calling for both sides to step back from the brink, Mr. Cuomo indicated that he thought New York needed a weapon to give it clout in any talks. "You can make all the fine speeches and all the calls for conciliation that you want," he said. "But if they get the impression that you're not going to do anything, they'll just keep taking your companies."
Reacting to Mr. Cuomo, Brooke Hern, a spokesman for Barbara W. McConnell, New Jersey's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development, said, "We're willing to talk." But he gave no sign that New Jersey was willing to make any concessions.
Mr. Tese said New Jersey officials had contacted his office yesterday, but he was out of the state and was not able to respond. To keep New York from starting its marketing campaign, he said, New Jersey must promise to stop offering New York companies incentives from its new $224 million Economic Recovery Fund.
Mr. Hern said, "That's not a possibility." New Jersey officials have repeatedly insisted that they are not targeting New York companies and that the Economic Recovery Fund is aimed mainly at helping businesses already in the state and at financing construction projects.
"What we're seeing here is a reaction to some very successful and creative positive economic-development programs and they're going to continue," Mr. Hern said. "But again, the commissioner conveyed that we are very interested in continuing to promote regional economic development and development efforts that don't rely on negative campaigning."

HEADLINE: A Ray of Hope From City Hall On Job Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
New data on New York's employment and output of goods and services indicate that the worst of the recession -- which has caused the city to lose 10.7 percent of its jobs since April 1989 -- is over, government and private economists say.
But they caution that the city's economic recovery will lag behind the country's and that there will be no significant increase in jobs soon. Indeed, several economists expect another employment decline in 1993. 
 In interviews and at a City Hall hearing held yesterday by City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, economists said the city would still be plagued by factors that have made New York's recession much more severe than the national slump.
These include cuts in industries like banking, airlines, telecommunications and manufacturing; the exodus of back-office operations, like processing securities transactions or insurance forms, and new technology that enables companies to avoid hiring new workers. Other problems cited included a surplus of office space that promises to stem construction and an inflation rate higher than the national average, which means that the city's cost-competitiveness is still eroding.
 
Data Offer Some Hope
 "We do not yet see a significant upturn," said Elinor B. Bachrach, New York State's deputy comptroller for New York City.
Economists agreed with Ms. Holtzman, however, that October employment data offered some hope.
The total nongovernment jobs in the city increased slightly, by 600 or 4,800, depending on how the figures were seasonally adjusted by two city agencies. John Tepper Marlin, Ms. Holtzman's chief economist, who produced the 4,800 estimate, called it the largest rise since February 1989.
But the number of government jobs fell in October. As a result, Mr. Marlin estimated that total employment rose by only 1,300 in October, which would be the first increase since May 1990, excluding temporary summer jobs. Using a different adjustment, James A. Parrott, chief economist of Mayor David N. Dinkins's Economic Policy and Marketing Group, estimates total employment fell by 200.
Calling the job figures "a ray of hope," Ms. Holtzman said her economists nonetheless predicted that the city would lose 130,000 jobs in 1992 and 50,000 more in 1993. Those figures are a bit higher than what other city and state agencies are forecasting.
 
Total Product Falling Slower
 Rae D. Rosen, former chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank, said that she did not expect employment to have a sustained rise until late 1993, and she doubted that the growth rate would even hit 1 percent in 1994.
Using a new method to calculate the gross city product -- the value of goods and services produced in New York -- Ms. Holtzman's economists said it was falling at a slower rate. Mr. Marlin predicted inflation-adjusted gross city product would shrink 1.5 percent this year and grow 1.4 percent in 1993. He calculated that it fell 5.3 percent in 1991, the largest annual decline since the 1960's.
The new calculation also showed that workers in the city are much more productive than those nationwide. Inflation-adjusted output per employee in the city has risen by an annual average of 2.1 percent since 1974 to a current $77,400. Output per worker grew an average of 0.5 percent in the country to $53,900.
But there is a dark side to the figures. "A big reason the output per worker in New York is so much higher is because many lower-paying, less-skilled jobs in the city have disappeared," Mr. Marlin said.

Upturn Is Seen In Media Spending

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
A prediction for media spending in 1993 foresees noticeable upturns after two disappointing years.
Myers Reports in Parsippany, N.J., an advertising, marketing and media consulting company, made what it described as a bullish forecast in predicting that media spending next year will grow 2 to 3 percent after inflation, or 7 to 8 percent factoring in inflation. 
 Myers expects robust gains in media categories like network cable television, up 13 percent to 15 percent; broadcast network television, up 8 percent to 10 percent; consumer magazines, up 9 percent to 10 percent, and newspapers, up 6 percent to 7 percent.

One model is Western-style capitalism that couples political democracy with free markets. The Poles and Czechs, having accepted the hardship of such "shock therapy," are making this dual freedom work. 
 The other model is the sort of "capitalism with an inhuman face" practiced in China. This allows the old Communist elite to remain in political power while permitting certain free markets to flourish.
Boris Yeltsin and his reformist right-hand man, Yegor Gaidar, want both halves of the freedom enjoyed by Americans.
They are opposed in Moscow by the Civic Union industrialists, who position themselves between the Yeltsin reformers and the nutty nationalists and Communists. These men want authoritarian control of politics and the economy, but with some toleration of private enterprise: "The Chinese people feed themselves," says Arkady Volsky, a longtime Andropov-Brezhnev aide, "and 1.2 billion are living a life of which we can only dream." Some dream.
Those are the two visions in collision in Moscow this week. The anti-reformers are posing as pragmatists who only want to "go slow" in moving toward a free economy. They profess concern for the human hardships in the wrenching away from their old command economy.
Some Westerners -- mainly Gorbophiles who wanted merely restructuring of Communism, not its replacement -- are touting the Volsky faction as moderate, practical and centrist, almost Clintonian in its reasonableness. They delight in Yeltsin's concessions to this China-model crowd as evidence that seeking both halves of freedom's loaf is a mistake for Russians historically hooked on authoritarianism.
Let's not be taken in by the siren song of moderation. The anti-reformers want to stop the privatization of the huge enterprises that ought to be made competitive or shut down. They want to stop the sale of land to farmers and keep agriculture in the inefficient hands of the old collectives. Bring back price control, they say, and let bureaucrats rather than consumers dictate what is produced.
In the first half of this year, reform began to take hold; private plots tripled to 20 million, and today are the bulwark against starvation.
But since July, the Russian Parliament -- 87 percent Communists elected before the attempted coup -- has managed to turn back the reformist clock. Old-timers gained control of the central bank, which promptly decreed that inefficient, state-owned heavy industries needed heavy infusions of cash. The result of this subsidy to hang onto the old elite's influence: Inflation rose from 8 percent a month to 30 percent.
What can the West do to help Russia avert a Tiananmen economy?
Our governments should reschedule the old Soviet debt, taking off a little repayment pressure, and come through on promises of visible humanitarian aid. But private investment, joint ventures, is the answer; that will happen only as Russian reformers win their battle to establish the primacy of private property.
Yeltsin, though he bobs and weaves to avert a coup, knows this. He stopped compromising with the Volsky elite on state control of the oil industry last week, decreeing privatization. The world's largest oil producer is the most inefficient; when Russia opens the profit potential to oil, world business will make it possible for Russia to get back on its feet.
We should know what to root for, and compromise is not it. "Shock therapy works and it works fast," says Anders Aslund, the Swedish economist advising the reformers. But it's not happening now.
We should root for the amalgam of political and economic freedom. That calls for a new constitution followed by elections, and a mandate for private farms and stock ownership of industry.
Maybe Boris Yeltsin, who retains more popular support than any Russian leader, can bring it off. From the sidelines, as we cheer for the success of their reach for freedom, we should at least let the Russian people know that the American model is far better than the Chinese.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Get Cracking on Bosnia

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
The people of Bosnia and the tinderboxes nearby might meditate on two realities: First, President Bush will not order U.S. forces to the rescue. Forget it. Second, President-elect Clinton won't either -- at least not for months. He shows little disposition to walk economics and chew foreign policy gum at the same time. He has barely begun to select his national security team.
Mr. Bush's decision to dispatch troops to Somalia has in no way altered his opposition to American intervention in Bosnia. His senior aides are absolutely clear about that. He just sees too many land mines in Bosnia and no way to get out. 
 Mr. Clinton is unlikely to set his course in Bosnia until weeks after inauguration at the earliest. Which means thousands more dead Bosnians and hundreds of thousands more Bosnian refugees pouring into an already floundering Germany. Which means little prospect of heading off wider Balkan wars in Kosovo and Macedonia. All this portends moral and strategic disaster.
Mr. Clinton should move now to put his senior foreign policy and defense team in place and get them cracking on Bosnia and other world crises. Focusing on the economy is right. But treading water on foreign affairs is dead wrong.
His transition staff for national security cannot do the job of creating policy. It contains few experienced, high-level pros. And these pros have to spend most of their time answering ridiculous press queries about Clinton policies that don't exist, playing footsie with anxious foreign diplomats, taking phone calls from panicky job-seekers and meeting with political allies to keep them from feeling excluded when the moment comes to exclude them.
Sandy Berger, the leader of the transition staff, has commissioned various policy papers from able, senior people. But these papers cannot substitute for the advisers who will form the Clinton National Security Council.
The first task of these senior advisers should be to flesh out Mr. Clinton's promising campaign rhetoric on Bosnia. He talked sensibly about providing arms to Muslims, now virtually defenseless against Serbian attacks. He hinted creatively at bombing attacks against military targets in Serbia to deter Serbs from further aggression. But good thoughts do not a policy make.
Before the Clinton team goes too far down the road on a Balkan policy, it should talk with key Bush aides. The President and his team have been far too cautious, unimaginative and shortsighted on Bosnia. But they have some telling arguments. Clinton advisers should listen and fashion convincing responses.
Mr. Clinton wisely rejects fighting a ground war in Bosnia. Instead, some of his advisers speak of establishing a safety zone there where Bosnians could go for food, shelter and security. Bush aides and Bosnian Muslims -- along with the international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen -- reject this idea. They feel it would legitimize Serbian conquests of Bosnian Muslim territory. But surely a formula can be found to provide for immediate humanitarian needs without compromising long-term negotiating positions.
Bush advisers also fault the Clinton inclination to arm Muslims. They believe, again backed by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, that this will only lead to greater violence and even more Muslim deaths. But there is a trade-off here: a heavy short-term price may be worthwhile to stabilize the battlefield and save lives thereafter.
Bush aides insist that if the U.S. bombs Serbia, as Mr. Clinton may propose, London and Paris will withdraw their humanitarian-relief forces from Bosnia. And so they will, unless Mr. Clinton successfully mounts a risky and ambitious campaign in private and public diplomacy.
Most compellingly, Bush advisers warn that getting into Bosnia will be far easier than getting out. Before taking any action, Mr. Clinton will have to fashion a persuasive plan of limited involvement, explaining what lines he will and will not cross -- then sell it to Americans and to Congress.
After looking at all this, Mr. Clinton may decide it's too late to help Bosnia. If so, he had better stop leading the Bosnian Muslims on, come up with a second line of defense against Serbia in Kosovo and Macedonia and sell that to Congress and the American people.

HEADLINE: With Jobs Scarce, the Neediest Helps the Unemployed

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Kathleen Nairne needs a job.
A conversation with her always returned to that point.
She recently separated from her husband and is trying to raise her two boys by herself after being laid off in June. She just learned that she is pregnant. The family's breakup has shaken her 13-year-old son, who is failing school. 
 But she could easily cope, she said in an interview, if only she had a job.
The recession has carved through the lives of Ms. Nairne and thousands of other New Yorkers out of work for the first time, leaving them dejected, frustrated and with little choice but to turn to charities like those aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Ms. Nairne, 34 years old, sought help from Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, to find a job as a bookkeeper and to pay the security on a cheaper apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn. With frustration etched across her face, she described her quest for employment in the months since she lost her job as an administrator with the New York City Department of Correction.
"I used to have a lot of spunk," she said. "I'm not losing it, but sometimes I get a little depressed. It's one letdown after another. I'm an isolated single person trying to maintain control. But I'm a strong woman, so I'll hold on."
 
A Harsh Toll
 She said she had visited dozens of offices across the city, filling out numerous applications and sitting through a seemingly endless series of interviews. With a degree from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and recommendations from previous employers, she thought she would have little trouble landing a new position. She was wrong.
Msgr. James J. Murray, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, said the recession -- which has driven the unemployment rate in New York City to more than 10 percent -- has taken a harsh toll on people like Ms. Nairne.
"The person who is out of a job for the first time in their lives -- that we are seeing a lot of," he said. "They are not accustomed to seeking help. It's a tough thing for a person to face."
Emanuel Tobier, a professor at the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, said the economic slump has particularly hurt New Yorkers who thought a college degree would prevent them from being unemployed for a lengthy period of time.
"In the early 1970's, if you were educated and lost your job, you could get another one pretty quickly," he said. "Now, you're out of work a lot longer. The apprehension is much greater, as is the pain."
In years of prosperity and in years of despair, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has assisted New Yorkers trying to turn their lives around in the face of adversity. The fund begins its 81st campaign this week as many people across the city go without food, shelter and health care. The Times pays for the fund's overhead so all contributions go directly to seven charities. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
Ms. Nairne said that when she feels discouraged after she receives a rejection letter, she reminds herself that she has two sons who depend on her. But she added that she would have little enthusiasm for life until she could support her family.
"It all boils down to a job," she said.

HEADLINE: Economic Security Rates Higher Status

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In a Nov. 15 editorial you joined the chorus of concern over Bill Clinton's proposed Economic Security Council, warning that "the parallel with national security invites . . . a quick descent into the worst protectionism." 
 In my experience, putting economic considerations on the same plane as national security is long overdue. Time and again, creative trade proposals that made waves diplomatically or geopolitically have failed even to make it to the President's table, because of the domination of the State Department and National Security Council. And I say this as a free-trader, who has taken considerable political heat at home for opposing protectionist trade measures.
A perfect model for the strategic role the Economic Security Council could play is found in the primary dealers amendment to the 1988 trade bill, which targeted Japan's closed market in government securities and threatened retaliation unless barriers came down. The amendment was opposed by N.S.C., State and the rest of the Reagan Administration, which heard only rumblings coming from Tokyo, but Congress prevailed. So far the provision has proved a smashing success, with American firms' share of this major Japanese market rising from zero to 11.3 percent and no need for United States retaliation.
While trade would only be part of the Economic Security Council mission, it is one area where the council could have a salutary effect by helping to make free trade a reality on both sides of the ocean, rather than serving as a stalking horse for protectionism.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Expectations in Somalia

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Many Somalis welcome the imminent American military intervention in their country, but they view the narrowly focused goal of protecting the delivery of food to the destitute as a mere sideshow to what really interests them: an end to the clan violence, economic reconstruction and political reconciliation. And they expect the Americans to deliver on all counts.
This mismatch in expectations, with the Somalis seeing the Americans as the economic and political salvation for their destroyed country and the Americans planning a brief mission designed to avoid any long-term involvement, could turn the operation sour very quickly, Somalis and international aid workers say. 
 Educated Somalis, many of whom have been holed up in their houses in the capital for the last two years while the country was devastated by clan fighting, say the Americans must stay for at least a year to solve the problem of the starving, disarm the population and get political and economic reconstruction going.
They talk of schools being reopened, job training for the armed vagabonds, roads being paved, all under the auspices of the United States.
"The Americans are in for a surprise," said Ahmed Jama, a British- and American-educated former national police chief. "The expectations are very high. The Somalis think they will do a lot of things for them. And if they don't do these things -- deliver the humanitarian food, then disarm the people and then bring people together for political reconciliation -- it will revert to chaos."
It also became clear today that Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, the most aggressive of the Somali clan leaders, had expectations other than food and medical aid for his people when he accepted Washington's proposal last week. General Aidid said he planned military action against a rival clan this weekend at Bardera, one of the worst hit towns in the famine zone.
Bardera, where more than 100 Somalis are dying of hunger and disease daily, is understood to be a chief target for the Americans: a place they would secure and then deliver food to. It is under the control of the forces of Gen. Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, the son-in-law of the deposed president, Mohammed Siad Barre.
Armed attacks by General Morgan's forces on the warehouses stocking food for the International Committee of the Red Cross and CARE, the international aid agency, occur daily at Bardera.
General Aidid said on Somali radio on Wednesday night that he would attack Bardera, 220 miles west of here, unless General Morgan's forces left the town, which they took from General Aidid two months ago. All international aid workers were advised today by Mr. Aidid's office to leave Bardera.
 
Seeks Alliance With U.S.
 Several Somalis said that the ultimatum by General Aidid appeared to reflect a calculation by the Soviet-trained general, who has been weakened by a series of military setbacks, that he could forge an alliance on the ground with the American forces moving into Bardera and thus use them to regain control of the city.
But Somalis said it would not be enough even if the Americans secured Bardera against the predations of either General Morgan or General Aidid, and even if the Americans repeated this process around the country.
Mr. Jama said the long-term goals were even more vital than feeding the hungry. He said that if they were not addressed, the country, which is brimming with weapons and ammunition from the cold war superpowers, would continue "to fight over what is left."
"This coming and going out is not worth it," said the former police chief. "It's just a waste of time. They shouldn't come if that's what it is because when they leave things will spark up again. They should be here for about a year if they are serious about it."
 
Aura of Goodwill
 The aura of goodwill that has enveloped the United States plan and the overwhelming strength of the American military meant the armed clan fighters who roam Mogadishu and the countryside might at first submit, many Somalis said. Mr. Jama predicted only "isolated incidents" of clashes between the Americans and the clan fighters.
But this tolerance would evaporate if the Americans carried off an aggressive aid mission but left a power vacuum that a broader, weaker United Nations force could not replace. Fighters like port security guards would be back, extorting money as they are now, aid workers and Somalis said.
"There will be very negative feelings if the security people from the port are told to leave and offered no alternative," said Abukar Mohammed Dahiye, a CARE official. They would want job training to replace the income they now get through gangsterism, he said.
If the Americans deliver only to the most poorly off 1.5 or so million Somalis and forget the rest of the population, particularly the urban and displaced population of Mogadishu, resentment of the Americans could soon surface.
For now, the Americans wear a mantle of approval because they are deemed far preferable to the United Nations and more likely to improve the situation in Somalia. The United Nations is viewed with contempt for having failed to resolve the food crisis and the lack of security.
 
Enthusiasm May Be Superficial
 The day Mr. Aidid expressed his acceptance of the Americans, one of his supporters, Asli Ahmed Gutaale, the supervisor of a Red Cross kitchen, showed how superficial the enthusiasm for the Americans might be.
"I hope the American troops will not come," she said. "If they come, I will fight them with my mouth. Why don't they help build our own military? They are jobless right now."
And many Somalis bitterly recall that it was Washington, a cold war supporter of Somalia in the 1980's, who delivered planeloads of arms to the forces of Mr. Barre as late as 1988 when his tottering government was staving off a rebellion in Hargeisa, the major city in the northeast.
A former military attache at the United States Embassy, Col. Al Girardi, wrote an assessment not long after leaving Mogadishu in 1989 warning against the kind of American support that many Somalis are appealing for today but that Washington is obviously trying to circumvent.
"Sooner or later, the country will be thrown into prolonged and violent tribal conflict and no amount of U.S. assistance will change this," he wrote.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tried to Support Dollar, Federal Reserve Confirms

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve confirmed yesterday that it had tried to support the dollar against the German mark in the early stages of Europe's currency crisis, but its efforts were largely in vain.
In a quarterly report on its foreign-exchange operations through October, the Fed said that it had acted amid fears in the currency markets that the dollar's decline would accelerate after it hit new lows in response to high German interest rates. 
 The dollar did set a record low of 1.39 marks on Sept. 2, but has since rebounded, to 1.58 marks through yesterday.
The Fed's purchases in August of $1.1 billion in dollars for marks, coordinated with actions by about a dozen other central banks, came as the mark's appreciation began testing the ability of the European monetary system to maintain stable rates. Selling marks and buying dollars would tend to reduce the mark's value and relieve some of the strains.
Currently, renewed pressure against the French franc threatens to tear apart the core group of nations, including Germany, that are striving to preserve Europe's currency mechanism despite the withdrawal of Italy, Britain and Spain.
William J. McDonough, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the manager of its foreign exchange operations, said the United States, in principle at least, remained a supporter of Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
The Fed bought $600 million in dollars for marks on Aug. 7 and Aug. 11, when the dollar declined after a weak employment report. An additional $500 million in purchases came on Aug. 21 and Aug. 24.
The earlier August moves relieved pressure against the dollar only somewhat, without arresting the decline, the Fed said. When the later intervention had no apparent effect, officials decided against further action.

HEADLINE: Gearing for Conference, Clinton Meets With Federal Reserve Chief

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 3

 BODY:
As he faces decisions about dealing with an economy that shows signs of improvement, President-elect Bill Clinton met today with the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and approved the initial guest list for a conference on the economy that has doubled to 215 participants.
Because the Federal Reserve controls interest rates, its chairman, Alan Greenspan, has as much influence over the economy as anyone in the Government. Mr. Clinton summoned him to the Governor's Mansion here for their first meeting since the election one month ago today. 
 "Governor Clinton wanted to meet with Chairman Greenspan to establish a sound working relationship, to talk about the state of the economy and to lay the groundwork for a productive relationship in the future," said George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director.
The Federal Reserve and the Bush White House often clashed because the Administration wanted lower interest rates to stimulate the sagging economy. In the Clinton Administration, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, while it will be important "to preserve the independence of the Fed," it will also be crucial for both sides to have "a common understanding of the economic situation."
 
Some Tension Predicted
 Some analysts have predicted that despite Mr. Greenspan's preference for consensus, there will be tension between the Federal Reserve and the Clinton White House as he seeks to keep inflation in check and the new President proposes legislation intended to stimulate the economy. Mr. Greenspan was appointed chairman by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by President Bush. His term runs until 1995.
Officials said there were no indications that Mr. Clinton would ask Mr. Greenspan to step down as chairman. In the first Presidential debate Mr. Clinton basically endorsed the work of the Federal Reserve System, saying, "Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound."
In their talks today, Mr. Stephanopoulos said the President-elect and Mr. Greenspan discussed Mr. Clinton's goal of "economic growth without heightened inflation." He added, "I don't know if he'll get into specifics on the economic plan, but I think those basic principles will be in discussion."
As Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan met for more than an hour, transition officials were making final decisions about the economic conference, which is growing into a far bigger event than originally contemplated.
Aides said they had juggled the agenda of the two-day conference to accommodate 215 participants instead of the 100 initially planned. They said that they were still crossing off and adding names to the guest list today, and that Mr. Clinton had reviewed the initial list of invitees, which includes ordinary citizens, academics and business executives. The first calls went out today.
 
'Cross Section' Sought
 "We're trying to get a cross section by industry, state, gender and economic approach," said one official involved in the event. "We'll get people who every day deal with the economy."
The conference is not expected to produce any policy statements on the economy, but it is expected to give Mr. Clinton a way to interact with a broad range of people on how to grapple with the economy. No elected officials will be invited, officials said, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the "shadow Senator" representing the District of Columbia, an elected post with no actual authority.
In another sign that the conference is turning into something resembling a mini political convention, officials from ABC and NBC said they were planning to base their major evening news broadcasts from Little Rock during the conference, which will be held on Dec. 14 and 15. CBS officials said they had not decided whether to broadcast from here. But the CNN program "Larry King Live" is planning to broadcast from here.
Tamara Haddad, a vice president of CNN and executive producer of the Larry King program, disputed critics who contend that the networks are helping turn the event into a media spectacle. "All anyone's talking about is how the Clinton Administration's going to handle the economy," she said. "This will be the first chance to see them in action."
 
'Some News to Chew On'Expected Soon
 Mr. Clinton spent the day at the Governor's Mansion, but as he began a morning jog he hinted that his first round of Cabinet appointees would be come soon. "We're getting close," he told reporters, adding that "we're making real progress" and "you all will have some news to chew on in the next few days."
Announcements on major economic posts are expected by the middle of next week, aides said.
In another sign that the election has not discouraged Mr. Clinton from campaigning, his aides announced that he would meet in Chicago on Monday with students at Wilbur Wright Community College, a vocational school. The visit will include a question-and-answer session with the students.
Later on Monday, Mr. Clinton plans to fly to Washington to confer with Congressional leaders and transition officials. There are no plans for him to meet again with President Bush. But Mr. Clinton will pay a courtesy call on William H. Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States, who will swear him in on Jan. 20.
"He wants to pay his respects" to the Supreme Court, Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore also plan to have tea with the Supreme Court Justices while they are in Washington next week.
The encounter, initiated by the Clinton transition team, copies a November 1980 visit that Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, then Vice President-elect, made to the Court.
The Reagan visit was the first by a President-elect to the Supreme Court since the 19th century.

HEADLINE: Hire City Poor In the Suburbs, A Report Urges

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Going against the grain of the most familiar anti-poverty strategies, which focus on urban economies or low-income housing in the suburbs, proponents of a plan to transport inner-city workers to suburban jobs are now bidding for the attention of the incoming Clinton Administration.
The Urban Institute, a Washington research group, is holding a conference here to discuss creating or realigning transportation systems to get the poor out to the suburbs where the jobs are. 
 An Urban Institute consultant, Mark Alan Hughes, presented a report citing four current projects in the Philadelphia, Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas. He said the Federal Government should consider spending $5 million to $10 million on such demonstration projects to see if they make a significant difference for inner-city workers. Unemployment figures in inner-city areas are consistently higher than those in suburbs.
 
'Engines of Employment'
 Using familiar labor-force and population data, Mr. Hughes said at a press briefing today that "the suburbs have become more than nice places to raise the kids; they have become engines of employment growth."
In an interview after the briefing, he said that using transportation initiatives to combat unemployment is an attractive solution, in part because the $150 billion in transportation spending authorized by Congress last year is available for domestic initiatives.
According to the report, The New Metropolitan Reality, written by Mr. Hughes and Julie E. Steinberg, a study of Newark and its suburbs between the years 1970 and 1988 showed thatthe farther from the center of Newark an area was the more job growth it generally had.
Central Newark lost nearly 80,000 jobs during that period, and the area within two miles lost 40,000 more. But areas six miles or more to the west, south and north of downtown gained jobs steadily, with the greatest increases recorded in areas about 16 miles out.
But the data indicate that more than half those jobs were inaccessible via New Jersey mass transit.
"The new metropolis is predicated on mobility, and private automobile travel is how this mobility is realized," the report said. "However, the transportation costs associated with all this mobility are regressive. Participation in work, shopping, schooling and so on requires travel in the modern metropolis. What for most people is a low-density life style becomes for the poor a set of costly barriers."
Whether such barriers can be overcome by making transportation more accessible to the inner-city poor has been a focus of debate for two decades. In his recent book, "The New Politics of Poverty," Lawrence Mead, a New York University political science professor, argues that earlier demonstrations of "reverse commuting" programs in the late 1960's had little or no effect on unemployment in the cities.
"I don't see strong evidence for lack of access to employment -- physical access or other barriers -- sheer lack of jobs, racial bias, or other things," Dr. Mead said in a telephone interview today. "To say this is a major solution is counter to the evidence we have."
But Dr. Hughes, a professor of public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, disagreed. "Some of the most persuasive post-L.A. riot rhetoric says give the poor a greater stake in their communities," he said. "That's the right incentive, but the wrong geography.
"Setting aside the issue of how possible it is to revitalize inner cities, if it works, it's separatist. Why, after a period of 30 years of massive infrastructure investment in the suburban labor market," he asked, should the Government try to replicate that success in the inner cities, where the jobs have been lost.

HEADLINE: Big Retailers Register Modest Sales Gains for November

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Most of the nation's large retailers posted only modest sales gains last month, according to figures released yesterday by big chain stores.
But most Wall Street analysts said the numbers were somewhat deceptive, and did not sound a somber note for the all-important Christmas season.
An index of comparable-store sales at 14 leading retailers compiled by Salomon Brothers rose by 3.8 percent in November, well below the 7.5 percent gain recorded during October. 
 "The first half of the month was sluggish, but things picked up by the third week," Jeff Feiner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said. "And the weekend after Thanksgiving was good and indicative of what we think will be a slowly improving environment."
 Analysts said a number of factors contributed to the poor results early in November, including unusually warm weather in certain parts of the country, which hurt sales of fall and winter merchandise, and consumer preoccupation with the Presidential election.
"Anybody who spoke to these companies early in the month knew then that it was painfully weak," Edward A. Weller, a retail analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said. "But Thanksgiving was good, and we have a strengthening trend."
Even though some underlying economic trends continue to suggest a sputtering recovery -- employment and wage growth both continue to be moribund, for example -- conditions are markedly better now than they were a year ago. That, analysts said, is one reason they are upbeat about the Christmas selling season.
An index of same-store sales at 18 retailers compiled by Alex. Brown & Sons rose just 1.8 percent last December.
Because of the year-to-year comparison and because two extra selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas fall in December, "I think December sales will look unusually good," Robert F. Buchanan, an Alex. Brown analyst, said.
Indeed, if sales "aren't up substantially, it's a bad sign," Mr. Buchanan added, noting that a gain of 5 percent or less would not be good news for retailers or the economy.
"The environment has picked up some," Mr. Buchanan said, "but it is still tough. It's not like shoppers are walking around with a lot of cash out there."
Among individual retailers, analysts said they were particularly impressed with results posted by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., whose same-store sales rose by 7 percent last month; by the J. C. Penney Company, whose sales rose by 5.1 percent, and the Limited Inc., where sales were up by 8 percent.
Chains whose results were poorer than expected were led by the Gap Inc., whose same-store sales were up just 1 percent in November.
 
 
Lower Prices
 "The Gap had a disappointing month," Mr. Weller at Montgomery Securities said. "Part of that is related to the fact that the merchandise they sold was moved at much lower prices than they had planned."
The Gap's results also disappointed investors, and the price of the company's stock slid by 75 cents a share, to $35.375, in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
In addition to the Gap, some analysts said sales results posted by the Woolworth Corporation were unexpectedly bad.
Same-store sales at Woolworth fell by 1.1 percent in November from a year earlier.
The drop in sales may have surprised some outsiders, but Mr. Weller said the decline probably did not raise many eyebrows or concerns within the company.
"Some retailers had been expecting soft sales because they ran so many promotions a year ago," he said. "Woolworth is the best example of that."

HEADLINE: At Plant, Gray Skies and Pink Slips

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EWING, N.J., Dec. 3

 BODY:
Workers on the day shift streamed out of General Motors Inland Fisher Guide plant here today just as gray clouds and a cold wind were moving in from the west. Hours earlier, in a meeting in the plant cafeteria, they had been told that the plant's 2,200 employees would lose their jobs next year.
"G.M. says 'Merry Christmas,' " one worker yelled to waiting reporters. "We'll survive!" called another. Yet another carried a homemade sign that read, "Will work for food." 
 The news did not surprise some workers at the plant, which makes items like door handles, seat adjusters and decorative exterior moldings.
 
'A Hammer Over My Head'
 "I came here on Aug. 27, 1978, and I was told I would not get my 90 days in," said Everett Barber, 39 years old, of Hamilton Township, N.J., a quality operator who builds power-seat components. "So this was a hammer hanging over my head since then. I feel relief now it's over."
Mixed with the relief was bitterness.
"They've been badgering us about company loyalty," Mr. Barber said. "Where's the loyalty to us? I can promise you I own my last G.M. vehicle."
Mr. Barber said that when workers arrived at the plant this morning, they were told that a meeting would be held at 10 A.M. in the cafeteria. "Management came through and they looked like they had just gotten a major whupping," he said. "We knew."
What he did not know was what would happen next. "The questions we asked today, no one had answers to. We're always the last to know."
Across America, in towns like Sioux City, Iowa; Syracuse, and Kalamazoo, Mich., G.M. workers came to work today, only to learn that their jobs would be among 18,000 cuts, and their futures would be in doubt. Under the United Automobile Workers contract, workers might be offered a transfer to another G.M. plant, but with the nation's No. 1 auto maker paring 80,000 jobs over the next few years, actually getting a transfer may be difficult. To make matters worse, the union contract with the company expires next fall.
 
 
Closing Set for '93
 Patricia Molloy, a spokeswoman for Inland Fisher Guide, said the plant was scheduled to close in the third quarter of 1993 although an exact date had not been set. She said the workers were told what was happening before the closing was disclosed to reporters.
Another worker expressed concern about how many people would be hurt.
"I think it's not only sad our standard of living is going to go down, but the entire community is going to suffer from this," said Karen Restuccio, 37, of Roebling, N.J. "A big corporation like General Motors won't be around to pump money into the economy."
When asked if this would make her Christmas difficult, Ms. Restuccio said, "We were prepared for it." She added: "I live alone, but I'm a homeowner, so I'm kind of worried there. But there's always a way."
When asked what her way might be, Ms. Restuccio replied, "It might be two jobs, but if that's what it has to be, that's what has to be."
 
A Personal Plea
 Pete Janora, 50, of Trenton, a tool and die maker, approached a reporter and said he had something to say. Mr. Janora produced his own statement, handwritten on a small white piece of paper. An American flag had been drawn at the bottom.
"It's not just this plant that's having trouble," he read. "Everyone has to worry and realize that we're losing manufacturing throughout this country, plant by plant, and industry by industry. Everyone can't work for the Government and have Government services. The Japanese and other foreign countries are in an undeclared war with us. It's time for all Americans to wake up and protect what our fathers, our grandfathers, and their fathers fought and died for."
Jeff Bintz, president of United Automobile Workers Local 731, which represents workers here, was unavailable for comment. Bob Wieger, financial secretary of the local, said Mr. Bintz would be unable to return reporters' calls today because he had planned to spend Thursday meeting with union members at the plant, which is across Parkway Avenue from the union hall.
"He's on the floor right now, talking to the workers," Mr. Wieger said, "which is where he should be."
Guy Messina, another U.A.W. official, took some hope from the fact that jobs would remain at G.M.'s assembly plant in Linden, N.J. That plant is being remodeled to allow the assembly of three new truck models, a midsize truck and two four-wheel-drive utility vehicles.
"I'm hopeful that the new president of G.M. will do what he did in Europe and go to three shifts of production," said Mr. Messina, who is shop chairman for U.A.W. Local 595, which represents workers at the Linden plant. "If that happens, we can accommodate some of our brothers and sisters from Ewing."

HEADLINE: Insurers' Turnaround on Health Benefits Only Opens New Set of Questions

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's election has been interpreted by the health-care industry as a referendum for sweeping change. Factions recently at war now seem to be falling into line. But the growing consensus is on general philosophical principles, not the details, which still present big obstacles to final agreement on how to provide health care to everyone at reasonable cost.
On Nov. 9, six days after the Presidential election, business executives, hospital trustees and leaders of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association offered to cooperate with Mr. Clinton in writing legislation to revamp the health-care system. 
 On Wednesday, in a break from past practice, the Health Insurance Association of America, representing 270 commercial insurers, called for a new law requiring insurance coverage of all Americans. As a way to control costs, the insurers said they would welcome a limit on the open-ended tax subsidy for health insurance bought by employers for their employees.
After the promise of jobs and economic growth, health care was the biggest issue in Mr. Clinton's campaign, and his election has changed the political landscape for action on the issue. In the last Congress, Democrats could not agree among themselves on a national health plan, and there was even more disagreement between Congress and the White House.
But now, with the Bush Administration dying and the Clinton Administration still unborn, the sounds emanating from Washington are melodious and harmonious.
Frederick H. Graefe, a Washington lawyer who specializes in health-care policy, said: "The vote by the directors of the Health Insurance Association is a simple reflection of political reality. They're reading the tea leaves after they got hit with a 2-by-4. Their proposal indicates where policy is headed in the next Congress."
Mr. Graefe said that several companies recently announced plans to withdraw from the trade group "because of the seeming intransigence of the Health Insurance Assocation in coming to grips with political reality."
The political reality is complex and elusive. For consumers, health care is a pocketbook issue. The cost of health care and health insurance has been rising twice as fast as other consumer prices. But for middle-income families with health insurance, there is no prospect of immediate relief under the changes proposed by Mr. Clinton and the health insurance industry. Indeed, the middle class might be asked to make some sacrifices for which it has not been politically prepared.
The changes would be gradual. Prices would rise more slowly. Some consumers would have to sacrifice some of their freedom to choose doctors and hospitals. Under the industry proposal, millions of Americans who get health insurance from their employers would have to pay higher taxes.
Karen M. Ignagni, director of employee benefits at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: "Middle-class workers with comprehensive health benefits will just say no to higher taxes. They have borne the burden of rising health-care costs for too long to accept this solution. They paid very dearly for the health benefits they now have. They sacrificed wages to get and maintain those health benefits."
Mr. Clinton has not said whether he wants to tax a portion of employee health benefits, as many economists recommend. Any effort to do so would fracture the coalition of his supporters.
Economic theorists say the tax code encourages employers to buy too much health insurance and encourages workers to use too much health care. Employees see the problem differently. Many workers are now paying more for less coverage than they once had.
Kevin E. Moley, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the election of Mr. Clinton had scared members of the health-care industry into being more flexible.
"They no longer have the comfort of knowing that George Bush as President will veto stupid legislation," said Mr. Moley, who used to work for an insurance company. "They are confronted with Governor Clinton, who is very activist, believes in a strong role for the central Government and is willing to play with the levers of power in Washington."
In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to impose an annual limit on all health spending, public and private. Many health-care businesses and insurers oppose this type of constraint, known as "a global budget," and they are frantically seeking alternatives to control costs.
"If you are confronted with a President who wants global budgets, then the idea of a tax cap on the deductibility of health insurance costs is far more palatable by virtue of its being an alternative to something that is out-and-out awful," Mr. Moley said.
Congress and the nation are far from consensus on how to reorganize the delivery of health care, and there are hundreds of unanswered questions, including these:
*What will be in the basic package of benefits promised to all Americans?
*Will elderly people be entitled to all the benefits they now get under Medicare?
*Will the Government regulate drug prices? Will a new Federal agency be needed to regulate health insurance?
*Must antitrust laws be amended to let hospitals cooperate in eliminating the duplication of costly services?
*If every American must buy private health insurance, what becomes of Medicaid, the program for poor people? What becomes of veterans' hospitals? The Indian Health Service?
Consumer groups are skeptical of the health insurers' latest proposal. Rhoda H. Karpatkin, president of Consumers Union, said the proposal would help break "a logjam of unrelenting resistance to real reform." But she added, "This is a plan by the insurance industry to save itself without solving the underlying causes of our health-care crisis."
The sudden burst of interest in health-care legislation reflects political and economic pressure built up over more than a decade.
Many critics of President Bush, including some Republicans, say he did political damage to himself by virtually ignoring the health-care issue from 1989 through 1991, as medical prices soared and millions of people lost health insurance coverage.
White House officials expressed irritation with anyone who tried to prod them into action. They shunned officials of the American Medical Association after an editorial in the Journal of the A.M.A. declared in May 1991 that there was "an aura of inevitability to national health-care reform."
Mr. Clinton will soon be tested. Unless he pays close attention to the myriad details of health legislation in the next four years, he is unlikely to fulfill his campaign promise of "controlling health costs and covering all Americans."

HEADLINE: Fed Action On Rates Is Unlikely

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Sounding more upbeat about the economy than they have all year, Federal Reserve officials said in interviews this week that they were not likely to change interest rates in the near future.
Speaking with unusual candor, the officials said that they were so pleased about the robust economic growth of the third quarter that they had no plans to cut interest rates soon and that they were so happy with the low inflation rate that they saw no need to raise rates either. 
 "I don't think there are compelling reasons at the moment for dramatic policy changes one way or the other," said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor.
In the view of one Fed official, the Fed and President-elect Bill Clinton are engaged in a "mating dance," each seeking not to offend the other.
 
Greenspan and Clinton Meet
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was in Little Rock, Ark., today, meeting with Mr. Clinton for the first time since Election Day. The chairman has refused to talk publicly about economic developments, but his recent speeches have been optimistic about inflation, although cautious about growth prospects.
No change in Fed policy would be good news for Mr. Clinton, who is contemplating measures to stimulate the economy that would increase the budget deficit, in the short term at least.
The Fed governors remain hostile to the notion of short-term stimulus, and this week they were even more antagonistic than two months ago, because of the strong 3.9 percent growth in the third quarter.
"At this point, I'd say I am encouraged about prospects and consequently less inclined to think there is room for fiscal stimulus," Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a telephone interview.
"We're not seeing pressures on the wage side," Susan Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor, said. "The overcapacity will continue to allow room for production increases without putting price pressures on the economy."
Fed officials indicated there would be no automatic increase in rates if Mr. Clinton decided to create jobs by raising the deficit. But they also said there was no need to cut rates further to spur growth.
David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said economic growth appeared to be strengthening gradually, although he, like most economists, said fourth-quarter growth would likely be weaker than the third quarter's.
Speaking about growth rates in 1993, Mr. Mullins said, "it could be anywhere from the high 2's to the mid-3's." That would compare with 2.8 percent so far this year, and should translate soon into higher employment.
Another Fed governor, Lawrence D. Lindsey, said, "A large number of fundamentals have fallen into place to suggest that conditions are there for sustained recovery." He noted that corporate profits and productivity were up. But the governors are also worried about consumer debt and slow European growth, which will hurt American exports.
As for the President-elect's policy plans, the interviews made clear that some officials are more hostile to stimulus than others, but most believe it could be counterproductive.

HEADLINE: K.J. Oberman, 62, Manager of Funds For Oppenheimer

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Kenneth J. Oberman, who managed the top-performing mutual fund in the United States last year, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 62 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
He died of Hodgkin's disease, his family said. 
 Mr. Oberman was senior vice president of the Oppenheimer Management Corporation in Manhattan and was the director of its Global Equity Investments. His responsibilities at his death included Oppenheimer's Global Fund, Global Bio-Tech Fund and Gold and Special Minerals Fund, with total assets exceeding $1.3 billion.
The Bio-Tech Fund rose 121 percent last year, ranking first among 2,400 mutual funds. It lost part of that gain this year with the general slump in biotechnology stocks.
Before last year's spectacular performance, Mr. Oberman turned in other strong results. While he managed Oppenheimer's AIM Fund in 1985, it rose 49 percent, ranking 10th among all funds. The Global Fund, which has more than $1 billion in assets, jumped 49 percent in 1985 and 46 percent in 1986.
Mr. Oberman was a booster of biotechnology companies' potential for scientific discoveries and financial growth. "This is the stuff that dreams are made of," he once said. He was also an expert in international investments, especially in Europe.
He worked at Oppenheimer for 12 years. Before that he was at Dreyfus for seven years, where he was the portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Fund and the Dreyfus Third Century Fund. Earlier, he was a vice president and research director at Delphi Management and at Model Roland.
Mr. Oberman was born in Brooklyn. He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's in economics from the University of California at Berkeley and another economics degree from the University of Stockholm.
He served in the Army from 1951 to 1953 in Korea and Finland and reached the rank of sergeant.
His wife of 24 years, Gretchen White, a lawyer, died in 1979.
He is survived by two daughters, Claire M. of Brooklyn, and Anneli of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Theodore of Brooklyn, and a stepmother, Jeanne Oberman of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: First Time Jobless Claims Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time unemployment claims decreased in mid-November for the seventh decline in the last nine weeks, the Labor Department said today.
Separately, factory orders rose 1.7 percent in October, the largest gain in four months, while the productivity of workers increased 3 percent in the July-September quarter. 
 Today's reports suggest that widespread layoffs are tapering off while the economy struggles to recover from the recession. Analysts had expected a smaller decline in jobless claims and a bigger gain in factory orders. Productivity was within expectations.
 
 
'It's Not Horrible'
 "We're struggling along at a moderate rate of growth," said Marco Babic, an economist at Evans Economics, a consulting firm in Washington. "It's not horrible. I don't think the doomsayers have too much going for them."
The decrease of 12,000 jobless claims to a seasonally adjusted 362,000 in the week ended Nov. 21 follows a 12,000 drop, to 374,000 last week.
The level of claims was the lowest since 355,000 in the week ended Oct. 31 and was "considerably stronger than expected, suggesting clear improvement in labor markets," Stone & McCarthy Research Associates said.
However, the four-week moving average for jobless claims, a less volatile barometer of employment conditions, climbed to 369,250 in the latest reporting week from 368,750.
In addition, 23,289 workers in 52 states filed under a separate emergency program providing extended jobless benefits in the week ended Nov. 21, the Government said.
This suggests the overall level of claims hovered near 380,000. During the previous week, there were 21,005 claims filed under the emergency program.
In today's report, 46 states and territories, led by Michigan with almost 15,000 layoffs in the auto industry, reported increases in jobless claims. Seven states reported decreases, led by Ohio.
The 1.7 percent increase in factory orders in October follows a 1.3 percent gain during September as demand for durable goods -- expensive items made to last three or more years -- rose while demand for nondurable goods fell, the Commerce Department said.
Factory inventories, a barometer of consumer demand for goods, decreased one-tenth of 1 percent in October after rising three-tenths of 1 percent in September.
Meanwhile, the revised increase in nonfarm productivity shows that people who did not lose their jobs during the recession worked longer and harder to compensate for laid-off workers.
Productivity, the output per hour of a worker, is vital to improving production without raising labor costs or inflation. It also makes American exports more competitive.
The rise in nonfarm productivity in July, August and September, first reported as a 2.6 percent gain, follows a 1.7 percent increase in April, May and June, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: College Students Accused of Electronic Tax Fraud

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMPTON, Va., Nov. 27

 BODY:
About 40 students at a private college in Virginia and 50 of their friends are being investigated on suspicion of committing a new kind of fraud that was created when the Government introduced its electronic income-tax filing system seven years ago.
Officials say the students were taught how to defraud professional tax-preparation services and banks by filing phony returns, complete with forged wage statements and other supporting documents, and then pocketing bank loans arranged by the services in anticipation of tax refunds. 
 The scheme worked for a while because of an Internal Revenue Service policy that allows taxpayers filing electronically to mail supporting documents later, so by the time the returns are found to be fraudulent, the bank checks have been cashed.
In Virginia, officials said, most people in the group learned how to participate from a student who, in turn, had heard about it from a relative. The officials did not say what the source of the forged documents was. But as more and more students and others became involved, it became what investigators say is one of the largest fraud cases of its kind.
 
Trying to Keep Up
 "Our challenge is to not only keep up with the technology but to keep up with the crooks," said the prosecutor in the case, Richard Cullen, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
The I.R.S. said that in the first nine months of 1992, fraud was discovered on 12,333 electronic returns, more than double the number in the previous year, representing $33 million in refunds. The number of cases detected in 1992 does not include the 90 people in the Virginia case, in which they are accused of filing more than $230,000 in false refund claims.
Apart from its size, the group is also unusual in that most of its members had never filed income tax returns before and took advantage of the system, in part, because they were familiar with the technology needed to produce the phony documents. Investigators said that for the most part, previous schemes have involved people with histories of fraud.
 
It Seemed Easy
 Felicia D. German, a premedical student at Hampton University on the Virginia coast who is accused of taking part in the scheme, said a friend had told her that many students had made money without being caught.
"You had all these people who had gotten money," Miss German said in an interview. "Time had passed, and nothing had happened. When you hear it's so easy, it's easy to get caught up."
The I.R.S. introduced computerized filing in three cities in 1986. The program was phased in elsewhere but not available nationally until 1990. This year, 11 million people, or 9 percent of taxpayers, filed returns electronically. The I.R.S. expects the number to be 25 million by the year 2000.
Officials said they had been caught off guard by the high level of electronic fraud, which now accounts for more fraud than paper returns. The agency has begun holding seminars on how to detect such claims, particularly by examining supporting documents.
And for tax returns for 1993, the I.R.S. has announced a change in the handling of electronic filings that a spokesman said will make it harder to get loans made in anticipation of refunds.
 
The Trail Cools Quickly
 In the past, the I.R.S. computer compared a filer's Social Security number to debtors' lists and then sent a signal to a tax preparer as a preliminary indication that a return would be accepted for processing. The firms have relied on that signal in evaluating refund applications, and that has given people the opportunity to collect the bank loans before the I.R.S. detects the fraud.
"By the time we get there, often the trail is cold and the checks are cashed," said Phil Xanthos, the I.R.S. branch chief of criminal investigations in Los Angeles.
The authorities said that in these cases the losses are absorbed by the lending banks by agreement with the commercial preparers. The service is immensely popular; at one of the largest commercial services, H & R Block, more than 90 percent of electronic filers accept the company's offer of "Rapid Refund" loans.
Harry W. Buckley, president of H & R Block's tax operations division, said the industry was so concerned about the fraud schemes that competing preparers are sharing information, the first instance of cooperation that he can remember.
Miss German, one of the Hampton students, said she had learned about the scheme from a classmate after she saw fictitious wage forms stacked in his apartment. The forms had been produced on a word processor. The classmate, Steven E. Morgan of Chicago, said in court papers accompanying his guilty plea that he had learned about the scheme from his roommate's brother. Investigators said other people became involved through conversations with friends, and they said many of the conversations led back to Mr. Morgan.
 
'No College Prank'
 The lawyer for nine of the students, Dr. John J. Rice, a Hampton associate professor with a part-time law practice, said they were "quite naive."
"Some of these people had never filed a tax return before," Dr. Rice said. "They thought the worst thing that could happen was than they would have to repay the money."
But Mr. Cullen, who is prosecuting the students on counts that each call for one to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, asserted that the scheme was "no college prank."
"They were greedy, and they're going to pay for it," he said.
In their filings, made from January to March, the students made up jobs, mainly at two area businesses whose employer numbers they knew, and claimed $2,400 to $2,800 in refunds for each claim. The refunds were increased by more than $1,000 each by claiming newborn children, a status that qualified a student for tax credits as head of a household and as a low-income parent.
"It's something they discovered could slip through the cracks," said Paul W. Littman, president of the Hampton franchise of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.
 
'No Cleverness at All'
 Most of the students used their own names and Social Security numbers, and in several cases a student went to one tax-preparation office to file returns under different names, prosecutors and tax-preparers said. But after many similar claims were received, preparers at Jackson Hewitt became suspicious and decided to examine supporting documents more closely.
"There was no cleverness at all," Mr. Littman said. "It's actually a pretty rude scheme. Anyone who files a false return under their own Social Security number has no understanding of the system."
"You had all these students who had babies in 1991, and they all had about the same incomes," said Mr. Buckley of H & R Block. "When you called the employers, you found that they'd never worked there."
Mr. Morgan, a former midshipman in the Navy Reserve Officers' Training Corps, was expelled from Hampton and later enrolled in Norfolk State University. He pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Norfolk to one felony count of conspiracy to defraud the I.R.S. In October, he was ordered to make restitution and to report to prison after Christmas to begin serving an 18-month sentence.
Miss German was linked to the scheme by an investigator who had copied her license-plate number as she drove a student to file a bogus return. A fourth-year student from Montgomery, Ala., Miss German left Hampton and enrolled in Norfolk State this fall.
She said she had been offered a bargain in which she would plead guilty to the felony of conspiring to defraud the I.R.S. by filing a false tax refund claim. If she refused, she could be indicted by a grand jury and would face a trial.
"I'm stalling," she said. "I don't know what I'm hoping for. I guess I'm waiting to see what other people do."
 
Other Pleas Expected
 Several other students are expected to sign plea agreements in mid-December, a Federal official said. The official said prosecutors are pursuing more than 50 related cases.
A Justice Department spokeswoman said that last year, before the students were discovered, 65 people were indicted in a dozen states on charges of filing 1,850 falsified electronic returns for refunds totaling $4 million.
Other electronic-filing schemes have often used the names and Social Security numbers of people who otherwise would not file -- homeless or unemployed people, for example, or workers with very small incomes and no tax obligation. Some fraud rings recruit the people to fill out returns, and then the organizers collect most of the refund.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Steady Business In Temporary Jobs

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr

 BODY:
THE temporary-help industry stands at the front line of an economic recovery, and the news from the front is encouraging these days.
When business begins to pick up, companies tend to be cautious at first, renting temporary workers instead of rehiring permanent ones -- a labor-market phenomenon that seems well under way. The number of workers employed by temporary-help companies has been running about 14 percent ahead of last year since May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 The big three suppliers of temporary workers -- Manpower Inc., Kelly Services Inc. and the Olsten Corporation -- report that revenues in recent months are up 15 percent or more over last year's levels. Profits are expected to increase even more sharply. And the rebound looks anything but temporary. Analysts predict that the earnings of the industry's three leaders will nearly double over the next two years.
The brightening outlook for the temporary-help industry has as much to do with the structural changes in corporate America as with the improvement in the economy. The fashion among big companies has been to strip down to a "core" work force to cut costs, and let outsiders do clerical and back-office work, data processing and other fairly routine chores.
The slimming down at big companies, which continues, is a key reason why permanent jobs have not come back despite recent signs of a recovery. "We are certainly a beneficiary of the reluctance to rehire in corporate America," said Mitchell Fromstein, president of Manpower. The company, based in Milwaukee, is the nation's largest supplier of temporary workers.
Other pluses for the industry are that the temporary-help companies have done a good job keeping their expenses under control without eviscerating their national networks of offices. In short, they should enjoy a rapid rise in profits when business picks up. Finally, as the economy strengthens and demand for temporary workers increases, the suppliers should be under less pressure to cut prices on big corporate contracts, which became standard practice during the slump as temp companies fought to hold onto their shares of the market.
"It's a very positive picture for the temporary-help companies," said Judith Scott, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee.
Yet there is one big caveat: the uncertain course of this economic recovery. For the temporary-help industry, as with the general economy, there has been a false dawn or two. In late 1991 and early 1992 when there were signs of strength, stock prices rose, but then the incipient recovery faltered.
By most accounts, however, the improvement appears stronger and more durable this time, with a magnified impact on the industry's profits. In the last few months, for example, Mr. Fromstein of Manpower says revenues from his company's 880 offices in the United States are 15 percent ahead of last year, but operating profits are 30 percent ahead. Manpower's stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed yesterday at $14.675, up 12.5 cents.
A near-term problem for Manpower is that more than half its business comes from abroad, mainly Western Europe, where the economy remains weak. Most analysts say this may be an advantage in the long run, but they expect Europe's doldrums to slow the pickup in the company's earnings. Ms. Scott, for example, estimates that the company's profits of 55 cents a share, or $40 million, this year will rise gradually to 75 cents a share, or $55 million, in 1993. In 1994, however, she expects a sharper rise, to $1.10 a share, or $81 million.
Kelly Services, based in Troy, Mich., is the second-largest temporary-help company. It does nearly all its business in the United States, so it should benefit more quickly from an American recovery, analysts say. And after moving to a more decentralized structure and bringing in new managers in the last two years, Kelly, a laggard in the industry's nascent recovery, may finally be positioned to rebound.
John Larson, an analyst for Barrington Research Associates, estimates that Kelly's profits for this year -- $1.25 a share, or $38 million -- will increase next year to $1.60 a share, or $48 million. In 1994, he estimates earnings of $2.15 a share, or $65 million. The recent optimism about Kelly has prompted a jump in its share price from about $32 at the end of October to $41.25 yesterday in over-the-counter trading, up 37.5 cents for the day.
The run-up in Kelly's stock price has caused some analysts to say that at roughly 26 times next year's estimated earnings, the price is high. "I like the company, but it looks pricey to me," said Mr. Larson, who changed his recommendation on Kelly from "buy" to "hold" when its share price moved above $40.
Of the industry's Big Three, Olsten, based in Westbury, L.I., has shown the most consistent profit performance during the downturn, helped by its large stake in the recession-resistant home health-care market. Olsten acquired Upjohn Healthcare Services for $58 million in December 1990, increasing Olsten's network of health-care offices by 200, to more than 275 offices. The division supplies workers to the growing market for home health care and supplemental staffing for hospitals and nursing homes.
The company's shares, which trade on the American Stock Exchange, were up 87.5 cents yesterday, to $35.75.
Olsten's profits have increased by 40 percent during the first three quarters of this year. "And if I had to pick one of these stocks that will do best over the next year," Mr. Larson said, "it would probably be Olsten."

HEADLINE: As Immigrants Face Crises, Neediest Cases Fund Helps

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Irma Contreras need only wander the aisles of a supermarket near her apartment in the Bronx to remind herself of why she left her small village in Honduras. The seemingly endless displays of milk and meat and produce piled high put into perspective the sacrifices she made to escape the poverty of her homeland and bring her six children to the United States.
Sometimes she appreciates the reminder. Like many of the more than one million immigrants who have settled in the five boroughs since 1980, she has faced crises as she has tried to start a new life in a land where work is often less plentiful than food in the local supermarket. 
 Since she arrived from Honduras in 1984 after separating from her husband, Ms. Contreras, 41 years old, had never been without work, mainly child care or housekeeping, until the last few months. But as the recession wiped away jobs, she turned to the Community Service Society of New York for help in paying her rent and feeding her children. She has also received legal and financial assistance to obtain her green card so that she can seek work that is more permanent. The society is one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which has begun its 81st annual campaign this week.
In an interview in her tidy apartment in the Highbridge section, Ms. Contreras spoke of her difficulties in finding a job. But she added that she was determined to remain in the United States with her family so her children -- who range in age from 10 to 24 -- would know English and receive a proper education. That, above all, was her goal.
"I want the best for them," she said in Spanish. "I don't want them to be like me, doing housework."
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund was established in 1911, a year when New York City was also being flooded by immigrants. Then, as now, charities confronted growing responsibilities as they tried to aid both newcomers and those who had lived all their lives in this country.
These days, the seven charities linked to the fund are struggling because government aid and donations have leveled off at a time when immigration is at flood levels.
"What continues to stretch us very thin is the fact that at the same time that we are trying to deal with the increased needs of the indigenous population, we have a major responsibility for immigrant resettlement in New York," said Stephen Solender, executive vice president of United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, a Neediest charity.
This year's Neediest campaign will end on Feb. 28. The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions go directly to the charities.
Ms. Contreras said that even though she has depleted her savings and has had to seek help from the Community Service Society, she was still able to draw strength from the success of Maria, her 18-year-old daughter, who has recently graduated from high school and is planning to attend college.
"There are times when one has, and there are times when one doesn't have," she said, voicing the resilience of a woman who has often gone hungry to feed her children. "But all in all, New York has been good for me and good for my family."

HEADLINE: New York Pursues Truce In Job War With Trenton

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
New York State suggested yesterday that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey coordinate negotiations between the two states in an attempt to end their fight over New Jersey's increasing use of financial incentives to try to lure companies from New York.
Jon Shure, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, said, "the idea of talking certainly interests us." 
 But there was no sign that New Jersey officials were willing to yield to New York's demands. Officials in Trenton repeated their view that they are neither specifically aiming for nor actively soliciting New York companies.
"We feel what we're doing is consistent with a state's obligation to promote itself, and we don't feel that we are in any kind of war with New York," said Barbara W. McConnell, New Jersey's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development. If New York "wants to reach out and have discussions, that is certainly not unacceptable," she added. "But we're not at war, so we don't see what there is to negotiate."
 
'Come to a Resolution'
 Vincent Tese, New York State's Director of Economic Development, said he hoped the talks could begin within a week. "We've got to come to a resolution pretty quick," or New York will carry out its plans to retaliate against New Jersey, he said. "We don't think a border war is in the best interest of the region, nor either state."
While New York officials have also expressed some concern about some new Connecticut incentives, there were no plans yesterday to ask Connecticut to participate in the talks.
New York officials say New Jersey has used incentives that have enticed businesses from New York or forced New York to pay more in incentives to keep them. Unless New Jersey relents, they have vowed to begin a campaign by mid-December to solicit New Jersey companies in the hope that New Jersey will have to pay more to keep its companies.
Mr. Tese said a major thrust of the campaign would be to persuade New Jersey companies to move to Orange and Rockland Counties. New York State has an 8,000-acre business park near Newburgh next to the Stewart International Airport.
 
'In a Very Good Position'
 "We're calling on the Port Authority to get people together to avert a very unpleasant situation," said Mr. Tese, who is the authority's vice chairman. Noting that the two states work on transportation and development issues on a daily basis at the authority, he said, "The Port Authority is in a very good position to bring some sense and some reason to this particular situation."
An agency of the two states, the authority operates the World Trade Center in Manhattan, ports, the three major airports in the New York metropolitan area, the PATH railroad under the Hudson River and tunnels and bridges between the two states.
While the authority's mission -- to foster regional development and cooperation -- makes it seem a logical forum for trying to resolve the dispute, it is also in an uncomfortable position.
Saying his organization was happy to help, Richard C. Leone, the authority's chairman, added, "I'm not exactly delighted that we're caught in the middle of this one." A New Jerseyan who was State Treasurer in the 1970's, Mr. Leone served in the 1980's as managing director of Dillon Reade & Company, the investment bank, and as president of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
New York officials say the main issue is New Jersey's use of its new $224 million Economic Recovery Fund to finance incentives to lure New York companies to New Jersey. New York officials are angry that bonds that New Jersey sold to finance the fund will essentially be repaid from New Jersey's share of rental income from 2.1 million square feet in the World Trade Center.
 
'91 Agreement
 Mr. Tese repeated yesterday that New York officials believe that New Jersey's incentives violate the spirit of both the compact establishing the Port Authority and a limited nonaggression agreement signed in 1991 by New York State, New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut.
New York's share of the World Trade Center money is going into the state's general fund. Referring to the state's recent budget problems and cut in personal income taxes, Mr. Tese said New York's use of the money included "budget relief to reduce taxes."
Yesterday New Jersey officials repeated their position: under the World Trade Center agreement, each state is free to use the money as it wants. Admitting that New Jersey had not violated any legal agreement, Mr. Tese repeated that he nonetheless wants New Jersey to promise not to use the Economic Recovery Fund to woo New York businesses. He said he did not mind if New Jersey continued to offer such incentives to businesses in other states.
But New Jersey officials said his proposal was not feasible. "I'm more than willing to listen to any reasons for doing that, but I've got no reasons today anyway to draw those kinds of restrictions around the fund," said Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of New Jersey's Economic Development Authority.
Mr. Tese said he would also try to make future deals clearly stipulate that neither state may use funds involving the Port Authority to finance marketing or incentive programs that harm the other.
The Port Authority's board has six members from New York and six from New Jersey. Stanley Brezenoff, the authority's executive director, was First Deputy Mayor of New York City in the Koch administration.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
The Dreams From Fields Of the Past Are Saved

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
FOR decades, Coles Roberts and his family have been the stewards of about 300 acres of the other New Jersey, the one you don't see from the Turnpike.
Mr. Roberts grew apples. At one point he farmed a forest of apple trees, 14,000 strong and sturdy trees whose well-fed roots and well-pruned limbs produced the blossoms that attracted the bees that pollinated the flowers that became those little green knobs that grew into those bulging Red Delicious and Rome Beauties that left his land by the ton to feed the fruit needs of countless consumers all over (not to mention his homemade hot cider). 
 Farming is hard work, like anything worthwhile, farm fathers told their children for generations. You take care of the soil, and the soil will take care of you; you nurse an apple tree through a decade of infancy and adolescence, and it'll produce for you for a third of a century.
"I love the outdoors," says Mr. Roberts, "working with my hands and machines to help things grow and mature." But the 66-year-old Mr. Roberts isn't farming anymore. It got too hard and too expensive. His son, Sid, chose a future in computers, which don't make anything but don't take a decade to get going, either. Last spring when a hard frost annihilated this year's crop, the senior Mr. Roberts just gave up.
Now he's the curator of the two-year-old New Jersey Museum of Agriculture here, working to preserve the state's agricultural heritage through an eclectic collection of old farm machinery, tools, imagination and not a few scraped knuckles. Preserving a farming heritage isn't easy either in the face of modern-day lack of interest.
Farming is probably not the first image that springs to the minds of most Americans when someone mentions the nation's most heavily urbanized state, except perhaps for tank farms. But agriculture and ancillary services like grist mills were the principal reasons why many Garden State towns grew up where they did. (The parkway exits came later.)
This is, for instance, the 100th anniversary of the first parcel-post shipment of baby chicks in the United States. That first batch journeyed from Frenchtown, N.J., to Chicago in a special incubator. And while that event is obviously not as worthy of a postage stamp as, say, the cultural contributions of Elvis Presley, it did help inaugurate New Jersey's poultry industry. Once, New Jersey was the nation's chicken-egg capital. Once, chickens were so important here that they tattooed each one to combat rustling. Once, New Jersey's chickens were cause for local pride, not chuckles. Now, the state is better known for producing Bruce Springsteen.
That's where museums come in, as producers of perspective, institutional reminders of what once was. New Jersey agriculture may seem invisible, but museum visitors (Wednesdays through Sundays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.) learn it remains a multibillion-dollar business, especially in sod, nurseries, vegetables and even pond fish-farming. Cranberries will remain big, too, until someone conjures a more lucrative use for those bogs.
The museum, just off an old farm-to-market road called U.S. 1, contains two floors of machinery, photos and hands-on exhibits that come alive when Jennifer Martin demonstrates how brooms are made, how butter is churned or how ubiquitous corn is, even in urban lives. Sometimes they turn on that original incubator and hatch some eggs. There's a history of nails, a blacksmith shop, old milk wagons and tractors.
That's Mr. Roberts's favorite part. "I love antique machinery," he says. "We take it apart and clean it and imagine what the oldtimers were thinking when they designed it. Then we help it run again. Their work can seem pretty primitive, but so will ours, too, someday."
Mr. Roberts and his co-volunteers Charlie Broy and Martin Decker are particularly excited about an old grain drill recently uncovered in Elizabeth Blauvelt's big dairy barn up in Franklin Lakes. The machine was built when Theodore Roosevelt was President. With new housing closing in, Mrs. Blauvelt is selling her last 11 acres and moving to New Hampshire.
However, thanks to the perverse economics pervading so many aspects of American life, Mr. Roberts can still work his 300 acres, in a way. He's cutting down the remainder of the 14,000 apple trees on his Burlington County farm and turning them into firewood for the Saturday-evening enjoyment of approaching suburbia.
Clearing the land also has the possible advantage of increasing its value for that inevitable day when the developer's lawyer wipes his shiny shoes at the old farmhouse door. The sales contract will no doubt include the right to scrape off the former farm's rich topsoil for sale elsewhere. That's the usual procedure in the continuing disassembly of country culture, in New Jersey and beyond.

 BODY:
A surge of demand in late November pushed auto sales to the healthiest level in recent months, as sales of domestically built cars rose 14.5 percent and domestically built light trucks rose 37.4 percent.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 7.3 million from Nov. 21 to Nov. 30, up sharply from 5.8 million in mid-November and 5.6 million in the first third of the month. 
 "Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers defintely have been witnessing the return of the individual consumers to the vehicle market," Robert L. Rewey, vice president for sales operations of the Ford Motor Company, said. Sales of the Taurus, which is contending with the Honda Accord for honors as the best-selling model, were 13,119, compared with 7,529 during the comparable 10-day period last year.
 
 
'Nothing Like a Good Contest'
 Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said, "There's nothing like a good contest to get sales cranking, and Ford clearly covets the calendar-year sales crown for its Taurus model."
Frank Arcurio, new-car sales manager of Dewar's Car World, a multibrand franchise in Johnstown, Pa., commented, "Showroom traffic picked up right after the election." Earlier in the year the dealership laid off 35 workers.
Sales of domestically built vehicles were 305,710, up 22.9 percent from a year earlier; they consisted of 180,367 cars and 125,343 light trucks, a category that includes sport-utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks.
Economists and automotive analysts have been disappointed that automotive demand during the last few months has not recovered as strongly as hoped. The last third of the month usually is stronger than the two earlier periods, so analysts are watching the early December numbers closely to see if stronger demand continues.
For all of November, sales of domestically built cars rose 5.9 percent from last November to 463,964. Sales of imported cars fell 4.6 percent, to 141,701. Over all, car sales rose 3.2 percent, to 605,665.
Sales of domestically built light trucks rose 29.4 percent in November to 341,706. Sales of imported light trucks fell 15.7 percent, to 27,627. Overall light-truck sales for the month rose 24.4 percent, to 369,333. Over all, vehicle sales in November rose 10.4 percent, to 974,998.
Ford, which had gained market share against rivals all year, posted a 26.1 percent gain, to 131,353 domestically built cars for the month. In light trucks, Ford gained 19.5 percent for the month, finishing with 110,457 sales.
 
 
G.M.'s Results
 The General Motors Corporation, the market leader, sold 190,811 domestically built cars in the month, down 7.5 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales, however, gained 25.2 percent, to 120,898.
The Chrysler Corporation sold 56,949 domestically built cars in November, up 5.8 percent. Chrysler's light-truck sales were up 42.2 percent, to 88,523.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's domestic car sales fell 7.9 percent, to 21,945. The Honda Motor Company's domestic car sales rose 7.3 percent, to 32,727, and the Nissan Motor Company's domestic car sales more than doubled to 16,036.

Rate-Cut Hopes Lift European Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
European bonds got a lift yesterday when hopes that Germany would cut interest rates were revived. The Bonn Government reported that the economy had declined sharply in the third quarter, and the country's largest trade union agreed to a wage settlement that is below the rate of inflation.
In Germany, the price of the 10-year bond rose about 1/2 point on the day. In France, bond futures grew about 1/3 point. 
 It's hard to predict when or if Germany might cut rates. But with the on- again, off-again expectations that often rule financial markets, the burst of hope was enough to spark a rally after the bad news from Germany earlier in the week.
 
Blunt Language
 On Monday and Tuesday, investors and traders were shaken by the blunt talk of the president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. Forsaking the traditionally quiet approach of Europe's most important central bank, Helmut Schlesinger gave interviews and spoke publicly to make his view clear. He said that although his neighbors wanted lower interest rates, Germany -- which sets the pace for interest rates in Europe -- could not respond right now.
But for bond analysts and traders, yesterday's economic report and union settlement raised the possibility for two reasons. First, the decline in the economy shows that it is clearly in recession, a fact that Chancellor Helmut Kohl acknowledged last week. And the union settlement indicates that more such labor accords, with wage increases small enough to reduce the inflation fears of the the country's central bankers, might be reached. Taken together, a slow economy and low inflation might prompt a cut in interest rates.
According to the Government, the economy declined 1.5 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. In addition, industrial production declined 2.2 percent in October, and the unemployment rate for the former West Germany rose to 6.9 percent in November from 6.7 percent in October.
In the wage agreement, IG Metall accepted a 3.25 percent, 18-month wage increase for 125,000 steel workers in northwest Germany. Inflation is now running at an annual rate of around 3.5 percent.
 
Treasury Market
 A surprisingly steep drop in the closely watched M-2 money-supply figure gave the bond market a little lift at the end of a day in which prices moved a lot but ended little changed.
The market managed to end on an up note, despite new data, including a decline in initial claims for unemployment insurance, that indicate the economy may be strengthening. A growing economy can worry bond investors because it can force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and lead to rising inflation.
But yesterday this did not matter, in part because traders did little as they awaited today's employment report for November. In addition, some investors and traders may be thinking that prices have already fallen more than enough to reflect the impact of a stronger economy.
In late trading, the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was offered at 100 28/32 , up 3/32 from Wednesday, to yield 7.55 percent, down from 7.56 percent. Prices and yields move in opposite directions: Rising prices add to the value of bonds and notes and reduce the yields; when yields rise, the value of the security, in relation to the price paid for it, declines.
Prices of Treasury notes also rose a little, and the discount rates on Treasury bills fell a few basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The drop of $8.6 billion in M-2, which includes currency in circulation, checking accounts, savings accounts and small certificates of deposit, was far more than the $1.9 billion in many forecasts. The decline is also another bit of information that is making it hard for traders and investors to decide how strong the economy is.
 
'An Upturn, but a Moderate One'
 "The notion has been that the economy will surprise us on the upside," said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "We think we are in an upturn, but a moderate one."
While a flood of recent figures show the economy is stronger than had been thought a month or two ago, some individual reports, like the M-2 decline, have raised some doubts.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Some Ground As Mark Shows Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher against most leading currencies yesterday, strengthened by year-end demand, weakness in the powerful German mark and additional evidence that the American economy is improving.
Gold prices were off slightly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fetched $335.50, off 40 cents from Wednesday. At the Republic National Bank in New York, gold was quoted at a late price of $335.30, off 40 cents from Wednesday. 
 Currency traders said the dollar's behavior was influenced partly by increased customer demand as 1992 draws to a close. American-based multinational companies, for example, often require large amounts of dollars in the final weeks of the year as they repatriate profits in foreign currencies.
The German mark, highly favored in global foreign exchange trading in recent months because of high German interest rates, retreated on news of rising unemployment, signaling weakness in Germany's economy. Currency dealers bought dollars instead.
Traders also said signs of a modest expansion in the American economy had helped the dollar somewhat, strengthening sentiment that domestic interest rates will rise. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments worth more.
Yesterday, the Government reported a rise in October factory orders, a fall in late-November weekly unemployment claims and stronger third-quarter productivity. There is some expectation that the November unemployment statistics, due out today, will also show improvement after months of persistent weakness.
The British pound defied the trend and strengthened against the dollar. Traders attributed the pound's behavior to technical influences in the market and expectations that British interest rates could start to creep up.
In London, the pound fetched $1.5675, up from $1.5480 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound fetched $1.5645, up from $1.5525 late Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.55 yen, up 0.38 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar fetched 124.65 yen. In New York, the dollar fetched 124.65 yen, up from 124.50 yen late Wednesday.
Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with those on Wednesday, were: 1.5830 marks, up form 1.5745; 1.4135 Swiss francs, up from 1.3960; 1.27375 Canadian dollars, down from 1.27915; 5.3860 French francs, up from 5.3720, and 1,392 Italian lire, down from 1,392.25.

HEADLINE: Bush, Salinas and Mulroney To Sign Trade Pact Dec. 17

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
President Bush will sign the North American Free Trade Agreement on Dec. 17, while President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada will sign the pact the same day in their countries, the White House announced today.
The agreement, which would eliminate trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States, will not take effect until legislatures in all three countries have approved it or legislation putting its provisions into law. 
 But the signing is nonetheless significant for two reasons. It will make it harder for President-elect Bill Clinton to make any changes in the agreement's text, and it insures that Congress will have to put the implementing legislation on a fast-track process, which permits no amendments.
The fast-track process that Congress authorized provides that any trade agreement signed by June 1 must be taken up by Congress on a yes-or-no basis.
Mr. Clinton and his transition team were not consulted before today's announcement, but Democrats did not seem to mind, in part because trade issues are politically touchy and addressing them exposes deep fissures within the Democratic Party over whether to open America's markets further to international competition.
Yet sentiment is growing in Congress to rein in the Administration.
The Bush Administration has engaged in a post-election flurry of trade policy initiatives. Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, threatened a trade war with the European Community two days after Mr. Bush's electoral defeat and ended up striking a broad trans-Atlantic deal two weeks ago to reduce farm subsidies.
Mr. Clinton has endorsed the North American pact, but he has promised not to sign legislation putting its provisions into law until he has negotiated three side agreements and has won Congressional passage of four other provisions to protect American workers.
The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said in an interview two weeks ago that he did not expect Mr. Clinton even to submit the implementing legislation to Congress until after all of these issues were resolved, a process that could take months. But once the agreement has been signed, Mr. Clinton could in theory wait for years to submit it and the pact would still be covered by the fast-track rules.
Administration officials feel personal pride in the agreement and wanted it signed by their President. "We wouldn't have gone to all the trouble of negotiating it if the President were not going to sign it," a senior official grumbled.
Canadian and Mexican officials have pushed for a quick signing for their own reasons. Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada must call a general election by next November, and his Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, recently said the pact would be put to a vote of Parliament soon after its signing.
President Salinas has been pressing the President-elect to pay more attention to the pact and to push it through Congress as soon as possible. The Mexican economy depends heavily on investments by foreigners who have assumed that the pact will take effect. The Mexican stock market quivers at the slightest indication that the pact might succumb to pressures from labor unions and other opponents in the United States.
Strong governing party majorities in the Mexican Senate and the Canadian Parliament are expected to pass the agreement without difficult.
Some Democrats expect the agreement to win Congressional approval, too. But the pact's future on Capitol Hill is hard to predict, because many of the incoming Congress's 122 new members have no clear position on the agreement.

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

Work in Progress
There's still work to be done on the SoHo branch of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which opened in June. A gaping hole remains on the first floor where a basement cafe is supposed to be, and the stairwells still don't have permanent lighting fixtures. Also missing are several architectural elements crucial to Arata Isozaki's design.
Indeed, the Japanese architect's plans called for an arched bridge of raw steel to cross over the cafe, an open staircase of raw steel with steel cable railings leading down to the basement, curved frosted-glass-and-steel display cases for the bookstore and gift shop, and walls of frosted glass at both ends of the second-floor galleries. The architect had also made a rough plan for the cafe itself. 
 Although there is speculation in the art world that the museum has simply run out of money, Michael Govan, the Guggenheim's deputy director, gives a different answer.
"It's not an issue of money," Mr. Govan said. "This was the fastest museum ever built. It's all been a learning curve because it's such a new space for us. We had a budget and went for the full design -- we spent every cent on such state-of-the-art equipment as climate controls for the art." So far, Mr. Govan said, the project, which included office space, has cost about $8 million, and will require $250,000 more to complete. "We don't foresee any problem in raising the money to complete the outstanding work," said Mr. Govan.
"It was critical for the museum to be finished at the same time as the uptown Guggenheim, no matter what," said David Gauld, the project architect who works for Mr. Isozaki. "After the opening we thought the museum would close for several weeks so we could finish the work. We did get two weeks between shows, but that was just enough time to finish things on the punch list. It appears the museum is stuck trying to get the funding."
 
Plans for Cafe
 It also appears that Mr. Isozaki will not design the cafe. Mr. Govan said the architect's involvement in the cafe had never been assured. "Nor was it meant to be a Guggenheim expense," said Mr. Govan. "Part of the reason the bridge and stair aren't finished was prudence: we wanted to see who the operator would be before we finished the design."
As of now, Miriam Novalle, who describes herself as "a self-taught nose, a perfumer," is to create an environmental cafe and tea emporium in the space. "I collect teapots, and I thought this would be a good idea," she said. "There's no place to go in SoHo anymore, and the museum needs the cafe and gallery owners need somewhere to go to make a deal."
Ms. Novalle is working with Paul Berman Lytle, an environmental architect based in New York who runs the firm Master Builders. Ms. Novalle said that besides food and teas, the cafe would also sell everything for the ceremony of tea, from teapots to homespun linen napkins. She said she hoped to open in April.
 
More Work Ahead
 But whether the rest of the museum will be finished by then is still not clear. Mr. Govan said the Guggenheim intended to complete the project as soon as it can clear several weeks to close the building. In addition to the missing elements from Mr. Isozaki's plan, lighting for the stairwells is being worked on by the artist Dan Flavin.
In the bookstore, 7-foot-high oak display cases have just been erected in place of the frosted-glass designs. And a 22-foot-long black steel table designed by Mr. Isozaki has been placed in the middle of the store.
Finished or not, the museum's 60,000 square feet of space has attracted a steadily growing audience since it opened in June. "We're up to about 6,000 visitors a week, which has exceeded our conservative financial projections," said Mr. Govan. "In my heart of hearts I always knew the museum would be popular."
 
In the Red and the Black
 Other news -- some good, some bad -- from SoHo this week:
On the bright side, Exit Art, the nonprofit alternative center for contemporary art, which has been at 578 Broadway for the last 10 years, is moving, expanding and changing its name. As of Dec. 12, the organization will be Exit Art/The First World and will triple its space -- to 17,000 square feet -- by moving to 548 Broadway, between Spring and Prince Streets.
"The word exit has actually become our entrance," said Jeanette Ingberman, who is the co-founder and co-director of Exit Art/The First World, with the artist Papo Colo. "We're putting together a center that we hope will be a model for the future," Ms. Ingberman said. "Our vision is to create a place where all the media can come together."
Ms. Ingberman said that she had been raising private funds to pay for the move for about a year, and that the current real estate market allowed her to lease the new space relatively inexpensively. The center will have a 5,000-square-foot gallery and will also include a cafe and the Apartment Store, a retail shop showcasing furniture and objects for the home, made by artists.
The complete expansion is planned in phases. By spring, Exit Art/The First World expects to open First World Theater, a 2,500-square-foot theater and performance space, and the Fashion Hall, a 2,000-square-foot space that would be used to explore the international influences between art and fashion. Foreign Affairs, a 5,000-square-foot exhibition gallery for events by artists from outside the United States, is to open next fall. The center is being designed by Mr. Colo as a series of open, flowing areas.
In its first exhibition, "Fever," which opens Dec. 11, the new Exit Art/The First World will show the work of 50 young artists from around the United States "There's a whole new generation out there of artists aged 22 to 35," said Ms. Ingberman. "They're the ones helping to define the future."
 
A Gallery Closing
 And now the bad news: Rubin Spangle, the two-and-a-half-year-old SoHo gallery that showed the work of Dan Flavin, Will Mentor, Carrie Smith and Michael Venezia, will close on Dec. 15. "With the economic situation being the way it is, we just couldn't go on," said Morgan Spangle, one of the owners. "We're going to take December and January off to think about how we will proceed with the business. We're not alone. There will be a lot more galleries closing, too."
 
Good Results in London
 The London auctions of Impressionist paintings, drawings and sculpture were uncannily similar to the sales of Impressionist work in New York City last month. Given the economic climate in England, which is considered to be far worse than it is in the United States, both Sotheby's and Christie's said they were pleased with the results.
"We're getting there," said David Nash, the director of the department of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's worldwide. "The London sales confirmed what we've been seeing this fall: a slow, steady improvement."
While at each house the sales brought in less money than the auction house had estimated, there were a few bright spots. At Sotheby's, the star work, Wassily Kandinsky's "Sketch I for Composition VII" (1913), sold for $8.25 million, right at Sotheby's estimate. The buyer was a European private collector who bid by telephone. Sotheby's total was $18 million, just below the house's $20.8 million low estimate. Of the 57 works up for sale, 22 remained unsold.
 
7 Cezannes at Christie's
 At Christie's, seven paintings by Cezanne, originally from the collection of Auguste Pellerin, a French industrialist and collector who bought his first Cezanne in 1895, were being sold by an unidentified European foundation. The paintings brought $15.8 million, $3 million short of Christie's pre-sale estimate. The top painting, "Man With a Pipe" from 1890-1992, sold for $5.28 million, well above Christie's estimate of $2.4 million to $3.6 million. The buyer was an anonymous telephone bidder.
While six of the Cezannes sold, the one that didn't, "Marion and Valabregue Setting Out for the Motif" from 1866 was purchased by an unidentified buyer immediately after the sale. Of the 51 works up for sale at Christie's, 20 did not find buyers. The entire auction totaled $28.3 million, under the $33 million to $46.5 million presale estimate.
"We are pleased," said James Roundell, who heads Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art in London. "Eighty percent of the works sold, which certainly shows a considerable improvement over the last two years. But we shouldn't get carried away. In this kind of a market, if you get overconfident, you can fall on your face."

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:
Among the rising tide of
hotel dining rooms, a many-flavored luxury spot.
In the early 1980's, hotels in New York City and beyond caused quite a stir by revving up their sleepy dining rooms to compete with top restaurants. But when the recession hit, these hotel dining rooms sank faster than the Dow Jones industrial average, and with that the hoopla over a hotel-food renaissance ended. 
 In the last few years, however, there have been signs of another resurgence, most notably in Manhattan at places like the Essex House, the Mark, the St. Regis and the Royalton. Add the Peninsula Hotel and its luxury restaurant, Adrienne.
Adrienne's kitchen has seen more coming and going than most guest rooms in the hotel, what with ownership changes, management shuffles and cuisine shifts. The chef today is Adam Odegard, who came from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Manhattan. Mr. Odegard has a flamboyant style, and sometimes his busy creations are the gastronomic equivalent of Penn Station at rush hour. But his sensibilities are on target, and one can fault him occasionally only for trying too hard.
The opulent Art Nouveau dining room offers plenty of privacy, deep armchairs and rose-tinted banquettes. This is the kind of comfort one rarely finds except in hotel dining rooms.
Adrienne offers a $28 prix fixe lunch that is one of the best bargains in midtown. One day it began with a rolled tower of faintly smoked salmon holding caviar accompanied by a potato-chive waffle and whipped mascarpone. The alternative starter was a superb wild mushroom risotto studded with lobster meat. For main courses there were a thick, gamey venison chop with braised red cabbage and a grilled striped bass with saffron rice holding chunks of salty chorizo. Dessert was a light but intense chocolate mousse with a sharp bittersweet chocolate lid.
Aside from the food revival there has been a marked improvement in service. Waiters are patient, informative and unremittingly polite.
Recommended starters on the regular menu include a cinnamon-perfumed pumpkin soup, crispy little won tons holding creamy goat cheese over a chicory salad, and marinated shrimp salad over green beans tossed in piquant horseradish-chili oil. One overproduced creation is barbecued chicken with a strong curry flavor, with chorizo, plantains, fried parsley, white bean chili and coriander oil. With so many flavor warheads detonating on the palate, it was impossible to tell what you were eating. At lunch one day, the risotto special was not risotto at all but tasty rice enhanced with sun-dried tomatoes, black olives and duck confit.
Adrienne's wine selection is aimed at clients who book the hotel's poshest suites, especially when it comes to Bordeaux. For more reasonable prices, look to California and the southwest of France.
Among the best entrees is grilled chicken in a bright fennel emulsion along with a potato-eggplant roulade. Grilled duck in a soy glaze with stir-fried vegetables and crispy lotus chips had a nice textural contrast, but the soy sauce on the plate left everything incredibly salty. Tuna is prepared in an interesting way, wrapped in rice paper, garnished with fried julienne of leeks and combined with sauteed foie gras and snow peas with a mild peppercorn sauce. Halibut steak with couscous and a fennel-chervil emulsion was a nice concept, spoiled only by fish that had an ammonia smell. (A week later, this dish was excellent.) An ungainly hunk of dried-out swordfish could not be rescued by a pleasing sweet corn sauce.
Among meat dishes, tender and succulent loin of beef is delightful in natural juices sweetened with port, along with caramelized winter vegetables. Roasted loin of veal is pleasing, too, with leeks, salsify and the same sweet corn broth that was paired with the swordfish.
Hotels have a thing about dessert trolleys, and this multi-decker hauls around plenty to entice the most abstemious. Sharp, cleansing lime tart is one of the lighter ways to go, as is the ripe pear tart. Moving up the caloric scale there is a smooth timbal-shaped banana mousse and a superb pumpkin pie. What is called peach clafouti is really more like a tart, but it is good nonetheless.
The serious efforts at Adrienne underscore the second hotel food renaissance in a decade. For those who appreciate comfort and creativity, it's worth a visit.

HEADLINE: Look to the Grassroots in Aiding Russia

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I have just returned from a year in Moscow as consultant for a banking start up, and read with great interest the views of former Ambassador Robert S. Strauss ("More U.S. Support for Russia," Op-Ed, Nov. 15). 
 Mr. Strauss argues that a weak Russia is not in the cards and that our support can help determine whether a strong Russia emerges as an open democratic state or a limited authoritarian society. I would add that the nature of the support we provide will critically determine both the effectiveness of the assistance program and the likelihood of success in achieving meaningful market and political reforms in Russia.
As Mr. Strauss appreciates, and I have no reason to doubt, President Boris N. Yeltsin seems to harbor a commitment to open, maybe even radical, change. Many Russians would like to try something new and less heinous than the politics and economics of the Communist past.
But my experience tells me that this is not enough. There is a whole layer of entrenched bureaucracy and self-interest that has woven itself into all aspects of Russian life. It is this network and access to it that determines a person's standing in Russian society. And it is this network that stands in the way of real progress.
In providing support to Russia, we would make a mistake in equating a strong Russia with a strengthening of its current institutions and practices. The trap would be to look only at the top -- the commitment of all or part of the Yeltsin cabinet team -- and ignore the realities just below the surface. To do so would not only reinforce a Russian penchant for elitist leadership that has plagued the country through the centuries, but would certainly undermine the chances for success as aid is diverted at the center from its intended targets.
So, while I agree to a strong Yeltsin presidency to guide and safeguard reform through this unstable transition period, I nonetheless strongly urge that we choose the more difficult route of a grassroots effort for our support. While in Russia I secured a technical assistance grant for my Russian client from the European Commission, the executive agency of the European Community. The disbursement is handled by a third party to help guarantee its desired application, and the grant supports the creation of local skills and new practices. This orientation strikes me as particularly productive.
We must resist the elitist and expedient temptation to focus on personalities and instead aim our support at lasting institutional and institutionalized change. In this way, U.S. support for reform in Russia can truly be in our and even the Russian people's self-interest.

HEADLINE: Violence on the Job Is a Growing Threat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Social Workers: Targets in a Violent Society" (front page, Nov. 18) and "Wires, Meters, Phones and Fears" (news article, Nov. 22) shine some light on a serious and growing problem in New York City and nationwide: violence on the job. 
 It is true many social workers and utility workers face the risk of assault every day, but they are not alone. Violence on the job is a daily threat for a wide range of workers, including teachers, hospital workers, bus drivers, maintenance workers and anyone who works alone.
New York City Department of Health records show 128 homicides on the job in 1991 -- skyrocketing from 47 in 1989 and 84 in 1990. In 1991, 74 victims were store owners or retail employees, and 23 were cabdrivers. Workers in jobs that call for handling of money or providing of security are at the greatest risk of violence.
Preventing workplace assaults and homicides is a complex task. Unemployment, poverty and racism create an environment in which violence can thrive. As an important first step, unions across the country have been calling for adequate staffing and safety training in high-risk jobs. Now is the time for employers to heed that call: it can be a matter of life and death.

HEADLINE: G.M. TO SHUT DOWN 7 PARTS FACTORIES IN STRATEGY SHIFT

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation identified nine plants today that it will close in the next three and a half years, including seven plants that make parts.
The announcement makes clear that the giant auto maker's strategy for becoming a leaner company involves increasing its reliance on parts purchased from outside suppliers. 
 The nine plants are in Flint, Kalamazoo and Livonia, Mich.; Syracuse; Ewing, N.J.; Wilmington, Del.; Euclid, Ohio; Sioux City, Iowa, and St. Catharines, Ontario. With their closing, 18,000 jobs will be lost.
 
Plants Can't Compete
 Automotive analysts have long maintained that many G.M. parts operations are uncompetitive, a significant reason for the company's financial woes. In some cases, the productivity of G.M. parts plants is not as high as that of competitors; in some cases, G.M. cannot compete with foreign factories or with suppliers who operate nonunion plants in the United States.
But the company has historically been committed to and proud of the extent to which it makes its own parts, a strategy known as vertical integration.
Before low-cost Japanese production made auto making so competitive, the company's vast parts-making operations were a big advantage: G.M. could profit at several levels of production, and outside suppliers could not hold it hostage to price increases.
 
Makes 70% of Its Parts
 But as cost control became more important, the company found itself locked into its own subsidiaries while competitors combed the world for lower prices.
 Auto industry experts estimate that G.M. makes at least 70 percent of its parts, far more than the Chrysler Corporation or the Ford Motor Company.
 The new strategy reflects the vision of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the company's vice president for worldwide purchasing, as well as that of its chief executive for the last six weeks, John F. Smith Jr.
G.M., which has lost $5.4 billion in the last seven quarters, said last year that it would close 21 plants and eliminate 74,000 jobs. With today's announcement, those totals have been revised to 23 plants and 80,000 jobs. The company said it had no plans at this time to close additional factories.
Detroit and scores of G.M. factory towns around the nation were braced for the announcements, which Mr. Smith had promised would be announced by the end of the year. For the last year many workers have lived in the executioner's shadow, knowing more plants were to close but not knowing their identity.
"The economic realities of the global marketplace dictate that we have too much capacity versus market demand," Mr. Smith said today. "To address that situation we are implementing fundamental changes and a restructuring to enable us to sustain profitability through all phases of the economic cycle."
 
Cadillac Offices to Close
 Although the city of Detroit was spared the closing of its only remaining G.M. final-assembly plant, which makes Cadillacs, the company said it would close the headquarters of its Cadillac division and transfer 1,125 workers to offices in Flint and Warren, Mich.
The closings announced today bear witness to the activism of G.M.'s outside directors, who are not employees of the company. Their frustration over the company's losses and glacial pace of change led to the resignation of Robert C. Stempel as chairman and chief executive on Oct. 26. Mr. Smith became chief executive and John G. Smale, the former head of the Procter & Gamble Company, the chairman.
G.M. said it believed that the more aggressive tactics would help it reach its goal of reducing production capacity in North America by about 25 percent, to 5.4 million vehicles annually, by 1995. But some experts on the industry quickly said that the closings announced today were simply not enough to stanch the company's losses.
Clifford Swenson, manager of production forecasting for Jacobs Automotive, a consulting firm in Little Falls, N.J., said today's announcements "don't go nearly far enough" toward balancing output with demand. "It appears G.M. has backed away significantly from the promises it made last December" to close six final-assembly plants, he said.
 
Fewer Assembly Plants to Close
 Of the nine plants identified today, two are final-assembly operations. The Wilmington factory produces the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta, both compact cars; the Flint plant makes full-size vans. The 23 plants scheduled for closing include 4 final-assembly plants.
William O'Neill, a G.M. spokesman, said the company was able to reach its capacity goal by closing only four final assembly plants instead of six, as contemplated last year.
A company spokesman declined to say whether the auto maker would build the Corsica and Beretta beyond 1996, when the Wilmington plant is scheduled to close. A new full-size G.M. van model is set to be produced in 1995. The production site has not been decided, G.M. said.
Investors seemed unmoved by the announced changes. G.M. shares closed unchanged, at $32.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The United Automobile Workers union, whose top officials say they are more encouraged by Mr. Smith's management than the administrations of his predecessors, denounced the cutbacks, though in an unusually restrained tone.
"We hope that G.M.'s new leadership will grasp the opportunity to redirect their efforts so that these closings and disruptions will stop once and for all," the union said in a statement.
Five of the nine plants set for closing belong to G.M.'s Automotive Components Group, whose 200,000 workers worldwide produce about $25 billion worth of automotive parts and components, the vast majority for G.M. vehicles. G.M. said that in the future it would narrow its parts operations to seven broad areas: batteries and related accessories; ignitions, catalytic converters and related equipment; lighting; interior accessories like seats, air bags, armrests and such; suspension and steering systems; electrical and wiring systems, and heating, air-conditioning and radiators.
In other areas -- bearings, axles, bumpers and horns, for example -- the company said it might form partnerships with other manufacturers, sell the businesses or close them.
"Disposition of these businesses will be managed over time to reduce the impact on our employes and our customer base," said J. T. Battenberg 3d, the G.M. vice president and group executive in charge of parts and components.
In an effort to soften the blow to Detroit by closing the Cadillac headquarters, John O. Grettenberger, Cadillac's general manager, announced that a second production shift, of about 1,000 hourly workers, would be added next year at the Detroit-Hamtramck final-assembly plant, which will build a variety of Cadillac models.
The economically beleaguered city learned this week it was out of the running for a Department of Defense regional finance center, which would have employed 1,000 workers.
"Cadillac's rich history and longstanding relationship with the city of Detroit will continue," Mr. Grettenberger said.

HEADLINE: Europe's Champagne Goes Flat

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Europe's climate has soured in a dramatic reversal of the celebrations at the start of 1992, when the West was forging to a new union, Germany was enthusiastically putting itself together and the liberated East was hailing democracy and the market. Now the mood is worse than glum, full of bewildered anger and dire warnings that, I hope, are as exaggerated as 1991's euphoria.
Economic pressures, political mismanagement and the nasty resurgence of old demons are provoking fears of a relapse into nightmares Europe thought it had left behind. The summit meeting in Edinburgh on Dec. 11-12 threatens more of a confrontation than the resolution of issues it was meant to solve. 
 The eruptions -- an assortment of grievances -- are separate, but they form the heart of the troubles. It is all worrisome because others think the myriad problems have been sparked by "unification as a ball and chain dragging down Germany and all Europe with it," as Le Monde put it.
Right-wing violence and threats of violence seem contagious. Vicious attacks on foreigners in Germany are attracting the most attention. For the first time since Spain's democratic rebirth, swastikas have appeared on walls in Madrid. The tolerant Netherlands is complaining about migrants and refugees. The far-right populist Jorg Haider is stirring venom in Austria with his demand for a referendum against foreigners.
The extremists haven't been so noisily noticeable in France, mainly because furious farmers have taken the limelight with the demand that their subsidies be maintained. The French Government, almost certainly doomed to defeat in March elections, is caught between threats of a national upheaval over the farm issue or a crisis with its European partners if it vetoes world trade agreement.
This is more than the oilseed versus French wine export question that nearly provoked an trade war until a compromise was reached. There is general agreement that a world trade pact would help lift everybody's economy out of recession, and France is isolated in insisting that it can't be at the expense of its farmers. Still, there is a sense here that small farms are crucial to the quality, the very identity, of France. The British feel the same about their coal miners. It doesn't help to remind people that Europe gained by sharply cutting back its ship-building and steel industries when they were outpaced by the shifting world economy.
There is more awareness in Europe than in America of the disasters looming in the East as it grapples with acute problems. Rather than spurring an energetic response to help, this aggravates fears of competition and floods of refugees, and intensifies calls for defense of strictly national interests.
Germany's partners feel that the huge cost of German unification and the method of financing it by borrowing instead of taxes, which keeps German interest rates high, in effect makes them pay an unfair share of the burden: their money is devalued or may have to be, and they can't recharge their economies. European union, proclaimed by the Maastricht treaty, is in doubt.
Meanwhile, the ravaging war goes on in the former Yugoslavia and threatens to spread through the Balkans, perhaps Central Europe.
To the public, governments look impotent, merely self-serving. This doesn't have to be. We are seeing the reaction to the end of an era -- the cold war and its mobilizing assumptions -- and a failure to move quickly enough to build new hopes. The solutions -- cooperation and renewal -- are known and proved, and the institutions to carry them out exist. There is even good will. But there isn't courageous leadership. The result is dangerous entropy, which, to be reversed, requires new energy.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Dips to 7.2% for Month on Jump in Hiring

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Solid confirmation of a perked-up economy emerged today as the Labor Department reported a rise in jobs and a two-tenths of a point decline, to 7.2 percent, in the November unemployment rate.
Unlike earlier improvements that have edged the jobless rate steadily downward from 7.8 percent in June, the latest included diverse gains in jobs, including factory employment, and did not result from a shrinking labor force. As a result, 9.2 million people are now out of work, nearly 800,000 fewer than in June. 
 Some private economists said the figures, which were better than most expected, meant that moderate expansion had replaced weak recovery.
 
 
Less Risk of a Relapse
 "There is some momentum building," said Alan Gayle, chief economist for Crestar Bank in Richmond. "The risk of any kind of backsliding is fairly minimal."
In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have been hit much harder by the recession than the country as a whole, the local economies appear to be have bottomed out. In New York State, unemployment fell to 8 percent, from 8.7 percent in October; in New York City to 10.5 percent from 11 percent. But in New Jersey, unemployment rose to 8.7 percent, from 8.1 percent in October and 7.1 percent in November of last year. Data for Connecticut were not released this week. [Page 47.]
"Some of the darkest clouds over the tristate economy are breaking up and moving on," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "But it is much too soon to throw your hat up in the air." He said the recovery in jobs could be slow and uneven.
In California, unemployment rose to 10.1 percent, the highest rate among the large industrial states, from 9.8 percent in October and 7.3 percent a year earlier. In Illinois, the rate rose to 6.2 percent from 5.5 percent, while in Ohio it rose to 7.4 percent from 7.2. But Michigan's rate fell to 7.9 percent from 8.6.
The November unemployment report, the first comprehensive measure of the economy's performance for the month, was quickly interpreted as a likely brake on the stimulus package being prepared by President-elect Bill Clinton. That notion reassured investors worried about inflation, producing a small rise in long-term bond prices and a corresponding drop in interest rates.
 
Figures Are 'Quite Nice'
 Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton University and an informal adviser to Mr. Clinton, said: "The last four to six weeks of data have been quite nice. My guess is, if we get another six weeks of improving data like the last six weeks, the whole idea of fiscal stimulus" -- that is, spurring the economy through increased deficit spending -- "will be stillborn."
In Little Rock, Ark., George Stephanopoulos, the spokesman for the President-elect, called the jobs report "good news." He added, "One of the more encouraging signs is that actually more jobs were created" and pledged that the Clinton team would continue to watch the job market "very closely."
His tone was noticeably different from the grudging approach to post-election economic reports that the Clinton team took until now.
 
Response of Bush Adviser
 The Bush Administration adopted a largely hands-off approach to the economy, hoping a recovery to the prolonged slump would appear before the election. During the campaign, President Bush pointed to six straight quarters of economic growth, but the turnaround seemed too weak then to overcome the public's restiveness over lackluster job and income growth.
Michael J. Boskin, the President's top economic adviser, said the data "provide further evidence of continuing improvement in the economy." It is particularly encouraging, he said, that "the good news is spreading to the labor market."
Assuming that the employment gains are sustained, he added, "this would be the final piece in the puzzle of a more normal, self-reinforcing expansion."
 Economists were encouraged not only by the job gains -- 105,000 for nonfarm payrolls and 420,000 as gauged by the department's survey of households -- but by the fact that people worked longer hours. In addition, a third of the payroll increase took place in factories.
 The unexpected increase of 35,000 factory jobs followed declines totaling 205,000 in the preceding three months, with gains widespread among industries producing both durable and nondurable goods.
The labor-market report was not, however, without sober elements. Retailing jobs, for example, rose by less than they usually do in November, resulting in a 46,000 decline after seasonal adjustment. And construction jobs fell 11,000, reversing a small October rise and leaving the number of construction jobs virtually unchanged over the last year.
Analysts also noted that 45,000 of the 105,000 additional payroll jobs last month reflected only the very brief employment at polling places on Election Day.
"There are still a number of things troubling the economy," observed William C. Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, citing in particular a lag in income growth and a deterioration in the nation's recently thriving export sector, now that the economies of various large trading partners are in decline. He estimated that if the Clinton team came forward with a stimulus package, it might involve $25 billion, half of what was once discussed.
The average workweek in the private sector rose 12 minutes, to 34.7 hours, the highest in more than five years; the average includes part-time jobs. The workweek in factories, meanwhile, also expanded 12 minutes to match its highest reading since 1966. Long hours are often seen as a precursor to new hiring as employers exhaust their ability to handle increasing amounts of business with the existing work force.
The combination of more workers and longer workweeks drove the index of aggregate hours to 122.2, from 121.4 in October, indicating a sizable increase in industrial output for the month.
Yet another favorable sign in today's report was upward revisions in the payroll numbers for September and October, the former turning a 72,000 decline into a 12,000 advance.
"The economy looks stronger across the board," said Norman Robertson, chief economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "It's not really in much need of a shot in the arm."
 
Adds to Positive News
 Today's figures follow a string of recent positive economic statistics. Those included falling first-time claims for jobless benefits and a report on gross domestic product for the third quarter that raised the growth rate to 3.9 percent from a 2.7 percent rate that itself had been higher than analysts expected.
According to the Labor Department's household survey, the labor force expanded by 279,000 last month after losses totaling 600,000 from June to October. This combined with the biggest job gain in 14 months to cut the ranks of the unemployed by 141,000.
Although two-thirds of the November job gains were accounted for by adult women, a large number of women also entered the labor force; their unemployment rate remained at 6.1 percent.
The volatile teen-age jobless rate jumped 1.9 points to 20.2 percent, but remained under the September level.
But the jobless rate for adult men showed substantial improvement. It tumbled four-tenths of a point to 6.8 percent as fewer men sought work while jobs grew moderately.
Geographically, the department also reported, the jobless rate eased a tenth of a point in each of three regions: the Northeast, to 8 percent; in the South, to 6.8 percent, and in the Midwest, to 5.9 percent. The rate in the West climbed a tenth of a point, to 8.7 percent.
The report also indicated some lessening of unemployment-related hardship, with jobless spells of more than six months dropping by 170,000, the first significant decline since mid-1989. This helped push the average duration of joblessness down to 18.2 weeks, the level prevailing for most of the summer, from 19.4 weeks in October.
 
Gains Among Self-Employed
 And the number of people who lost their last job -- as opposed to those who quit or were entering or re-entering the labor force -- tumbled by 435,000.
Just over half of the rise in employment under the household survey occurred among the self-employed. That gain more than made up for a sharp decline in October.
Average hourly earnings for private production workers advanced six-tenths of a percent last month, with weekly earnings up a hefty 1.1 percent, an indication of improved spending power.
The payroll report found that the proportion of manufacturing industries adding workers soared to 56.5 percent in November, the highest level since April, from 37.1 percent in October.

An End Date for the Other Transition

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. Dec. 4

 BODY:
Arkansans who have been waiting for weeks to hear what would happen when Bill Clinton resigns as Governor -- some in an almost ungracious state of anticipation -- received mixed news today.
President-elect Clinton, it seems, will be leaving office by Dec. 14. And his successor, Lieut. Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, announced today that as his first official act as Governor he would probably try to raise taxes. 
 The State Supreme Court settled the last of a dispute over the succession of Governor, ruling that Mr. Tucker could indeed take over the job he has essentially been working at for nearly a year without holding a special election.
Mr. Clinton had been purposely vague about when he would resign his state job. He continues to live and conduct most of his Presidential transition business from the Governor's Mansion, where he will remain until he leaves for Washington. But he has been to the State House only three times since the Nov. 3 election.
On Thursday, The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette bluntly told Mr. Clinton in an editorial that his welcome had run out.
"What's the difference between a boor and a governor?" the lead editorial read. "A boor leaves without saying goodbye. A governor says goodbye without leaving. Alas, the difference between the two seems to be diminishing every day Bill Clinton insists on hanging around."
Today, Mr. Clinton's aides said the Governor would resign before the State Legislature holds a special four-day session to grapple with a Medicaid crisis.
As it happens, that will be just in time to allow Mr. Tucker to deliver the bad news. He said today that he would ask the Legislature to approve taxes on cigarettes, legal and medical expenses and soft drinks to raise $164 million in revenues to balance the state budget.
But even with that load to bear, Mr. Tucker seemed pleased and relieved that his future is now official. The court decision, he said, settled "the question of exactly what I was." He added, "Was I Lieutenant Governor or acting Governor or sort of Governor or some sort of funny three-legged animal?"
Mr. Tucker plans to begin lobbying on behalf of his tax package in a manner that would probably make Mr. Clinton, who must journey to Capitol Hill again on Monday, envious. On Saturday, Mr. Tucker plans to attend a frog leg lunch with members of the State Senate.
 
Binge on Economic Policy
 First it was an economic conference, then a retreat, then an audit. Now it is beginning to look like a huge round-table economic policy binge for a few hundred of Mr. Clinton's closest friends and advisers.
"Originally it was supposed to be a couple of dozen people," said one transition official. "Now it's a convention."
Mr. Clinton's intention to hold the high-profile meeting has attracted network news broadcasters and dozens more journalists to Little Rock to join the news-starved reporters who have been encamped here for weeks. His absence from the public eye has fueled much of the anticipation. And the endless speculation generated by economists and ad hoc crystal-ball gazers in Washington and elsewhere have elevated the meeting, scheduled for Dec. 14 and 15, to must-attend status.
Gene Sperling, one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, said the meeting would be a sort of public airing of concerns.
"It will be valuable for him in the same way that it is for a judge to hear oral arguments, even after he has seen the briefs," he said.
Questions about the meeting recur at each day's transition news briefing. Do favorable economic statistics mean Mr. Clinton will scale back his plans to address the deficit? Does Mr. Clinton plan to abandon the middle-class tax cut proposal he scaled back once already during the campaign? Will the list of invitees provide a clue to the makeup of Mr. Clinton's Administration?
But some of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers have warned reporters to expect little in the way of concrete proposals from the meeting. In fact, they will all but admit that they are mostly seeking images -- television pictures of Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore appearing to address economic issues.
This has not dimmed the interest of the reporters or of the prospective participants.
"Requests for invitations are flying all over here," said one transition official. "There is this optimism about the economy and everybody wants to put their 2 cents in."
 
Official Clinton Copier?
 There is cashing in and then there is cashing in.
David Leopoulos, who spent much of his time this year working on behalf of his childhood friend, the President-elect, is appearing on television commercials here on behalf of his business rental company, boasting that he rented the copy machines for the Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters based here.
Wearing a suit and sitting on the edge of a desk, Mr. Leopoulos, identified on screen by his middle name, Paul, chats about the virtues of renting copy machines from his company. A bright red, white and blue Clinton-Gore campaign sign is propped nearby.
During the campaign, Mr. Leopoulos spoke frequently on behalf of Mr. Clinton. Today, however, he could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Crossing a Line, and Redrawing It

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The decision to intervene in Somalia marks a turning point in American foreign policy: for the first time American troops are entering a country uninvited, not to shore up an anti-Communist regime, protect American wealth or stifle a strategic threat, but simply to feed starving people.
President Bush, with the enthusiastic backing of President-elect Clinton, has crossed a red line. 
 He has said in effect that because the United States is now the world's only remaining superpower it cannot ignore responsibility for grave humanitarian crises in which American actions, and only American actions, could well mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of people. Even though the United States has no military, economic or political interests at stake in such crises, it must respond anyway, he said.
The problem is that if halting starvation or upholding human rights are now legitimate criteria for American intervention abroad, as compelling as protecting traditional strategic interests, where does President-elect Clinton draw the new red line? How much starvation is necessary, or how bad does the human-rights situation have to become, to justify American action? If Somalia, why not Bosnia, and if Bosnia, why not Kurdistan, and if Kurdistan, why not Haiti?
The question has particular poignancy for Mr. Clinton, who entered politics as a student leader fighting against the old rationale for military intervention in Vietnam and now must fashion a new rationale as the opening act of his Presidency.
In an era when America is facing no overwhelming strategic threats from abroad, and when it can afford to let its ideals increasingly govern its foreign policy, it will become critical for the Clinton Administration to explain not only where it chooses to intervene, but also where it chooses not to intervene. Otherwise, every area of the world will come clamoring for help.
 
Interests and Principles
 "The challenge for the Clinton Presidency will be twofold," said Michael J. Sandel, a political theorist at Harvard University. "On the one hand, he will have to articulate clearly the principles on behalf of which we may need to intervene -- whether it is upholding human rights, averting starvation or promoting democracy."
But on the other hand, said Mr. Sandel, those principles will have to be tempered by some sober practical considerations about where Washington can be effective at a cost that is tolerable to the American public.
"Clinton will have to be honest with the American people about both the principles justifying intervention and the practical considerations that might restrain such action," Mr. Sandel said. "Otherwise he will seem inconsistent and hypocritical and ultimately undermine the domestic consensus for intervention."
During his tenure, Mr. Bush tried to make those distinctions with his deeds instead of his words. First he intervened to rescue Kuwait, after an invasion by Iraq, which marked the first time since the Korean War that American troops led a coalition abroad to uphold the United Nations Charter and the principle of the sanctity of international borders.
That step forward, though, was made easier by the fact that behind the diplomatic principles at stake in the Persian Gulf were also the hardcore American interests in oil flows and strategic concerns about Iraq's growing arsenal.
Intervening in Somalia, though, goes one step further. In effect, Mr. Bush, through his actions in Iraq and Somalia, has now defined his vision of the boundaries of American post-cold-war intervention.
 
Necessity of U.S. Action
 There are the cases, Iraq for example, where principles and major strategic interests are at stake, which virtually demand that Washington organize an international coalition to respond. And there are the cases, Somalia for example, where there are principles and no strategic interests at stake -- or real opposition forces on the ground -- which make it relatively easy for Washington to organize an international coalition to respond.
The struggle comes in dealing with problems that fall in between the poles of Iraq and Somalia. In Bosnia, for example, there are just enough strategic interests and human rights at stake to draw world attention and invite action. But there are too many armed forces on the ground to make such an intervention easy and the strategic interest at stake for the United States is not major but rather limited, and thus cannot justify the potential costs in American lives.
Mr. Bush came about as close as he ever will to detailing the new rationale for American foreign policy when he said today: "In taking this action, I want to emphasize that I understand the United States alone cannot right the world's wrongs, but we also know that some crises in the world cannot be resolved without American involvement, that American action is often necessary as a catalyst for broader involvement of the community of nations."
Mr. Clinton has so far preferred to avoid any detailed description of his own vision. Today he had his spokesman, George Stephanopoulos, read a short statement in which he underscored his support for "President Bush's decision." When Mr. Stephanopoulos was asked later about whether that was a harbinger of the Clinton foreign policy, he said: "Well, I don't know if I can comment on that kind of a hypothetical. But at the moment, Governor Clinton supports this operation."
Clinton aides say privately that they are increasingly aware that while Mr. Bush is making the tough decision to go in, it is Mr. Clinton who will be saddled with the even tougher decision of how to get out. And they are growing worried about how it could divert Mr. Clinton from his campaign vow to remain focused like a "laser beam" on the economy.
They should be. Harry Truman first described the American intervention in Korea as a "police action." His successor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, found it to be something rather larger.
And even if Mr. Clinton finds he can withdraw the American troops from Somalia early in his term, as Mr. Bush suggested, that may not be the end of the story.
Ronald Reagan could attest to that. On Aug. 25, 1982, Mr. Reagan dispatched 800 Marines to Beirut to ease the withdrawal of Palestinian guerrillas in the wake of the Israeli invasion. He promised that they would only stay for a maximum of 30 days. So anxious was Mr. Reagan to get the American troops out that he withdrew them two weeks before the 30-day deadline, as soon as the guerrillas had gone.
Four days later, Christian militiamen stepped into the vacuum and massacred hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee districts.
Two days after that, the Reagan Administration, racked with guilt for having pulled American troops out too early, ordered them back without any preparation or strategic rationale. Only after 241 American servicemen were blown up in a suicide-bombing 17 months later were the forces finally withdrawn.
But the lesson remained: that in accepting leadership for an international relief effort, whether in Lebanon or Somalia, the world's only superpower may assume a moral obligation for events that lasts well beyond the withdrawal of American forces.

HEADLINE: Data on Region's Economy Improve

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
The economies of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have been hit much harder by the recession than the country as a whole, appear to be at or near the bottom, according to employment data released yesterday and Thursday.
"Some of the darkest clouds over the tristate economy are breaking up," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York-based regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "But it is much too soon to throw your hat up in the air." 
 New York State's unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 8 percent in November from 8.7 percent in October, the bureau reported. New York City's unadjusted rate fell to 10.5 percent from 11 percent. They were the lowest since May. A year ago the respective rates for the state and city were 7.9 and 10.2 percent.
In New Jersey, the unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in November from 8.1 percent in October and 7.1 percent a year ago. But for five months before October, the rate was 9 percent or more.
November data for Connecticut have not been released. But the state Department of Labor said Thursday that the adjusted unemployment rate dropped to 6.9 percent in October from 7.2 percent in September.
Manufacturing accounts for a fifth of Connecticut's jobs. With a large portion of them in the shrinking military industry, economists say unemployment could rise again. "Maybe Connecticut's economy has bottomed out in total, but I still wouldn't break out the champagne quite yet," said Anthony J. Ferrara, the New England regional commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Economists also cited other data as evidence that recession is bottoming out in the region.
Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the signs in metropolitan New York include strong Wall Street profits and rises in home sales, air travel and the leasing of midtown Manhattan offices. "We're still awaiting signs of strong job growth," she said, "but we get a sense the worst is probably over."
In New York State's private sector, the seasonally adjusted number of jobs increased by 5,500 in October, reaching 6,266,000. While the increase was tiny, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, "it is the first time since April we have seen anything positive."
Because of a drop in government jobs, total jobs in New York rose by 3,000, to 7,689,000. That was 585,000 below the peak in June 1989.
The rise in New Jersey's unemployment rate broke a three-month string of declines. But that survey examines employment of the state's residents, regardless of whether they commute to another state. The number of jobs in New Jersey actually grew by 15,000 in October, to 3,394,000. The last rise was in January. While government jobs fell by 3,000, private-sector jobs rose by 18,000. The job total was 316,000 below the peak in February 1989.
"We have seen some firming up in some industries in New Jersey," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
In Connecticut, the seasonally adjusted number of jobs rose by 500 in October, to 1,492,000, or 195,000 below the peak of February 1989. Other encouraging signs in Connecticut include a drop in initial unemployment-compensation claims, stabilizing employment in banking and increases in personal income, car sales and building permits for homes, said Nicholas S. Perna, chief economist at Shawmut National Corporation.

HEADLINE: The Silence the Students Left Behind;
In Bridgeport, a University's Decline Has a Ripple Effect

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Dec. 4

 BODY:
On a gray overcast day, Kitty Davis sat on her front porch smoking a cigarette and staring sadly at the University of Bridgeport campus, recalling what her South End neighborhood was like just a few years ago.
"There were students everywhere," she said. "It was a bustling, exciting neighborhood filled with student houses and all the sights and sounds of an active college community." 
 But the university's troubles have changed everything. Enrollment has dropped from 9,000 in the early 1970's, when Ms. Davis moved into her home on Broad Street, to below 1,500, and many of the bars, restaurants and grocery stores that once catered to students are gone. Illegal drugs have become the community's biggest business.
"You see that empty yellow building over there, the one with the broken windows?" said Ms. Davis, pointing to the eight-story brick structure surrounded by a small barbed-wire fence. "It was a dormitory called Bodine Hall and it was once filled with the sounds of students laughing, partying and playing music, sometimes until after midnight. The parking lot was always filled with cars."
But that was when the university was at its peak, with more than half a dozen thriving colleges, before the recession started chipping away at enrollment and the university's financial base. It was before a bitter two-year faculty strike began in 1990, the longest ever in American higher education, that resulted in the hiring of nonunion professors and drove even more students away.
It was also before the university's board decided in April that the only way to keep the 65-year-old school open was to turn over control to the Professors World Peace Academy, founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, in exchange for $50.5 million over five years.
University officials say there are now 1,400 enrolled students and they say enrollment will rise by next fall. Students on campus are skeptical, however, and say they believe enrollment is closer to 400.
"I can't wait to get out of here, it's got to be the most depressing campus in the country," said Lee Henderson, a 22-year-old senior majoring in graphic design, who expects to graduate in May. "When I started here four years ago it was great. There were big parties with hundreds of students. This year, I threw a Halloween party and 10 people showed up."
"The campus is just dead," said Paul Henrique, a student at the law school, which last year broke away from the university and affiliated with Quinnipiac College in Hamden. He said that the library is virtually empty, except for law students. "To tell you the truth," Mr. Henrique said, "the only students I ever see on campus are in the law school. There's pretty much nobody else left."
The enrollment decline has hurt the business community too. "It's a disaster, that's the only way to describe it," said Jose Mota, a hot dog vendor who operates the J.M. Wagon on Park Avenue, in the middle of the campus. "Business is down 75 percent from two years ago and I don't see how I can stay open much longer."
Many other business owners say they don't know how much longer they can survive. Although they are concerned about the affiliation with the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's group, they say they will accept anything that will save the university.
 
'A Little Leery'
 "I'm a little leery about it, but this is better than seeing the university just die, which is what would happen to me if the school closes down," said Ernest A. Ursini, who owns a liquor store and My Mother's Place and Deli on Park Avenue, a block from the campus.
Some merchants, however, were forced to give up a long time ago.
Ved Mehta, the former owner of the Austin Street Cafe, said business was booming when he bought the restaurant in 1988. Just five blocks from campus, the bar was frequently filled with students and professors.
Crime and declining enrollment changed that.
"When the faculty strike started and enrollment went down, business went down fast," Mr. Mehta said. "And then, we had people being mugged in the parking lot and gunshots coming right through the windows. By last Christmas business had dropped by more than half, and we were forced to close. It had become a real nightmare."
Today, the building stands empty, much of it destroyed earlier in the year by fire.
On Broad Street, only police cars can be seen in the parking lot of Bodine Hall, which is used as a training center for Bridgeport and nearby police departments.
"Every once in a while, you can hear the training going on, you can hear them practicing things like: "Pull over! Get out of the car with your hands up,' " Ms. Davis said.
In the deteriorating South End, Ms. Davis and her neighbors say it is often difficult to tell whether they are hearing the sounds of training exercises or of actual arrests.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The troubles of the University of Bridgeport have reshaped the South End neighborhood, which once vibrated with 9,000 students.

Sun Myung Moon. (pg. 25) (Joyce Dopkeen/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
January Crude Oil Contract Falls for 5th Straight Time

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Crude oil for delivery in January fell for the fifth consecutive session, to its lowest level since early March, weighed down by burdensome supplies and slack demand, analysts said today.
Initially, crude oil rebounded in reaction to a report from the International Energy Agency that estimated first-quarter demand at 40 million barrels a day, up 600,000 barrels a day from the fourth quarter, for the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
 "The attitude is to sell the rallies," said Victor Yu, senior trader at Nikkhah Energy Group, a division of Refco in New York. "People were skeptical of the report because the last report estimated demand one million barrels higher than it was."
January crude oil finished 14 cents lower at $18.94 a barrel. Oil products finished mixed. Heating oil for January delivery closed 0.08 cent lower at 54.22 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline for January delivery closed 0.12 cent higher at 51.42 cents a gallon.
 
Further Fall Seen
 Mr. Yu, like other traders and analysts, predicted crude oil futures could fall further still. "The market is oversupplied," he said. "There's too much oil here and in Europe, and not enough demand or cold weather."
Oil futures have been tumbling all week amid disappointment that OPEC did not agree to larger production cuts for the first quarter when oil ministers met last week in Vienna. OPEC set a production ceiling of 24.9 million barrels a day, which was about 400,000 barrels short of expectations. Many traders expressed concern that OPEC would even adhere to the new quotas.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Reports Of Gains in U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against other major currencies after November employment data pointed to strength in the American economy.
Gold prices were firmer, with spot gold on the New York Commodity Exchange closing up 20 cents at $335.70 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted gold up 25 cents, to $335.75, in late trading. 
 The Government reported that nonfarm payroll jobs rose by 105,000 in November, up from a revised gain of 34,000 in October, and that the unemployment rate fell for the fifth straight month in November, to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent.
The dollar had already risen 12 percent since its September lows on an expected economic upturn, so the employment data did not cause much fanfare.
"The market tends to discount good economic news," said Andrew Hodge, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert. The recent gains inspired by the Presidential election euphoria had already discounted higher confidence in the recovery, he added.
 
German Bank Holds Firm
 Also holding the dollar back was the continuing reluctance of the German central bank to lower interest rates despite a growing recession in Germany, Mr. Hodge said. The country's relatively high interest rates bolster the value of the mark.
David Newman, a dealer at Harris Bank, said thin commercial interest in the few remaining trading days of the year was keeping a lid on the dollar. In the last three years, the dollar has rallied in Janaury.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.63 Japanese yen, up from 124.55 on Thursday. Later in London, it firmed to 124.90 yen. In late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 124.95 yen, up from Thursday's close at 124.67.
In London, the British pound slipped to 1.5595, from $1.5665 Thursday. It closed in New York at 1.5605, down from Thursday's close at $1.5640. The Australian dollar traded at 69.34 cents in United States currency, off from 69.63.
In New York, the dollar gained one pfennig to close at 1.5928 marks. It ended at $1.2774 (Canadian), up from $1.2746 Thursday.
Other late rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.4285 Swiss francs, up from 1.4135; 5.4070 French francs, up from 5.3875; and 1,395 Italian lire, up from Thursday's 1,392.

HEADLINE: Variety of Moving Events Prompt Donors to Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
June C. Starck wanted to usher in the 81st annual campaign by making its first contribution. Kathleen Whelen was eager to thank some men who came to her aid when her car broke down in the middle of the night in the Bronx. Valerie Eisman used her donation to honor the memory of a friend.
There seem to be an infinite number of reasons for sending money to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 Many checks to the fund are accompanied by letters describing shocking, uplifting or sobering experiences that prompted people to give. It might have been the sight of a homeless person sleeping on a subway platform. Or a marriage or birth. Or a newspaper article about the plight of a New Yorker who, because of the recession, is unemployed for the first time. Or a recovery from a serious illness.
The day after last year's record campaign ended, Ms. Starck, a retired administrator in Manhattan, mailed in $500, saying that she hoped the money would help begin the next drive on the right footing. Donations received after the end of one year's appeal are held over until the start of the next.
"I thought that maybe if I start giving money earlier, they can start using it earlier," she said on Thursday. "I see more and more homeless people around my apartment, and it's very upsetting. And then I think: 'Who knows, is my luck going to change over the next 20 years?' "
Since the early years of this century, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has relied on the donations of people like Ms. Starck to change the lives of tens of thousands of suffering New Yorkers. These days, with the economy sagging and government aid declining, the seven charities that receive money from the fund are depending on private contributors more than ever.
This year's campaign will end on Feb. 28. All contributions go directly to the charities, because The Times pays for the fund's overhead.
Ms. Eisman and her husband, Steve Breiter, sent $85 to the fund in memory of Dr. Dan Pfeffer, a close friend who died last year. "He personally would be happy that people in New York City -- that was where he got started -- were being helped by this," Ms. Eisman, who lives in Baltimore, said the other day.
Ever since Ms. Whelen found herself lost in Mott Haven at 3 A.M., she has searched for a way to express her appreciation to the men who helped tow and fix her car: Ralphie from Protege Collision, Angel at the Gulf station and the men who work at Don Glo Towing.
"I was anticipating the worst possible experience," Ms. Whelen, who lives in Norwalk, Conn., wrote in a letter to the fund that included a $100 check. "Instead, everyone I met was helpful, reassuring and concerned for my safety. I am glad I took a chance and trusted these folks -- they could not have been kinder."
 
 
HOW TO AID FUND
 Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and sent to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087, or to any of these organizations:
BROOKLYN BUREAU OF COMMUNITY SERVICE, 285 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217.

No agents or solicitors are authorized to seek contributions for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Contributions to the fund are deductible on Federal, state and city income taxes to the extent permitted by law.
To delay may mean to forget.

HEADLINE: Coup Fever in Venezuela

 BODY:
It matters very much to Americans -- North, South and Central -- that the coup fever raging in Venezuela finds a lasting cure.
President Carlos Andres Perez is, plainly, a flawed and unpopular politician. But he is just as plainly Venezuela's legitimately elected leader. To replace him by the ballot box next year would reinforce democracy throughout the region. To replace him by violence before then would undermine troubled democracies elsewhere. 
 Venezuela is not an obvious candidate for coup fever. Oil money has made it one of Latin America's richest nations. Its growth rate is among the region's highest. And its 34-year record of continuous democratic government is a proud achievement in a turbulent continent. When strongmen seized power last year in Haiti and this year in Peru, Venezuela led the hemispheric protests.
Now, however, Venezuela itself needs a strong show of democratic solidarity. In February, military conspirators came close to assassinating the President. An even more deadly revolt erupted last week. Opinion polls now show Mr. Perez's approval ratings below 10 percent.
Part of his unpopularity stems from free-market reforms that have greatly reduced the living standards of the middle class. Debts, lower oil prices and regional competition compelled Venezuela to cut consumer subsidies and other government spending. Meanwhile, rampant corruption around the Perez Government and a belief that sacrifices are not fairly shared helped transform economic suffering into political discontent.
As unpopular as Mr. Perez has become, Venezuelans don't seem eager for a military-backed regime. Their revulsion at the latest bloody rebellion helped insure its failure. As one coup supporter said: "I don't understand what's going on with these people. . . . They complain, they protest, and yesterday, which was the day to come out, they didn't take to the streets."
The conspirators don't seem to understand that Latin America has outgrown the era of military saviors. Military regimes have brought personal pain and economic ruin throughout the region in recent decades. Popular hopes now lie with expanded freedom, not iron rule.
Latin America's military leaders have been among the last to grasp this historic lesson. Civilian governments, even flawed ones, will need constant political reinforcement from democratic neighbors, especially the U.S., for years to come.
Today, every government in the hemisphere except Cuba and Haiti has some variety of democratic rule. That's a high-water mark. It warrants celebration, and vigilance.

HEADLINE: Alaska's Plan to Shoot Wolves Is an Outrage;
Predation Helps Herds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Alaska's plan to kill wolves is destructive not only to Alaska's wildlife but to wildlife management and even to economic interests, which are presumably driving the proposal. 
 Alaska will sell permits to shoot wolves, and then sell even more hunting licenses to eager hunters lured by the hope of more moose, more caribou, or easy kills. But what the Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation doesn't understand is that it is not at all certain that slaughtering wolves will increase the number of moose and caribou, because there are no data suggesting that wolf predation limits caribou or moose population size. In fact, wolf predation tends to keep prey populations healthy by removing sick and diseased animals.
Alaska is kidding itself if it thinks slaughtering wolves will promote tourism. We predict the public will not spend tourist dollars in a state that backs up 18th-century biases against predators with 20th-century technology.

HEADLINE: Tax Credit Likely to Be Retroactive

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Moving to prevent delays in discretionary capital investments, the two most senior Congressional tax writers announced yesterday that any tax credits adopted next year for such business spending would be retroactive to yesterday.
The announcement by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was intended to encourage businesses not to wait to buy costly items like machinery, Congressional aides said. 
 Mr. Bentsen has been frequently mentioned as a leading candidate for Treasury Secretary in the new Administration, giving his opinions on the matter even more weight. Aides to President-elect Bill Clinton said yesterday that Mr. Bentsen had been informed that he was Mr. Clinton's first choice for the post.
 
A Question of Timing
 The timing of the investment tax credit has been an issue for American businesses since the Presidential elections. Mr. Clinton campaigned on a promise to make such a tax benefit a central tool in his economic program.
But many members of Congress feared that the promise of a credit was creating a drag on the economy, because businesses would not act now, thinking they might get a tax benefit by waiting.
"We do not know at this time whether any such legislation will in fact be proposed or enacted," Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Bentsen said in a statement. "However, we wish to reassure the business community that we believe investments in depreciable tangible personal property made today and thereafter should be eligible for whatever tax investment incentives are ultimately enacted."
The two legislators may well have made this quarter one of the most advantageous for investments by businesses in capital goods, regardless of the terms of any legislation next year. Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Bentsen said that if the tax incentives were restricted to spending that exceeded the amount a business spent in some base period, then the current quarter should not be included in that period. That would mean that even if companies make heavy purchases in this quarter, the base level that they would have to exceed to qualify for the credit in the future would not be raised.
The statement by Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Bentsen, the most influential members of Congress in shaping tax legislation, is a strong assurance, but not a guarantee, that if such legislation is adopted next year, spending done now will qualify for a credit, Congressional aides said.
Such announcements by Congressional tax writers have become commonplace in recent years. In the past, however, they have at times been endorsed not only by committee chairmen, but also by the top minority members. With the Democrats soon to have both the White House and a majority in Congress for the first time in 12 years, such signs of bipartisan agreement are not as critical as in the recent past.
The statement by the two legislators came amid signs of a slowing in the purchase of large machinery and other big capital goods by American businesses. In October, the most recent month for which data are available, machine tool orders by American businesses fell 18.3 percent, to $184.2 million, while total tool order numbers fell 24.9 percent as the weak economies of the nation's trading partners cut exports in half.
The investment tax credit is an immensely popular tool for economic stimulation among politicians and business executives. The Clinton plan, reminiscent of the actions taken by John F. Kennedy when he became President in 1961 in the midst of a recession, would return to businesses as much as 10 percent of what they spent on machinery in excess of a certain level.

HEADLINE: Du Pont Halts Compensations in Crop-Loss Furor

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GAINESVILLE, Fla., Dec. 4

 BODY:
After spending $500 million to compensate farmers for crop failures linked to one of its agricultural chemicals, E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company has reversed course, rejecting any blame for the damage and halting its payments.
 Du Pont officials said the move, announced early last month, was based on new research into the chemical, Benlate. They described today what they said was an exhaustive scientific hunt for clues at a public meeting here of an advisory committee to the state Department of Agriculture. 
A top Du Pont scientist said that the company's new position was based on the results of $10 million in research it had conducted in Florida and Hawaii.
 
New Twist in Mystery
 More than a thousand growers, mostly in Florida, have reported damage on crops treated with Benlate. But the scientist, Dr. Bruce A. Hadley, said Du Pont could not duplicate the damage in carefully monitored tests on seven farms and nurseries in which the compound was applied to 250,000 plants. And a spokeswoman for Du Pont, Patricia N. Getter, said the company was thinking about putting the product back on the market.
 Dr. Hadley's presentation was another twist in a biochemical and legal mystery that began nearly two years ago when Du Pont pulled the product from the market after farmers in Florida, Texas, California and Puerto Rico said it was destroying their plants.
 Some of the Florida growers, and several dozen farm workers have since reported that their health was harmed by exposure to Benlate, a fungicide that was once one of the most popular chemicals on the nation's farms.
 The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health said today that it had opened a preliminary investigation here to determine whether Benlate caused illnesses. It is one of the few studies the Federal agency has ever conducted on a pesticide-related incidents. Symptoms reported to the state by farm workers include dizziness, rashes, sore joints, nausea and nose bleeds.
The growers who still maintain that Benlate caused their losses, say Du Pont made a mistake in not pulling it off the market sooner. From their viewpoint and the view of state officials here who support them, the crop damage was the worst product failure in Du Pont history.
 But Jack A. Krol, the vice chairman of Du Pont, said in an interview today that the problems with Benlate were not a result to a product failure. He confirmed that the $500 million in liability claims were the most the company had paid in its history.
 "We acted at the time with the best information we had at hand," said Mr. Krol. "It was going to take another growing season to run all the tests. Now we have an answer. I wouldn't call what happened a mistake. I would call it a business judgment we made with the facts we had at hand. Obviously we aren't happy having paid $500 million in claims and if we had the information we wouldn't have paid the claims."
 
Harm to Company's Reputation
 Either way, the Benlate incident has presented an important financial problem for Du Pont's chairman, Edgar S. Woolard. It has also hurt the company's reputation as a supplier of safe and reliable farm chemicals, and put Du Pont, the country's eighth largest industrial corporation, in direct conflict with this state's wealthiest grower and its top farm officials.
 More than 100 lawsuits are pending against Du Pont here, and the state is seeking to intervene in one case to be heard this month in which a grower is asking a state court to open the company's private files to public inspection.
 "It is absolutely ludicrous for them to take the position they are after paying out $500 million in damages," said Bob Crawford, the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture. "The only common link we have found in all the damage reported to us is Benlate. I have no doubt Benlate is the cause. Du Pont changed purely for their negotiating position for all the lawsuits still pending against them."
 Mr. Crawford said no state suffered greater damage from the Du Pont chemical than his. He said Benlate shriveled tree, vegetable and flower crops from south of Miami to the Florida Panhandle. More than 1,200 of Florida's 14,000 growers have filed claims against the company for damages. Mr. Crawford said the Benlate disaster had caused economic losses of nearly $1 billion and was by far the largest agricultural disaster this state had ever experienced. He said hundreds of the state's farmers had been ruined by the Benlate disaster.
 "The human toll has been very high," Mr. Crawford said. "It's caused divorces and depression. It's put people under enormous financial strain all over the state. When your whole life is basically in the next crop and you apply a pesticide and it kills all your plants, what are you going to do? Along comes Du Pont who says they will pay. Then all of a sudden they decide summarily they are disavowing any liability. And that is what has irked me because that is so irresponsible for a company like Du Pont to do that."
 The amounts of the individual settlements and the types of damage they were meant to compensate have largely been kept private between the company and the growers. But of those settlements that have been disclosed in the Florida press and by some farmers, some have been for millions of dollars to cover destroyed crops and lost business.
Before Du Pont withdrew most formulations of Benlate from the market in 1991, the chemical was the most widely used fungicide in Florida. It was intended to protect crops from root rots and other fungal damage caused by Florida's hot and humid weather. The compound has been popular in American agriculture since Du Pont introduced it in the early 1970's, and Benlate helped the $7 billion Florida farm industry become a dominant supplier of fruit, vegetable, flower and nursery crops.
 But since the late 1980's Benlate has been been one of Du Pont's most troublesome products. In 1989, Benlate compounds sold by the company became contaminated with a herbicide that killed crops in Florida and other states. The company pulled Benlate from the market the same year and was fined by the Environmental Protection Agency, though the company and the Government are still negotiating the amount of the penalty.
 The company put Benlate back on the market in 1990 but then withdrew it again in March 1991.
 The questions about Benlate have led to the formation of an unusual coalition to challenge Du Pont, made up of farmers, farm workers and environmentalists, groups that historically have been at odds over problems involving pesticides. All three groups were well represented at the meeting here.
 "What's going on with Du Pont and this chemical is a crime," said Dale Smith, a 52-year-old grower of native plants from Homestead, Fla., who was wiped out by Benlate more than a year before Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida last August. "I used Benlate three times and I never used anything else and it dwarfed my plants and gnarled up the root systems. Nothing could be sold."
 Such stories are common among farmers who said they used Benlate. But Dr. Hadley, the research manager for Du Pont's agricultural products division, said the company's research absolved Benlate of responsibility.
 In the face of rising tensions in the room, Dr. Hadley described in a calm and measured voice the careful steps the company had taken to support its new version of events. He said Du Pont had identified the principal lots of the product that were involved in most of the complaints in Florida and other states. Du Pont subjected thousands of boxes of Benlate from those lots to batteries of analytical tests capable of measuring infinitesimally small concentrations of ingredients and found none that were contaminated with any chemical that would kill plants.
 Dr. Hadley said soil was tested for the presence of chemicals formed after Benlate dissolved and nothing unusual was found. He said plants grown in this soil thrived.
 He said the company reached agreement with six growers in Florida and another in Hawaii to test Benlate on hundreds of thousands of shrubs, flowers and vegetables without incident. He displayed photographs of apparently healthy plants taken from these tests. Some of them were grown after they had been doused with Benlate at levels hundreds of times higher than is recommended by Du Pont or permitted by the Government.
 "The bottom line is we have tried to recreate the plant damage from applications of Benlate and have been totally unsuccessful," he said. "We have no choice but to conclude that Benlate did not cause the damage."
 
Conclusion Is Assailed
 But Dr. Tim Schubert, a top plant pathologist for the state's Department of Agriculture, took issue with Dr. Hadley's conclusion today and suggested that the company was not being completely forthcoming about its findings. Dr. Schubert said he took a tour last month of two of Du Pont's research sites near Tampa and noticed that shrubs sprayed with Benlate had unusual numbers of small leaves, branches that had multiple buds and shoots and under developed root systems. Dr. Schubert said the abnormalities were among those commonly described by growers of woody ornamental plants who had used Benlate.
 "These effects were consistent with what the state has learned about Benlate's ability to cause phytotoxic effects in plants," Dr. Schubert said.
 Asked about Dr. Schubert's observations this afternoon, Dr. Hadley said underdeveloped root systems and leaves were "a normal occurrence and not related to chemical treatment."

Du Pont de Nemours & Company announced that it was more convinced than ever that its chemical Benlate did not cause the variety of health problems that many farmers say it did.

HEADLINE: Chapter 11 Offers No Discounts For Macy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
It is not unusual for lawyers and bankruptcy judges to wrangle over fees and expenses. But a report filed in the bankruptcy proceedings of R. H. Macy & Company illustrates just what happens when a big, fat turkey lands in bankruptcy court and its advisers start scrambling to carve off a juicy slice.
 Never mind that the department store chain rolled up a whopping $1.3 billion loss in its last fiscal year and that its cash flow was nil. In June, July and August, the lawyers, accountants and financial advisers working for Macy and its creditors piled up bills for services and expenses amounting to $5,705,591.30, or about $62,000 a day. 
The bulk of the charges involved Macy's accountant, Deloitte & Touche, which received nearly $2 million, and its law firm, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which received $1.7 million.
 These are some of those charges:
 *A $6,930 bill filed by Weil Gotshal for looking at the bankruptcy papers of Ames Department Stores, which the law firm also represents.
 *A $4,070 bill from Deloitte & Touche for 37 hours of reorganizing files.
 *A bill for $13,425 for almost 90 hours spent researching and producing 30 slides comparing cost structures of five department stores.
 *Fees for three accountants from BDO Seidman, the firm representing Macy's unsecured creditors, who spent a total of 137 hours preparing routine fee applications each month.
 *A bill from the Blackstone Group, financial adviser to Macy, for a lunch that cost $418.91, even though guidelines by the bankruptcy court stipulate that meals may not exceed $20 a person and Blackstone had only four people working for Macy.
 
Ordered by Judge
 Concerned by the high cost of the advice to Macy, its bondholders and its trade creditors, Judge Burton R. Lifland, the judge who is overseeing the proceedings in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, formed a committee in September to analyze and evaluate the charges.
 Given Macy's dire financial straits, some of the law and accounting firms have found ways to economize. Weil Gotshal scaled back its work to lower its fees by roughly $200,000 a month.
 In its filing yesterday, the committee criticized some of the bills for being excessive and vague. The judge will hold a hearing on the report and bills on Tuesday.
 "We are unable to be impressed by legal fees being reduced to approximately $500,000 per month," the committee wrote of Weil Gotshal's cuts.
 William Jarblum, a partner in the law firm representing the trustee for one group of Macy's bondholders, wrote the report for the four-member committee, which included Herbert Hellman, Macy's general counsel.
 Mr. Hellman did not concur with the report's conclusions about Weil Gotshal or Berlack, Israels & Liberman, the bondholders' law firm.
 "I think Mr. Jarblum doesn't know what he's talking about," said Harvey Miller, a senior partner at Weil Gotshal and the lead lawyer representing Macy. "He's never staffed a large Chapter 11 case."
 He said Macy had actually reduced fees by doing many tasks in-house, like compiling financial documents.
 Mr. Miller said he was not going to cut fees and expenses just because of the criticisms. The $6,930 bill submitted for reviewing the Ames bankruptcy was legitimate, he said, because some of the strategies Ames used might be pertinent.
And he defended the use of a five-year, $200-an-hour associate, Susan Pearson, to draft the firm's fee application, a routine task.
 "Two hundred dollars an hour is not expensive in today's world," Mr. Miller said.
 
Compared With Federated
 A spokesman for Macy, James Fingeroth, said the advisers' fees were about half of what Federated Department Stores was charged at a similar point in its bankruptcy.
 David G. Heiman, head of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue's bankruptcy division and Federated's lead lawyer, said he could not verify Macy's contention.
 The report was most critical of Macy's advisers, though it suggested that advisers to the creditors could also be more economical. It questioned, for example, the amount of time Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, advisers to the bondholders, spent on comparative analyses of other department stores' operations.
 More than 70 percent of the fees and expenses were billed by Macy's advisers. But it is typical, particularly in the early part of a bankruptcy case, for the debtors' advisers to have the lion's share of responsibility.
 Alfred Leach, a spokesman for Deloitte & Touche, said the firm had not had an opportunity to review the report and could not comment.

He did concur with its assessment of the fees of Berlack, Israels & Liberman, a law firm for Macy's bondholders. This correction was improperly delayed through an editing lapse.

HEADLINE: Gardening

BYLINE: By Anne Raver; Anne Raver writes about gardening for The New York Times.

 BODY:
HENRY MITCHELL has helped me survive the annual deluge of numbing garden books. In ONE MAN'S GARDEN (illustrated, 262 pp., Houghton Mifflin, $21.95), a collection of his Earthman gardening columns for The Washington Post, he writes, "I have a useful rule of thumb for judging garden books: whenever I see charts in which you read down one side, then across, I know the book was written by some idiot whose learning and whose love are exhausted by a three-word summary."
You know the ones. Endless charts of plants, with their colors, heights and so forth. More English cottage garden books than Burpee tomatoes. Though I like one: ENGLISH COTTAGE GARDENING FOR AMERICAN GARDENERS, written and photographed by Margaret Hensel (239 pp., Norton, $50), has the usual charming photographs, but the plant combinations are interesting and the information on hardiness, culture and sources undeniably useful -- albeit only to the hopelessly English-obsessed. Still, I draw the line at paint-by-number gardening books in which each typically beautiful photograph is now accompanied by a diagram of curving numbered blobs with corresponding plant lists. You can even, those books claim, crack the genius of Gertrude Jekyll this way. 
 Balderdash. Just read Jekyll, if you can stand her prose, and go sit in your garden.
I won't even talk about the coffeetable books, whose preciousness and price have gone over the top. Perhaps they are parodying the people who buy them.
Which leads me back to my wholehearted hurrah for Henry Mitchell's new book, whose every page is filled with his irascible, wholly unpretentious voice: "It is agreeable to waddle about in one's own paradise, knowing that thousands of others have better gardens with better thises and thats, and better grown too, and no weeds at all. To know this and grin as complacently as a terrier who just got into the deviled eggs, and to reflect that there is no garden in England or France I envy, and not one I'd swap for mine: this is the aim of gardening -- not to make us complacent idiots, exactly, but to make us content and calm for a time, with sufficient energy (even after wars with bindweed) to feel an awestruck thanks to God that such happiness can exist. For a few days, of course."
Mr. Mitchell never tries to be funny or erudite. He just is. I don't fall asleep when he talks about the importance of architecture in the garden. He points out, for example, that many of the world's great gardens would be slim collections of plants, were their walls and pools and pathways removed. Then he offers a few simple suggestions to inspire those of us who would dream of having Sheffield Park in our backyards. We could try, he says, dedicating the whole garden to a copse of dogwood and sourwood, or a "huge informal pool fringed with peltiphyllums and reeds, overlooked by a mossy arbor of cedars." A Roman temple wouldn't hurt, either, he later notes.
A very different animal is the Massachusetts Horticultural Society's KEEPING EDEN: A History of Gardening in America, edited by Walter T. Punch (illustrated, 277 pp., Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown, $50). Mr. Punch is the head librarian of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, and his collection of 16 essays sweeps from Gordon De Wolf's revealing chapter on colonial times, when the first settlers were digging holes in the ground for houses and taking their gardening tips from American Indians, to William Howard Adams's whirlwind look at 20th-century American gardens (from Edith Wharton's "well-bred" design standards to the low-maintenance gardens of Thomas Church and Garrett Eckbo in California).
Phyllis Andersen contemplates the evolution of city gardens, from William Penn's plan for Philadelphia's five green squares to Frederick Law Olmsted's democratic park systems to a brief nod to the community garden movement. Michael Pollan looks into the future with an essay that juxtaposes the American obsession with lawns against the wilderness park. In one landscape, we dominate nature with chemicals and machines that obliterate what Alexander Pope called "the genius of the place." In the other, Mr. Pollan writes, we rope it off and worship its untouched qualities: "The idea of a middle landscape -- a place that might partake equally of nature and culture, that might seek to strike some sort of compromise or balance between the two realms -- has received short shrift, with the result that, even after some 500 years, the American garden has yet to come into its own." And so, he adds, does a sensitive and sane approach to our environmental problems.
This is the most satisfying of all the essays, because Mr. Pollan has the luxury of focusing on one idea while the other writers are burdened with the impossible job of summing up too many major ideas, movements, economic patterns and brilliant insights in too little space. But as Mr. Punch gamely points out in his introduction, the book begins to trace the diverse history of gardening in this country. I found it a fascinating outline. The bibliographies at the end of each chapter are invaluable resources, as is Elisabeth Woodburn's summation of gardening writing in America. One could hardly order a better reader's guide for the long winter months.
Another mind-expanding work is THE MEANING OF GARDENS: Idea, Place, and Action, edited by Mark Francis and Randolph T. Hester Jr. (illustrated, 283 pp., MIT, paper, $22.95). This collection of 29 essays by such varied minds as Garrett Eckbo, Chip Sullivan, Ian L. McHarg and Catherine Howett, first published in a small scholarly edition two years ago and virtually unnoticed by most gardeners, is now available in paperback. The essays deal with such subjects as the garden as a reflection of faith (from ancient times to our own); the garden as an expression of power (from Adam and Eve to Louis XIV to a pioneer woman who carves a garden out of her husband's beanfield to assert herself); gardening as the imposition of order, as cultural expression, as personal expression. There is even one on gardens as places to die.
As for how-to books, there are two excellent guides for vegetable lovers. THE NEW ORGANIC GROWER'S FOUR-SEASON HARVEST, by Eliot Coleman (illustrated, 212 pp., Chelsea Green Publishing, $17.95), clearly explains how to use cold frames and simple hoop greenhouses (with full instructions on building them) in order to eat fresh vegetables the year around. Mr. Coleman explains composting, the value of green manure, the importance of soil aeration and other basics with the easy style of a man who knows that mistakes in the garden often teach us the most about its mysteries. If he can grow food the year around in Maine, I figure I can too. STEP BY STEP ORGANIC VEGETABLE GARDENING, by Shepherd Ogden (illustrated, 297 pp., HarperCollins, $23) is a thorough guide to the basics of good gardening. Building good soil is the key, writes Mr. Ogden, who draws on the wisdom of his gardening father, Big Sam, as well as the experience he and his wife, Ellen, have gathered from their trial gardens for The Cook's Garden, their mail-order seed company in Londonderry, Vt. You will find a bounty of insights here on growing specific crops.
In the flower world, ANNUALS FOR CONNOISSEURS, by Wayne Winterrowd with photographs by Cynthia Woodyard (210 pp., Horticulture/Prentice Hall, $25) shatters the cliche that annuals are just fill-in plants. Even the most misused annuals have their place, Mr. Winterrowd writes. Take blue Salvia farinacea out of the bed of white petunias and red Salvia splendens, and put it next to the buttery yellow perennial Anthemis tinctoria. But more important, this Vermont gardener introduces us to many unusual annuals that can easily be grown in our own gardens, like Abelmoschus manihot, a six-foot mallow with dark green leaves and pale yellow five-inch-wide flowers with deep burgundy centers, and the green-flowered Nicotiana langsdorfii.
In brief: THE ENVIRONMENTAL GARDENER, edited by Janet Marinelli, THE TOWN & CITY GARDENER, edited by Linda Yang and TREES: A Gardener's Guide, edited by Judith D. Zuk (each 96 pp., Brooklyn Botanic Garden, paper, $6.95) add three well-written volumes to the garden's handbook series (four handbooks a year are included in the $25 membership, but each can be purchased separately). And for gardeners who need to conserve water (and many across the country now do), DRIP IRRIGATION: For Every Landscape and All Climates, by Robert Kourik (illustrated, 118 pp., Metamorphic Press, paper, $12) explains the arcana of drip systems and why they are better for many plants; it also tells how to install the right system.
XERISCAPE GARDENING: Water Conservation for the American Landscape, by Connie Lockhart Ellefson, Thomas L. Stephens and Doug Welsh (with photographs by Ms. Ellefson, 323 pp., Macmillan, $30) is a comprehensive guide to designing and planting a garden that doesn't guzzle water. THE ORGANIC GARDENER'S HANDBOOK OF NATURAL INSECT AND DISEASE CONTROL, edited by Barbara W. Ellis and Fern Marshall Bradley (illustrated, 534 pp., Rodale Press, $26.95) offers a concise listing of controls and clear photographs of common garden pests as well as diseased plants.

Gifts of Gab for '93

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
With all thy getting," the publisher B. C. Forbes liked to quote from Proverbs 4:7, "get understanding."
With all thy quoting, get a quotation book. The old editions are good, but the new ones are better be cause people are making new quotations every day. 
 The heaviest hitters in the field are Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 16th Edition (Little, Brown), edited by Justin Kaplan, and the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, New Edition, edited by Angela Partington. (It's the Fourth Edition, duly noted on the title page; I don't know why the publishers prefer the vague "new edition" on the jacket.) If you have a very large Christmas stocking, get both, because each has its separate virtues. If you have to choose, the best buy for Americans is Bartlett's.
That's not only because the publisher offers 1,400 big pages for $40 while Oxford falls short of 1,100 pages for $35; the reason for Bartlett's dominance of the field is its scholarship and zest. When Mr. Kaplan quotes Margaret Fuller's "I accept the universe," he footnotes Thomas Carlyle's comment, "By God! She'd better." Oxford does it the wrong way around, under Carlyle, making it harder to look up.
In selections from the Book of Job, an interest of mine, Bartlett's has twice the text; Oxford leaves out lines like "He is a king over all the children of pride." Both stick to the familiar King James Version of 1611; Oxford should consider shifting to its own beautiful and more accurate Bible translation in future editions.
Mr. Kaplan is a careful man: he lists "There's no such thing as a free lunch" under the economist Milton Friedman. I wrote to Milton about the origin of that adage some years back, and he cheerfully acknowledged it had not been original with him; that's why the quotologist adds a careful "attributed" next to the line.
Oxford is more specific about dates, however, and shows better judgment on the selection of the sayings of Ronald Reagan. Both books cite evil empire, but Bartlett's goes beyond Reagan's 1983 usage to its origin in the 1977 George Lucas film, "Star Wars." (Both also have the line "Go ahead, make my day," delivered first by Clint Eastwood, but only Bartlett's has the right citation. Oxford cites the 1971 film "Dirty Harry" as its origin; instead, it started in that film's 1983 sequel, "Sudden Impact," written by Joseph C. Stinson.)
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." If you want to find out how some of us have broken our heads to find the coiner of that, get "Nice Guys Finish Seventh: False Phrases, Spurious Sayings and Familiar Misquotations" by Ralph Keyes (HarperCollins, $18). It wasn't Edmund Burke, and if you were there when it was first said, speak up.
Mr. Keyes's title is drawn from the way the sportswriter Frank Graham edited Leo Durocher's "The nice guys are all over there. In seventh place." We remember it as "Nice guys finish last." (Who said "Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser"? In a mean-spirited moment years ago, I attributed that to Henry Kissinger, but it wasn't his coinage. Keyes suggests Knute Rockne, but Richard Nixon credits his college football coach, Chief Newman.)
Then there's "Dickson's Word Treasury: A Connoisseur's Collection of Old and New, Weird and Wonderful, Useful and Outlandish Words" (have you noticed how subtitles are getting more hard-sell lately?) by Paul Dickson (Wiley paperback, $14.95). His chapter on journalese offers such gems as densely wooded area, defined as "where most 'badly decomposed' bodies are found," and flawed, "used by critics in reviews in which they actually enjoyed the film, play, book or whatever but feel compelled to say something negative lest their boss think that they have gone soft in the head." A section on phobias is useful: a copy was sent to me with levophobia tagged; it means "fear of things on the left."
Stephen Glazier, who died this year just before his chef d'oeuvre was published, was a modern Peter Mark Roget -- a putter-together of word lists. The Random House Word Menu (guess what publisher, $22) combines dictionary, thesaurus and glossary in an original way that is of great use to writers. Look up cooks, for example, to find baker, barkeeper, confectioner, publican ("manager of tavern") and, among many others, a solution to the waiter-waitress-waitron problem that some linguistically correct types have posed: server.
Under grunts, as a category of speech many other word books neglect, the writer may select from a range including aah, har rumph, la-di-da, oof, ta-da, unh-unh, varoom and the ever-popular yech.
Palindrome freaks, a small category of word lovers who like to read back and forth, will snap up the slim and somewhat overpriced paperback "If I Had a Hi-Fi" by William Irvine (Laurel, $5.99), which includes We panic in a pew and Desserts, I stressed and the ambitious Some men interpret nine memos. (Gary Muldoon of Rochester, in the course of explaining to me that the word mnemonic comes from the Greek goddess Mnemosyne, contributes a palindrome of interest to parents proud of their grown-up offspring: Diapers repaid.)
For serious linguists, the gift of the year is a reprint of Otto Jespersen's 1924 "The Philosophy of Grammar," with an introduction and a new index by James D. McCawley (University of Chicago Press paperback, $17.95). When I recently offended who-whomniks by opining that than was a preposition, not a conjunction, Professor McCawley rode to my rescue by citing the great Danish linguist Jespersen's conclusion that so-called subordinating conjunctions are prepositions with clause objects. (Anybody still there? Helluva book.)
For librarians of major Wall Street investment houses -- not a huge audience, but somebody has to look out for their interests -- here's The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance (Stockton Press, 3 volumes, $595). General readers will find more than they want to know about takeovers, leverage and the quantity theory of money, but word freaks will be titillated by such entries as contango, "a fee paid by the buyer who wants to postpone delivery," a sultry dance by the buyer of futures options that is the reverse of backwardation.
The Wizard of Oz entry by Hugh Rockoff was an eye-opener: this children's story by L. Frank Baum is explicated as an 1890's allegory about bimetalism. The Yellow Brick Road is the gold standard (an oz. of gold); the Cowardly Lion is William Jennings Bryan, derogated for lack of courage by free-silver populists; President William McKinley, friend to financiers, is the Wicked Witch of the West, and the Wizard in Emerald City (Washington, D.C.) is Mark Hanna, the Republican leader. The New Palgrave does not say who Dorothy's dog is supposed to be.
Finally, for word lovers who appreciate an example of simple and lucid writing on a subject of infinite complexity, try the new edition of Robert Jastrow's short classic, "God and the Astronomers" (Norton, $18.95). By running the big-bang theory backward, scientists must deal with the moment of cosmic creation, a subject usually confined to theologians. To describe the reach of Hubble's Law of the Expanding Universe, he writes, "It applies not only to the Cosmos, but also to inflating balloons and loaves of bread rising in the oven." The bigger the subject, Jastrow demonstrates, the more effective are homely words.

HEADLINE: Days and Nights in Disney World

BYLINE: By NANCY SHARKEY; NANCY SHARKEY is an editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
THERE is a perverse rule in economics that applies to luxury goods: All else being equal, people believe that when they pay more, they get better quality. This applies to furs, platinum watches, Lamborghinis, Gucci briefcases and, apparently, Walt Disney World. Little else can account for the difference in price between the low-end and high-end hotels at the Walt Disney World complex in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
In a 10-night visit last summer, our family of three stayed in eight Disney World hotels ranging in price from $85 to $400 a night, excluding taxes. To our surprise, we found that $100 a night buys good accommodations and nearly the same level of comfort that the high-end places offer. At Disney World, a guest at any hotel can use the facilities of any other hotel. No matter where we were staying, we were able to ride throughout the complex on the sophisticated transportation system, including water taxis, monorails and trams; we had our pick of pools, restaurants, parking lots, even laundry facilities and baby-sitting services. As Disney guests we could reserve meals at park restaurants two days in advance. 
 We also found, not surprisingly, that newer is better at Disney World. The furnishings are spiffier and the amenities more amenable at the brand-new Dixie Landings ($85 or $104 a night) and the Yacht Club (we paid $260 a night) than at their older counterparts, the Caribbean Beach resort at the budget end and the Contemporary in the middle range.
The length of our stay, 10 days, solved a big problem: the perceived necessity to see it all, and fast. With a resort-style pool and pleasant accommodations, we didn't feel compelled to spend more than four hours a day in any of the three amusement parks: the Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center or MGM Studios. We arrived at each park early to avoid the heaviest crowds and fled to our hotel by lunchtime for a boat ride, tennis , horseback ride or swim.
While changing hotels every day is few people's idea of relaxation, we had deliberately set out to try as many hotels as possible, and in the process discover how to get the greatest value from the Disney hotel system.
Everywhere, we were ensconsed in a "setting," which of course is the Disney plan. The resorts evoke various benign themes. There's ersatz Louisiana plantation or New England clapboard resort, Polynesian village and faux Fifties Miami Beach.
I chose the eight hotels for their variety of price, location and style. We stayed in every type of accommodation that Disney offers, except a tent site. Many hotels are paired, with slightly different decor but the same price and architecture. We stayed in only one of each pair. We ate lunch or dinner in every resort and were impressed by the quality of the food -- far better and more carefully prepared than in the crowded restaurants inside the three amusement parks, and above average for typical hotel restaurants. Food prices generally followed room rates: the Grand Floridian was the most expensive, Dixie Landings among the most reasonable. I traveled anonymously.
Disney World's hotels are priced primarily by location -- the closer to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot or MGM, the grander and more expensive. And within each facility, rooms are priced by the view. "Parking lot or lagoon?" one reservations agent inquired.
At the high end, paying $250 a night or more, we stayed in the Grand Floridian, the Dolphin, the Yacht Club and the Contemporary. In the midprice category, between $100 and $250, were the Vacation Club and a trailer in Fort Wilderness. At the budget end, less than $100 a night, were Dixie Landings and the Caribbean Beach. The Vacation Club apartment and Fort Wilderness trailer had kitchens and dining areas. The others were large hotel rooms, with two double or queen beds, a terrace, a double sink outside the bathroom, which we appreciated, and an honor bar with reasonably priced sodas and snacks.
We each had our favorites. Chris, who is 12, loved the splashy Dolphin, with a health club, a waterfall pool, pedal boats on the lake, a game room, ice cream parlor with 50's jukeboxes -- and swarms of well-behaved teen-agers. My husband, Joe, liked the low-key Vacation Club apartment, with a private terrace opening onto shade trees; Jacuzzi room, washer-dryer and well-equipped kitchen. I liked Dixie Landings for its value, with good landscaping, a riverboat ride, bicycle rentals, central children's pool and the quiet adult pools adjacent to each of six clusters of buildings, a fishing pond and a decent, moderately priced Cajun restaurant.
There were specific highlights as well. The best pool was the Yacht Club's serpentine affair, with water slide and beach area for toddlers. The easiest access to the Magic Kingdom was from the Grand Floridian, which has its own monorail station and ferry landing. The best access to MGM was from the Dolphin and Swan, and to Epcot from the Yacht and Beach Club, both within walking distance, though there's a five-minute tram ride available.
The best service was on the concierge floor at the Dolphin, a section with full-time concierge service, central lounge, breakfast, tea and desserts. The hotel is operated by Sheraton, and the pleasant staff is less frenetically friendly than at hotels operated by Disney. At those, the staff seemed to have a divided mission -- part helper, part movie extra. Employee changing rooms and offices are labeled with signs, "Cast Members Only." Dressed as ranch hands, serving wenches or sailors, employees were young and usually desperately eager to please.
All of the hotels we stayed in were inside the vast Disney World complex, which has 17,460 rooms in 20 hotels, campgrounds and apartments. Outside the complex, the highways are lined with an astonishing clutter of hotels and motels, with an additional 53,000 rooms. And Disney plans more hotels. The most recent to open have been at the budget end, $85 and $104 a night, and Disney is planning to build more in that range by 1995, including a Hollywood-theme hotel near MGM Studios.
In addition to the hotel telephone numbers, there is a central reservations number, (407) 934-7639. Only the Dolphin, operated by Sheraton, has an 800 number.
 
Yacht Club
Our first stop was the Yacht Club, where the decor, not surprisingly, is nautical: white shoulder-high wainscoting, thick blue carpet with nautical flags and maritime prints, charts and shipboard details. The gray clapboard 635-room building, and its sky-blue companion hotel, the Beach Club, with 580 rooms, are meant to evoke the Cottage Era on the Maine coast. They would do so better, were it not for rows of metal flags atop the roof, permanently unfurled against the Disney sky. The lagoon in front of the hotel has a pristine white beach; its fine sand, free of seaweed or mollusks, is imported from the White Sands of New Mexico.
Our room had two queen-sized beds and a nice terrace overlooking the lawn and lagoon. The wood furniture had a nautical flavor, and there was plenty of light. The huge serpentine pool, with whirlpools tucked away in rocky overlooks and a sandy area for toddlers, was a highlight. A shipwreck waterslide empties into one end; I was content to let Chris stay in the water alone, because there were lifeguards every 50 feet.
The restaurants were uncrowded, and food was good and generous -- big sandwiches in the Yacht Club Gallery -- and at night, the three of us shared a tender, flavorful chateaubriand ($35) in the Yachstman Steakhouse. On the down side, the waiter asked if we knew the difference between bearnaise and bordelaise sauces, and a table of people near us were taking flash pictures of each other after every course.
Activities were uncrowded. Use of croquet sets was free and the tennis courts were ours alone. Late in the afternoon, we rented a small motorboat ($12 for a half hour) to explore the lagoon.
Across the lagoon from the Yacht Club, Disney's plans call for a boardwalk style hotel and amusement park, a bit like the old Atlantic City. This will undoubtedly affect what I found the greatest charm of the Yacht Club, its serenity.
Yacht Club Resort, (407) 934-7000, opened in 1990, 635 rooms, rates from $195 to $445 a night; from Dec. 20, $205 to $470. Adjacent is the Beach Club Resort, with a salmon and aqua beach theme.
 
Caribbean Beach Resort
Next, we stayed at the Caribbean Beach Resort, which is very popular because of the $85 room rate, among the lowest in the complex. The 2,112-room motel complex was jammed when we arrived; the separate guest registration building had a 20-minute wait to check in. Our room, despite the price, was surprisingly similar in size to the Yacht Club's. The beds were double, rather than queen, and the room didn't have a private balcony. But the covered walkway off our second floor room was wide enough that we simply could pull chairs outside and watch the afternoon rain, a fact of life in central Florida's summers.
The hotel has no bellhop service, no full-service restaurant and no room service, but a small central mall offers a wide selection of fast food. I found a stand there selling cereal, juice and milk, which I stashed in our room refrigerator for breakfast.
For dinner that night, I had booked what the reservations agent told me was the most popular dinner show in Disney World, the "Hoop De Doo Revue," a stage production at Fort Wilderness, about a 20-minute ride away. We couldn't understand the appeal. Our table was on a U-shaped balcony, wedged between the stage curtain and the kitchen door and overlooking a Dickensian scene of diners pressed tightly together at a mass of tables below. The production is billed as an all-you-can-eat meal with a two-hour vaudeville frontier show. Dinner, served at 7:45 and cleared at 8:10, consisted of fried chicken, barbecued ribs, corn on the cob and salad. I complained to the waitress about my ribs, which had an odd taste that I suspected was oven cleaner. The waitress asked the cook, and reported back that he didn't think it was, but he sent out a replacement anyway.
Then the four Disney performers danced onto the stage below. We had never seen the hokeypokey performed professionally before. Inevitably, there was audience participation, and we were roped in unwillingly by a young man in a Hee Haw suit.
"They're from New York," wailed the singing troupe, improvisationally, as the crowd applauded wildly. "Remember to use a fork!"
Wishing we'd said "Afghanistan," we slunk out before dessert. Back at our hotel, we complained to the Caribbean Beach manager about the seating, the food and the show, requesting a refund of part of the $100 we had spent. We were politely informed that the "Hoop De Doo Revue" is one of the most popular attractions in Disney World but that the Hoop De Doo manager would contact us. Chastened, we waited, even left a forwarding number, but he didn't.
Caribbean Beach Resort, (407) 934-3400, opened in 1988, 2,112 rooms, rates $85 (parking lot view) and $104 (lagoon view) a night; from Dec. 20, $87 and $114. Bus service only to the theme parks.
 
Grand Floridian
Next stop was the Grand Floridian. Here was grandeur, Disney style. The lobby of the main building has a five-story atrium, overlooked by oval ivory painted balconies. Outside, the white wood frame building with its turreted red roof looks remarkably like San Diego's Victorian gem, the Hotel del Coronado.
Our room was furnished in wicker and chintz, with big thick towels in the bathroom. We stayed on the concierge floor, which had a private lounge, overlooking the lobby, in which buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, wine and cheese and cakes and brandies were served. Snacks were available free, around the clock. Our crisp, cheerful, well-informed concierge thoughtfully sent Chris a child's bathrobe to match the two terrycloth adult robes in the room.
The Grand Floridian has the best tennis facilities at Disney -- two red clay courts, empty when we were there. The big L-shaped central pool is surrounded by deck chairs, many of them occupied by English and German guests. We ordered sodas from a small gazebo.
The hotel also has Disney's most expensive hotel restaurant, Victoria and Albert's, designed like an English men's club, with leather, wood -- and, in July, a fire in the fireplace. The intimate circular dining room has a domed trompe l'oeil ceiling. For our fixed-price dinner of $75 each, excluding wine, we received personalized menus, folded and closed with sealing wax.
The maitre d'hotel introduced our waiters, a handsome young couple one of whose name-tags said Albert and the other, Victoria. They recited the menu, taking turns. We noticed that the wine steward's tag also said Albert.
"You're all named Victoria and Albert, like the museum?"
The waitress nodded.
"What's your real name?"
She leaned forward, smiling conspiratorily. "Linda."
The food was superb, and so was the service. We had salmon carpaccio in three-pepper sauce with balsamic vinegar; consomme of elk and antelope with morels, a filet of beef with horseradish crust, salad of wild greens, Stilton and poached pear and a chocolate-raspberry terrine for dessert. Because there were only three other tables occupied, I asked if we could meet the chef. He turned out to be an Alsatian, trained in Colmar, who had until a couple of years ago owned a restaurant in Miami.
Later in the week we would return to the Grand Floridian by boat from the Magic Kingdom, just to enjoy the pleasant setting by the pool.
Grand Floridian Beach Resort, (407) 824-3000, opened in 1988, 900 rooms, rates from $220 to $400 (concierge floor) a night; from Dec. 20, $230 to $430. Tram, monorail and water ferry service to Magic Kingdom. 
 
 Fort Wilderness
Late the next morning, we crossed time and space to the quasi-rustic Fort Wilderness. After a half-hour wait in the reception shed -- our trailer was not ready -- we took a bus to River Country, the water park in the complex. Parking is heavily restricted throughout Disney World. -- Here, each trailer has a space, well shielded from its neighbor, but there's no parking on the roads; people leave their cars in the main lot or beside their campsites and use the frequent but often jammed buses.
At a very crowded settlement area near the lagoon, we bought ingredients for a picnic at the canteen and then took the ferry to Discovery Island, a tiny zoological park. The attractions at River Country -- inferior to better-designed water parks all over America -- were packed elbow to elbow. Tickets to these two parks were included in our six-day Disney passes; had we known they were so crowded and so unexceptional, we would not have bothered.
We had to wait until late afternoon for our trailer. After returning room keys -- and a resort charge card -- that belonged to another guest and had mistakenly been given to us, we finally settled into a comfortable, well-appointed tan-and-brown Fleetwood. It was equipped with a kitchenette, a surprisingly spacious bathroom with tub, shower and linen closet, a bedroom and in the living room, a Murphy bed, an artifact that Chris had seen only in black-and-white movies. We were so grateful for the extra space that we overlooked the aluminum and plastic.
There's a nightly organized campfire gathering in the complex, which was canceled because it rained. Fort Wilderness has a pool the size of the Grand Floridian's, a small, crowded game room, a depot grocery, a bike rental shack and a small lagoon for pedal boats. The main lagoon, a big man-made lake at the northern part of Fort Wilderness, has small motorboats, called water sprites, that skitter like gnats on the surface. Chris and I took out one, but the lagoon was so crowded that I spent much of the half hour worrying about collisions.
We spent two nights at Fort Wilderness, giving us our first full day without changing hotels. So we decided to start early at the Magic Kingdom amusement park, taking advantage of the one-hour's early admission (opening time is normally 9 A.M.) available to Disney hotel guests on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. We left our trailer at 7:30 and drove a few miles to the Grand Floridian guest lot, where we caught the monorail into the park, leaving our swimsuits in the car.
Chris and his father immediately headed to the Magic Kingdom's most popular attraction, Space Mountain, which is a steel roller coaster whose only real distinction is that it is in a large building, so the descent is in the dark. Not a fan of roller coasters in general, let alone at 8 A.M., I read the paper outside in the sun.
The long lines and dense crowds made us glad that we made lunch reservations from our hotel at the Liberty Tree Tavern, a large restaurant inside Magic Kingdom whose small tavern rooms give a feeling of intimacy. Afterward, we took the water shuttle back to the Grand Floridian, changed in the locker room, and spent the afternoon by the pool. Back at the Magic Kingdom in the evening, we fled when the curb of Main Street began filling up at 7 P.M. for a 9 P.M. parade.
Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground, (407) 824-2900, opened in 1971, 408 trailers $165 and $185 a night, ($180 to $195 from Dec. 20) and 784 campsites, $30 and $49 a night ($32 to $49 from Dec. 20). 
 
 Dolphin
Our next stop was the Dolphin, one of the hotels Disney commissioned from prominent American architects, this one a post-modern extravaganza by Michael Graves, whose splashy decor and Matisse colors, poster-bedecked walls and bright paintings suited the unashamed artifice of Disney better than our homey trailer in the damp woods.
Our peach and aqua room on the 19th floor, which had two queen-sized beds, pale wood furniture and marble sinks, overlooked MGM Studios to the right and Epcot to the left. The Dolphin has four choices for swimming -- a lap pool, a wading pool, a large pool with bridges and a swim-under waterfall and waterslide and a beach on the lagoon. There we could rent pontoon chairs, pedal boats and small sailboats.
We had lunch at an outdoor cafe, where things like pizza in a frisbee are served by lithe blonde waitresses wearing bikinis and tiny sarongs. The staff throughout the complex is young and good-looking, and seems to have been chosen partly on the basis of appearance. (In the Magic Kingdom, for example, the Tom Sawyer's raft drivers tended to be tow-headed and as aw-shucks cute as the young Ron Howard). Ethnic diversity among the staff seems not to be part of the Disney vision.
The proximity to MGM Studios was so easy that we went in the late afternoon, avoiding the crowds for the popular Indiana Jones show, and again first thing the next morning.
Dolphin Hotel, (800) 227-1500 or (407) 934-4000, opened in 1990, 1,514 rooms, $219 to $238; from Dec. 20, $229 to $299. Its sister hotel is the Swan, operated by Westin. Tram and water ferry service to MGM Studios; bus service to Magic Kingdom. 
 
Contemporary Resort
Our next stop was the Contemporary, once the most famous hotel in Disney World. Like so many once "futuristic" Disney concepts, the Contemporary today evokes nothing so much as the late Eisenhower Administration. A giant A-frame structure, with rooms fitted into each side, the hotel has a monorail line boring right through the lobby. It also has something of an attitude. As we were checking in, the man ahead of us, checking out, complained about the noise in an adjoining room. I asked the clerk if the hotel was noisy. "We're not going to get anxious about that already, are we?" he said, fixing me with a firm look.
I asked for a room on a high floor so we would have a great view of the fireworks that light up the night over the amusement parks. Our room was a disappointment, not worth the $275 we paid. A king-size bed, studio couch and worn sofa all needed sprucing up, and the rug was quite worn. The terrace had settled so that a 12-inch puddle formed in the center after the day's rain, and one of the tubular chairs was broken.
But the view of the fireworks was great. Chris ordered a pizza and watched from the terrace, while we went to "Broadway at the Top," a professionally done, agreeable revue of show tunes performed by a six-piece band and five singers. And before dinner, seated at the bar with picture windows overlooking the amusement parks, we had the hoped-for view. The food was standard nightclub fare, but prepared with care. The salad, our waitress said, was made with hydroponically grown bibb lettuce raised in a display at Epcot Center -- a rather poignant tribute to the original vision of Walt Disney, who had hoped Epcot would become an environmentally innovative working community rather than the permanent World's Fair that it is.
Service in the hotel itself was brusque. When our room service breakfast the next morning arrived half an hour late without milk for the cereal, the waiter threw the deadbolt on our door so that it would remain ajar as he left. "This way, I don't have to knock when I come back," he announced as Chris and I sat eating while my husband was in the shower. On two other occasions that morning,maids strolled in without knocking.
Contemporary Resort, (407) 824-1000, opened in 1971, 1,053 rooms, $180 to $435 a night; from Dec. 20, $190 to $435. 
 
Dixie Landings
By the time we got to Dixie Landings the next day, we were grateful for the privacy, as well as the reasonable price. An immense motel complex with an attractive central public area, Dixie Landings and its counterpart, Port Orleans, are the newest resorts in Disney World. Our room was in one of eight buildings designed to look a little like Louisiana antebellum mansions.
Our room, which overlooked the pool, had two double beds and plenty of feather pillows, but we missed having a refrigerator. Besides the price, at $104 a night, we found several advantages to staying here. There is a swimming pool, attractively designed, between each building, and a large central pool for children, as well as a water slide and small playground, together with a well-stocked fishing hole and bike rental station. Chris rented a bike for $2 an hour and spent hours happily circling the complex on wide walkways. We all rode the free water ferry through winding rivers to the Disney entertainment complex, Pleasure Island, where we looked into a couple of the bars, including one that seemed to be modeled after the Explorers Club in New York, complete with mounted heads.
Another advantage to staying at Dixie Landings, particularly compared with the Caribbean Beach Resort, was the availability of both a full-service restaurant that serves Cajun food and a cafeteria food court serving all meals. Though the complex was full, the pools were not crowded, and we had an easy time making dinner reservations. We had learned that Disney restaurant portions tend to be large, so the three us of shared two entrees and salad.
The next day, we decided to try the last item on our pass, a water facility called Typhoon Lagoon. Its main attraction is a huge wave pool, capable of generating an eight-foot wave. It did, but it was so crowded that we were concerned about injury.
Dixie Landings, (407) 934-6000, opened this summer, 2,048 rooms, $85 and $104 a night; from Dec. 20, $87 and $119. Its sister hotel, Port Orleans, has the iron grill balconies and floor to ceiling pastel shutters of the French Quarter. 
 
Vacation Club
Our last stop, the Vacation Club, looks like a high-rent suburban condominium complex. Our spacious two-room apartment had a separate Jacuzzi room and bathroom with walk-in shower, as well as a laundry room. The kitchen was fully equipped with good appliances, and Chris was delighted with the 30-inch television and V.C.R. in the living area, which had two pull-out couches. Our large balcony overlooked the river and a golf course fairway.
The Vacation Club units are rented like hotel rooms but also are promoted and sold on a time-share basis, though the only sign of that we saw was a couple of discreet brochures in our mailbox.
This was our last night, and we would have been happy to have stayed here all week. In fact, we didn't leave the complex that day, except for dinner. Had we called ahead, the staff would have stocked our refrigerator for a reasonable fee.
The difference between our less-expensive room at the Vacation Club and the room at the Contemporary was astonishing; we assumed that the 20-minute bus ride to the Magic Kingdom was the reason. Joe and Chris played tennis on a private court, while I read by the pool.
Ten days after we arrived, we had finally found a place to spend a relaxing vacation.
Vacation Club Suites, (407) 827-7700, opened in 1991, 197 units; $180 (studio) to $325 (two bedrooms); from Dec. 20, $190 to $340.

Round-the-World Air Fare
Q. Do airlines still offer round-the-world fares that allow a traveler to stop at several destinations for one flat price? -- L. Masone, New York, N.Y. 
 A. Some airlines, generally in conjunction with other carriers, do continue to offer such fares. British Airways, (800) 247-9297, for example, maintains a round-the-world desk. Tickets, good for a year, must be bought at least 14 days before the first flight. With a travel agent or ticket agent, a buyer works out an itinerary, which does not require dates for any but the first flight. There may be any number of stopovers, with no minimum or maximum stay, as long as stops are continuously in one direction. Passengers may make a total of five stops in the United States and Canada in addition to the first stop on entering North America. There is no charge for making dates for flights, for changing dates or for making one change in the routing. Subsequent route changes are $25.
There are several optional side-trip flights available along the way. For example, when passengers arrive in London, they may make round trips at no charge to other cities in Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, or for $128 to Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain or Sweden. Another option, out of North America, is to fly to the Cayman Islands, $175 round trip out of New York (the price varies by city), with a free flight to Cayman Brac. Those who arrive in Honolulu can make one free round trip to any of the other islands.
A British Airways trip, in conjunction with United, that makes the Pacific leg in the north (with choices of Japan, Hong Kong, and so on) is $2,570 in economy class, $3,618 business class and $5,020 first class. First-class passengers can fly the Concorde on the trans-Atlantic leg for $863, and business-class passengers can take it for $1,718. A South Pacific route (including Australia and New Zealand), with United and Qantas, is $3,274 in economy; $5,180 business class and $6,744 first class. The route also allows some stops in Africa.
 
Chelsea Flowers in America
 Q. You recently answered a reader's question about the Chelsea Flower Show in England. I have heard there is to be a Chelsea America Flower Show held in the United States. Is it associated with the one in England? -- Sandra J. Fusco-Walker, Kinnelon, N.J.
A. The Chelsea America Flower Shows in the United States are "patterned" after the Chelsea Flower Show in London, a spokesman for the Chelsea America Foundation says. But he notes that there is no formal relationship between the foundation and the Royal Horticultural Society, which runs the London show. Some of the show's advisors, including Stephen Bennett, the show director of the Royal Horticultural Society in England, have been involved with the Chelsea Flower Show in England.
Chelsea America Flower Shows will take place outdoors (with parts under tents) and will include model gardens, floral and cut flower displays and educational exhibits.
The first show will be held at Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., Feb. 6 to 9, 1993. It will take place on 40 acres on the former site of Marineland at the south end of Santa Monica Bay, in Los Angeles County. Information: (310) 648-6602.
The second will occur Feb. 20 to 23, at West Palm Beach, Fla., on 30 acres at the Vista Center of Palm Beach, on Okeechobee Boulevard at the West Palm beach exit of Florida's Turnpike. Information: (407) 793-7577. Both shows, which are planned as annual events, take place from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. and admission to each show is $10 a day. The organizers say admission is guaranteed, so buying tickets ahead of time is not necessary. However, tickets bought in advance in groups of 10 or more are $8.50; call (212) 207-1774.
The shows are likely to expand to other cities as well, the company spokesman says.
 
 
Parisian Theater
 Q. Can we get information on theatrical performances in Paris in February? -- Anita Lifson, Washington
A. Here are some of the productions (all in French) that will be in Paris in February. Tickets can be reserved by telephone.
Theatre de la Colline, 15 Rue Malte-Brun, 20th arrondissement, telephone 43.66.43.60: "Domaine Ventre," a comedy by Serge de Valletti, continues to Feb. 27. Performances are Tuesday to Saturday at 8:30, and Sunday at 3:30 P.M. "Terres Mortes" by Franz Xavier de Krotz (originally "Bauern Sterven") will be presented Feb. 16 to April 10; Tuesday to Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets for both are $28.
At the Comedie Francaise, 2 Rue Richelieu, in the first, 40.15.00.15, "Les Precieuses Ridicules" and "L'Impromptu de Versailles" two short comedies by Moliere, are being presented Feb. 6 through July, daily at 8:30 P.M. Tickets: $9 to $32.
At the Theatre de la Bastille, 76 Rue de la Roquette, 11th, 43.57.42,14, "Le Chasseur de Lions " a comedy by Javier Tomeo, begins Jan. 11 and continues to Feb. 7. Performances are Monday to Saturday at 7:30 P.M. and Sunday at 3:30 P.M. Tickets: $20.
Theatre National de Chaillot, 1 Place du Trocadero, 16th, 47.27.81.15: "Filumena Marturano" a comedy by Eduardo de Filippo, Jan. 21 to March 13, Tuesday to Saturday at 8:30 P.M. and on Sunday at 3 P.M. Also, "Les Fausses Confidences," an 18th-century comedy by Marivaux, Feb. 3 to to March 20, Tuesday to Saturday at 8:30 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets are $28 for each.
 
An Expo in Korea
 Q. Where will the next world exposition be held? -- Mary Greenwood, Key West, Fla.
A. The next world exposition will take place Aug. 7 to Nov. 7, 1993, in Taejon, Korea, about 100 miles south of Seoul. The theme of Taejon Expo '93,"The Challenge of a New Road to Development," addresses the problems of industrial development, such as the effort to maintain the environment and traditional culture while developing economically. Taejon, with nearby Taedok Science Town, has emerged as a Korean science and technology center. The exposition will use computer technology to present information on the grounds and also in airports, bus and train stations and at hotels and tourist information centers. It is unusual for the Bureau International des Expositions, the sanctioning organization for world expositions, to allow an event two years in a row. The Korean exposition is sanctioned as an international exposition, which has a narrower focus than a universal exposition such as the Seville event. More information: Korea National Tourist Office, 2 Executive Drive, Seventh Floor, Fort Lee, N.J. 07024; (201) 585-0909.

HEADLINE: Focus: Philadelphia;
A Center for the Hispanic Community

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
A TWO-SQUARE-BLOCK area in the center of North Philadelphia's Hispanic community is being redeveloped to preserve its role as an economic and cultural hub.
The site, near Fifth Street and Lehigh Avenue, used to house St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. It has been dark nearly two years. Construction is scheduled to begin by year's end on a $20 million, 250,000-square-foot complex with housing, municipal and social services and educational facilities. 
 Knitting and textile mills were once the primary employers in this industrial area dating to the 1870's. Most of the mills now are silent, but when St. Christopher's closed its Lehigh Avenue complex two years ago and moved to a new facility at Front Street and Erie Avenue, hospital officials hoped to restore the area's lost vitality.
The officials got proposals from several developers, choosing to sell the site to Canus Corporation of nearby Manayunk, whose plan includes social service facilities, housing and public meeting space.
Of the total cost, about $4 million will come from state, local and Federal agencies, with the restexpected from bond sales and private investors, who will be eligible for low-income-housing tax credits. The project will create a community center at the crossroads of the city's most concentrated Hispanic population. This, it is hoped, will lure independent real estate development, said Susan Rabinovitch, Canus's president.
In all, the Lehigh Park Center project includes 90,000 square feet in one building redeveloped for a nursing home; 41,000 square feet in another redeveloped building for offices of Congreso de Latinos Unidos, a social service agency; 80,000 square feet of housing in 29 rental apartments for low-income families in a variety of apartment and rowhouse buildings and 17 units in rowhouses on as many sites to be developed by a local nonprofit housing development corporation.
There also will be 21,000 square feet for a business and vocational training center and 15,000 for a municipal "mini city hall" and educational facilities.
The corner of Fifth and Lehigh is called "El Bloque de Oro" -- The Golden Block -- because of its many businesses, cultural and community groups.
Ms. Rabinovitch said the area had all the ingredients needed for successful grass-roots economic development.
"I don't know of another project in the city that brings all these parts together and all the different types of financing," she said. "Here was an urban renewal problem waiting to happen. But if I had to pick a community with hard-working people who'll raise their kids there, it would be here."
She said saw the site's potential 14 years ago on a visit from Montreal when her husband, Hyman, was interviewed at St. Christopher's, where he still works as a surgeon.
In addition to the construction jobs, Ms. Rabinovitch saw Lehigh Park Center as a way to replace some 300 workers who relocated with the hospital and to bring in other needed jobs or services. In particular, she said, the area has a severe shortage of nursing home beds.
Canus has done similar projects before, combining neighborhood restoration with self-sustaining economic activity. In the Powelton Village neighborhood, next to Drexel University in West Philadelphia, it developed a block of shops with apartments above in the 3600 block of Lancaster Avenue.
In 1988, when St. Christopher's Hospital announced plans to move 14 blocks from where it was founded, hospital officials recognized a duty to reuse the disparate buildings they had outgrown, said Gretchen Sennott, a hospital spokeswoman. They considered several plans, but chose to sell the site to Canus for $2.5 million.
In addition to larger industrial buildings, the hospital had used several rowhouses as doctors' offices.
"We had a strong commitment to the community and community leaders felt strongly that the creation of more abandoned buildings in North Philadelphia was a problem," Ms. Sennott said. "While the buildings were difficult to administer in a hospital setting because they're separate, they're easier to use in a multiple-use redevelopment."
ST. CHRISTOPHER'S is one of the oldest pediatric hospitals in the country and some of its buildings date to its founding before the turn of the century, Ms. Sennott said.
Now its buildings look much like other graffiti-covered red-brick plants in the area that date to the Industrial Revolution. One architectural exception is a white-brick, two-story city library fronting for a full block on Lehigh Avenue; it, too, is scarred by graffiti.
More than a dozen multi-story factories once produced textiles, carpeting, wagon wheels or yarns and were surrounded by the rowhouses and small apartment buildings for their employees.
Many are in dilapidated condition yet stand side-by-side with homes covered in colorful siding with tidy front yards or pocket gardens.
While Philadelphia's total population shrank from 1.7 million in 1980 to 1.6 million in 1990, its Hispanic total -- primarily from Puerto Rico -- grew in that same period, from 63,570 to 89,193. The overwhelming majority of the city's Hispanic residents live within a mile of the Golden Block, according to census data.
In 1995, political redistricting of the city will yield a City Council district that is 26 percent Hispanic. Angel Ortiz, who pressed for the creation of the district, is currently the only Hispanic member of the Council, but he is an at-large member, as opposed to a district representative.
Alba Martinez is executive director of Congreso de Latinos Unidos, a social service agency for the Hispanic community. She said the headquarters at Lehigh Park Center would create a more visible identity for the organization.
"It would be for us a dream come true to centralize all our programs under one roof," she said. "We could be more efficient and effective and it would allow us to do more with less."
The group currently has 26 programs operating in five sites throughout the city providing drug, alcohol and AIDS awareness efforts and counseling plus after-school activities. Its $3 million annual budget allows for only $90,000 a year in rent, Ms. Martinez said. The rest of its rent in the Lehigh Park building will come from a $1 million Federal grant obtained this fall.
"ANY developer that comes into a neighborhood to work with social service agencies is aware of their precarious financial situation," Ms. Martinez said. "But we're being conservative."
The city also has a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which has developed a small business loan fund to assist minority business start-ups. Several banks have committed a total of $1 million to the fund, said Gualberto Medina, the chamber's president. Mellon Bank/PSFS is among the private lenders involved in the loan fund and in financing Lehigh Park Center.
Jim Dever, a bank spokesman, said the bank had so far committed a $500,000 loan for the project.
Mellon/PSFS is among several banks approached by Canus, but it has no branches in the immediate area. Indeed, there are no major bank facilities at the heart of Fifth and Lehigh. It took a community protest in nearby Kensington to get Fidelity Bank not to close its offices about a mile from the Lehigh Park Center site.
Another bank, Provident National Bank, is looking for ways to bring banking service to the neighborhood. It was also a lender to Canus for Lehigh Park Center, said Don Kelly, the bank's community reinvestment manager.
"The need has gotten greater and greater because of the conditions there and because of the structural changes in the economy and the recession," he said.

HEADLINE: What's in Store For the West Side

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
ON the west side of lower West End Avenue, a scrubby and uninhabited quarter of abandoned rail yards, parking lots, rubbish heaps and a service station, an entirely new neighborhood is being planned with enough room for 14,650 residents and a variety of impacts that will be felt citywide.
As a focal point, this new neighborhood might have something akin to a town square: a privately owned, one-acre park between 63d and 64th Streets where three enormous developments converge. The park is part of Daniel Brodsky's Manhattan West proposal, whose 38-story towers would border it on the south. A twin-towered, 41-story apartment building, one of 16 in Donald J. Trump's Riverside South project, would rise to the west. Over the north end of the park would be the 39-story apartment towers of a residential and studio complex proposed by Capital Cities/ ABC. 
 "What we're talking about, with these proposals put together, is the development of a new community," said Richard L. Schaffer, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "It's a community that will complete the western edge of the Upper West Side."
Should all the projects get built, the transformation would be astonishing. Riverside South alone might have from 11,030 to 11,350 residents by the year 2002, added to 1,700 residents in Manhattan West and 1,600 residents on the ABC site. More people would live in these projects alone than now live in the area from Central Park to the Hudson River, 58th to 66th Street.
Local leaders, city officials and private planners are struggling to measure and mitigate the impacts of these projects. These negotiations reveal the broad concern over development at that scale.
Directly or indirectly, the impacts of Riverside South might be felt at a sewage plant in Harlem, a rail yard in the Bronx and television studios in Queens. With the other projects, it would add hundreds of students to crowded elementary schools and thousands of riders to crowded subway stations.
Although the three projects abut one another, they have come through the city review procedure at different times. And that is one of many things that frustrated the neighbors in dealing with the proposals.
"I'm very dismayed by the process, by the inability to consider the cumulative effect of all this building," said Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, a Democrat who represents the area. "It seems to me that the role of city government should be to plan. We don't plan. We process applications."
IN 1990, the Board of Estimate approved Manhattan West, between 61st and 64th Streets. This 900,000-square-foot development would include 1,000 apartments and a park at the north end.
On Dec. 17, the City Council is to vote on Riverside South, a 7.9 million-square-foot development on the abandoned Penn Yards, from 59th to 72d Street, which would have as its civic centerpiece a waterfront park ranging from 15.8 to 21.5 acres. ABC's plan for a 1.2 million-square-foot project between 64th and 65th Streets is now being considered by Community Board 7, after which it will be reviewed by Borough President Ruth W. Messinger, the City Planning Commission and, finally, the Council.
ABC has proposed an L-shaped apartment structure on the northwest corner of West End Avenue and 64th Street, with three towers and 937 units. It would adjoin a 113-foot-high structure containing the new Studios 25 and 26, which would be linked to the existing Studios 23 and 24. There would also be a 350-space parking garage.
Residents of the development, which is to be finished in 1996, would be "relatively affluent" managers and professionals, mostly in their mid-20's to mid-40's, said the draft environmental impact statement prepared for ABC by the Manhattan firm of Allee King Rosen & Fleming.
According to the impact statement, the project "would likely increase" displacement pressures on as many as 978 people living nearby in single-room-occupancy hotels or in buildings with five apartments or fewer, which are not typically subject to rent regulation. However, the impact statement also noted that the pressures would exist without the ABC development.
Without any mitigation, traffic would grow significantly more congested along West End Avenue, from 57th to 72d Street, particularly in the morning rush hour, as well as at Central Park West and 65th Street. The project would also crowd the M104 bus on Broadway in the morning.
On the positive side, the impact statement said, the project would increase employment in the television and film industry, as well as related companies, such as those supplying lights and equipment. This would be "a much needed boost to the industry during lean times, as well as a gesture of confidence in New York City."
By ABC's calculations, the project would create 255 new jobs on the site: 100 in the production of a new daytime entertainment show and 155 in the apartment building, stores and garage. The complex would free existing studios for use by newly created news programs, according to ABC's impact statement, accounting for 200 more new jobs.
Building the project would create a year's worth of employment for about 3,720 people, principally construction workers and material suppliers, 70 percent of them living in New York City. Construction would also generate from $17 million to $20 million in tax revenues for the city and state.
"I think ABC has much to commend it as a project," Mr. Schaffer said, but "the residential component is too large."
Large as it is, the ABC development would be overshadowed by Riverside South, whose effects would be felt not only in other neighborhoods but also in other boroughs.
For example, the North River Water Pollution Control Plant, four miles away on the Harlem waterfront, has taken center stage in the debate over Riverside South, whose sewage might push the already strained and odor-filled plant beyond its capacity.
"If the capacity is reached and you have no other place to put the sewage, you're not going to be able to have any more hook-ups," said Councilman Stanley E. Michels, who represents upper Manhattan. "We would inhibit further development in the northern part of Manhattan."
North River has a permitted capacity of 170 million gallons a day of sewage. In August, the flow was 171 million gallons, according to the impact statement, but the 12-month average was 169.1 million gallons. Riverside South would generate 1.42 million gallons of sewage a day in 2002, by which time conservation measures are supposed to have reduced the overall flow.
Under a restrictive declaration signed by Mr. Trump, Riverside South buildings cannot be hooked up to the North River plant unless the chairman of the City Planning Commission certifies that the sewage will not cause the plant to exceed allowable capacity. Alternatives include the construction of a sewage plant at Riverside South or a pumping station that would send Riverside South's sewage to a plant on Ward's Island.
Another example of the potentially far-reaching consequences of Riverside South involves the television studio proposed at its south end. Council members worried that the creation of a huge new studio in Manhattan might undercut efforts to promote the existing Kaufman-Astoria and Silvercup studios in Astoria and Long Island City, Queens.
ALTHOUGH the Council did not eliminate the Riverside South studio, it required Mr. Trump to come back for a special permit in order to build it. "The reality is we stopped the studio," said Peg Breen, the spokeswoman for Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone of Queens. "The likelihood is that economics will dictate that the studio never be proposed and the reality is that whatever is proposed will be modified by the time it goes through the process."
The Bronx would also feel the effects of Riverside South. Because Mr. Trump's development would foreclose any possibility of reusing the Penn Yards as a rail freight terminal, its construction would increase the strategic importance of the Harlem River Rail Yard in the South Bronx. As part of the restrictive declaration, Mr. Trump is to provide $7 million to the city for capital improvements at the Bronx yards.
More general economic benefits, as outlined by the impact statement, would include $220 million in tax revenues generated by construction of the project. Riverside South would create enough work to employ 27,000 people for one year or 2,700 people for 10 years, the expected construction period.
Its most tangible and enduring benefit for the public would be the creation of a public park along the Hudson River. This would be 21.5 acres if the West Side Highway is relocated from the shoreline viaduct on which it now runs to a curving, inland route. If the highway stays in place, the park would be 17.5 acres. The park could lose another 1.7 acres if the development of pier space is not approved by the Army Corps of Engineers.
The impact statement discloses that if the highway were to stay in place, noise levels in the park "would be higher than those generally recommended for outdoor activities." If it is moved, the amount of noise would be "comparable" to that in existing parks adjacent to major roadways.
Among the finer points covered by the impact statement is the fact that small portions of the site along the original shoreline may have been used by Indians as summer fishing camps and that there may be undisturbed "evidence of prehistoric occupation," such as shell piles, known as middens.
The environmental impact statement, prepared for Mr. Trump by Allee King Rosen & Fleming, also includes these findings:
* Riverside South might add 844 students to the public schools. Of these, up to 430 children would be of elementary-school age, "significantly exacerbating" overcrowding. Mr. Trump has agreed to provide space on site, for sale or lease to the Board of Education, to accommodate 600 students.
* It would add as many as 3,600 riders to the subway system at rush hour and nearly 1,500 riders at mid-day. Mr. Trump has agreed to contribute $10 million toward the construction of a new headhouse and stairs at the 72d Street IRT station and $2 million for a new stairway at 66th Street.
* It might hasten the displacement of up to 960 people who live in small apartment houses and single-room-occupancy hotels nearby. But Mr. Trump has agreed to set aside at least 12 percent and as much as 20 percent of the housing for lower-income families and this "may provide housing opportunities for those persons."
RIVERSIDE SOUTH was rejected by Community Board 7 but approved, with modifications, by Ms. Messinger; by the City Planning Commission, unanimously, and by the Council's Land Use Committee, 12-to-2.
Because they fail largely to address the key question of overall density, the modifications and mitigations have not done much to placate Riverside South's critics, who have long maintained that Mr. Trump's project should be no larger than the 7.3 million-square-foot Lincoln West proposal, which was approved for the same site by the Board of Estimate 10 years ago.
The chairwoman of the community board, Hope L. Mason, said: "What each player, except for the Community Board, has done is to pick out those elements of the project that are palatable to a certain degeree and leave the harder issues -- in particular, the issue of density -- to the next participant."
"The buck doesn't stop with anyone," Ms. Mason added.
But Mr. Schaffer said the process had resulted in a "very reasonable package," with key concessions on sewage, subway stations and park development.
Rather than contrast Riverside South to Lincoln West, Mr. Schaffer compared its density to that of the nearby community, saying that both had approximately 100 dwelling units an acre.
"I think it's entirely consistent with the built fabric of the Upper West Side," he said. "What people aren't used to is seeing a 56-acre site developed."
Since the Riverside South impact statement presumes a 10-year construction period, he said, it accounts for the effects of the Manhattan West and ABC developments, which are to be completed earlier.
"I think the far West Side can sustain the population of the new community," he said.

HEADLINE: Delegation Gains Edge on Capitol Hill

BYLINE: States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NOT since Harry S. Truman's 1948 campaign to clean up Capitol Hill has the United States Congress hemorrhaged so badly: This year the House of Representatives alone lost one quarter of its members. A total of 123 Congressmen either were beaten or retired, many choosing to quit rather than face a backlash from an electorate chafing at news of proliferating scandal and a deepening recession.
But Connecticut voters resisted the anti-incumbency tide sweeping the rest of the country, sending back to Washington a fully intact delegation. In an institution where the parameters of power are defined by seniority, this could give Connecticut an edge over other state delegations, many of which will see their strength diluted by freshmen legislators. 
 The Connecticut delegation is looking at the kind of clout in the House and the Senate that it had in late 1970's when former Representative Robert N. Giaimo and Senators Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Abraham A. Ribicoff presided over some of the most influential committees and subcommittees in Congress.
"I think the delegation is poised to be more powerful than it's been in a long, long time," said former Representative Toby Moffett, who now works for the Wexler Group, a lobbying firm in Washington.
The combination of enhanced seniority, personal access to the White House, and the likely election of Connecticut's more experienced members to major committees and leadership positions, should bring the state power in the Democratic-controlled Congress that far exceeds its modest size.
 
Rewards for Early Clinton Backers
 "We have some great opportunities with seniority in our delegation and ties to a new Administration," said Democratic Representative Rosa L. DeLauro of New Haven, who is returning for her second term. Ms. DeLauro and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of New Haven were among the first members of Congress to publicly support the Clinton bid for the Presidency.
Ms. DeLauro and her husband, Stan Greenberg, one of President-elect Bill Clinton's closest campaign advisors who is poised to play a high-profile role in his Administration, are considered two of Connecticut's best assets going into the 103d Congress.
"It's an intangible measurement but it will be extremely important to the state to have that duo covering both the legislative and the executive in a crunch," Mr. Moffett said.
Congressional staff members already have stamped Ms. DeLauro and Mr. Greenberg as personae grata with members of the vanguard political elite. As one Congressional aide put it, "You know they're going to be dining at the White House."
Mr. Lieberman will also enhance the state's position in Washington with his ties to the new Administration. The Senator has been an assiduous campaigner for the President-elect, who is an old friend and colleague from their law school days at Yale. Mr. Clinton, who worked on Mr. Lieberman's first State Senate campaign in New Haven, already has consulted with Mr. Lieberman on a range of issues, from the conflict in Yugoslavia to an economic recovery program.
 
Friends in High Places
 "I look forward to having a friend in the White House," Mr. Lieberman said. "It will give me an opportunity to do a lot more for the state. I will be able to gain access when we need it if there is a special problem. We will at least get a hearing.
"We in Connecticut will benefit more from his Administration than other places," the Senator added, "because we are more in need and also have a skilled work force, too much of which is out of work."
Mr. Lieberman's background on environmental issues in the Senate also places him in a natural position to work with Vice President-elect Al Gore on his top priority: integrating environmentalism with economic development.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of East Haddam, will move up in his committees, although with 12 years in the Senate, he has already established seniority and considerable power as the chairman of three subcommittees in the Foreign Relations, Banking and Children's Committees. One of Mr. Clinton's top priorities, according to campaign aides, will be Mr. Dodd's family-leave bill, which is expected to be one of the first to make it into law in the next session of Congress.
 
A Patchy Seniority Record
 Unlike states such as Massachusetts that have had lawmakers serving for a quarter of a century and longer, Connecticut has a patchy record of building seniority in Congress. Since Congressman Giaimo and Senator Ribicoff served for 22 years, and Governor Weicker for 20 years, no member from Connecticut has served more than a dozen years.
During that earlier period, the Connecticut delegation boasted chairmen of the House Budget Committee, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Small Business Committee.
"What kills us is that lawmakers go on to run for other offices," said Howard Reiter, professor of political science at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. "They go on to run for Senator and Governor, so Connecticut has not stacked up on seniority very well," he said, noting the cases of former Representatives Bruce A. Morrison and John G. Rowland, who ran unsuccessfully for Governor in 1990.
The greatest gain in seniority this year will be in the House, where Democratic Representative Barbara B. Kennelly of Hartford will move up seven places on the influential Ways and Means Committee and will likely retain her current position as the House Chief Deputy Whip, the only woman in the Congressional leadership.
Mrs. Kennelly's seniority on the tax-writing committee also all but guarantees her a joint appointment to the Budget Committee, another pre-eminent panel. Mrs. Kennelly said she would work to secure programs like heating oil subsidies, which were crucial for the state.
 
In Line for a Chairmanship
 Democratic Representative Sam Gejdenson of Bozrah, who narrowly survived one of this year's tightest races, will move into the second spot on the Foreign Affairs Committee. If the committee's chairman, Lee Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, moves to the Clinton Administration, as some politicians believe, Mr. Gejdenson would be in line to be chairman.
Mr. Gejdenson, the delegation's longest serving House member who is beginning his seventh term, has become a high-profile member of the House having led the campaign finance reform movement last session as well as directing the re-election bid of Representative Tom Foley of Washington as Speaker of the House.
Mr. Gejdenson, who also came to Mr. Foley's aid when the Speaker was reeling from the recent House Bank scandal, said that it took him years to get to the point where he could push his own legislative agenda. "I spent my first eight years here hoeing in the back fields," he said.
Unlike most members, Mr. Gejdenson has excellent access to the Speaker, who decides which bills live and die. "No one in the world is closer to Foley," Mr. Moffett observed. During the waning hours of the 102d Congress, for example, Mr. Gejdenson dropped by Mr. Foley's office half a dozen times in a successful attempt to get two of his bills -- a jobs-for-exports bill and one to protect whistle blowers at nuclear sites -- to the floor for a vote.
 
Coveted Seats Up for Grabs
 But even Connecticut's neophyte members will probably benefit from the losses suffered by the larger states. Almost every large and mid-size state lost veteran members, who had been sitting on the major committees for decades.
Ms. DeLauro, for example, is the leading Democratic contender for a spot on the Appropriations Committee, the panel that doles out money for everything from highway projects to medical research. Even though the Congresswoman is only going into her second term, there is an unprecedented number of openings on the committee -- 13 -- making it possible for her to be considered.
Not since the days of former Representative William R. Ratchford, Democrat of Danbury, and Senator Weicker has Connecticut had representation on the Appropriations Committee.
"It's been a very long, dry period for Connecticut," said Mrs. Kennelly. Both Mr. Gejdenson and Mrs. Kennelly, who sit on the panel that decides committee assignments, have worked hard to secure Ms. DeLauro a spot.
Assignments, which will be handed out before the end of the year, are based on votes on the Democratic side by the Steering and Policy Committee, and on the Republican side by the Committee on Committees. Members of each committee have the final say on assignments and it is up to the individual legislators to lobby these members, who base their votes on seniority, geography, personal qualifications and political connections.
Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Stamford, also is trying for a spot on the Appropriations Committee. This will be his second run for the assignment and he says he has persuaded the Committee on Committees that New England needs representation. There are no other members from the New England region bidding for the spot, which puts Mr. Shays in a strong position.
"We would be thrilled to have a member of the delegation on Appropriations, where some of the most important decisions are made," said Terry Muelenberg, director of Governor Weicker's staff in Washington. "The states that do best are those sitting at the table."
Ms. Muelenberg said that Connecticut would have a better chance to fulfill its wish list of favored projects which the state office gives to the delegation every session. On the tentative list for the next session are hundreds of millions of dollars for the highway and transportation fund, energy assistance and defense conversion programs.
 
Republicans Jockey for Positions
 With the Democratic-controlled Congress and White House, Republicans will play a diminished role, although they too will benefit from seniority. Representative Gary Franks, Republican of Waterbury, is lobbying for a seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Franks also is slated to move up in seniority on the Armed Services and Small Business Committees, although he would have to relinquish his seat on these committees if he secures a seat on Energy and Commerce.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of New Britain, may follow her Democratic colleague Mrs. Kennelly into a leadership position. Mrs. Johnson, who also moves up in seniority on the Ways and Means Committee, is running for the position of vice chairman of the Republican Conference, the leading Republican group in the House.
Mrs. Johnson is lobbying her colleagues for votes and, with the support of Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, she has a good chance, according to House Republicans. Mrs. Johnson helped shore up moderate votes for Mr. Gingrich when he ran for whip.
"She's gained a great deal of respect for her leadership already," said Representative Dean Gallo, Republican of New Jersey, who is working for her election. "Her involvement, expertise and tenacity to get resolutions all bode well for her."
Tony Blankley, press secretary for Mr. Gingrich, put it more succinctly: "She's no shrinking violet. And we don't have as many women in our conference as we would like."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: Readers' Questions;
A Converted Orphanage, and a Stickley Connection?

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
This is another in a series of columns answering questions from readers about New York's changing streetscapes.
 
402 East 90th Street
 Q. We live in a condominium at 402 East 90th Street, converted about nine years ago from an old building. I've been told it was once a convent with land and gardens extending almost to the East River. Can you tell me about the building? . . . Ruth J. Natinsky, Manhattan. 
 A. Before reconstruction into apartments, your building was used as a garage but it was indeed built as part of an orphan asylum.
St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum was founded in 1857 for the care of Roman Catholic orphans of German origin.
The asylum built various structures on the block bounded by 89th and 90th Streets, First Avenue and York Avenue, and 402 East 90th Street was built in 1898.
Designed by A.F.A. Schmitt, the large brick building was apparently used as a church. Facing 90th Street, it has a facade similar to a power plant or warehouse, but the principal, eastern facade -- originally facing the orphan asylum grounds -- has a curious temple front, which is still largely intact. The orphanage was operated by the Sisters of Notre Dame.
In 1918, the building was converted to a garage.
In the 1970's, there were several plans filed with the Department of Buildings to convert the building to tennis or squash courts but it appears that these were not carried out and that the building was converted to apartments by adding several stories in 1986 in a conversion that, incidentally, preserved some of the original facades.
 
6 East 39th Street
 Q. I am trustee of the Craftsman Farms Foundation, which operates the farm and residence of Gustav Stickley, the furniture designer, in Parsippany, N.J. We have frequent inquiries about the Craftsman Building at 6 East 39th Street in New York City. Did Stickley build it? The story has it that his acquisition of the building caused his bankruptcy in 1915. . . . Muriel F. Berson, Mountain Lakes, N.J.
A. The 12-story loft appears to be a conventional speculative building. It was built in 1912 by the estate of Henry Cram and designed by Schwartz & Gross, active commercial architects.
Stickley's firm moved in soon after completion and indeed took the whole building. But it appears he did not actually own it -- bankruptcy proceedings in 1915 described the chief assets of the firm but do not mention any real estate.
 
Labor Temple
 Q. There is a building called Labor Temple on East 14th Street used by church groups in the late 1940's. I'm interested in its history and architect. . . . Femmy Lundstrom, Woodbury, L.I.
A. Labor Temple was established as a center for the working classes in the old 14th Street Presbyterian Church at the southwest corner of 14th Street and Second Avenue in 1910 by the Rev. Charles Stelzle, once a machinist. The church was demolished in 1924 but a professional developer agreed to build space on the site for the Labor Temple in exchange for control over the store's apartments and other offices in the six-story Romanesque-style building.
Designed by Emery Roth -- known for his high-rise apartment houses like the San Remo -- the $750,000 building contained an auditorium, gym, chapel, roof playground and other spaces.
The Rev. Edmund B. Chaffee, the director at the time of opening, described the mission of the Labor Temple as the study of "the great industrial and social problems that face modern society."
 
101 West 86th Street
 Q. My great-grandfather, Joseph Silk, lived at 101 West 86th Street in 1912. How old was it in that year? . . . Judith Sylk-Siegel, Manhattan.
A. This structure, at the northwest corner of Columbus Avenue, was built as the Ormonde in 1886-87. It was designed and owned by John G. Prague, an architect very active in opening up the West Side.
Joseph Silk, a fruit merchant who moved from 30 West 65th Street in 1908, is shown in the 1910 census here with a household of eight people. Those in your immediate family line were your great-grandfather, 63 years old, and his daughter (your grandmother), Hannah Siegel, 35.
The five-story Ormonde, which has stores on the ground floor, originally had half-floor apartments and was considered a "flat," midway between a tenement and a luxury apartment house. It has since been reconstructed within to add many more apartments.
 
565 West 169th Street
 Q. I am not sure when my co-op apartment house on the east side of Broadway from 169th to 170th Street was originally built, but the stock certificates refer to its incorporation in 1921.
Older residents of this six-story structure contend that it was the very first such venture ever built. Is this true? . . . Emmanuel Lemakis, Manhattan.
A. No. The building application for your complex, Woodrow Court at 565 West 169th Street, indicates a construction date of 1917-1918. It was built for the 169th Corporation of which the principal was Jacob Axelrod, of 200 West 72d Street. Axelrod was known as an active rental apartment house builder; his architect was George F. Pelham.
It is difficult to determine Axelrod's intention for Woodrow Court, but it was sold six times between its completion and August 1920, when it was acquired by "Woodrow Court Inc.," the co-op corporation. None of the owners were active, identified co-op builders or converters in this period.
The first co-ops were built in the 1880's with a revival just after 1900, but these were uniformly aimed at luxury tenants. Inflation after World War I drove up rents in Manhattan and for a few years there was a flurry of middle-income co-op activity, of which Woodrow Court is an example.
It is possible it was conceived as a co-op, but the delayed transfer suggests it was really a conversion by a subsequent owner. The 1925 census lists its residents as about half native-born, with occupations like bookkeeper, shoe salesman and accountant.

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:

Flip Tax on an Inheritance
 
Question: A co-op apartment was left to me and my sister by my mother, who died two years ago. The apartment passed into my mother's estate, to which my sister and I are sole heirs. 
 The managing agent for the co-op maintains that while the estate may own the apartment and must pay the maintenance, the heirs may not occupy the apartment unless they pay a flip tax of $20,000. We believe the current market value is about $120,000 to $140,000. It seems to me that the imposition of this large fee -- 15 percent -- when no sale is involved is questionable. Does the flip tax apply? . . . Carol Williams, Stamford, Conn.
 
Answer: Probably not. According to Brook Boyd, a lawyer with the firm of Herrick, Feinstein in Manhattan, if the co-op's documents were standard it would be unusual for the flip tax to be triggered by mere occupancy of the apartment. But from a practical standpoint, the co-op has substantial leverage when it come to occupancy and rules regarding flip taxes.
"It would depend on the specific language in the proprietary lease or the offering plan," Mr. Boyd said. "If the flip tax applies only to a sale, then the inheritance of the apartment should not be subject to a flip tax."
The so-called flip tax, which is not a tax but a transfer fee on the sale of shares, has been upheld in New York State courts as a legitimate way for co-ops to raise money. The corporation's board has the right to determine the amount of the fee and how it is imposed.
You should refer to the co-op's documents for specific references to how flip taxes are applied and may want to want to consult a lawyer specializing in co-op law.
 
Refinancing in a Co-op
 
Question: Our building has 250 apartments and is dominated by the sponsor. When I became a shareholder about five years ago, the co-op had a $3.147 million mortgage. It was replaced with a five-year mortgage of $3.792 million. I am told that another mortgage will be taken for $4 million. I never feel comfortable with the verbal explanation of why almost $1 million has been added to our debt in the past several years. The building needs work, but wouldn't a one-time assessment be more beneficial to shareholders? . . . Clarence Jones, Long Beach, L.I.
 
Answer: Maybe not. According to Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, sequential refinancing of the building's underlying mortgage during such a short period of time, is not necessarily a poor financial strategy.
"If each new mortgage has been taken at a lower interest rate," said Ms. Rothman, "it may have been prudent management of the building's debt."
Even with the increase in the loan size, if the interest rate drops were significant, the board may have been able to raise cash while maintaining or lowering the portion of the maintenance used to pay the mortgage.
However, your board should be willing to provide you and other shareholders with more than a verbal justification of its refinancing strategy. Co-op boards are obligated to provide shareholders with annual financial reports. You might suggest to the board that it include a discussion of its refinancing in this year's report.
 
Bothersome Smoke
 
Question: The building directly across from mine constantly belches smoke from its chimney, often right into my window. I have been told that I have no recourse because the smoke is usually white and white smoke is legal. It is smelly and gritty all the same. Is this true? . . . Stephanie Winston, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. According to Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, the air pollution control code laws make no distinction between white smoke and smoke of any other color. Any visible smoke is prohibited. The use of incinerators is still legal in New York City, but their use will be banned in all residential and most commercial buildings after next June 30. The only legal use will be in connection with medical facilities. You can file a complaint by calling the agency's 24-hour hotline at (718) 699-9811, or write to the D.E.P. at 59-17 Junction Boulevard, Corona, Queens 11368.

HEADLINE: Wounded Waterbury: No Place to Go but Up

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
IT is a Chamber of Commerce nightmare. There lies Waterbury, perched up and down on some hills in western Connecticut, still known as the Brass City though the big brass companies have all passed away, a community down on its luck that obviously could use a bit of encouragement.
So what happens? Money magazine, in its annual survey of the best and worst places to live, rated the city No. 300 out of the 300 largest metropolitan areas in the country. That's dead last, the end, the pits. Adding insult to injury is that it is the second straight year that Waterbury has attained the status of lowest of the low: 1991, No. 300; 1992, No. 300. 
 What the survey seems to have accomplished, in addition to angering the business and political establishments and ordinary citizens as well, is the urge to fight back.
The anger is mostly based on the contention by city leaders that the Money survey is unscientific and unfair, biased toward isolated cities of the Midwest and the Great Plains that have little relationship to the older cities of the crowded Northeast.
How, they ask, can a city like Sioux Falls, S.D. -- this year's No. 1 -- be compared with Waterbury, Conn.?
 
Industrial vs. Prairie Town
 Sioux Falls has a far more homogeneous population of 123,000 spread over a huge area by Eastern standards. "If we had that area, we could include Boston if we went one way or New York City if we went the other," commented Waterbury Mayor Edward D. Bergin. His city's population of 110,000 is tucked into about 28 square miles.
Waterbury has always been an industrial city while Sioux Falls is a prairie town currently enjoying prosperity as a center for back-office bank operations that were attracted to South Dakota because the state places no legal limits on usury.
Critics of the Money survey also charge that cities in states with big economic troubles, or with income taxes, do not fare well in the survey, an additional economic burden for Waterbury to bear.
"We have the highest unemployment rate in the state," said Frank D. Fulco, president of the Greater Waterbury Chamber of Commerce. Waterbury has an unemployment rate of about 14 percent while the rate Sioux Falls is 2.6 percent.
 
Bridgeport's Weather Better?
 Economics aside, Mr. Fulco said other aspects of the survey baffled him. One of the most puzzling was a category on the weather. He can understand why, for instance, Honolulu would be rated better for weather than Waterbury. But so was Bridgeport. Waterbury was given 18 points out of a possible 100 for weather. Bridgeport was given 28 points. "They've got different weather in Bridgeport than here?" he asked.
Richard Eisenberg, a senior editor of Money, denied that the survey had any geographical bias and he noted that five years ago, when the Northeast was booming, the No. 1 city for quality of life was Danbury, Conn. He said that he found "the difference" in weather between Waterbury and Bridgeport "an interesting question," but that the weather statistics were based on Government statistics and, to his understanding, even neighboring cities could have different weather patterns.
Regardless of how the Money survey was conducted, and its fairness or unfairness, this year's slur on Waterbury's name, following the indignity of last year, seems to have galvanized the old city.
A citywide forum, "Town Meeting for Tomorrow," is going to be held in February, to give residents a say in what direction the city should go, Mr. Fulco said. In addition, he said, the American Institute of Architects has given preliminary approval to a request for a team of architects and planners to study the city and make recommendations for its future.
 
$100 Million Shopping Center
 But the best bet for getting Waterbury out of its economic doldrums could be a $100 million shopping center planned for a 100-acre tract near downtown and along Interstate 84, which cuts through the city. The site is that of the old Scovill brass works where the brick ghosts and pollution of the city's manufacturing past must be cleared before the developers of the mall can come in.
The city's cost of clearing the land could run as high as $30 million, but Mayor Bergin said the city had a "novel approach" for obtaining some of the money. The idea is to have the Department of Defense participate in demolishing the buildings because the Defense Department, the Mayor noted, helped create the plants that provided materials like shell casings in World Wars I and II and, therefore, should help in taking them down.
But even if that approach does not work, he said, he is convinced the land will be cleared, the mall built and 3,000 jobs produced in a city that needs jobs.
 
Image From Interstate 84
 An added benefit of clearing away the Scovill mills, Mayor Bergin said, is that it would also clear away the image of Waterbury presented to motorists passing by on Interstate 84 or Route 8. In this, Mr. Fulco concurs: "People driving by see old factories, the image of a blue-collar town. 'It's dying,' that's what they say."
Waterbury even gets little respect from other cities in the state, Mr. Fulco added. "Radio and television stations, particularly the ones in Hartford and New Haven, don't even mention Waterbury when they give the weather," he said. "They mention the three biggest cities, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport, and then Danbury. But Danbury isn't the fourth biggest city in the state. We are."
As Mr. Fulco sees it, that and other slights have created sort of a municipal inferiority complex in Waterbury. Residents, he said, do not readily admit they come from Waterbury. "The enemy is us," he asserted. "We've got to change our image of ourselves."
 
Municipal Politics
 The level of city politics could be one reason why some residents don't broadcast where they live. Connecticut's most famous corruption case, in the era before World War II, was known, rightfully, as "The Waterbury Scandal," which involved the conviction and imprisonment of the city's Mayor, T. Frank Hayes, who was also the Lieutenant Governor of the state, and about two dozen cronies, for embezzling several million dollars from the city. Then, in June of this year, a former Mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, was sent to prison for embezzlement. Even Mayor Bergin, whose long tenure was temporarily interrupted by a loss to Mr. Santopietro, was once indicted on charges of taking a bribe but was found not guilty. Politics in Waterbury is heady stuff.
Despite that, and despite the judgment of the Money survey, city officials and many others maintain that Waterbury is a fine place to live, a place of proud and hard-working people, with charming old business buildings of brick or brownstone, with the old-fashioned department store, Howland-Hughes, which dates back more than a century and specializes in the customer service once common in retail establishments before the chains took over.
"This is not a city of the very rich and the very poor," Mr. Fulco said. "It's middle-class American and we've maintained our middle class."
Mayor Bergin said Waterbury has not had the suburban flight that the three larger cities in the state have experienced. "Residents may have moved to other parts of town for better neighborhoods but they stayed in the city instead of fleeing to the suburbs," he said. "To people who live here, this is a good city."
 
827 Hotel Rooms, 300 Restaurants
 It is also a good city to people from the outside, said Jim Whitney, executive director of Waterbury Convention and Visitors Commission. He said he felt that the Money survey was "totally flawed" but it was not going to change his approach to attracting visitors. His boasting runs on: "We have 827 hotel rooms, more than Hartford. We have 300 restaurants. We have one of the prettiest greens in New England. We have accessibility. And the cost to stay here is 25 percent less than other cities in state."
These are people, of course, who are expected to say nice things about the city. Their jobs depend on the city. Not so though for a Roman Catholic nun who has become a Waterbury booster.
Sister Marguerite Waite, president and chief executive officer of St. Mary's Hospital, said she looked on the results of the Money survey as a lack of knowledge about Waterbury. It does not reflect the Waterbury she knows. "This is a nice city with wonderful health care and a symphony orchestra and a great museum," she said. "I think it's a great place to live. And the people here are special, who pull together."
If that kind of testimonial isn't enough, there are always the comments of a real outsider to consider.
 
Sioux Falls Disk Jockey
 His name is Kevin Flynn but in Sioux Falls, S.D., he is known as Maxx Boogie, the morning disk jockey for radio station KPAT.
After Sioux Falls was named the best city in the Money survey, Mr. Flynn thought it would be fun to hold a contest with first prize being a trip to Waterbury, "the First to the Worst." He arrived in Waterbury with the contest winner in tow and said both were delighted with what they discovered and how they were received -- dinner with the Mayor, an aerial foliage trip, a tour of the historical areas, riding the sightseeing trolley.
Back home in Sioux Falls, Mr. Flynn now sings the praises of Waterbury.
"What is Money magazine thinking of?" he asked, with some wonderment, on a recent day after his chores at the station were done. "Waterbury is a wonderful place. If we're No. 1, we've re-ranked Waterbury from No. 300 to No. 1 1/2. No, make that 1 1/8." Mr. Flynn is a real civic booster, for Waterbury.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
A Hispanic Center for North Philadelphia

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
A two-square-block area in the center of North Philadelphia's Hispanic community is being redeveloped to preserve its role as an economic and cultural hub.
The site, near Fifth Street and Lehigh Avenue, used to house St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. It has been dark nearly two years. Construction is scheduled to begin by year's end on a $20 million, 250,000-square-foot complex with housing, municipal and social services and educational facilities. 
 Knitting and textile mills were once the primary employers in this industrial area dating to the 1870's. Most of the mills now are silent, but when St. Christopher's closed its Lehigh Avenue complex two years ago and moved to a new facility at Front Street and Erie Avenue, hospital officials hoped to restore the area's lost vitality.
The officials got proposals from several developers, choosing to sell the site to Canus Corporation of nearby Manayunk, whose plan includes social service facilities, housing and public meeting space.
Of the total cost, about $4 million will come from state, local and Federal agencies, with the restexpected from bond sales and private investors, who will be eligible for low-income-housing tax credits. The project will create a community center at the crossroads of the city's most concentrated Hispanic population. This, it is hoped, will lure independent real estate development, said Susan Rabinovitch, Canus's president.
In all, the Lehigh Park Center project includes 90,000 square feet in one building redeveloped for a nursing home; 41,000 square feet in another redeveloped building for offices of Congreso de Latinos Unidos, a social service agency; 80,000 square feet of housing in 29 rental apartments for low-income families in a variety of apartment and rowhouse buildings and 17 units in rowhouses on as many sites to be developed by a local nonprofit housing development corporation.
There also will be 21,000 square feet for a business and vocational training center and 15,000 for a municipal "mini city hall" and educational facilities.
The corner of Fifth and Lehigh is called "El Bloque de Oro" -- The Golden Block -- because of its many businesses, cultural and community groups. Ms. Rabinovitch said the area had all the ingredients needed for successful grass-roots economic development.
"I don't know of another project in the city that brings all these parts together and all the different types of financing," she said. "Here was an urban renewal problem waiting to happen. But if I had to pick a community with hard-working people who'll raise their kids there, it would be here."
She said saw the site's potential 14 years ago on a visit from Montreal when her husband, Hyman, was interviewed at St. Christopher's, where he still works as a surgeon.
In addition to the construction jobs, Ms. Rabinovitch saw Lehigh Park Center as a way to replace some 300 workers who relocated with the hospital and to bring in other needed jobs or services. In particular, she said, the area has a severe shortage of nursing home beds.
Canus has done similar projects before, combining neighborhood restoration with self-sustaining economic activity. In the Powelton Village neighborhood, next to Drexel University in West Philadelphia, it developed a block of shops with apartments above in the 3600 block of Lancaster Avenue.
In 1988, when St. Christopher's Hospital announced plans to move 14 blocks from where it was founded, hospital officials recognized a duty to reuse the disparate buildings they had outgrown, said Gretchen Sennott, a hospital spokeswoman. They considered several plans, but chose to sell the site to Canus for $2.5 million. In addition to larger industrial buildings, the hospital had used several rowhouses as doctors' offices.
"We had a strong commitment to the community and community leaders felt strongly that the creation of more abandoned buildings in North Philadelphia was a problem," Ms. Sennott said. "While the buildings were difficult to administer in a hospital setting because they're separate, they're easier to use in a multiple-use redevelopment."
St. Christopher's is one of the oldest pediatric hospitals in the country and some of its buildings date to its founding before the turn of the century, Ms. Sennott said.
Now its buildings look much like other graffiti-covered red-brick plants in the area that date to the Industrial Revolution. One architectural exception is a white-brick, two-story city library fronting for a full block on Lehigh Avenue; it, too, is scarred by graffiti.
More than a dozen multi-story factories once produced textiles, carpeting, wagon wheels or yarns and were surrounded by the rowhouses and small apartment buildings for their employees. Many are in dilapidated condition yet stand side-by-side with homes covered in colorful siding with tidy front yards or pocket gardens.
While Philadelphia's total population shrank from 1.7 million in 1980 to 1.6 million in 1990, its Hispanic total -- primarily from Puerto Rico -- grew in that same period, from 63,570 to 89,193. The overwhelming majority of the city's Hispanic residents live within a mile of the Golden Block, according to census data.
In 1995, political redistricting of the city will yield a City Council district that is 26 percent Hispanic. Angel Ortiz, who pressed for the creation of the district, is currently the only Hispanic member of the Council, but he is an at-large member.
Alba Martinez is executive director of Congreso de Latinos Unidos, a social service agency for the Hispanic community. She said the headquarters at Lehigh Park Center would create a more visible identity for the organization.
"It would be for us a dream come true to centralize all our programs under one roof," she said. "We could be more efficient and effective and it would allow us to do more with less."
The group currently has 26 programs operating in five sites throughout the city providing drug, alcohol and AIDS awareness efforts and counseling plus after-school activities. Its $3 million annual budget allows for only $90,000 a year in rent, Ms. Martinez said. The rest of its rent in the Lehigh Park building will come from a $1 million Federal grant obtained this fall.
"Any developer that comes into a neighborhood to work with social service agencies is aware of their precarious financial situation," Ms. Martinez said. "But we're being conservative."
The city also has a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which has developed a small business loan fund to assist minority business start-ups. Several banks have committed a total of $1 million to the fund, said Gualberto Medina, the chamber's president. Mellon Bank/PSFS is among the private lenders involved in the loan fund and in financing Lehigh Park Center.
Jim Dever, a bank spokesman, said the bank had so far committed a $500,000 loan for the project.
Mellon/PSFS is among several banks approached by Canus, but it has no branches in the immediate area. Indeed, there are no major bank facilities at the heart of Fifth and Lehigh. It took a community protest in nearby Kensington to get Fidelity Bank not to close its offices about a mile from the Lehigh Park Center site.
Another bank, Provident National Bank, is looking for ways to bring banking service to the neighborhood. It was also a lender to Canus for Lehigh Park Center, said Don Kelly, the bank's community reinvestment manager.
"The need has gotten greater and greater because of the conditions there and because of the structural changes in the economy and the recession," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Chinatown;
Beneath the Bustle, A Malaise Emerges

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
COMPARED to the rest of the city, Chinatown is booming. Rents are high, buildings are still going up, offices are still being leased.
What promises to be its largest restaurant ever, with a capacity of nearly 1,500, is scheduled to open on Elizabeth Street next year. And Chinatown long ago crossed its traditional Canal Street boundary, making ever deeper inroads into Little Italy. 
 But compared to itself scarcely two years ago, Chinatown is ailing. Its jewelry centers, where booths once commanded waiting lists, have "space available" signs in the windows. Its restaurants are suffering revolving-door ownership as restaurateurs discover diminished volume no longer supports high rents.
Storefronts on Canal and Mott, the main shopping streets, remain pretty well occupied, but local owners say some are in arrears on their rent. Stores that used to command $145 a foot now can be had for $100 or so. It no longer takes $100,000 in key money for a 10-year lease on Canal. And on secondary streets like Mulberry or East Broadway, no key money is needed at all.
"Retail space never used to go on the market here," said Stephen D. Dadourian, a managing director of D.G. Hart Associates Inc., which owns several Chinatown properties. "Tenants would sublet, there'd be key money. Now stores can sit for a month."
Office space, which generally rents for between $22 and $35 a foot, sits far longer than that. Even buildings offering the kind of luxury space that is almost impossible to find in this cramped, bustling downtown area are having a rough time.
No one expects the area's newest buildings -- Ka Wah Bank Ltd. of Hong Kong's 15-story Glory China Tower at 11 East Broadway, Chinese American Bank's 8-story building at 77 Bowery, and Bank of East Asia's 8-story building at Canal and Mulberry streets -- to be rented soon.
"With space in the World Financial Center at $26 a foot, it's not easy to woo triple-A tenants here," said Y.M. Yang, an executive vice president of Chinese American Bank.
Dashed hopes are rife. Three years ago, when the Chinese American Bank started construction, it expected to occupy five floors and rent out three. Now it will be happy to rent two floors. It has not hired a broker or aggressively sought tenants itself.
"We'd be lucky to get $100,000 in yearly rents, and after all the taxes we'd pocket half that," said Mr. Yang. "So sure, we'd like to find tenants, but right now we've got other things to devote our manpower to."
The picture is even bleaker regarding space targeted at jewelers. The New York Jewelers Exchange at 70 Bowery, once exclusively for jewelers, recently let space to a travel agent. Williamson, Pickett & Gross Inc.'s new building at Elizabeth and Hester Streets, built with ground-floor jewelry boutiques and upstairs apartments, is empty.
"I've put 'for rent' signs out for the first time in 25 years," said Irving R. Raber, a prominent Chinatown building manager. "And I've reduced rents as much as 25 percent for the jewelers I do have."
Many buildings are being hastily converted to new uses. On Canal Street near Lafayette Street, the owners of one building carved space previously used by a large discount store into a series of smaller areas, hopin to create a jewelry mall. There were no takers, and they have recently reopened the space and leased it to a big stereo store.
D.G. Hart, which has rented most of the office space in its renovated building at 168 Canal Street, has had less luck with a renovated loft on Elizabeth Street it had hoped to rent to jewelers. It is now looking for light manufacturing and office tenants.
Similarly, the new Golden Gate Mall, on Canal and Mulberry Streets, was originally intended as a retail mall; it has converted the top floors to office space.
The problems go beyond the recession. For one thing, Chinatown is facing competition for residents and businesses for the first time in its history. Many Chinese-Americans, and even some immigrants, have wearied of the congestion and high rents of Chinatown, and have gone to the boroughs.
There is a mini-Chinatown in Brooklyn, stretching from 50th to 62d Street on Eighth Avenue, and one emerging on Avenue U, between Coney Island and Ocean Avenues. Chinatowns have also emerged in Queens, in Flushing and Elmhurst-Jackson Heights.
"Many of us who grew up socializing in Manhattan's Chinatown are hanging out in Brooklyn now," said one Chinese-American professor who asked not to be named.
Moreover, Chinatown's real estate operates by a different set of rules than midtown. Lower floors command higher rents than upper ones, in part because many buildings are old and lack elevators and in part because Chinese businesses use window signs to attract drop-in traffic.
Superficially desirable stores on well-traveled corners can stay vacant for months because they are said to have bad feng shui -- a Chinese expression describing a belief that the shapes and textures and juxtaposition of surrounding buildings and natural fixtures have an impact on the success of anyone operating in their proximity.
"IF your location is said to have bad feng shui, you won't rent easily," said Joseph G. Genovesi, a managing partner of D.G. Hart.
Workouts and foreclosures remain rare, though. Many Chinese people are averse to debt and few buildings are heavily mortgaged. And seeking protection from creditors is, culturally, just not Chinese.
"Chinese people believe that paying a debt is more important than anything else, even if you have to go into your own pocket to get the money," said Paul Ho, manager of Citibank's Chinatown branch at 164 Canal Street.
Chinatown has a lot going for it that midtown does not have. Everything is on a small scale. Building floors rarely have more than 3,000 square feet of usable space.
Businesses, too, are small -- a typical Chinatown accounting or law firm has one, maybe two partners, and would fit into 500 square feet. Thus, even rents that are high on a square-foot basis can be affordable to a modestly profitable business, while a vacant office rarely represents a huge drop in a landlord's income.
Chinatown also is attracting people and investments from Hong Kong, in anticipation of the colony's reversion to China in 1997. David Chin, a local insurance agent, notes that Hong Kong investors readily pay $1.5 million for decrepit buildings worth a third that amount, just to move their assets to town.
"They assume they will be able to recoup their money when another immigrant wants to transfer funds," Mr. Chin said.
Scarcity is also keeping building prices high. Most Chinatown buildings are old, and many are mixed residential, retail and industrial. Apartment houses are often rent-regulated, making it almost impossible to evict the tenants and renovate for commercial use.
"Empty commercial lofts are so rare that they become very expensive," said Sonya Chiang, a broker with A.O. Realty. Indeed, Sing Tao Newspapers got $4 million for an old seven-story building at 105 Mott Street, which the buyers converted into commercial lofts.
Geographically, Chinatown is a hub for such prime nearby tourist destinations as Little Italy, South Street Seaport, SoHo and Wall Street, and development related to tourism is also picking up.
In February, Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger formed a Chinatown Tourism Council to market Chinatown as a tourist attraction. And the new Holiday Inn Downtown on Lafayette Street near Canal -- until recently the Hotel Maria -- is advertising in Chinese-language papers in Canada, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hong Kong.
Phyllis Berlingeri, the hotel's sales director, says bookings are brisk. About 30 percent of the guests are Asians (60 percent of those from Hong Kong), 40 percent are domestic tourists and the rest are foreign tourists.
The hotel, whose rates top out at $120, is chasing a different crowd from pricy downtown hotels like the Vista International.
"There's a lack of competition for the price-conscious Asian traveler," Ms. Berlingeri said.

HEADLINE: Ballroom Dancing Is Back in the Swing Again

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
BALLROOM dancing, which flourished during the Depression, World War II and, briefly, the 1970's oil crisis and then went into eclipse, is on the rise again, and thousands of New Jerseyans are dressing up and going out to waltz, fox-trot and rumba.
Baby boomers, weary of the solitary gyrations of the 80's, have joined their jitterbugging elders on the dance floor. Men and women in their 20's and 30's, who never suffered through the white-gloved misery of formal dance classes, are learning for the fun of it. And couples of all ages are flocking to join the first New Jersey chapter of the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancing Association. 
 Experts offer a variety of reasons for the resurgence. Some credit the recession, on the theory that cutting the rug on Saturday night, waltz or fox-trot style, may make it easier to face the bills on Monday mornings.
"Whenever we have had a war or hard times, ballroom dancing has been popular," said Neil Clover, a dance instructor at Princeton University, which offers ballroom dancing as a noncredit course.
Dr. David Dodd, an associate professor of sociology at Montclair State College, said the return of ballroom dancing might also be part of an overall "return to social conservatism," manifesting itself in a "nostalgic yearning" for the glamour and structure of ballroom dance. After years of "do your own thing" rock-and-roll dancing, he added, ballroom dancing may represent "settling down to safe middle age" for baby boomers.
And Russ Patrick, owner of the Stardust Ballroom in Pennsauken, who has watched the ebb and flow of social dancing over 40 years as a dance band musician, suggests that the decline of social drinking has played a part. "People come to the ballroom to meet each other," he said, "and dancing gives them something else to do."
 
An Increasing Membership
 Last March, Robert Cassel of Cedar Grove started the first state chapter of the national dance association, which now has 225 members. More New Jersey chapters are in the works. And while most of the ballroom association's members are from northern New Jersey, the art is also gaining in the south.
Some 250 to 400 people glide, spin and box-step across the Stardust Ballroom's white maple surface each night in what Mr. Patrick described as a "resurgence" over the last two years. Sandra Fortuna, a Cherry Hill ballroom dance coach and competition producer, said her "festival" competition and exhibition has grown from being "a large dinner dance" when it began in 1988 to having 1,000 entrants this year.
Ballroom dancing is right in step with some of the dominant social themes of the 90's -- it is healthy, economical and ecologically sound. Dee Murray, owner of the Arthur Murray Dancing School in Fair Lawn and no relation to Arthur, touts ballroom as a way to reduce stress and build confidence. Some of her students, she adds, have lost weight in the process of mastering the art.
Price, experts say, is a factor. From the Stardust Ballroom to the weekly dances at the Boys and Girls Club in Lodi, couples can put on their dancing shoes and tighten their belts at the same time, since many establishments that hold regular dances charge less than $10 a person for an entire evening of tripping the light fantastic -- sometimes to the beat of live music.

 
Lessons on the Basics
 Many newcomers to the ballroom have never had basic dance instruction. ("They don't know their left feet from their right," Mr. Patrick said). To make up fpr this, and to win new converts, the Lodi Boys and Girls Club and the Friday night dances at the Stardust Ballroom often begin with a group lesson where would-be dancers are guided through basics by an instructor.
Though a group lesson will not turn a nondancer into Fred Astaire, novices "learn to maneuver on the floor and switch partners," Ms. Murray said. The lessons at the Stardust Ballroom focus on a different dance each month and draw about 100 students.
Group lessons can be contagious. Angela Darata, director of development for the Lodi Boys and Girls Club, began the club's weekly dances. "I didn't know how to dance," she said, "and now I can hold my own on the dance floor."
Mr. Cassel and his wife, Valerie, wanted a leisure activity they could pursue as a couple. They signed up for group lessons and now dance regularly in amateur competitions.
But learning to dance is sometimes more effective when undertaken on a private basis. Ms. Murray said the most common reason her students gave for taking private lessons was the daunting prospect of having to dance at a wedding.
Occasionally, all the members of a wedding party call her in a state of nondancing desperation. More often it is only the lone bride or bridegroom attempting to stave off first-dance embarrassment.
 
Rise in Competitors
 At the opposite end of the spectrum from the self-conscious novices are the growing numbers of ballroom competitors, both professional and amateur, who skim the parquet, the women dressed in voluminously skirted gowns upholstered with sequins, and their partners clad in tuxedos or tails. Ms. Fortuna's "festival" competitions are held in October each year. This year's event, in Cherry Hill, included professional and amateur events.
The American Star Ball, an annual amateur competition, was held last October at the Meadowlands Hilton.
Dance fads come and go. Brian Nash, a dance instructor in Rutgers's two-year-old, noncredit dance program said the "mambo craze" and the "swing craze" have lately taken hold in New Jersey. Swing dancing, as practiced in the big-band era of the 1940's, has returned with some rhythmic variation as "West Coast swing."
The "electric slide," a freestyle line dance, is especially popular, Mr. Nash said, at dances where there are a large number of singles. And country and western dancing, combining country tunes with traditional dance rhythms, is also popular in dance clubs and ballrooms.
Dr. Dodd thinks that the return to the pastime of earlier eras may also have something to do with traditional dance music. "Pop music has gone to extremes," he said, "and people may be looking for music that is more soothing and painless."

THE ECONOMY
 
Insurers Change Their Minds on Universal Health Coverage 

The United States insurance industry made a big break with its past when it proposed a plan that would require coverage of all Americans. The insurers' plan provides tax incentives for employers and tax penalties for consumers who do not purchase insurance so that all Americans would have an "essential package" of health benefits. Those whose benefits exceed the essential package would pay income taxes on the amount by which they exceed the standard. The Government, of course, would have a big role in defining the basic package. The plan also agrees that everybody would be covered regardless of existing medical conditions. The proposal by the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents 270 commercial insurers, reflects a realization that comprehensive health legislation is almost certain to come, with or without insurers' participation, in the Clinton Administration.
 
A Leading, or Misleading, Index
 
The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading indicators, which is supposed to predict future economic strength, rose a heathy 0.4 percent in October, after two months of declines. But having been burned by previous false starts in the recovery, a number of economists cautioned against overoptimism. They cited factors that might not continue and other forces that are not measured by the index that could be drags on the economy. In light of the reluctance to believe its findings, maybe they should call it the index of misleading indicators.

A number of other reports last week suggested it may be time to start believing in the economic pickup. These included a sharp jump in the purchasing managers' index of manufacturing activity in November, a 1 percent gain in new construction in October, a drop in first-time unemployment gains and a 1.7 percent rise in factory orders in October.
 
Trying to Read the Home Data
 
One statistic that did not improve was the report on sales of new homes in October. It tumbled 10.3 percent. But even this may not be as bad as it looks. Month by month for more than a year, the Commerce Department has revised its initial report upward when final data are received. For September, for example, the Government initially reported a decline of 1 percent from August. Last week that was revised to a gain of 7 percent.

Zoom Goes the Taurus
 
Car sales surged to an annualized rate of 7.3 million in the last 10 days of November after lazing along below 6 million earlier. Some dealers said their showrooms no longer resemble funeral parlors. Sales were particularly strong at Ford, in part because of the company's all-out campaign to drive Taurus past the Honda Accord in the contest to be the best-selling single model in 1992. In the last 10 days of November, 13,119 Tauruses were sold, 74 percent more than a year earlier.
 
Metropolitan Cease-Fire. Not.
 
A nonaggression pact involving New York City, New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut has lasted a bit longer than the cease-fires in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but not by much. The pact, signed in October 1991, was intended to prevent negative advertising and economic development programs that simply lured businesses from one jurisdiction into another without doing anything for the region's overall economy. But recently there have been a number of skirmishes, and in the latest round of aggression, New York has vowed to retaliate against New Jersey's initiatives in the ongoing Hudson River tug-of-war.

Finally, Payrolls on the Upswing
 
While factory closings still provide front-page headlines -- General Motors identified nine plants that it will close in the next three and a half years -- the underlying trend is actually much brighter. The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 7.2 percent in November, from 7.4 percent in October. It was the fifth consecutive decline and brought the rate to its lowest point since April. But the report, issued on Friday, did represent a turning point of sorts. It was the first of the declines caused by an increase in payrolls rather than a decrease in people seeking work. The Labor Department also said the rise in nonfarm payrolls was the biggest since July; 105,000 jobs were added, of which 35,000 were in manufacturing.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Lashing Out at Foreign Steel
 
The Commerce Department imposed temporary taxes on steel imports from 12 nations where United States steelmakers claim the Governments provide unfair subsidies. Whether the taxes become permanent depends on further review by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission. Six countries affected by the temporary taxes are in Europe, and the European Community has lodged a protest.

Women Need Not Apply in Japan
 
One of the glories of the Japanese economy is its low unemployment, which now stands at 2.2 percent. But the rate may soon be rising. For the first time in four and a half years, there are more people looking for work in Japan than there are jobs available. The problem is especially tough on women workers. A recent report said there are 2.2 job openings for every man seeking a position and less then one opening for each woman. And while Japan passed an equal-opportunity law seven years ago, it does not seem to be working for women seeking "career track" positions -- those above the clerical level. "Only when jobs are plentiful does the law have any meaning for women," said one college senior who has been frustrated in her job search.
 
Signing Off on Trade
 
The North American Free Trade Agreement will be signed on Dec. 17. The three national leaders involved all have strong reasons for a quick signing. Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada must call an election within a year, and he would like to get this matter behind him before doing so. President Salinas of Mexico is eager for the positive economic impact that the pact may have. And President Bush wants to get the measure to Congress before his successor and others find reasons to pick it apart and rework it.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
ABC Gets Into The Rerun Game
 
The top 10 lists of novels, albums and films often seem to be monopolized by certain names that appear again and again. But recurring hits are much rarer among the people who create television series. Nevertheless, ABC is betting that Wind Dancer Production, producers of the sitcom "Home Improvement," may be an exception. ABC has set up a partnership that will guarantee the show three more years and set up a profit-sharing arrangement for two future comedy series by Wind Dancer that ABC will broadcast. If either series endures until enough episodes are created to be sold in syndication, ABC could share in hundreds of millions of dollars in rerun sales.

Keep Off the Microcodes
 
A long-running legal battle in Silicon Valley is the dispute over whether the clones of Intel's dominant "86" series microprocessors violate Intel's copyrights. Last week's decision was that Advanced Micro Devices did not have the right to copy Intel's microcode embedded on its 486 chip. This means more months of sales by Intel without direct competition until Advanced Micro or somebody else figures out a way to duplicate Intel's chip without stepping on its codes.
 
Beating Clinton to the Punch
 
The two top executives at the Walt Disney Company exercised their options to buy millions of shares at about $3.60 each and then sold most of them for about $40. The pretax gains for Michael D. Eisner and Frank G. Wells were put at $187 million. Mr. Eisner, Disney's chairman, said they were trying to protect shareholders from a large tax bill in the future. President-elect Clinton has discussed limiting deductions for executive pay to $1 million per executive, and so if Mr. Eisner and Mr. Wells had waited to cash in, Disney might have added tens of millions of dollars in taxes. The President-elect has also talked of putting a surtax on millionaires.
 
Power to the Viewers
 
The nation's biggest cable television company announced last week that the future of television may soon involve more than 500 channels per set. Tele-Communications said that through "digital compression," it expects to be able to offer 10 programs on each of its channels. This means viewers may ultimately choose from a huge menu of movies, sporting events and current shows that can be watched whenever the viewer chooses rather than when the network specifies.

Punishing Salomon
 
Although Salomon Inc. has already settled charges related to the violations of Federal securities laws that were uncovered in August 1991, it was only last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission started dealing with individuals involved. Two former managing directors, Paul W. Mozer and Thomas F. Murphy, were accused of submitting billions of dollars in phony bids in Treasury auctions; Mr. Mozer is also accused of insider stock trading. The S.E.C. also reached settlements with three former top executives. John Gutfreund, Salomon's former chairman, agreed to pay a penalty of $100,000 and to be barred forever from heading a securities firm. Thomas Strauss, the firm's former president, and John Meriwether, a former vice chairman, agreed to smaller fines and suspensions of a few months. The fines were said to be the first for failing to provide adequate supervision of a firm's activities.

Comptronix's Tricks
 
Another company whose actions in the face of bad news are under intense scrutiny is Comptronix, an Alabama-based electronics company whose seemingly sterling record of profit growth had actually been silverplated by its top officers. It now develops that the board knew of the accounting irregularities for 10 days before they were disclosed to the world. In that interval someone made $350,000 in profits by buying put options, betting on a decline in the stock. But Comptronix's lawyers did prevent its founder, now suspended, from selling 100,000 shares.

HEADLINE: Leading Health Insurers Into a New Age

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A DINOSAUR sits on the desk of Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America. The plastic toy is an apt symbol of an industry struggling to save itself from extinction as the political climate changes.
Mr. Schramm, chief lobbyist and spokesman for the nation's commercial health insurance companies, says many people tell him "this is an industry of dinosaurs." 
 The trade association, often perceived in Washington and elsewhere as a symbol of intransigence, is trying to deal with tumultuous economic, social and political changes shaking the worlds of health care and insurance. But it is not easy for a risk-averse industry whose culture and mentality have been shaped by actuaries.
In a break from past practice, the Health Insurance Association, representing 270 commercial insurers, called last week for a new Federal law that would require coverage of all Americans, define a basic set of benefits and limit tax breaks for the purchase of its own product, health insurance.
The association, founded in 1956, often seems to be on the defensive, under siege from consumers, labor unions, state regulators, members of Congress, state legislators and other politicians.
Critics say the industry wastes billions of dollars on overhead costs. In addition, they denounce the industry for raising premiums, cutting coverage and discriminating against people with potentially expensive medical conditions, the very people who most need insurance.
Through aggressive lobbying and advertising, the association appears, for the moment, to have bested liberal Democrats like Representative Marty Russo of Illinois, who wanted to establish a system of national health insurance managed and financed mainly by the Government. But the insurers know that bigger battles are coming after the inauguration of President-elect Bill Clinton, and their new proposal signals a willingness to work with him.
Mr. Schramm, a health policy researcher, is resigning after five and a half years as president of the association. He will become executive vice president of Fortis Inc., the American arm of an international insurance and financial services company. The next president has not been named. But Mr. Schramm, a former associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, said his successor would be "someone who is a recognized political presence."
That is appropriate. The insurance industry and its trade association are entering one of the biggest political battles of the decade as Congress joins Mr. Clinton in trying to revamp the nation's health-care system.
The insurers' new proposal reflects a commitment to controlling health costs and providing coverage for all people, the main objectives of Mr. Clinton's health program.
A requirement for universal coverage would help 35 million people with no health insurance, but it would also create a big new market for private insurers. The proposed limit on tax-free health benefits is not in the insurers' short-term interest, but they find it more palatable than efforts to control costs directly through Federal regulation. (Under the association's proposal, employees would have to pay income tax on any health benefits exceeding the value of a standard health plan to be defined later.)
While the association's proposal might seem to imply unity among member companies, in fact the industry no longer speaks with a single voice.
In the last 18 months, three big companies, Cigna, Aetna and Metropolitan Life, announced that they were withdrawing from the association. The three said they believed they could be more effective in lobbying, public advocacy and building coalitions outside the association. There is also a widespread perception of tension between big and small companies inside the association, where each member has one vote regardless of size.
The three defectors have a strong commitment to "managed care," in which insurers coordinate networks of doctors and hospitals serving large groups of workers and their dependents. The association appreciates the importance of such networks and, in recent years, has placed more emphasis on managed care. But it apparently did not move fast enough to satisfy all the big companies. The trade group also had to consider the needs of smaller companies that still emphasize conventional forms of insurance and have difficulty making the big investments needed to organize managed-care networks.
Michael J. Morrissey, chairman of the board of the Firemark Group, an insurance research and consulting concern in Parsippany, N.J., suggested another reason for tension between the big insurers and some of the smaller companies. The big companies, he said, are more willing to accept laws that spread the cost of health insurance across all members of a community and prohibit insurers from charging extremely high premiums for people who are deemed to be at high risk or have chronic ailments like diabetes.
Several states have passed laws limiting variation in health insurance premiums, and many members of Congress favor Federal legislation to require such "community rating."
"MOST big companies feel that community rating is inevitable," Mr. Morrissey said. "They want to be part of shaping that process, rather than fighting it."
Some of the small insurance companies have found a lucrative market by distinguishing good risks from bad ones and refusing to write coverage for the bad risks. They are reluctant to abandon this practice, known as cherry-picking. Some of these insurers could be put out of business if Congress bans the practice.
The chairman-elect of the Health Insurance Association, G. David Hurd, chief executive of the Principal Financial Group, in Des Moines, said: "Small companies always have suspicions about big companies. Big companies have suspicions about small companies."
But Mr. Schramm said it was simplistic to portray the tensions within the association as a spat between big and little companies. Some small insurers have made large investments in managed care, just like the big companies, he said.
If the association has had difficulty defining itself, that may be because the definition of an insurance company is blurring. More and more insurers are in the business of providing or managing health care. Some administer health-benefit plans for companies that insure themselves. Many commercial insurers have established health maintenance organizations, which offer a wide range of services in return for a fixed monthly fee.
Thus, for example, John D. Moynahan Jr., executive vice president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, said: "Our role has changed dramatically from providing the standard type of insurance to being a manager of care. We're on an irrevocable march in that direction. We can operate more effectively as an independent company than within the structure of the industry trade association."
Soaring health costs and the shift to managed care have affected the bottom line at many insurance companies.
A. Michael Frinquelli, a managing director at Salomon Brothers who follows the insurance industry, said: "Most of the big insurance companies are making money on their health insurance business, but the profit margins are slim, only 1 or 2 percent of premiums and equivalent income. The health insurance business has strained the capital positions of these companies, partly because of the large capital investment needed to start managed-care networks."
The challenge for the Health Insurance Association is like that facing the American Medical Association: how to reorient itself, adopt new positions and create a more progressive image while still protecting the financial interests of its members.
 
 
 
THE EFFECT OF MR. CLINTON
 TEN months ago the Health Insurance Association of America was fighting to preserve a role for private insurance in the face of Democratic demands for the expansion of government health programs.
Under Republican fire in the Presidential campaign, President-elect Bill Clinton made clear that he did not favor proposals to enroll everyone in a public health program. By the end of the campaign, he was espousing ideas that would dramatically expand the role of private health insurance. He would encourage uninsured people to buy private coverage through big purchasing cooperatives. And he said that low-income people on Medicaid should get private insurance, with the Government paying part or all of the premiums.
In fending off calls for a Government-run program of national health insurance, Carl J. Schramm, president of the association, worked closely with the Bush Administration. But he expects Mr. Clinton to pay much closer attention to health care, and he welcomes that.
"The industry has done badly under Republican regimes," said Mr. Schramm, a Democrat. "In many ways, we do better historically under Democratic regimes. There are a lot of Democrats on our board of directors. There is a much larger number of Democratic policy analysts, who have a sophisticated view of health issues and realize that this is not a simplistic question of the free market versus regulation."
"The touchstone of Bill Clinton's policy is that health costs are the first problem you have to deal with," Mr. Schramm added. "We agree. Our members say, 'Boy is that right!' "

Will the Good Times Roll Again for Tiffany?

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
THE 1990's have not been good so far to Tiffany & Company.
A domestic recession that caused Americans to cut back on luxury purchases was bad enough. But Japan's economic troubles, reflected in the Tokyo stock market's tumble, have also hurt. Indeed, Japanese customers, many of whom make their purchases of robin's-egg-blue Tiffany packages through Mitsukoshi Ltd., a department store, account for about a quarter of the company's sales -- meaning crimps in Japanese spending have hit Tiffany's bottom line. 
 But signs are emerging that Tiffany's troubles may have bottomed out, with the stock price having risen from $24 in September to as high as $30 last week. Even though Mitsukoshi recently cut back its purchases, with the Tokyo market rallying and with indications of an American economic revival, the world economy may be signaling that the demand for crystal bowls and sterling silver is on the way up.

Taking a Hands-On Approach at Aldus

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Aldus Manutius, a 15th-century Venetian scholar, developed a printing system to make books widely accessible. Paul Brainerd started the Seattle-based Aldus Corporation in 1984 with a similar goal. His Aldus PageMaker software, used with Apple's Macintosh and LaserWriter printer, allowed the average PC user to produce professional-looking documents. Mr. Brainerd had entered the newspaper business while in school and later worked for the Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company. His interest in publishing technology then took him to Atex Inc., a maker of newspaper editing and composition systems. Aldus is now the ninth-largest PC software company.
Question: You're known as the father of desktop publishing. Are you a proud parent? 
 Answer: When we first started, professional publishers viewed desktop publishing as a toy. The LaserWriter wasn't good enough, there weren't enough fonts, the Mac didn't even have a hard drive. The early users were really the creative people. Today the market is split, largely because of its success, between the general users and the professional users, who want color separations and control over all the dials and levers.
Q: Computers were supposed to lead to a paperless office. Yet desktop publishing has probably felled more trees than anything in recent memory. Will this continue?
A: People culturally are very attached to paper. It's a very efficient way of organizing and dealing with information. So I don't expect paper to go away in our lifetimes. What I do expect to see is the emergence of more interactive electronic media; that's already occurring. It's not necessarily replacing paper, but it will some day.
Q: Aldus recently had four down quarters and its first layoffs. How are things now?
A: We're back on track. The recession hit us more than others because a lot of our customers are from marketing, advertising -- the industries hit hardest by the slowdown. We scaled back by about 100 people. I have been playing a much more hands-on role in three key areas: professional graphics, consumer products and service and support
Q: Hands-on in service and support?
A: I go and sit down with the support technician, take my headset and listen in on the calls. It's a great way to understand how people are using the product. The other day, a Windows customer trying to print to a film recorder and having trouble. It was a complex problem that actually was in the Windows print driver, not in our application. But the customer doesn't care, he just wants to get it fixed. He's very upset, on deadline. It's always amazing to me how our tech support people are able to calm them down and go to work on the problem. It's part technical, part psychology.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
In Hong Kong, Foreigners May Lose Again

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Faith in China remains strong, especially if you are far enough away from it.
That became clear Friday when foreign investors rushed in to halt the slide in Hong Kong stock prices, a plunge that had sliced 16.8 percent off the Hang Seng index in the first four days of the week. 
 "Everybody has been conditioned to believe these crises provide buying opportunities," commented Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's international strategist. "U.S. and European investors are very eager to buy Hong Kong." The foreign buying pushed up prices 5.8 percent for the day, cutting the weekly decline to 12 percent.
The panic in Hong Kong was brought on by a spat between Britain, which is running the colony until 1997, and China, which will then take over. Chris Patten, the Governor, wants to introduce a little democracy. That outrages China's rulers, who don't like uppity citizens and fear their people might get some dangerous ideas. That dispute had been festering for weeks, generally ignored by investors who bid Hong Kong prices to new highs as recently as Nov. 12. The belief, especially strong in overseas investors, has been that Hong Kong was the way to play China's inevitable growth and emergence as an economic powerhouse.
But the locals started to get nervous when China threatened that commercial deals made now might not be deemed binding after China took over. That was serious. Beijing was -- shockingly to those who have long since dismissed as irrelevant the fact China continues to be a Communist country -- threatening to unravel business deals.
For investors these days, the world does not look all that friendly. In Europe, the currency system is again in danger of collapsing, notes Steven Nagourney, a Lehman Brothers strategist, and the bulls are hoping that the Bundesbank Council, when it meets Thursday, will announce higher monetary targets, opening the way for lower interest rates. Unfortunately, Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger has been hinting that lower rates will not come soon.
In that atmosphere, Hong Kong has been one of the few countries where forecasts of rapidly rising profits seemed to be reasonable. It is no wonder that foreigners hope the current crisis will blow over.
But the sad fact is, as Morgan Stanley's Mr. Biggs noted, that Hong Kong stocks even now are not cheap. Stocks there trade at a higher multiple of cash flow than in almost any other major market, he said, adding that the history of Hong Kong is that it goes to extremes of valuation in both directions. He thinks Hong Kong has further to fall.
In the long run, buyers of stocks in any country are placing a bet that the country's business climate will continue to be hospitable. The certainty of that in the United States is now bringing in foreign money and helping to support valuations at the high end of reasonableness. In China, however, it is a major uncertainty that only now is beginning to be reflected in stock prices.

Recovering From Annus Horribilis

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Funds that invest in health and biotechnology companies have had a tough year, falling 10.2 percent through Nov. 19, on average, compared with a 3.7 percent rise in all growth funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.
As a group, the funds lost 11 percent in a first-quarter bloodbath and had not posted positive results for two consecutive months until November. The industry was sanguine about the funds last year, when they gained an average of 74 percent, and a handful of new health care funds -- Franklin Global Health, Dean Witter Health Sciences, Govett Global Health Care and Merrill Lynch Healthcare (spun off from its old Science and Technology Fund) -- started up in 1992. 
 Given the sector's strength over the last three years, is 1992's retrenchment enough? And what impact will the Clinton Administration have, in light of the President-elect's promises of affordable health care?
Managers of the funds blame a trio of ills for the group's 1992 performance: a big spike in health care stocks at the end of 1991 as the market surged broadly on lower interest rates; a market preference for cyclical growth companies, which tend to do better than stable growth companies as the economy moves out of recession, and what Cheryl Alexander, who manages the $975 million Putnam Health Sciences Trust, in Boston, calls "fear of the election" -- concerns that a new Administration would make changes that would hurt the health care sector.
Going forward, however, managers find the group more attractive. Valuations for health care companies, they note, are the lowest in 30 years as stock prices have fallen and earnings growth rates risen. So many opportunities abound that the $200 million Oppenheimer Global Bio-Tech Fund reopened to new investors in October.
As for the election, the managers differ on what changes might be made, but agree change is needed. "There's too much waste, parallel ways of delivering health care and idiosyncrasies to be corrected," said Edward P. Owens, who manages the $600 million Vanguard Specialized Health Care Fund.
While Mr. Clinton promised to introduce health care legislation in the first 100 days, many managers believe he now thinks change should be slower. Health care spending accounts for roughly 13 percent of gross national product, and "to do something dramatic to something that accounts for that big a piece of the economy will be difficult, particularly in the middle of a recession," said Charles Mangum, who manages the $800 milllion Fidelity Select Health Care Fund.
John Kaweske, who manages the $812 million Financial Portfolios Strategic Health Sciences Fund, has bet heavily on managed care, a concept much talked about in Washington. Managed care is personified by health maintenance organizations, of which he owns a fistful, including US Healthcare, United Healthcare, Qual-Med, Healthsource and Takecare. These and other companies delivering health care account for 30 percent of his fund. Twenty percent is in generic drug makers -- like Mylen and Zenith Labs -- because of their focus on cost containment.
As for harnessing inflated drug costs, price increases have already fallen from triple the rise in the consumer price index to 1.5 times the index, says Ms. Alexander, of Putnam. Even given legislation to fine-tune drug pricing through Medicaid rebates or deductibility of marketing expenses, "Clinton's timing is providential in that he can make only minor changes and still claim victory," she said.
Roughly one-third of Ms. Alexander's portfolio is invested in drug companies, and she has been adding lately. Her top five holdings are companies with new products plus experience with flat pricing: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Smithkline Beecham, Abbott Labs and American Home Products.
Sandra Panem, associate manager of the Oppenheimer fund, which invests solely in biotechnology companies, said "the package of new incentives that the new Administration is looking at, especially investment tax credits and capital gains relief, would benefit the types of entrepreneurial companies that characterize this sector." She sees broad opportunities in biotech and has been buying Amylin and Alteon, two companies developing new approaches to treating diabetes.
Edward Owens of Vanguard has taken a small new position in the drug store industry because earnings have been stable and because he believes "the Phar-Mor bankruptcy would benefit the remaining players in a modest way." His five largest holdings are Beckman Instruments, Pfizer, Imcera, Bristol-Myers and Ciba-Geigy.
About half of Fidelity Select Health Care is invested in drug stocks, says Mr. Mangum. Because valuations have fallen on higher-quality companies, he has been expanding positions in Warner Lambert, Schering-Plough, Pfizer and Merck.
Jordan Schreiber, who has managed the health care part of Merrill Lynch's Sci-Tech Fund since 1983 and now manages the $100 million spinoff, increased its European allocation from 20 percent to 50 percent in anticipation of the election, mostly in drug makers like Astra in Sweden. The concern was that pressure on pricing and slower growth rates would hurt American companies.

'Everything's Coming Up Roses'

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Vince H. realized that times were tough when he discovered that he had worn out his record of Ethel Merman belting out the finale of "Gypsy." That song, "Rose's Turn," had raised his spirits on the days that he could not find work. And there were many.
Like thousands of New Yorkers, Vince H., a 52-year-old office clerk, was laid off this year for the first time in decades. And like so many people in a city whose unemployment rate has jumped to more than 10 percent, he searched for a new job for months, visiting every employment agency and office temporary firm that he could find. 
 "I couldn't get nothing to save my soul," he said the other day as he savored a cup of black coffee and a cigarette at a diner in Chelsea. "I went through my savings and my credit cards. And then I hit rock bottom."
 
Threatened With Eviction
 After he fell five months behind in his rent, his landlord threatened to evict him from the apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens, that he had lived in for 12 years. With nowhere else to turn, he called Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Catholic Charities gave him money from the fund to help pay his back rent, and then he began another push to find a job. He was finally hired as a clerk by an office-supplies manufacturer in Chelsea a few months ago.
He said that at first, he was reticent about seeking help from a charity, because he thought he would be made to feel guilty about his misfortune. But he said that as soon as he walked into the office of Catholic Charities, he immediately felt comfortable.
"It wasn't a demeaning experience at all," he said.
 
Held On to Optimism
 Vince H. said that in the months he was out of work, he tried to remain optimistic, filling the extra time by catching up on reading. But he added that he was surprised to find out how exasperating the search was.
"If you have a job, then you don't have any idea how frustrating it can be," he said. "For every job out there, there are 15 or 20 of us word processors."
Returning to work, he said, has rejuvenated him. And he has bought a new copy of Ethel Merman's record, one that he hopes he will not wear out any time soon.
"Being part of the rat race again does something for you," he said. "It feels good to be back again."

HEADLINE: The New Blood Culture

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ON a Sunday night in 1938, Orson Welles caused a national panic by broadcasting an hourlong adaptation of "The War of the Worlds." Despite repeated announcements that the radio show was only fiction, terrified Americans took to the streets, convinced that Martians were invading and destroying the country. Why? With perfect timing, a month after the Nazis got their claws into Czechoslovakia, Welles had tapped right into the proliferating, if still subliminal, American fear that war was on its way.
In November 1992, a Wellesian director of our own time, Francis Ford Coppola, tapped into a similarly rampant, and no less lethal, real-life terror running through the public consciousness. "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula,' " a movie that was ridiculed in advance by much of Hollywood and the press as a certain flop, a "Bonfire of the Vampires," was an unexpected sensation in its opening weekend, selling $32 million worth of tickets. 
 Is there any doubt which foreign invasion Americans are fearing this time? The audience that turns out for "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " smells blood even more literally than Welles's audience did.
And Mr. Coppola gives it to them, in a movie that both frightens and arouses by playing off the unchecked fear of further AIDS invasions of the national bloodstream. "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " is an orgy of bloodsucking, bloodletting and blood poisoning. It's beyond Grand Guignol: it's opera for the new blood culture.
The new blood culture is the bizarre pop byproduct of a national obsession with all bodily fluids. It's a high-pitched, often hysterical acting out of the subliminal fantasies, both deadly and erotic, of a country that has awakened to the fact that the most insidious post-cold-war enemy is a virus. AIDS, after all, actually does to the bloodstream what Communists and other radicals were once only rumored to do to the nation's water supply. Its undiminished threat has made the connection between sex and death, an eternal nexus of high culture, into a pop fixation, finally filtering down to the vocabulary of commercial images.
The blood culture is pervasive, for Mr. Coppola's movie is no fluke unreeling in a vacuum. As so often happens in this large country, and not by coincidence, a psychic obsession has surfaced everywhere at once. The same week that "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " was the highest-grossing movie, the No. 1 fiction and nonfiction books on the best-seller lists were Anne Rice's "Tale of the Body Thief," in which another vampire, the contemporary Lestat, puts on a "little rubber sheath" rather than infect a lover with a "dark seed that might harm her," and Madonna's "Sex," a burlesque instruction manual for sadomasochistic sex in the era of AIDS.
Since the advent of AIDS is hardly new, why have the floodgates of the blood culture opened now? Call it trickle-down anxiety. AIDS awareness -- specifically, the awareness that the disease is not the exclusive property of homosexuals, drug users and hemophiliacs -- has increased exponentially in the year of Magic Johnson, heightened further by its sporadic prominence in a political campaign. Once the distraction of the election was over, Americans could turn their full attention to the fear.
It was on election eve that Mr. Johnson announced his second retirement from basketball, a decision prompted by the ominous, if ill informed, remarks of a fellow player, Karl Malone, who felt that his game-induced "scabs and cuts" put him at risk of infection. Only a few days later, in the election's immediate aftermath, did the possible lifting of the ban on homosexuals in the military prompt a virulent controversy that caught even that adept reader of the public mood President-elect Bill Clinton by surprise. Here again the not-so-hidden agenda was the irrational fear that one's blood could be contaminated by casual contact with those who are H.I.V. positive. Blood fear skyrocketed even as the country's previous dominant fear (the economy) eased.
Enter "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " -- which is to say, Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula." In retrospect, it is clear that the movie's mid-November nationwide opening was as brilliantly, if as unintentionally, timed to ride a wave of public trauma as that of "War of the Worlds" in 1938.
Though set mostly in Victorian England, this movie touches every 1992 blood button it can. The neck wounds inflicted by Gary Oldman's Dracula, seen in close-up, look like the lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma. The film pauses, irrationally but mesmerizingly, for an extended microscopic view of what appears to be rampaging blood cells. And its cinematography is often tinted capillary red, day and night, saturating the viewer's entire perspective with blood. What horror tale more than Stoker's, or this unfaithfully anachronistic retelling of it, could be more metaphorically appropriate to this moment?
"Blood is too precious a thing in these times," says Dracula, who leaves his victim, a Victorian English maiden named Lucy, with what her physician labels a "disease of the blood unknown to all medical theory." A blood specialist played by Anthony Hopkins likens Lucy's ailment to venereal disease -- "syphilis and syphilization have advanced together," he says -- calling it a threat to the "ethics and ideals" of humankind and potentially a plague. Unsafe sex is depicted as an exchange of blood with lubricious vampire vixens, and not even babies are immune to the threat. At times vampires appear as mist and fog -- vaporized fluids that can invade unsuspecting bloodstreams even when least expected and most protected.
The AIDS invocations are so unsubtle that it is hard to understand how Hollywood, which is nothing if not cynical, failed to realize what "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " was and how it might play to an alarmed public. But the explanation for this myopia may not be so complex. Since Hollywood has yet to release a major movie with AIDS as its explicit subject, it follows that it would fail to notice in advance that Mr. Coppola had made a movie implicitly about the disease and that there might even be a huge market at that.
Yet, fear is not the only appeal of "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' " and other artifacts of the blood culture. The eroticism of these works, however much mocked by critics, is real, even as that eroticism is entwined with death. What was once forbidden and dangerous is now titillating to a mass audience -- at least if viewed on screen or in a book. Violent sex, once considered an offbeat taste, is now a common denominator of eroticism, even if cartoonishly presented with mail-order leather and harness accessories as it is by Madonna in the pages of "Sex" or with ripped flesh and bestial rapists by Mr. Coppola in "Bram Stoker's 'Dracula.' " No wonder that torn clothes and bondage fashion, with their intimation of rough trade, have become popular. No wonder, too, that Mia Farrow's poison-pin valentine to Woody Allen, with a steak knife plunging into a heart, became an image of national fascination the moment it was disseminated by "60 Minutes."
AS the new blood culture has made America take a second look at sadomasochism, so it has uncloseted homoeroticism. The early appearance of AIDS among gay men forced a large heterosexual public to examine gay sex for the first time. And if the marketplace is any measure, people were titillated to some extent by gay sex as they were by sadomasochism -- at least from a distance. Gay or lesbian fantasies are a standard feature in the threesomes of "Sex," in Anne Rice's vampire fiction and in the iconography of fashion advertising, whether on behalf of Calvin Klein or his many imitators. Request Jeans produced a 48-page advertising supplement to the October issue of Details magazine, in which two voluptuous female models and a man nearly as large-breasted act out a crude bisexual porn-film "Thelma and Louise" scenario (in and out of their jeans) in a cheap Western motel.
The fetishization of the condom, the blood's ubiquitous defender, is also an inevitable product of the blood culture. Like jeans, condoms turn out not to be a simple, utilitarian product available in a single style and color -- once the market demands more options. Indeed, the new pop porn -- whether the Request Jeans portfolio or "Sex" -- has appropriated condom imagery for its packaging; shrink-wrap is nothing if not a giant condom that reinforces the safeness of the masturbatory sex that porn is meant to induce. And as with actual condoms, shrink-wrapping is developing its own status-minded variations, with Madonna choosing silver Mylar over plain old cellophane. Never one to miss out on a trend, Barneys New York unveiled new windows on Thanksgiving weekend that include a tribute to Madonna and her Mylar and another to Magic Johnson, who hovers near a Christmas tree brightly festooned with gold-wrapped condoms.
So begins the holiday season in the jittery blood culture. Deck the halls with shades of apocalypse now.

THORSTEIN VEBLEN, meet Wendy Wasserstein.
Conspicuous consumption may be as passe as the power suit, but conspicuous references to status symbols -- from Louis Vuitton handbags to Asprey candlesticks to Manolo Blahnik mules -- are bringing down the house at Miss Wasserstein's new play, "The Sisters Rosensweig." 
 The play deals with the midlife crises, assimilation conflicts and relationships of three Jewish sisters: Sara Goode (played by Jane Alexander), a twice-divorced London bank president who wouldn't throw away an old cashmere sweater; Gorgeous Teitelbaum (Madeline Kahn), a Newton, Mass., housewife and radio call-in-show host who calls herself "Doctor" and overdresses in faux Ungaro, and Pfeni Rosensweig (Frances McDormand), a rootless travel writer who wears Birkenstocks and hauls her belongings around in plain shopping bags.
But on another level, the play, at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, demonstrates how material culture and consumer products are used (and abused) for self-definition, for character judgments and as currency in interpersonal relationships. A Chanel suit plays such a pivotal role that to reveal it would be as bad theater-going manners as divulging the name of the murderer in an Agatha Christie whodunit.
Brand-name dropping isn't new in the arts. Dr. Monroe Friedman, a professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University, said that since World War II, the use of product names as puns, metaphors and punchlines in films, novels and plays has been proliferating faster than street vendors selling fake Rolexes. Although such references abound in contemporary fiction and were the foundation for pop art, this trend is deeply disturbing to self-styled culture cops who decry the commercialization of language.
Shakespeare managed with elegant metaphors like "taffeta phrases" and the "pink of courtesy." But contemporary authors often dot their works with what Dr. Friedman calls "metaphors for the mundane."
Coinages like "Teflon candidate," "McPaper," the "Edsel of" whatever and assorted detergent references abound in the professor's book "A 'Brand' New Language: Commercial Influences in Literature and Culture (1991, Greenwood Press). "Some humanists find this degrading to language," Dr. Friedman said recently. . "Can we only relate to each other through things?"
Dr. Mary Douglas, an eminent British anthropolgist, sees no alternative. "How else should one relate to the Joneses if not by keeping up with them," she asserts in "The World Goods," a 1979 book that she wrote with the economist Baron Isherwood. "Consumption is the very arena in which culture is fought over and licked into shape."
Dr. Douglas believes that an important part of the enjoyment of goods is in "sharing names that have been learned and graded."
Dr. Douglas, meet Miss Wasserstein.
ON almost every page of Miss Wasserstein's script, the sisters, their men and the people they gossip about are defined by or relate to one another through the shared (or disputed) meanings of things -- movie and song titles, schools and, of course, brand-name products: Wedgwood, majolica, Retin-A, Susie Cooper china, Portobello Road antiques, poodle skirts, Ralph Lauren shirts, Groton, The New York Times, sushi, fish and chips, Fruit of the Loom, Newsweek, Sacher torte, hot-oil treatments, Diet Coke, Tanino Crisci and Harrods.
Miss Wasserstein's choices were carefully made. Things don't provide "the complete definition" for a character, the playwright said. "But it's part of the picture," she continued. "It gives the character more detail, specificity. It sets a time and a place."
Take Sara, for example. President of a bank. Radcliffe grad. Reads The Financial Times. "Sara still has LP's," Miss Wasserstein said. "Her record player is not a CD player. That marks her right away. Sara believes CD's belong in the bank. Her candlesticks are Asprey. She has majolica and gives you its date: 'Victorian, 1893.' "
Clothing, with its infinite and minute levels of meaning, resonates with sophisticated audiences. And Miss Wasserstein knows the territory.
Mervyn Kant (Robert Klein), a suitor of Sara and furrier turned leading supplier of "synthetic animal protective covering," enters carrying a Turnbull & Asser shopping bag. From it, Merv, who wears brown suede shoes with his linen suit, takes a proud purchase -- a lavender shirt with "Bonfire of the Vanities"-style white collar and cuffs.
Why Turnbull & Asser? Partly for the sound of it, Miss Wasserstein said. "It's more lyrical than saying 'I bought an expensive shirt.' " It also has the right connotations. "My brother is a banker," she said in a bit of an understatement (Bruce Wasserstein was an architect of leveraged buyouts in the 1980's). "I noticed several years ago that he and all his friends were getting their shirts made in London at Turnbull & Asser."
The shirt does double duty, semiotically. Miss Wasserstein uses it to bring out the snob in Nicholas Pym (Rex Robbins), the pompous, pin-striped Thatcher M.P. who dates Sara. Why is it, Nick asks Merv, "that so many Jewish-American men I know, professionals mostly, wear those shirts?"
"It's a money-lending uniform," Merv says, skewering Nick's stereotyping. "They're so well-designed, you'd never know it costs a pound of flesh to get them."
The entrance of the flamboyant Gorgeous, a bargain-basement shopper, is a sight gag: she's dressed head to toe in Chanel knock-offs and is carrying an imitation Louis Vuitton handbag. For those in the audience who don't see what's so funny, the dialogue makes it clear that she wears counterfeit couture.
"What interests me about Vuitton pocketbooks," Miss Wasserstein said, "is that the real ones and the fakes are both vinyl and that I can tell a fake from a real. Women have been taught to size things up quickly."
Gorgeous gets an extra laugh for carrying a Filene's bag. But wouldn't a Filene's Basement bag be more in character?
Not in this case, Miss Wasserstein said: "In the bag is a gift for Sara. Gorgeous wouldn't buy a gift in the basement."
Gorgeous gets her biggest laughs mispronouncing European shoe brands (Gucci, paired with Pucci, is a run-down-at-the-heels cliche, Professor Friedman said; Neil Simon has used it, and so has Miss Wasserstein, in a previous work.) In "The Sisters Rosensweig," Miss Wasserstein opens some new shoe boxes. In one scene, Gorgeous vows that if she gets a cable-television job she's after, "I'm marching myself right into Saks and treating myself to Bruno Maglis, Ferragamos and Manulo Blanchikis."
Manulo Blanchiki?
That's how Gorgeous pronounces Manolo Blahnik, the esoteric brand favored by fashion editors, socialites and Hollywood stars.
A self-described shoe maven, Miss Wasserstein, who grew up wearing fake Pappagalos from Chandler's and occasionally real ones, said a fashionable friend introduced her to the Manolo Blahnik store on West 55th Street, where a pair of shoes costs $400 to $1,200. The playwright owns one pair. "Red satin," she said. "Very high. I've only worn them once."
She said she selected the brand for the script because "it's hard to say -- a fun name to use," and because the women Gorgeous gets her values from "would have seen Geena Davis in those shoes on the cover of Vanity Fair," she said, adding, "Those ladies would say these are the best."
But Manolo Blahnik almost got cut from the script. The name meant nothing to Daniel Sullivan, the director, and he wondered how many in the audience would recognize the name. Miss Wasserstein reasoned that even if people didn't know, they'd surmise it was a shoe brand when it followed the two better-known names -- Bruno Magli and Ferragamo. She won.
But she could lose when little theaters all over America start doing the play. "Brand names don't always travel well," Dr. Friedman said. And a generation from now, it's likely that plays that include them will "have to have footnotes all over the place," he added. Just like Shakespeare.
But it's a no-lose situation for the manufacturers that are mentioned. "Word-of-author advertising," as Dr. Friedman calls it, has proven to raise confidence in a product's value. That's why many companies will even pay to be mentioned. (When they pay, it's called solicited-word-of-author advertising.))
In "The Sisters Rosensweig," the mentions are all unsolicited. But not unappreciated. On opening night, Chanel sent Miss Kahn and Miss Wasserstein flowers. And after the opening, Ferragamo sent them both the shoes that Gorgeous rhapsodizes about in Act II -- the flats with the bows.
Manolo Blahnik has yet to be heard from.

HEADLINE: COINS;
Ancient Collections: A Lesson in History

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
WITH the decline of the economy in the last several years, sales of coins have slowed and prices are down. But several auctions this month may tell whether times are changing. Two auctions next weekend should show if the market for ancient coins is improving.
Ancient coins are often more difficult to sell in this country than their American cousins. Most American collectors prefer the United States coins they saved as children. Certainly the quality of those collections has improved over the years, but rarely do the collectors move to the larger and more complex domains of Greek, Roman or Byzantine coins. 
 Why would anyone want to change from collecting American coins to ancient ones? One reason might be the history behind those coins.
Lot 679 of Christie's sale this Friday is a silver Abderan tetradrachm minted about 460 B.C. Try to forget its age. Try to forget that it comes from a city in Thrace, a country in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula that was a pathway for Persian armies invading Greece. One of Abdera's citizens, Democritus, held the farfetched theory that all matter consisted of small particles called atoms.
Thrace was one of the earliest countries producing coins, and Abderan coin makers created some unusual designs at a time when some of the most beautiful coins were being produced.
The griffin on the obverse or front of the coin is taken from Abdera's history; the griffin is the symbol of the Ionian city of Teos, whose people rebuilt the city. But while other Abderan coins also showed the griffin, the individual design often changed. The griffin might be rearing, trotting or just standing. Soon, other symbols began appearing on the obverse. Today, numismatists think that those symbols, one of which is a fish, were the signatures of the designers.
The reverse of the coin shows a simple incused square broken into quarters. This design is reminiscent of Greek coins minted 200 years earlier. But the designers of Abdera later added their ruler's name around the outside of the square, the first coin designers to do so. The inscription on this coin reads "Abideriteon," and James Lamb of Christie's says it translates as "Of the people of Abdera." The inscription on the obverse is the name Kallidamos, who was probably the magistrate who directed all the mint activities.
An Abderan coin can bring thousands of dollars. It can be seen at Christie's, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, on Monday from noon to 5 P.M. and Tuesday through Thursday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. For more information: (212) 546-1000. Other ancient coins, including another one from Abdera, will be sold on Friday and Saturday by Superior Galleries at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers, 811 Seventh Avenue, at 53d Street. They can be seen Tuesday through Saturday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Philadelphia;
A New Dorm For Temple

BYLINE: By David J. Wallace

 BODY:
THE first new dormitory in 25 years on Temple University's North Philadelphia main campus is being built on North Broad Street. The school plans to open it in time for fall 1993 classes.
The $19 million hall, not yet named, is part of a 19-project capital improvement program whose cost is estimated at $347 million. It will house 562 students and 15 staff members in two-bedroom suites arranged in units having a kitchenette and study lounge. Laundry, exercise and recreation facilities and a convenience store are included. The building will have a computer link to Wise Owl, Temple's data communications network, letting students communicate with each other and look up telephone numbers for campus personnel and other information. 
 The Philadelphia-based Hillier Group Architects designed the four-story brick and limestone building in an H-shape with two interior garden courtyards not visible from the street.
The 146,000-square-foot dorm, between Diamond Street and Susquehanna Avenue, will rise across the street from a row of abandoned red brick one-family homes. It will sit on the 1.5-acre site of a state armory that was razed after a 1989 fire. State officials leased the land to Temple for 50 years. The project is part of a community development plan created by the school in tandem with residents, area merchants and city officials.
Temple financed the dormitory project through a 1991 long-term bond issue. In October, the school also received $61.9 million in state funds, with plans to raise $28.7 million of its own for such projects as a new recreation and convocation center, a classroom and laboratory building plus fire and safety renovations to 11 existing high-rise structures.
School officials said the influx of new campus residents would bring increased economic and social activity to an area that includes some of the city's most impoverished neighborhoods.
Along with the dormitory, community development efforts have been begun to restore commercial and residential properties on neighboring streets, such as Susquehanna Avenue, Carlisle and 15th Streets, said James S. White, Temple's vice president for public affairs.
The community was seeking a way for business owners to "take advantage of the audience created by the new dorm and try to arrest the disinvestment that's plagued the commercial strip," Mr. White said. Small businesses such as full-service drugstores, shoe repair, clothing or service shops are envisioned, he said.
Only 2,400 Temple students, about 10 percent of the main campus enrollment, live on campus. Most take classes at some of the six satellite campuses and live elsewhere in the area.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Clinton Tries to Learn From Carter and History

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE big shadow hanging over the Clinton transition is the shadow of the early failures of the Carter Administration. Hardly a day goes by without a warning to Little Rock about well-known mistakes, like being too much of an outsider, or without an answering boast that the canny new guys won't casually insult Congress.
But many of these dark images are false or exaggerated, cast by shadow puppets constructed out of cardboard memories, shaped by the defeat of 1980, and so they do not offer very useful hazard signs for the new "outsider" administration from the South. These images have haunted the Clinton team to the extent that the President-elect's aides have spent hours talking with former Carter Administration officials to find out what worked and what didn't. 
 In fact, if not in the conventional wisdom of 16 years later, the Carter Administration succeeded pretty well with the public and Congress in its early days. His walk down Pennsylvania Avenue at the head of his inaugural parade, a televised fireside chat, a town meeting and a radio call-in program, with Walter Cronkite in the role of Larry King, all conveyed a very popular common touch.
His first moves with Congress were generally successful, except for the failed selection of Theodore Sorensen to head the Central Intelligence Agency. But he worked with Congressional leaders on an economic program, and the Senate even passed an emergency natural gas bill of his without sending it to committee.
Serious trouble began in the late spring of 1977, when he sent a complicated energy bill to Congress without proper groundwork, and the rest of that year was often difficult. But he strengthened his Congressional liaison team and set up a skilled office under Anne Wexler to mobilize outside support for his policies. He built a historically underrated record of accomplishments, from airline and trucking deregulation to civil service changes and the Panama Canal treaty.
 
Battered by Events
 In the end, surging inflation and interest rates, the Iranian hostage crisis and a bloody intraparty challenge by Senator Edward M. Kennedy made Jimmy Carter the first elected incumbent to be defeated since Herbert Hoover, and the popular image of his Administration became one of near-total failure. In fact, its economic growth record was one of the strongest since the war. As Jody Powell, Mr. Carter's press secretary, pointed out the other day, the deficit was around $40 billion, and there was a healthy trade surplus.
The real history does provide lessons. But they include successes, like that informal touch, as well as mistakes, like setting a 90-day deadline for proposing his energy program, in the view of Prof. Charles O. Jones of the University of Wisconsin. Professor Jones is the author of "The Trusteeship Presidency," the leading scholarly examination of the Carter Administration.
 
Times Have Changed
 But the most important lesson is that this is not 1977. The public is much more worried about the economy and about the ability of government to solve national problems than it was then. And most of all, this Congress and this President-elect look at each other differently than their predecessors did, seeming to share a sense of mutual dependency.
The Congress Mr. Carter encountered was rather full of itself. It had limited Presidential authority to make war and manage budgets. It had overidden vetoes. And it had forced a President from office.
The President whom the 95th Congress faced was almost equally self-confident, morally sure of himself, and at first not much interested in how issues seemed from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
They often failed to speak the same language. Mr. Carter, for example, almost mystified lawmakers when he made major issues out of water projects and government reorganization, issues that seemed almost sub-Presidential to the Hill. He won those fights, but at great cost. Mr. Clinton, however, seems content to soft-pedal irritants like his desire for the line-item veto.
This time, after a deeply ineffective 102d Congress that made "gridlock" a household word, there is a shared sense of fear at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. In 1977, said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, both sides thought the return of a Democrat to the White House was a return to the natural order. He said that neither Congress not the Carter Administration "realized that this was a significant opportunity that we had to capitalize on."
But now, he said "Everybody feels pressure from the people to make this work."
Mr. Gephardt is metaphor for his message. As a junior Democrat in 1978, he fought Mr. Carter over hospital-cost containment. As a leader in 1992, he urges his colleagues to treat Mr. Clinton as the "quarterback" whose plays they must run.
Mr. Powell agreed that the times invited cooperation, and he added that the Clinton team was hardly the bunch of outsiders that the Georgians had been, but he offered one caution anyhow. He said that no matter how much Congressional consultation and stroking Mr. Clinton engages in, "If you ask them to do something that's going to be politically hard for them, it's still going to be hard."
The most frequently cited mistake of the early Carter Administration, and the one the Clinton folk claim to know by heart, is the idea that the Georgians failed by not setting priorities and trying to do too much all at once. Mr. Powell said, "We certainly did ask Congress to do more than the institution was capable of handling."
But the problem was broader. Mr. Carter's staff compiled a list of hundreds of his campaign commitments, which the press promptly dubbed "Promises, Promises." He was asking for more than his Administration could manage. As Mr. Powell put it, "We had so much going in that it was hard to communicate any sense of what we were about, because we were about everything."
For a politician with as many promises as Mr. Clinton, keeping to a few priorities will require self-restraint. But there seems no chance that Mr. Clinton will display another of Mr. Carter's faults, a failure to claim success even when he achieved it. As Professor Jones observed, even when Mr. Carter won, he often complained that he had not won everything: "He couldn't even extract victory from victory."
But Mr. Clinton, after all, proclaimed himself the winner when he finished second in New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
U.S. Bomb Labs, Waging Peace, Shift Their Targets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A wiry, chain-smoking, Sanskrit-quoting genius by the name of J. Robert Oppenheimer traipsed through the snow atop a densely forested mesa in northern New Mexico to found the Los Alamos lab, the birthplace of the atomic bomb and spiritual home of what grew into a maze of 20 or so nuclear sites around the country. That complex, which today, some 50 years later, has some 100,000 employees and an annual budget of $11 billion, is scrambling to reinvent itself amid celebrations marking the birth of the nuclear era. The soul-searching, which began at the cold war's end, is accelerating because of Bill Clinton, who has pledged his presidency to domestic renewal. The question of the moment is how far, and how fast, the nuclear complex can move beyond the bomb.
"It's the most radical change we've ever faced," Dr. Siegfried S. Hecker, director of Los Alamos, said Thursday. "There still are defense jobs we need to do, but we have to be more responsive to helping solve the nation's economic problems." 
 The 9,000-person lab, with an annual budget of more than $1 billion, has no nuclear arms under development for the first time in its history, officials say. The situation is similar to Ford or General Motors producing no cars, and pondering whether to get into a new business.
Today the push throughout the nuclear complex is to aid industry, chiefly by sharing exotic skills and technologies. Los Alamos, for instance, claims global preeminence in supercomputing. But the red tape around such jewels is often thick and intimidating.
About 3 percent of the Los Alamos budget goes to joint ventures with private industry. Bill Clinton has called for up to 20 percent to go into such partnerships, saying the Federal labs are slumbering giants of industrial might.
"We have these incredible resources," Mr. Clinton said of the labs during the campaign, adding that "we have but only scratched the surface of their potential."
Perhaps. The atomic breakthroughs of World War II fed the popular notion that scientific wizards and Federal funds could team up to achieve almost anything. The Apollo moon program did nothing to diminish that idea, although the marriage of money and brains produced countless flops like synthetic fuels, breeder reactors and Star Wars.
 
Painful Rebirth
 A spiritual rebirth for the bomb makers, the founders of the Federal-science paradigm, may be quite painful not only because of the inherent difficulty of making bold advances outside their field, but also because they succeeded at their military job for so long. Their institutional habits, and obsessions with secrecy, are now a half century old.
The hunt for what would become Los Alamos predated the celebrated test of the world's first reactor in Chicago on Dec. 2, 1942, which showed that sustained nuclear fission was possible and likely to lead to a bomb. Impatient for success, Oppenheimer, a 38-year-old physicist chosen to direct the bomb designers, led Army officials visiting New Mexico on Nov. 16 to a high mesa with stunning views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. A light snow was falling. He wanted the site for its beauty, sure it would inspire his team. The military liked its isolation. By the time scientists starting arriving in March 1943, Army crews were erecting a small city of barracks and Quonset huts and lab buildings, all ringed by barbed wire.
Other sites followed -- Argonne outside Chicago to advance reactor studies, Hanford in Washington State to produce plutonium for bombs, Oak Ridge in Tennessee to enrich uranium and fashion it into arms. After the atomic bombing of Japan and the start of the cold war, the network grew: Sandia in Albuquerque to make firing and safety circuits, Livermore in California to design more bombs, Pantex in Texas to perfect mass assembly.
Herbert S. Marks, general counsel of the Atomic Energy Commission, once remarked that the bomb enterprise bore no relation to the industrial or social life of the nation. "It was a separate state, with its own airplanes and its own factories and its thousands of secrets," he said. "It had a peculiar sovereignty, one that could bring about the end, peacefully or violently, or all other sovereignties."
Today the complex itself is torn by change. Warhead production has been thrown into reverse, with disassembly and storage now in the fore. Some facilities are being mothballed. The biggest challenges, and hopes, center on the science labs of Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos, which are seen as treasure troves of intellectual riches.
"We are living in a world where brain power will determine the lives of all our people," Mr. Clinton told Sandia workers during the campaign. "I want to make sure that each of you has a chance to contribute your full potential."
Los Alamos is already shifting gears, Dr. Hecker says. In two years it has signed 31 cooperative agreements with industry, and has 40 pending. It has teamed with Motorola to cut the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which work wonders in cleaning electronic circuit boards but are also destroying the Earth's ozone layer. In another joint venture, Los Alamos is working with Life Technologies to develop an innovative technology aimed at speeding the quest to map the human gene.
Dr. Hecker said Los Alamos is also pioneering technologies on its own that the Government might ordain for wide civilian use, such as high-speed supercomputer networks similar to the national "information superhighways" advocated by Vice-President-elect Albert Gore.
 
Hiding Old Loves?
 The lab is also devoting much energy to what Dr. Hecker called the "nuclear draw-down," dismantling arms, cleaning up the weapons complex and developing ways to limit the bomb's spread around the world. "The country needs the smarts to deal with whatever nuclear weapons are left and their legacy," he said. "That's the core of what we do. But I'm optimistic we can also aid the domestic agenda."
Critics say the new industrial drive could simply provide a cloak for old loves. "The labs are not only looking for new ideas in nuclear weapons," said William M. Arkin, military research director for Greenpeace, "but are doing so in a manner that is increasingly secretive."
John Stroud, an official with Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety, based in Santa Fe, said Los Alamos was expanding its bomb work as other centers were retired. "They pay lip service to industrial partnerships," he said, "but are unwilling to take any risks that would commit the lab to an alternative course."
Dr. Hecker said some nuclear work at Los Alamos was indeed growing but would only "help to slow the decline." And with scientific caution, he added that the industrial push, while promising, offered no guarantee of a surge in national innovation.
"I'm optimistic because the private sector is taking a significant interest in us," he said. "But now we have to demonstrate that we can actually do some good."

HEADLINE: A Living, Barely, Behind the Wheel;
Low Pay and Long Hours Cut Through Taxi World Stratum

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
On the rivers of hurtling steel that New Yorkers call streets, Majeed Salhab, Tharwat Bekheit, Tony Smith and Majeed Moughal are a beleaguered breed of gondolier.
All drive taxis, but they represent different species within a vast and varied industry. While Mr. Moughal ferries tourists around Manhattan in his sparkling yellow medallion cab, Mr. Smith uses his rattling Chrysler as a gypsy cab to illegally shuttle Queens residents from subways to their homes. Mr. Salhab makes six trips daily in his black car, a climate-controlled Lincoln, but Mr. Bekheit makes as many each hour as a car service driver in a road-worn Cadillac, taking orders over the radio from a dispatcher in Brooklyn. 
 And though all of them fear crime, Mr. Smith's work is easily the most dangerous: statistically, he and illegal drivers like him are more likely to be killed in their cabs than police officers are on the beat.
Yet for all their differences, the four share a hard routine that, in the city's sputtering economy, has become harder. Ridership is down, tips are smaller, workdays are longer and, consequently, turnover among drivers is rising, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.
In an effort to stabilize the billion-dollar business, the Dinkins administration has proposed revamping the city's taxi regulations, some of which date to the 1930's. The plan is intended to clamp down on illegal cabs, cap the number of car-service bases and expand the number of medallion cabs by 400. But the proposal has received mixed reviews from the industry and faces an uncertain fate in the City Council.
Amid questions about who should be regulated and how, some experts say the city should abolish taxi regulation and let competition dictate the industry's growth. "Deregulation will mean more diverse service and improved quality because of competition," said Dick Netzer, a professor of economics at the Wagner Graduate School for Public Service at New York University.
In this cantankerous and protean industry, regulation never stopped diversification. When yellow cabs gave up on cruising neighborhoods outside Manhattan 20 years ago, new businesses, many built on the labor and entrepreneurial energy of immigrants, stepped into the void. Inexpensive car services emerged in middle-class communities. Radio-dispatched luxury black cars won corporate accounts. And "$1 cars"-- unlicensed, or gypsy, cabs -- sprouted like wildflowers in poor neighborhoods.
Today, there are about 60,000 taxis of all types that transport nearly a million New Yorkers each day. With more cars chasing fewer riders, passengers are waiting less for cabs and reporting fewer complaints about drivers, according to the taxi commission.
But for the drivers, stiffer competition in a weak economy is taking a toll. The stories of Messrs. Bekheit, Moughal, Salhab and Smith provide a glimpse into those hardships and also the vast changes that have swept the industry and made it so difficult to regulate.
Though their cars are as different as their clients, the drivers' hopes, fears and even paychecks are much the same. All are immigrants who, like generations of cabbies before them, see taxi driving as a poor man's gateway to mainstream America.
"With a cab, you feel you have your own job," Mr. Moughal said. "It gives us a little respect."
 
Car Services
An 18-Hour Day, $70 Taken Home
 When the "check engine" light flashed yellow inside Mr. Bekheit's cab on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway recently, an untypically good day suddenly turned sour. He stopped the wheezing car at a garage, discharged his passenger and, as green fluid trickled from a radiator hose, tallied the losses: an $11 fare, $50 for repairs and three hours of precious driving time.
Eighteen hours into a workday, Mr. Bekheit (pronounced beck-EAT) was weak with hunger, red-eyed from exhaustion and brimming with disgust. As the mechanic tinkered under the car, Mr. Bekheit ducked into a storage room, kneeled on some grease-stained rags and prayed to Allah. Then he barreled back into business.
"One dollar!" the Egyptian immigrant muttered, stuffing the remains of his earnings into a pocket. "And today was busy, today I was going to make money."
Mr. Bekheit, 26 years old, came to the United States from Alexandria in 1987, drove a medallion cab briefly and then returned to Egypt. But he returned to the United States a year ago, hoping to save enough money to attend graduate engineering school in New York City.
A friend recommended taxi driving, so he bought a car for $1,200 and became one of 22,000 drivers in the neighborhood car business. One year later, he is on his fifth car: a 1985 Cadillac Brougham with 240,000 miles, a dented passenger door and a cockeyed headlight. The car cost him $2,700.
 
Independent Operator
 Like most car-service drivers, Mr. Bekheit is an independent operator who pays a 25 percent commission to the licensed radio base that arranges his trips, Apple Express in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Unlike yellow cabs, car services and black cars are not allowed to pick up street hails, though many do anyway.
On a good, 18-hour day, Mr. Bekheit says he can take home $70 after expenses. To pay his bills and save some money, he almost always works seven days a week. In the last year, he has been robbed three times and shot in the leg once.
A handsome, soft-spoken man, Mr. Bekheit says crime has not deterred him from driving all night. But fear of it has kept him from bringing his wife and 4-year-old son to New York City. Unable to save enough to begin graduate school, he has begun thinking about returning to Egypt.
"Sometime, you must stop," he said. "You miss your wife, you miss your son, you miss your country. Sometime you must stop."
 
Gypsy Cabs
Earning a Living Could Be Fatal
 Tony Smith's choices have also been bleak.
An automobile mechanic who was laid off last year, the Jamaican immigrant says he began driving a gypsy cab when he couldn't find work paying more than the minimum wage.
"I never sold drugs, but the thought do cross my mind," he said. "I said to myself, you make bigger money, faster money. But I don't want to go to jail. In this business, the most I get is a ticket."
Mr. Smith, 27, is one of scores of gypsy-cab drivers who make illegal street pickups in Southeast Queens. Because many gypsies work part time, there are no accurate estimates of their numbers. The Taxi and Limousine Commission estimates about 8,000, but the licensed car-service industry says the number is over 20,000 and growing as unemployed people join the business.
With virtually no overhead or licensing fees to pay, gypsy drivers can charge less than licensed taxis or buses, usually $1 per short, local ride; anything longer is negotiable. But city taxi officials say there is a downside to the price: many gypsy drivers carry little or no insurance, drive dilapidated cars and even commit crimes against their passengers.
Such concerns seem not to have deterred Mr. Smith's clientele. On a good day, he can earn $20 an hour during rush hour and take home $75 for the day, he says. However, when taxi commission officials patrol the area, as they did on Friday, he stops work. During that crackdown, a taxi inspector was stabbed in the leg by an unlicensed driver. The driver was charged with second-degree assault.
 
'We Move Faster'
 Every morning, Mr. Smith cruises Hollis Avenue, honking his horn and beckoning to people near bus stops, some acquaintances, some regular riders. "People aren't stupid," Mr. Smith said. "They say we move faster than the buses. And why should they ride the bus when they know I can take them to their door?"
Tall and lanky, with a mustache and flat-top haircut, Mr. Smith does his best to provide clean, friendly service. The red-velour interior of his white 1985 Chrysler Le Baron is immaculate, though riddled with cigarette burns. He carries several Luther Vandross tapes favored by riders.
But the car, which was given to him by a relative, shakes when Mr. Smith accelerates over 30 miles per hour. He says the vehicle has been inspected, properly registered and carries liability insurance, for which he pays $1,500 a year.
Despite the low overhead, there is one high cost to gypsy cab work: crime. Of the 33 murders and approximately 3,000 robberies committed against all cab drivers last year, gypsy drivers were probably the most common victims, the police say.
Mr. Smith, who routinely gives rides to local drug dealers carrying guns, says he protects himself with a black jack he carries under his seat. "I'm scared," he said. "But I have no choice but to work late. I can't go home with just $50 in my pocket."
 
Black Cars
Tie and Town Car, But Still Sweating
 After almost losing the use of his left arm when his yellow cab crashed on a rainy night in 1987, Majeed Salhab moved into safer work. He bought a black car.
The move has been costly, with high start-up costs and overhead. But his peace of mind is greater. Instead of hustling nonstop for fares, fearing that passengers will rob him and battling Manhattan traffic on 12-hour shifts, the Palestinian immigrant sets his hours, picking and choosing from what amounts to the cream of taxi work. Unlike the other drivers, Mr. Salhab has little fear of crime, because his passengers do not pay him directly. Instead they pay the black-car company, which deducts a commission and fees and pays the balance weekly to Mr. Salhab.
"I know this is not big business," he said. "But at least I'm my own boss. That's worth a lot to me."
Mr. Salhab, 32, who lives in Bergen County, N.J., sits near the top of the taxi spectrum as one of 7,000 drivers of black cars, the radio-dispatched luxury cars that primarily serve corporate accounts.
The industry evolved in the early 1980's when the city ordered medallion cabs to remove their radios. Then, several fleets quit the yellow industry and began operating just radio cars. They lost the right to pick up street hails, but they retained lucrative corporate customers. During the flush years of the 1980's, black-car companies were bustling and profitable.
 
Harder Times
 But in the lean 1990's, they have suffered. Most black-car companies are cooperatives in which drivers become shareholders by buying radios that give them access to the companies' corporate customers. The more revenue the client list produces, the more expensive the radios. In the 1980's, some radios sold for $80,000 and more. Today, those radios sell for half that or less.
Those woes have not affected Mr. Salhab because he leases his radio from his company, Skyline Credit Line Inc. But he says that he must work 50 percent longer to earn the same money he earned three years ago.
Mr. Salhab dislikes one aspect of black-car work: People think he is rich. "They see your suit and tie, your Lincoln, they want to steal from you," he said. "They don't know how we make our money. They think it came easy."
 
Medallion Cabs
Bright Yellow Cabs And Faded Dreams
 As dusk descends on Greenwich Village each night, Majeed Moughal and dozens of other Pakistani medallion drivers descend on Greenwich Village.
Rush-hour traffic eddies around their taxis outside Gaseteria on Houston Street as the drivers gossip and gripe in preparation for changing shifts. In Pakistan, the drivers had been lawyers, engineers and business owners. They came to America for political reasons, education or better jobs. They settled, uncomfortably, for taxi work.
"Tell me, what else can I do?" said Mr. Moughal when someone ribbed him for driving for more than two years. "At least I have a piece of bread at night. At least it is better than being a criminal in the street."
Mr. Moughal (pronounced MOE-gull) had taught psychology at a teacher's college in central Pakistan. But when his career stalled five years ago, he came to America to obtain a graduate degree, a sure-fire ticket to promotion in Pakistan, he thought.
Little has turned out as he planned. He found a job as a security guard but was laid off in 1989 and turned to taxi driving. Since then, he has divorced his wife in Pakistan and married a Russian emigre he met in a Brighton Beach meat market. "Now I have no reason to leave," he said. "Now I work for my family."
Mr. Moughal, 41, is typical of the new medallion driver. In 1991, 21 percent of the new applicants for hack licenses were from Pakistan, more than double any other group of applicants.
 
Well-Educated Drivers
 Though there are no statistics on the subject, interviews with dozens of Pakistani drivers suggest many were college-trained professionals in their homeland. For some, cab driving is a painfully embarrassing fall from grace. "Don't tell anyone what I did in Pakistan," said an electrical engineer. "It is a disgrace to my profession."
But others who have tasted the bitterness of unemployment or minimum-wage labor view cab driving as something better. Such people often seek to buy their own cars or medallions -- the city licenses that allow taxi drivers to pick up street hails.
Mr. Moughal is one. He currently leases his cab and medallion for $550 a week. But he knows his prospects of buying them are uncertain. Medallions cost as much as $140,000, and few drivers can save enough. He works 12-hour shifts seven days a week to bring home $500 weekly -- just enough to support his wife, her daughter and mother in their one-bedroom Brighton Beach apartment.
He still studies psychology textbooks in his car during breaks, but his dream of graduate school has faded. "With a child, a wife, a home, how can you get to where you want to be," he said. "We stay at home and watch TV; that's all we can afford. And it is getting tougher. I'm lost in this profession."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: Reaction in Congress;
Some Republicans, but Not All, Praise the Expected Appointments

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Republican members of Congress joined their Democratic colleagues today in praising the expected appointment of Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury Secretary, but some raised concerns about other leading candidates for President-elect Bill Clinton's economic team.
Democrats said the reported list of economic advisers reflected Mr. Clinton's commitment to move the party away from traditional tax-and-spend liberalism toward pragmatism.. 
 Members of both parties voiced enthusiasm for Senator Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, who is widely expected to be chosen Treasury Secretary. And they thought that Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, would make a strong advocate for fiscal discipline should he be selected director of the Office of Management and Budget.
But some Republicans predicted that Robert B. Reich, a Harvard instructor who is widely expected to assume a senior economic post, would become a lightning rod for partisan controversy.
 
Criticism From Gramm
 Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a ranking Republican on the Banking and Appropriations Committees, criticized Mr. Reich as "a state socialist, a national economic planner" who might push for the kind of economic policies that failed in Eastern Europe.
Still, the overall reaction from both sides of the aisle was positive. "Wonderful appointments," said Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a ranking Republican on the Banking and Finance Committees. "Bentsen is thoughtful and sound. If Clinton's got Panetta in there, he's picking someone who is concerned about the deficits and is willing to do something about them."
Speculation on the economic appointments has reached a high pitch on Capitol Hill, in large part because Mr. Bentsen's and Mr. Panetta's departures would trigger potentially significant leadership changes on the Senate Finance Committee and the House Budget Committee that they now head, with possible policy implications affecting social security, health care, trade and the environment.
The ultimate effect on Congress is still a matter of speculation, but an appointment for Mr. Panetta could set off a donnybrook between Democratic liberals and conservatives over who would become chairman of the Budget Committee, which has special rules on succession. Several members said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's accession to the chairmanship of the Finance Committee would lend the panel greater creativity in dealing with the rising costs of entitlements like Social Security.
Mr. Moynihan is expected to give up his chairmanship of the Committee on Environment and Public Works to assume the Finance Committee post, opening the way for Senator Max Baucus, a Democratic environmentalist from Montana, to take over for Mr. Moynihan. Already chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International Trade, Mr. Baucus would assume substantial leverage in his goal of pressuring the Mexican Government to improve its environmental standards in exchange for ratifying the free trade agreement with Mexico.
 
Democrats Offer Praise
 Not surprising, Democrats greeted the expected announcements with the warmest praise.
"It's a very good team that combines new ideas and pragmatism," said Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, a ranking Democrat on the House Banking Committee. He added that Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Panetta, Mr. Reich and Roger Altman, a New York investment banker expected to become deputy treasury secretary, would push to open new export markets and promote high-technology industries without involving the Government in areas where the private sector is better off left alone.
Senator Richard H. Bryan, a moderate Democrat from Nevada, said the expected appointments "show that Clinton is indeed a new kind of Democrat."
Even some conservative Republicans voiced approval for some of the expected appointments.
Senator Steve Symms of Idaho, a Republican member of the Budget and Finance Committees, said the appointment of Mr. Bentsen "should send strong signals to everyone in the financial community that there will be a steady hand at Treasury." And should Mr. Panetta receive the nod, Mr. Symms said, "the deficit will no longer be the Reagan deficit and the Bush deficit; we will have everyone involved in it."
 
Bentsen Departure Assailed
 Mr. Gramm had kind words for Mr. Panetta and Mr. Bentsen, his fellow Texan, but with the inclusion of Mr. Reich, who he believes is an unreformed liberal, he said, "I don't see a consistent team there."
Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut, a Republican member of the House Ways and Means Committee, was also critical of Mr. Reich, saying he "is clearly identified with one extreme of thinking in terms of manipulating economic growth." She also said she regretted to see Mr. Bentsen leave the Senate "because he is one of the most knowledgeable and balanced thinkers on health care reform."
And as for Mr. Panetta, Ms. Johnson criticized his leadership role in defeating the proposed balanced budget amendment last year, adding, "If you're trying to break gridlock, it seems to me unwise to choose appointments that focus on partisan differences."
Although Mr. Panetta's appointment is not certain, House Democrats are already expecting that Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a conservative Texan who is a chief promoter of the balanced budget amendment, will run to replace him as Budget Committee chairman. Liberals are expected to rally behind Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, as Representative John M. Spratt of South Carolina jockeys to become the compromise winner should no candidate win a first ballot caucus victory.

HEADLINE: Amy Fisher Locales Shunned by Producers

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 4

 BODY:
Three production companies are racing to complete television movies of the Amy Fisher story, but none of the filming is being done on Long Island, where the drama played itself out.
The contradiction has not been lost on officials of Nassau and Suffolk counties assigned to attract film makers to the island. But they say that few movies set on the island have been filmed here lately and that things have been especially difficult since a labor dispute led many production companies to boycott the New York City area. 
 The scene of the May 19 shooting -- the front steps of Joseph and Mary Jo Buttafuoco's white split-level house on Adams Road West in Massapequa -- is being re-created at studios in Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia.
It was on these steps that Miss Fisher, then 17 years old, shot Mrs. Buttafuoco in the head. She recovered, but not without damage to her hearing and jaw, and the .25-caliber bullet remains lodged in her neck near her spinal cord.
Miss Fisher, who insists that Mr. Buttafuoco put her up to shooting his wife, was sentenced on Tuesday to 5 to 15 years in prison. Mr. Buttafuoco has denied the charges and has said he never had an affair with Miss Fisher.

 Debbie Markowitz, director of cinema and television production for the Nassau County Department of Commerce and Industry, said, "So far, all we've gotten are requests for police badges and photographs of police uniforms. Other than that, we've had very little input into the Amy movies. They all started production without us."
Ms. Markowitz said the motion picture and television production industry contributed at least $10 million a year to the economy in Nassau, but she said it appeared little would come this year from the Fisher story.
Huntington Hospital, where Miss Fisher was taken by her lawyer, Eric Naiburg, after two suicide attempts, is in Suffolk County, but it has not been approached by the Fisher film makers. Christopher Cook, director of the Suffolk County motion picture and television bureau, said he had received no inquiries.
"I think the bottom line may be the weather factor," he said. "It's sunnier in California at this time of year, and they're racing to put it all together."
"There's also the matter of a wage differential between the United States and Canada and the exchange rate, which favors the Canadian dollar over the U.S. dollar," he said.
 
Perception on Expenses Cited
 He noted that Long Island was the place to make moves in the mid-80's but that the industry was "faddish" and had moved elsewhere. "But it's cyclical and will return," he said.
A seven-month Hollywood boycott of the New York City area over labor costs also played a part, Mr. Cook said. The boycott ended in mid-May 1991, when film-production unions in the area granted concessions on overtime wages in return for enhanced health and pension benefits.
Bruce Feinberg, the new director of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's film office, said his mission is to promote film making from Montauk to the Canadian border. And while Long Island has all the expertise and settings for a Fisher film, he said, "You can't argue with the Canadian exchange rate."
He said the film industry, which is produced by a blue-collar work force behind a glamorous facade, adds an estimated $2.5 billion to the state's economy each year.
Mr. Cook, meanwhile, said he remained philosophical about the loss of the Fisher film projects. He noted that the movie of "The Great Gatsby," set on the North Shore, was filmed in Newport, R.I.; "The "Amityville Horror," about a haunted house on the South Shore, was filmed in New Jersey, and Peter Benchley's "Jaws," about a shark that terrorizes the East End of Long Island, was filmed off Martha's Vineyard.
Of the three Amy Fisher movies, ABC's "Beyond Control: The Amy Fisher Story," starring Drew Barrymore was the first to set a broadcast date, Sunday, Jan. 24. The film, based on press accounts of the case, is being made in Vancouver.
The NBC movie is being made by KLM, a Long Island production company, but is being filmed in Toronto. Based on Miss Fisher's account, it is called "Treachery in the Suburbs" and will star Noelle Parker, a newcomer. It will also be shown Jan. 24.
CBS's "Casualty of Love," stars Alyssa Milano, formerly of "Who's the Boss". The film, produced by Tristar and based on the Buttafuocos' story, is being filmed in Los Angeles and is to be shown Jan. 26..

HEADLINE: C.E.O. of Public Education Inc.

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J., Dec. 3

 BODY:
Bundled in a camel's-hair coat behind the wheel of his Lincoln Town Car, Dr. Philip E. Geiger looks more like a Fortune 500 C.E.O. than a school superintendent.
He sounds like one, too, as he enthusiastically talks about "zero-based budgets," "strategic planning" and "electronic spreadsheets." And the 45-year-old school superintendent is as proud of his master's degree in business administration from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance as he is of his doctorate in education from Columbia University. 
 Make no mistake about it, though. Phil Geiger's business is running the 10 public schools in Piscataway Township, and in the eyes of admirers he is a model of a new generation of school administrators who must manage the conflicting forces of constricting budgets and expanding educational needs.
 
Hiring Private Companies
 His major cost-cutting weapon has been the hiring of private companies to provide noninstructional services, a trend seen across the nation. He and other school administrators say that one way to cut costs without interfering with the quality of education in the classroom is to focus on the wage and benefit contracts awarded in palmier economic times to support workers like bus drivers, custodians and cafeteria workers.
At the same time, Dr. Geiger is putting the savings into an array of new programs that he says will make the district, which has 6,000 students and a budget of $51 millionthis year, a leader in classroom instruction in the region.
Plans are under way for programs to accelerate students' computer, science, mathematics and reading skills. Also, parents and teachers are examining ways to use community resources more effectively.
For school administrators, who have seen their work loads jump, and for parents and teachers, the reaction to Dr. Geiger is often mixed. Some express outright or grudging admiration for the superintendent's attempts to cut overhead, while others worry where the ax will fall next.
"He is a dynamic, innovative figure who has created a lot of excitement in our schools," said Paula Van Riper, an assistant dean of academic services at Rutgers University who serves as president of the Piscataway Township Board of Education.
But others peg Dr. Geiger, who took over in mid-1991, as a heartless bureaucrat with a bottom-line brain and a calculator for a heart.
"He has come into this town and caused chaos," said Marge Mathews, 58, a school bus driver for 30 years who says she will go on unemployment next year rather than work for the low wages a private bus operator would pay.
Dr. Geiger's own view, shared by many educators in the region, is that the present political climate of cutting costs allows the schools to cast off old ways of doing things that were expensive and introduce new programs that in calmer days would have met strong resistance.
"That's where a zero-based budget comes into play," said Dr. Geiger, who this month is concluding a long series of budget talks with administrators.
"Every year we clear the decks and justify every dime we spend," added Dr. Geiger, whose salary is $120,000 a year. "If a program can't be justified other than by tradition, we look at how its costs can be re-allocated to improve instruction without spending new money."
The district diverted $2.4 million from noninstructional expenditures into the classroom last year, a feat Dr. Geiger hopes to more than match in his new budget.
 
Concerns of Unions
 Just how far school administrators take the move to use private companies is a matter of concern for unions that represent teachers and school support personnel.
A few districts have contracted with private companies even to supply teachers. In Baltimore, Educational Alternatives Inc., a Minnesota-based company, has a five-year contract to manage and staff five city schools.
Until last year when the board awarded the school cafeteria contract to Service America Inc., 55 lunchroom workers, who were not unionized, were paid $8 to $15 an hour by the district. Even though they worked only five hours a day during the school year and had summers off, Dr. Geiger said, the 55 were given full health and dental benefits equal to those of teachers, costing the district $8,000 per employee in premiums. The workers also qualified for pensions.
The district saved $500,000 in the first year and expects similar savings in the future, said Dr. Geiger. Meanwhile, daily use of the cafeterias by students rose because of better menu choices, he added.
All the cafeteria workers at the school were offered work by Service America at a 20 percent reduction in pay and no health benefits other than what they would pay out of pocket, Dr. Geiger said. Two out of three made the switch but about 10 quit during the past year, he said.
The move to privatize the school bus system by early next year has run into more public resistance because the bus drivers, unlike the lunchroom workers, are familiar faces to parents. Drivers who earn $12 an hour plus full benefits expect cuts similar to those experienced by the cafeteria workers.
"We are opposed to it for the safety of the children," said Michele Martin, president of the Piscataway Township Education Association, the union which represents the district's teachers and bus drivers.
If privatization goes through as expected, the saving will be $1.5 million a year, Dr. Geiger says. And the sale of the existing bus fleet should net an additional $1.3 million, he said.
 
New Computer System
 The district plans to use these and other savings to establish a new $4 million computer network that, Dr. Geiger says, will be unrivaled in New Jersey. It will vastly improve learning skills in the elementary grades, he said.
Dr. Geiger, who has been a school superintendent since the age of 29 and has also worked as a private consultant, was recruited from Lexington, Mass., an affluent suburb outside Boston. It was his experience in contracting out school services to private companies in Lexington, as well as his budgeting prowess, that caught the attention of those in the New Jersey district.
As if to underscore his point, supposing anyone had missed it, Dr. Geiger has designed a symbol of his administration that is widely displayed in the schools. It shows the letters B.A.U. within a circle with a red line drawn diagonally through them. "No more business as usual," he said emphatically.

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Aides Say U.S. Role in Somalia Gives Bush a Way to Exit in Glory

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Friends and advisers to President Bush say that mounting concern about the fate of more than one million starving people was the major goad to his decision, 11 days ago, to offer troops for use in Somalia. But it is no coincidence, they add, that Mr. Bush is leaving office with a show of American might in a noble cause.
Having seen a chance to exit with an example of America's global responsibility in a fragmented world, they said, the President has shaken off considerable bitterness over his political loss and seized it. 
 In interviews during the last week, several associates and aides who have spoken to Mr. Bush about Somalia said the American expedition represents the sort of hard-nosed foreign policy decision that political concerns have constrained Mr. Bush from making openly, and which defeat has freed him to pursue.
None of those people, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, suggested that Mr. Bush delayed action in Somalia for political reasons during a campaign that was obsessed with domestic economic concerns. In fact, it was not until after the election that Administration and United Nations experts began to regard the situation as so dire that only military force could change it.
 
Political Considerations Denied
 One senior Administration official argued that political considerations were not involved, noting that the United States has steadily increased its military and diplomatic role in Somalia since last summer.
Still, that aide noted that Mr. Bush's campaign advisers were "fearful of accusations that all the President cared about was foreign policy," and strongly urged him to take a lower public profile on all foreign issues until after the election.
"Would we have been a little more vigorous otherwise?" the aide asked. "That's harder to answer."
Viewed from a strictly humanitarian point, Mr. Bush's aides said this week, the White House's decision on Nov. 25 to commit troops to Somalia was forced by a steady decline in the country's military and social condition that began in mid-October and reached a peak days before Thanksgiving.
 
Airlift Began in August
 The United States began airlifting food into Somalia on military transport planes on Aug. 14, and after both aircraft and relief convoys began to come under scattered attack by rival gangs, the Pentagon dispatched 2,400 marines in mid-September to ships in the Indian Ocean off Somalia's coast.
Late that same month, the United Nations sent 500 Pakistani soldiers to Mogadishu, the Somali capital, but the troops were never deployed outside the city's seaport and airport because gang leaders could not agree on their placement. By mid-October, the gangs had forced the closure of the nation's second-biggest seaport, at Kismayu, and the flow of relief began to shrink more rapidly.
But officials said that it was not until late October or early November, when the Mogadishu seaport also was forced to close and the city was virtually blockaded by the warring gangs, that the need for military intervention began to become apparent to the White House.
By Nov. 7, when the seaport shut down, only 20 percent of aid shipments were reaching starving citizens; the remainder was being stolen by gangs. In the week before Mr. Bush offered the use of American troops, gangs shot and seriously wounded a Pakistani soldier in the United Nations force and a United Nations official was robbed at gunpoint in Kismayu.
 
U.N. Ship Forced Back to Sea
 The day before Mr. Bush's offer, a United Nations ship carrying 10,000 tons of supplies was hit by artillery fire as it tried to dock in Mogadishu, and was forced back to sea.
"We started early last summer flying the aid in because the U.N. wasn't doing the job," one senior aide said.
"After the Pakistani troops arrived, things really, really just kind of closed down -- a month ago, maybe," he said "I mean, it wasn't a precipitous thing, but it's just pretty much closed down now."
That relentless deterioration of conditions ultimately led Mr. Bush to commit American troops to a United Nations efforts inside Somalia, aides and friends said. But they said that other factors, including Mr. Bush's desire to leave office on a high note, may well have played roles, too.
 
White House Drove U.S. Role
 Throughout the summer and fall, Administration officials said, decisions to commit aircraft to relief flights and deploy marines to the Indian Ocean were driven by the White House, sometimes amid reservations by military leaders in the Pentagon.
One friend and adviser described Mr. Bush as the last of a series of Presidents who were steeled by the experiences of World War II and the cold war.
"The President represents a strong current of thinking about foreign policy . . . about the need for international engagement," another senior Bush aide said.
From a purely personal standpoint, another senior official said this week, the President wishes to be seen ending his term as a decisive leader, not as a vanquished politician. To the extent that pictures of starving Somalians can be replaced by Jan. 20 with images of American troops handing out food, that aide said, Mr. Bush will leave the White House a content man.

HEADLINE: Eskimos Learn They've Been Living Amid Secret Pits of Radioactive Soil

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE

 BODY:
The season of darkness, two months without a sunrise, has fallen over much of the Alaskan Arctic, and with it has come a sense of betrayal and uneasiness among the native people not seen for some time.
Thirty years ago the Inupiat Eskimos north of here successfully stopped a plan by the Federal Government to create an Arctic harbor with a huge atomic blast near the village of Point Hope, on the Chukchi Sea in northwestern Alaska. Now the Eskimos have learned they were not free, after all, of the Government's nuclear experiments. 
 While the idea of blowing a hole in the ice was shelved in 1962, the Government went ahead with a secret project the same year to bury several thousand pounds of radioactive soil in the same area.
 
Shallow, Unmarked Mound
 The soil, which Government documents said contained trace amounts of fallout from a nuclear explosion at the Nevada Test Site, was placed in a dozen pits to examine how radioactivity spreads in an Arctic environment, then was scooped up and buried in a shallow mound. The site was unmarked by warning signs; the people who live and hunt in the area were never told of its existence.
The Eskimos learned of the buried nuclear waste this fall when Dan O'Neill, a researcher at the University of Alaska, made public documents he had found while researching a book on the abandoned harbor plan, which was publicly reported at the time but had been largely forgotten.
In October, after acknowledging the details of the 1962 plan, Government scientists tested the soil and concluded that it no longer posed a health hazard. But many native leaders say they don't believe the scientists, and they are thinking of hiring their own experts to test the site. Natives of the North Slope have a cancer rate that far exceeds the national average.
 
Nothing but a Wasteland
 "I can't tell you how angry I am that they considered our home to be nothing but a big wasteland," said Jeslie Kaleak, Mayor of the North Slope Borough, which governs eight Arctic villages, including Point Hope. "They didn't give a damn about the people who live up here."
In Point Hope, an ancient whaling village of 700 people that anthropologists say is one of the oldest continuously inhabited sites in North America, Mayor David Stone said: "We feel betrayed. The people have lost their trust in the Federal Government."
When Senator Frank Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, visited the village in the fall, an elderly woman threw herself at him and shouted, "You have poisoned our land!"
The disclosures highlight a jarring collision of two worlds: the hunting and whaling subsistence life of the natives, in a relatively pristine environment, and the Government's can-do engineering mentality.
The plan to set off a nuclear blast in the Arctic was known as Project Chariot and was designed in the late 1950's to demonstrate a peaceful use of the atom. The idea was to create a deep-water port that could be used to export coal in the three months of summer, when the Chukchi Sea is not frozen.
Project Chariot ran into fierce opposition at Point Hope, which lies less than 100 miles from the Russian border. The blast, to have been set just offshore from the village, would have contaminated prime caribou hunting grounds and disrupted fishing and whaling in the area. At the time, many of the people still lived in sod houses and spoke the native Inupiat language.
 
Derision, Then Another Plan
 While the native opposition may have been a crucial factor in killing Project Chariot, the Government was also unable to find a commercial partner who thought it might be economically feasible to operate a man-made harbor in the Far North.
"It was real lame-brain operation that nobody in Alaska saw much merit in," said Chuck Kleeschulte, an aide to Senator Murkowski.
But late in 1962, about the same time the Government announced it was abandoning Project Chariot, it went ahead with the plan to see how radioactive isotopes would react in an Arctic environment. This project, a United States Geological Survey study done under a license by the Atomic Energy Commission, was never given a public hearing.
Although the documents from the time are sketchy about the real purpose of the project, Mr. O'Neill said he suspected the Government was trying to prove that radioactivity was less harmful in frigid conditions. and that Project Chariot was therefore feasible.
To do their experiments the scientists chose some Federal land on Cape Thompson, 25 miles south of Point Hope, and placed several thousand pounds of radioactive soil in a dozen pits over a two-mile radius to monitor its leaching.
According to the documents, the soil came from within a mile of ground zero of a nuclear blast in Nevada and contained strontium-85 and cesium-137. Tom Gerusky, a Government health physicist who visited the site in October, said the amounts were small enough to have been carried to Alaska in a cloth bag, with some of the most intensely radioactive isotopes in lead pouches. The strontium would typically have lost all its radioactivity years ago, and the cesium would still have about half its radioactivity after 30 years.
 
'Up Through the Food Chain'
 Many Eskimos fear they were harmed by exposure to the contaminants. "Both cesium and strontium are extremely worrisome because they can go up through the food chain," said Mr. O'Neill.
He said the scientists greatly exceeded limits on the volume of radioactive material that may be buried unsealed. "The documents show that what they did was illegal," he said. "What they buried was a thousand times higher than the allowable standard for that kind of nuclear burial."
After conducting experiments, the Government scientists scooped up about 15,000 pounds of contaminated soil, buried it in an unmarked mound and left the site as a sort of anonymous nuclear grave. That was the end of it until September, when Mr. O'Neill made public his documents.
The news shocked Point Hope. Perhaps no one was more upset than Wilfred Lane Sr., an Inupiat who had chosen 160 acres adjacent to the burial mound as his part of an aboriginal claim to which he is entitled.
 
Abandoning a Dream
 When he picked the land in 1971, he said, no one from the State of Alaska or the Federal Government informed him that the site contained radioactive contaminants. His family had long hunted near Cape Thompson.
"My plan was to build a youth camp there," said Mr. Lane, who is 52 years old and lives in Kotzebue, south of Cape Thompson. "I wanted to make a place where we could teach the youth about native culture in the summer."
Mr. Lane said his brother, who had regularly hunted caribou, picked berries and eaten murre eggs in the Cape Thompson area, died of cancer a few years ago.
Although Mr. Lane and other natives now blame radioactivity for the Eskimos' high cancer rate, Government researchers say it is because of poor diet and cigarette smoking.
Department of Energy officials, who are charged with cleaning up the nation's nuclear dump sites, say they are working on a plan to remove the Cape Thompson waste next year.
 
Little Harm, Physicist Says
 "I know people are upset, but we don't believe anybody received any significant radioactive exposure from this," said Mr. Gerusky, the Government health physicist.
It is unclear how much radioactivity from aboveground nuclear blasts by the Soviet Union may have drifted into the Arctic, but American officials say the amount could be considerable.
There is also concern that the Bering and Chukchi Seas are contaminated by radioactivity: Russia has acknowledged that over the last three decades the Soviets dumped old submarines with damaged nuclear reactors, and more than 10,000 containers of nuclear waste, in waters of the Far North.
Although Energy Department officials said they knew of no other American nuclear waste sites in the Arctic, Mr. O'Neill said he expected more disclosures. "It's unfortunate, because right now relations between the natives and the Government have been poisoned by all of this," he said.

Mayor David Stone said, "We feel betrayed. The people have lost their trust in the Federal Government." The cancer rate of the area's natives far exceeds the national average.

HEADLINE: Hospital Bills and Paying Them

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
By court order, New Jersey had to change the way it compensated hospitals for unpaid care. But last week the state went far beyond that task, not only adopting a controversial alternative on paying for indigent care, but making momentous changes in the rules governing health insurance and hospital charges.
An odd alliance of a Republican majority and a Democratic Governor churned out a bewildering group of new laws with effects that will not be known for years. News of the far-reaching changes in the insurance market was almost lost amid the drama of the close vote on the hospital compensation plan, which will draw on money from the state unemployment fund. Gov. Jim Florio, for his part, claimed that the state had entered a new era: "These reforms will help make sure no one in our state has to lie awake at night wondering how to pay the bills if someone in the family gets sick."
 
Falls Short of Clinton's Goal
 Hyperbole aside, the new insurance measures should make health coverage more widely available. They put New Jersey in the forefront of a handful of states that are making major changes in health care and are also consistent with changes that President-elect Bill Clinton is expected to seek for the whole country. 
 But for all they may accomplish, the changes in New Jersey also illustrate the difficulties the states face in the field: the measures fall well short of the goal Mr. Florio expressed and Mr. Clinton has set: universal health coverage. And they hold little promise of holding down the surge in medical costs, the root of the crisis.
New Jersey has faced the same breakdown in health security as the rest of the country. Officials estimate that more than 800,000 residents -- more than 10 percent of the population -- now lack health insurance. Most are the working poor and their families -- those not poor enough to get Medicaid but not affluent enough to afford premiums. Others have been denied coverage or quoted exorbitant rates because they have medical problems or are otherwise deemed high risk.
The underlying goal of the new measures is a transition that all sides are seeking. Now, medical bills of the uninsured are picked up by the state when they are hospitalized or use emergency rooms. The new aim is have more people insured, covering primary care as well as hospitalization. Payments to hospitals for charity care are being reduced.
 
City Hospitals' Rocky Future
 The Governor had used the pressure of a Nov. 30 deadline on indigent care financing to push through additional major changes in the health insurance system. These include measures to end price discrimination by health insurers against the sick and the old; creation of a new form of subsidized insurance for the working poor; requiring insurers to offer five standardized plans to small businesses and individuals, allowing for comparison shopping; and putting new limits on insurers' administrative costs and profits.
The Republicans, securing their goal in the grand bargain, radically reduced the regulation of hospitals. Bucking a national trend, the Republicans ended hospital price controls, which they said hampered competition between institutions, but which many experts said had actually helped to hold down the state's medical costs.
The deal they put together includes the most ambitious attempt of any state to extend coverage. Still, it is unclear how many people will secure it, and the change may be a rocky one, especially for urban hospitals, which now serve many uninsured patients. "This change makes sense, but with such radical shifts occurring, it's hard to tell what's really going to happen in terms of the coverage of the population," said Anne Gauthier of the Alpha Center, a nonprofit health policy group in Washington, who has studied state reforms. "Will the patients walking in the door really have the insurance?"
Some consumer advocates said that the new insurance rules gave too much power to the industry and may result only in higher insurance prices for everyone, without much relief for the needy. Officials respond that for the first time, insurers will be forced to compete over price, rather than over who can sign up the healthiest group of customers.
Whatever the gaps, New Jersey overnight moved into the forefront of change at the state level. Despite all the talk of insurance reform, only a few states, including New York, Minnesota, Vermont and Maine, have actually passed anti-discrimination measures resembling those in New Jersey; how they will work in practice remains to be seen.
While Oregon and Massachusetts have drawn up more ambitious plans that would mandate universal coverage, these have been stalled by legal challenges and the economic recession. Hawaii remains the only state with near-total coverage, achieved by requiring employers to offer insurance and creating a state-subsidized plan for others.
 
Trying to Tame the Monster
 In part, the limits of New Jersey's plan reflect its local political constraints: new taxes are anathema for now, state government is starkly divided by party and lobbyists for private hospitals and insurance companies have wielded great power.
But the shortcomings also reflect the problems facing any state trying to tame the health-care monster on its own. Mr. Clinton has said he will propose a national plan for universal coverage and cost control early next year. While the details are still being debated, his proposals are expected to include curbs on discrimination by health insurers, much like those adopted in New Jersey, and also a much more sweeping requirement that all employers offer insurance to their workers.
"We'll make a dent in the number of uninsured; we'll do the best we can," said Brenda J. Bacon, Governor Florio's health adviser. "But we don't want to be the first state" to enact employer requirements, she said, "because of the possible negative impact on job growth."
State officials hope that hundreds of thousands of the working poor, and unemployed or part-time workers, will buy coverage from a new, subsidized plan called New Jersey Shield. While details remain to be fleshed out, a family of four earning $33,500 a year might pay $105 a month, a small fraction of the market rate, for comprehensive coverage in a private managed-care plan, officials said.
The needed public subsidy for the subsidized coverage is projected to rise from $50 million in 1994 to $200 million in 1997. Initially the money will come from the same pool as that for uncompensated hospital care: the state unemployment insurance fund. But that makeshift arrangement is supposed to end by Jan. 1, 1996.
Officials hope that by then a national program of health financing will be in place, providing some financial aid.

Paying for the Uninsured
New insurance regulations adopted in New Jersey last week are aimed at reducing the number of uninsured residents, now estimated at more than 800,000.
Standardized policies: For individuals and small groups (2 to 49), insurers will be required to offer five standardized policies, encouraging direct price competition between companies.
Ending discrimination: Now, commercial insurers pick and choose among applicants. New Jersey Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a nonprofit group that is required to serve as insurer of last resort, has seen its expenses soar as more high-risk patients enroll in individual and small group policies, a market it dominates. Under new "open enrollment" rules, commercial companies, too, will have to offer individual policies to all applicants up to a quota equal to their share of the overall health market, or pay an assessment to Blue Cross. Commercial insurers will also have to accept all small-group applicants. Under a "community rating" requirement, each insurer must set the same rates for all individuals and those in small groups, regardless of age, health status, sex, occupation, place of residence or other factors. A company's rates will vary only by the amount of coverage the customer chooses. This should reduce rates for the sick and the old but may raise them for healthy applicants.
Setting fees: Insurers in the individual and small group markets will be required to pay out at least 75 cents of every dollar collected for medical care; some now pay only about 60 cents, the rest going for administration and profits. The Insurance Commissioner's approval power over rate increases for individual policies has been lost, but officials hope that competition will prevent profiteering.
Subsidized insurance: Beginning in 1994, a new program, New Jersey Shield, will offer a subsidized managed-care plan, with premiums on a sliding scale based on income. Officials hope that as many as 450,000 people, mainly low-wage or part-time workers or the unemployed, will sign up. The subsidies, which could total $200 million or more annually within a few years, will initially come from the state unemployment insurance fund, but after 1995 a new source may be needed.

HEADLINE: 10-Cent-a-Pack Cigarette Tax Increase Proposed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The State Health Department has proposed a 10-cent-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax, partly to pay for children's health programs and anti-smoking campaigns.
The increase would raise $28.6 million a year, health officials said in budget documents submitted to the State Office of Policy and Management for the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
 The Department of Health Services wants to spend $2.1 million on anti-smoking campaigns aimed at children and at women of childbearing age. Smoking causes 4,200 deaths in the state each year, resulting in economic losses totaling $700 million, state officials say.
The increase to 45 cents per pack also is proposed so the state will not become a destination for Massachusetts residents shopping for less expensive cigarettes, Health Services Commissioner Susan S. Addiss said.
Massachusetts will increase its cigarette tax by 25 cents, to 51 cents a pack, on Jan. 1.
"We feel it kind of behooves us to keep up with them," Ms. Addiss said. "From a public health point of view, we don't want to be seen as a mecca for purchasing cigarettes."
Bourke Spellacy, a Hartford lawyer who represents the Tobacco Institute, said cigarette companies would oppose the tax increase.
 
Last Increase Was in 1991
 "There is no industry that favors increasing taxes on itself," he said. "All our smaller businesses get hammered whenever that occurs."
The state last increased the tax in 1991, when it went up 5 cents per pack to the current level of 45 cents.
Health officials would like to use the tax revenue to make hepatitis B vaccine available to children whose families cannot now afford it. Federal health authorities recommend that the vaccine be given to all children in the first year of their lives, but the series of three shots costs $50 to $100, so many children are not being vaccinated.
Ms. Addiss said she would also like to expand school-based health clinics, a health insurance program for poor children and substance-abuse programs for teen-agers and pregnant women.
A Washington-based organization of state legislators, however, says Connecticut would be unlikely to get as much money through the tax increase as it expects.
Studies show that such increases often drive consumers to other states to buy cigarettes, said Noel Card, director of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council. While out of state, some of those consumers will buy groceries, liquor and other products in addition to cigarettes.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Giuliani Lining Up His Team For Race

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
When he ran for Mayor of New York City in 1989, about the biggest criticism professional politicians made of Rudolph W. Giuliani was that he did not have enough political professionals helping him. Sure, his media adviser was Roger Ailes, the Peck's Bad Boy of the 1988 Republican Presidential race, and Mr. Giuliani came within 2 percentage points of winning, after a tough campaign.
But Mr. Ailes has more or less retired from politics, and Mr. Giuliani is trying to cast his net wider for his planned rematch against Mayor David N. Dinkins next year. Now comes word that he has been talking with Ed Rollins, the political consultant who was an architect of Ronald Reagan's 1984 landslide and who briefly defected from his party to work for Ross Perot this year, before quitting in irritation that his advice wasn't taken. 
 "No decisions have been made" about the campaign staff, said Mr. Giuliani's spokesman, Ken Frydman. But friends of Mr. Giuliani confirmed that discussions had been held.
One stumbling block may be that Mr. Giuliani has also been flirting with another high-powered consultant, David Garth, the New York media expert. New York Republicans said the challenge would be sorting out and melding the talents and egos of all those who might be willing to work for Mr. Giuliani.
 
Dueling Parties
 Live in New York tomorrow night -- separated by 40-odd blocks -- two decidedly opinionated women may both be asking, "Can we talk?"
But no one is likely to confuse them.
"I plan to say that if you're waiting for Joan Rivers to come on, you're at the wrong party," said Ruth W. Messinger, Manhattan's Borough President, who will be holding her annual winter fund-raiser at the National Arts Club off Grammercy Park at the same time Ms. Rivers will be on stage at City Council President Andrew J. Stein's fund-raiser in the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center.
Mr. Stein is asking his guests to pay $1,000 for a cocktail buffet and entertainment by Ms. Rivers and the chanteuse Andrea Marcovicci. Ms. Messinger -- who has made no secret of her willingness to serve in Bill Clinton's Administration, or her hope to someday hold citywide office -- is asking her guests to bring a wrapped gift for a child in a homeless shelter, along with their $500 or $1,000 contribution. She is a strong supporter of Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Stein's mayoral rival, and there is little warmth between her and Mr. Stein. So did she schedule her party to give him a little competition?
"Actually, I set it up long before I knew when his was," she said.
 
Election Day Experiment?
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who threw away convention two years ago in running for governor as a third-party independent and who has marched to his own drummer on other issues since then, now wants elections in Connecticut to be held on Saturdays.
He raised the issue this week after State Senator Kevin P. Johnston, a Democrat from Putnam, resigned to take a job as a state auditor. Under law, the governor must call a special election within 10 days of a legislator's resignation, and the election is then held exactly 46 days after the election writ is issued.
Tradition has dictated that those writs be issued on a Friday, thus requiring a regular Tuesday vote. But Mr. Weicker said this week he may well sign the document on Tuesday, mandating a Saturday election in mid-January. Connecticut's constitution and statutes books require Tuesday elections for statewide votes and most municipal elections, but are silent on the rules for filling mid-term vacancies.
"For a long time I've believed that we as a nation should be voting on Saturdays and Sundays," Mr. Weicker said on Friday. "When we vote on weekdays, there are a lot of other things that have to go on -- there's many other endeavors that make it difficult to exercise the voting franchise," he said.
But the Governor said the economic realities of the recession might short-circuit what he called "my great experiment in democracy." Town officials in Mr. Johnston's district have said that opening and heating the schools on a Saturday, and paying overtime to all the people needed to run the election, would batter some local budgets.
"I don't know if it's going to be this election or not, but I'd like to go ahead and give it a test," Mr. Weicker said.

From Poverty to Pushcart to Pros

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
The shame of poverty kept his brothers under their sheets during those unbroken mornings. The feeling, if not overpowering, wasn't foreign to Tony Fernandez, either, as he prepared to step into the streets and the stench and the dreams of San Pedro de Macoris.
Fernandez would rise with his parents. His father, with his quick smile and the deliberate, hitched stride of a field worker, would leave for the distant acres of sugar cane. His mother, sterner than his father, would set before Fernandez the pathetic pushcart his older brothers scorned. 
 Fernandez would swallow his pride and head off to collect the vegetables, items his mother would then sell in the street that day.
"There is not too much of a secret to your story when you are 8 years old and pushing that thing through the streets," Fernandez said. "You are poor, and the embarrassment of that was great for my brothers. Me, I don't know why I didn't feel ashamed."
Fernandez was not a natural for heroism. At birth, he was given the nickname Cabeza, meaning head in Spanish, because his frail frame was dominated by a large bald head.
With age came epithets and he was later termed a tullido, a cripple, by some because of a knee disability. His father was overprotective; his mother adored him but clung to no illusions about his promise.
"We were in the kitchen one day, and my mother came in and told my dad to send all of us boys off to work," Fernandez said. "She said we'd never be anything. But my dad said, no, that he believed Cabeza would do something, be something."
Jose Fernandez, father of 11, his hands cracked in equal parts by age and effort, held his child's head in his hands and looked into his eyes.
"They have a saying in my culture that at a certain age you can see what a boy is going to become," Fernandez said. "My dad was 60 years old. He was aware of life. I don't know what he saw. But he could look in my eyes and see something, listen to my words and hear something. He said Cabeza would do it."
It turned out that there was little Cabeza wouldn't do with a bat or a glove. He played his way out of the barrio. He played so well that the Toronto Blue Jays ultimately told Alfredo Griffin, Fernandez's idol, to play for somebody else. He played in All-Star Games for the American and National leagues. And he will play for the Mets in 1993, having been acquired from San Diego in late October.
 
Playing Forever
 Fernandez will, he says, play on into his 30's, and perhaps one day he will play in a World Series.
That, though, won't be enough, and so his wife, Clara, has insured that Fernandez, 30 years old, will be able to play forever. She has designed a baseball field cut out of the mountains outside San Pedro. The field -- which is three-quarters finished -- is placed at the outer reaches of Fernandez's 50-acre farm of corn and sugar cane and it measures 320 feet down the left-field line, 365 to center, 310 to right.
"The infield reminds me of Shea Stadium," a smiling Fernandez said as he stared out over the project from the hilltop chapel that is also being built as part of the estate. "That's coincidence," he said of the field's evocations of Shea. "I'm a Christian man, you know. Coincidence is all I can attribute it to."
Coincidence has otherwise played an insubstantial role in Fernandez's life. Labor and desire have won out. It's a story with a lot of the recognizable surface facts -- the rise from poverty to athletic stardom, but there are also ancillary and untold tales, as well as a broad, stubborn subtext of disillusionment, confusion and hurt.
It's a history that Fernandez helped trace recently as he and his wife and three children drove from their home in Santo Domingo to their surreal spread in the mountains.
"People don't know me; I know I am right about that," Fernandez said. "And I'm probably the wrong guy to ask, too. I don't even know how to describe myself. I believe I have a strong will. I believe that my story in baseball has mostly been one of joy. I believe I overcame many obstacles."
 
Armed Guards
 The chief obstacle for those leaving Fernandez's house in Santo Domingo was unease, for the guard at the gate had an impressive pistol on his hip and he may or may not have been old enough to have a driver's license. He was one of any number of armed security men posted around the exclusive, although by no means opulent, neighborhood.
The celebrity enjoyed by major league baseball stars in the Dominican Republic is a mix of the bizarre and the poignant. There is the need for security and the presence of guns, but more memorably there are the moments of delicacy and respect.
No fewer than half a dozen attendants swarmed to check the appointments of Fernandez's jeep at the debris-dominated local gas station. The banter was wonderfully informal, the requests modest.
"Hats, they'd like a couple of hats," Fernandez said. "Hats, hats, hats."
The newspaper boy on the street, for whom every sale is a small fortune, wouldn't take money from Fernandez and pushed a copy of Listin Diario through the window. The barefoot vendor who worked the traffic light raced alongside the jeep for a block, breathlessly updating Fernandez on neighborhood news.
Fernandez made a right-hand turn and was soon staring at the Estadio Quisqueya. The stadium was built in 1955, and in 1986 Fernandez, already a starter for Toronto, hit .364 to win the winter league batting title.
There has been talk in Santo Domingo of poor attendance, the high cost of tickets to games, the increasing reluctance of Dominican superstars to play again in the winter league.
"I wish it could be the same as before, but it won't ever be," Fernandez said. "People want you to play. People miss us. I understand their feelings. It's hard to explain, but there has been too much baseball for me to play. I haven't in five years. I'll do it again, though, before I retire. I promised them that."
The 90-minute drive to San Pedro was epic in its range of experience. Dead dogs were scattered along the seaside highway. Unclothed children barely out of infancy roamed the road's shoulders. Police officials randomly stopped cars and arbitrarily exacted instantly invented fines.
 
Flashbacks
 Fernandez was largely unmoved. It was not insensitivity. It was familiarity. But there were occasions when memory shattered his detachment, and when Fernandez's jeep skirted the Dario Contreras in Santo Domingo it was impossible for the 30-year-old shortstop not to flash back to his stay in that hospital as a 14-year-old.
Fernandez's mother, Andrea, had made her way from San Pedro to Santo Domingo at least twice a week for more than a month to plead for her son's admission to an overcrowded public hospital, imploring someone to attend to his gimpy right knee.
"She begged and begged, one doctor in particular," Fernandez said. "In the end, he had a little compassion. He told her one day to go get me."
He remained at the hospital for six weeks. Fernandez, forced to share a bed with another boy -- "There was no disease and so there was no reason for us each to have a bed, they said," -- had surgery to remove bone chips.
"My mother was not too pleased with the game of baseball," Fernandez said.
Cresting the bridge that leads to San Pedro, Fernandez's jeep encounters the wall of heat and odor that circles the city. It is a city of churches and smiles, merengue and misery and baseball. Fernandez swung past the Estadio Tetelo Vargas and slowed but did not stop.
Later, he spoke about his childhood adventures in the stadium, his hands covering his eyes. Fernandez was not crying, but he was once more feeling the force of an early and obviously enduring passion.
The mental pictures of himself are powerful: an ill-proportioned child laughing and snatching major leaguer Ray Knight's glove to take grounders; a young boy banished to right field by his own disdainful brothers; an adolescent, whose evolving elegance was undeniable, blossoming amid the tutelage and belief of Epy Guerrero, the Toronto scout who would sign him. The most modest desires of those days are the ones that still ache in the heart.
 
Playing for Love
 "Thinking about the uniforms of those players in that stadium was enough for me then," Fernandez said. "To have a uniform like theirs was all I wanted."
"A lot of writers say that we played to get out of poverty," Fernandez said. "But that's not the only reason or even the main one. The kids I saw in the street today, are they playing because they think they are going to make money? Come on. They are playing because they love the game. They are playing to have fun.
"My mother didn't even believe professional baseball was for real for me when I was signed. It was not until I had the actual money. I put 3,500 pesos on her bed at last. 'Here it is,' I said. 'I'm a professional ballplayer.' "
Fernandez is certifiably among the most accomplished to come out of his country, a land that has produced Juan Marichal, the Alou brothers and generation after generation of quality shortstops, from Griffin to Nelson Norman to Julio Franco, to the emerging kids like Jose Offerman and Andujar Cedeno.
But for all the numerical wonders -- a .322 average in 1987, a career fielding percentage of .980, the 17 triples in 1990 -- there has been a persistent cloud of disappointment.
Fernandez's father died in 1982 before he had played in the majors and his mother died within two years of his breakthrough. Fernandez broke his elbow in the September stretch in 1987 when the Tigers overcame the Blue Jays for the title, and there have been injuries to his knees, thumb and face, too.
His experience in Toronto soured, and Fernandez, forced to combat the dual stereotypes of Latin ballplayers and Christian athletes, retreated into a cultivated, theoretically more secure, remoteness.
His time in San Diego was disfigured by player standoffs with the manager and it was ended by a terribly lopsided trade to the Mets that was dictated by economics. The Padres had decided to reduce their payroll; Fernandez and his $2.3 million salary were auctioned to the Mets.
"Latin players have been misunderstood, made out to be moody, hostile, lazy, erratic," Fernandez said. "We are an emotional people. But we are honest and sincere, and the difficulty of the change in cultures has just never ever been fully accepted and appreciated.
"Of course it all still hurts. But not as much as it used to."
As Fernandez surveyed his "farm" in the mountains, there was, to be sure, nothing to wince at except the blaze of the sinking sun.
Altitude brought relief from the suffocating conditions in San Pedro. A horse grazed in left field. A river rumbled in the distance. His three sons sprinted toward the horizon.
"We lost a bond in our family when my parents died," Fernandez said. "I want that bond back and I thought baseball could do it. That field out there, where I can play with my sons and again with my brothers and sisters and their children, that's as close as I can come to an answer."
Cabeza looked once more before turning back to the house.
"I didn't imagine those mornings with the pushcart," he said.

Red Sox and Dodgers Are Desperate to Add Punch to Lineups

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Don't tell the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers that pitching is 75 percent of the game, or 90 percent, or whatever Connie Mack proclaimed many decades before the 1992 Red Sox and Dodgers proved a team has to hit home runs and score runs occasionally to win games.
Because they didn't hit home runs and score runs, the Red Sox finished last for the first time in 30 years and the Dodgers finished last for the first time since 1905, when Connie Mack was in only the fifth year of his 50-year tenure as manager of the Philadelphia Athletics. 
 Lou Gorman, the Red Sox general manager, and Fred Claire, the Dodger general manager, have emerged from the devastation of the last season and have brushed the debris from their shoulders.
"I've been busy up to my ears," Gorman said before departing for the winter meetings in Louisville, Ky., where he and Claire will intensify their reclamation efforts. "I hope to get a bat with some pop in it to impact us offensively. We need someone to drive in some runs and generate our offense."
Gorman has explored the possibility of signing Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire or Joe Carter, and he plans to talk with Ruben Sierra's agent, too. He also had a fling with Kirby Puckett before Puckett returned to the Minnesota Twins. These players have been the most attractive run producers available as free agents. The Red Sox are prepared to pay dearly for one of them because they paid dearly for their lack of offense last season.
"It was an unbelievable year," Gorman said, "a year in which we lost Carlos Quintana before the season opened. Ellis Burks was out pretty much from the All-Star break. We lost Mike Greenwell at the end of May for the rest of the year. Wade Boggs hit 85 points below his career average. Jody Reed hit 41 points below his career average, and Jack Clark didn't hit one home run at Fenway all year. That all added up to no offense."
The Red Sox generated so little offense that they could have joined Clark in filing for bankruptcy. From the perennial .300 hitter Boggs, they got a .259 average, and from Clark, Greenwell and Burks they received a collective 15 home runs and 81 runs batted in.
 
No Support for Pitchers
 As a result, the Red Sox squandered a strong effort from their pitching staff, which placed second in the league with a 3.58 earned run average, second in complete games with 22, second in fewest home runs allowed by only one with 107 and third in strikeouts with 943.
The Red Sox traded their No. 1 reliever, Jeff Reardon, to Atlanta, so Gorman is looking for a replacement. He signed infielder Scott Fletcher as a free agent last week after losing second baseman Reed in the expansion draft.
Reed, who will be replaced by Fletcher or Tim Naehring, wound up with the Dodgers, filling one of the needs Claire identified after the Dodgers' disastrous season. The general manager also felt the need for improvement at third base, in left field and in the bullpen closer's role.
Obviously, those same glamorous free agents, most of whom play or could play left, have been available to the Dodgers, who last season finished last in the league in home runs and runs scored.
"If one was going to be in the free-agent market in a big way, it was going to be in a big, big way with premium players," Claire said. "But our focus wasn't in that type of investment. We wanted to see if we could work something out with Eric Davis."
 
Injuries Curb Performance
 Once upon a time, Davis was classified with the Bondses, Pucketts and Carters. But an injury-prone body and a classic case of underachievement has rendered him one of the major disappointments in years. In 1992, Davis, whom the Dodgers acquired from Cincinnati a year ago, batted .228, hit 5 home runs and drove in 32 runs in 76 games.
Surgery was performed on his left hand, wrist and shoulder. The Dodgers nevertheless signed him as a free agent, giving him a $1 million salary and the chance to earn an additional $1 million, based on payment of $5,494.51 every day he is on the active roster.
"Eric will be our left fielder," Claire said. "I have been asked if we are concerned with a player coming off surgery? Of course. You can't run from that. But Eric has worked very hard."
As he headed for Louisville, Claire was looking for a third baseman and a relief pitcher. Yesterday, the Dodgers signed Cory Snyder to a $3 million, two-year contract and re-signed Roger McDowell to a two-year, $3 million contract.
Snyder, 31, hit .269 last season for the Giants with 14 home runs and 57 r.b.i. He played five positions: all three outfield spots, first base and third base.
"I know they need a third baseman," Snyder said of the Dodgers yesterday. "I'd like to start with that. I'm versatile. I'm not sure what's going to happen."
McDowell, 32 later this month, was 6-10 with 14 saves and a 4.09 e.r.a. last season. He pitched in 65 games, and opponents batted .306 against him.
On Friday, the Dodgers re-signed outfielder Mitch Webster to a two-year deal worth $1.2 million.
The Dodgers had one of the largest payrolls in the major leagues this year, nearly $40 million, but Claire said the team had "redefined where we think our payroll should be: it's coming down."
 
Trading at a Standstill
 The flurry of trades that cascaded out of the expansion draft last month might have to hold the tradeniks for a while. Barring a sudden outbreak of meetings between general managers, this week's Louisville gathering doesn't promise to produce many player swaps.
"I can't get anyone interested in trades," Lee Thomas, the Philadelphia general manager, said. "They're all worried about free agents. A lot of clubs have said let's talk at the winter meetings, but I think until the free-agent thing settles, not much will happen."
Thomas's view was echoed by many other general managers.
"I haven't had a chance to talk to anyone about trades," Larry Himes of the Chicago Cubs said.
"I've been trying to trade, but everybody is talking about free agents," Dan Duquette of Montreal said.
Herk Robinson of Kansas City said he hadn't heard much trade talk.
"Too many free agents out there and not enough have signed to allow your attention to be turned to that as much as you'd like," said Robinson, who is waiting for word from Joe Carter on whether he wants to play for the Royals or stay with Toronto.
John Schuerholz of Atlanta says the trend in recent years has been toward free-agent domination of the week of the meetings.
"The agents inundate the lobbies of the hotel and take up your time," Schuerholz lamented. "You go through the smorgasbord of free agents. That's what the winter meetings have become."
 
No End to Giveaways
 The executive board of the Players Association met in Boca Raton, Fla., last week, and the players and union officials were treated daily to high-priced entertainment from the owners. After months of doom-and-gloom talk about the game's economy, clubs could hardly contain themselves, shoving lucrative contracts and offers at free agents faster than the players and their agents could read them or sign them.
Five pitchers signed contracts that guarantee their salary for four years. A sixth, Greg Maddux, was offered so much money by the Yankees, slightly more than $34 million for five years, that the deal would average nearly $1.5 million more per year than the next-highest-paid pitcher.
The Minnesota Twins signed Kirby Puckett to a $30 million contract before someone else could sign him for $35 million. The Yankees offered Barry Bonds slightly more than $36 million for five years, and it was apparent that someone else was willing to sign him for even more money.
The Yankees gave Spike Owen, a journeyman shortstop with limited range and a below-average arm, $7 million for three years.
Change the system, cry the owners? Why should the players want to change the system?
 
Newcomers Take the Plunge
 Besides the continued spending, this free-agent market is noteworthy for the new teams that have plunged into it. That's right; clubs that have not played the market much previously are playing big time. The Seattle Mariners have signed Chris Bosio to one of those four-year contracts, and the Houston Astros have signed a pair of pitchers to them, Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell.
"We indicated when Drayton McLane bought the ball club, the next logical step for us would be a re-entry into the free agent market," Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, said. "Last year we dabbled around the edges. Now we're at a point where we need to be aggressive to improve the ball club."

HEADLINE: On AIDS, Let's Keep the Issue Clear

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was disappointed in the attempt to plead the case for an increase in funding for AIDS research based on economic considerations ("Financing to Meet AIDS's True Costs," Viewpoints, Nov. 22). AIDS research should be expanded for a host of reasons, the strongest among them that immune system technology should be the core of all disease research, with predictable benefits in the form of clues to virtually every other antigen, including those that would fight cancer. 
 Presenting the economic case provides easy fodder for the short-sighted; increased funding runs the risk of being shot down by merely countering these weak and even fallacious arguments.
For example, the article argues that 51,000 AIDS deaths in 1992 will result in a loss of $15 billion to $20 billion in Federal and state tax revenue. If revenue is an issue at all, that revenue could be easily replaced by expanding the oversubscribed State Department immigration lottery, bringing in replacements in the form of the brightest and the best from overseas.
And the article implies that cancer and heart disease funding would be better spent on AIDS because those diseases "strike older Americans primarily," while AIDS afflicts the young. But cancer and heart disease generally take their victims at the prime of life, canceling enormous investments in education and life experience. They kill people at the peak of their earning and contribution potential. The economic loss is astronomical and measurable. As any insurance underwriter will tell you, in dollars and cents, the young just aren't worth much.
It is shaky ground when you try to argue the spiritual in physical terms. Let's argue the expansion of AIDS research based on the need to alleviate human suffering. Let's avoid offering easily refuted logic that can serve to confuse those whom you would hope to convince.

HEADLINE: Ex-Communist Countries Look to U.S. Cities

 BODY:
When the former Communist countries of the old Soviet bloc seek advice on capitalism, they look not just to financial centers like New York and Chicago. More and more, former Soviet republics and other Eastern European countries are turning to smaller post-industrial American cities, like Baltimore and Pittsburgh, for economic advice and intellectual exchange.
"Old industrial societies of the West have faced the same environmental and economic problems Russia now faces," said Blair A. Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in Washington. "Russians see difficulties and need desperately to talk to people who have faced these issues on a similar scale." 
 The mid-sized American cities are eager to develop these relationships, hoping that they will pay off in academic and business relationships once capitalism starts rolling in the former Communist lands.
 
A Visit to Baltimore
 St. Petersburg recently sent a delegation to Baltimore to learn how it had turned its gloomy industrial waterfront into a vibrant tourist and commercial center.
It may seem odd that the most majestic city of the former Soviet Union would be taking cultural cues from an American city known for baseball, crabcakes and the Babe Ruth house. But the guidance they seek, St. Peterburg's leaders say, is in planning, and Baltimore is reaching out to them.
"Baltimore is the first American city that has taken an interest in St. Petersburg, and we are so thankful for them," said Boris Nikolashchenko, the Russian city's planning chief, who took part in the visit. "We find that our city has a lot in common with them, not really in appearance, but spiritually."
There are similarities in the cities' histories. Baltimore, which was in decline in the 1960's, managed to pull itself out of the red by matching federal and state funds with local business investment in the region.
A private-sector bailout greatly interests St. Petersburg, whose woes include public housing problems, a dismantled arms industry that left many unemployed, pollution and second-banana status to Moscow, which contributes to the shortage of public funds.
 
Ties With Hungarian City
 The University of West Virginia in Morgantown has established links with Pecs, a city in Hungary. Pecs, like Morgantown, is in the heart of a slowly fading coal-mining region scrambling to rebuild its economy, said Andrew Isserman, director of the regional research institute at the university.
"There is an incredible bond among coal miners in the world, and that translates into the relationship between these two cities," he said. "Hungarians are concerned about what they are going to do, now that their coal is not competitive on world markets. We in Morgantown have been very successful in developing new industry for the labor that once worked in coal mining."
Pittsburgh is working with cities in Siberia for similar reasons. The University of Pittsburgh has had several exchanges with the Center for Urban and Social Research in Novosibirsk, through which professors, business people and students have gotten together to exchange ideas on everything from art and literature to steel.
"Both of our towns are based on heavy industry and resource extraction," said Ronald H. Linden, director for the Center for Russian and East European Studies at the university.
"They are looking at Pittsburgh to see how we have adjusted to the decline of industry in our region," he said. "We have experience in dealing with the decline of manual labor and the growing need for intellectual labor. We know how to construct a tax base. These are the kinds of issues that Russia has never had to deal with."
 
Warmth at Universities
 American universities are eager to exchange students and professors and eventually perhaps to foster business relationships between cities. "The long-term payoff is that Siberia will soon be an important region," Mr. Linden said. "This interaction affords us access to influential people."

HEADLINE: FOR GIVERS AND RECEIVERS, CHANGING LIVE WITH NEEDIEST FUND;
In Time of Growing Need, Harsh Attitudes Grow Softer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The cycle seems to be turning. Slowly perhaps, but turning. Images of self indulgence so flagrantly flaunted for so long are blushingly turning more sedate. Stretch limousines seem less obvious and less stretched, perhaps as budgets become more so. And charitable organizations are reporting increases in the numbers of volunteers as well as requests.
As it does every few years, the relationship of the contented "us" to the unfortunate "them" is changing, drawing closer. Compared with a few years ago, people now seem less inclined to take full credit for their own good luck and are not quite as ready as they used to be to blame the down-and-out for their poverty. Denial is giving way to compassion and the idea seems to be growing that to a greater degree than we believed, we really are all in this together. 
 From tenement days in Manhattan's Five Points 150 years ago, different stereotypes at various times have taken hold to establish a precise distance that the lucky and well-to-do want to maintain between themselves and the disposessed. There have been the deserving poor, undeserving poor, religious ideas of predestination, Darwinian images of workhouse rigors, Horatio Alger's optimistic waifs, huddled masses, greenhorns, exploited sweatshop workers, labor agitators, rabble, lumpen, Bowery bums, derelicts, and most recently, the homeless.
During the 80's when many were prospering in plain view some others declined and a few even sank beyond general awareness as the fortunate were not only turning away from the suffering of others but were out to banish tragedy from their lives -- as if that could be done simply by working out or going on a diet. Now, as the recession claims more in the mainstream, and as the election campaign leaves exposed veins of need and anxiety among neighbors and relatives, the comforts of denial are more difficult to sustain. Tragedy, we are learning once again, is universal, as unavoidable as loved ones dying. It is a lesson that has often brought people together.
It may be that the current trend toward greater fraternity, if that's what it is, developed because there simply was nowhere else to go. It may also be explained by how rapidly and broadly misfortune has spread. No longer can the crazed, the dirty, the scabrous, and the addicted who live as our neighbors on our streets be regarded as rare aberrations in a land where social mobility was long assumed to go only upwards. There are too many of them for that.
David Jones, the executive director of the Community Service Society of New York, an agency supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, is one of those who have noticed the change in public attitues. "I am getting more and more calls from people who are expressing interest in doing volunteer work for the first time," he said, adding that he thought the period was over when people concentrated on their careers to the exclusion of other pursuits.
"I am starting to see a trickle of people who are talking about volunteering," he said. "For the first time I'm seeing younger people who are still early in their careers who are engaging in all sorts of discussion about social welfare and poverty. I think there is a shift."
As of three months ago, the number of people receiving some form of public assistance in New York had risen above 1 million, to 1,018,302. It was a 9.4 percent increase over a year earlier. With numbers like that comes a growing awareness that bad luck and hard times do not settle exclusively or even primarily on those whose appearance and behavior at times strains or impedes empathy.
In this season, when both good intentions and cries for help rise, the Neediest Fund stands ready to match those who give with those who need, establishing another of those ties that binds this city in community. Like the reservoirs upstate it preserves and enhances life by collecting and distributing.
These days entire epidemics of bad luck are raging. Who by now has not met or heard of someone infected with H.I.V.? Or known someone dead of AIDS? Who has not had acquaintances who lost jobs? Who has not learned of friends or children of friends who, after finishing college, or even graduate school, have not found jobs that would allow them to pay back their educational loans? Who has not heard about or seen men and women who put on fraying clothes to salvage some pride as they eat regularly in charitable soup kitchens. And who has not established eye contact, often on a daily basis, with the more troubled homeless as they hold to their neighborhood routes like mailmen?
And, of course, beyond such more or less familiar tragedies loom particuliar misfortunes: homes and hopes destroyed by fires, households smashed by various addictions, people victimized by crime, by discrimination, and a resurgence of tuberculosis preying on the weak.
Despair tends to be particular. It is custom-made like the revulsion and confusion felt by Angela, the 24-year-old mother who lashed out violently at her 3-year-old child. Fortunately, there came a moment when she realized she needed help, and fortunately, she was able to find it when she approached the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, another agency supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. With the help of a social worker there, she has found the source of her rage and the abuse has abated. Her life and that of her child are better.
Sometimes relatively small things can loom as major obstacles when there is no place to turn. For Angelique James, it was a business suit, a blouse and dress. Without them she could not attend a career program sponsored by the Children's Aid Society that would enable her to gain the most from her almost-completed college education. The money was supplied by the Neediest Cases Fund, and prospects for Ms. James, as well as dozens of other potential job applciants, brightened.
And sometimes even a quick fix can be a lifesaver in rough seas. For a while, Vince H. thought he would be swamped. Having been laid off, he fell behind in rent and faced eviction. But with help from anohter program aided by the Neediest Cases Fund, Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, Vince H. was able to pay the back rent. His anxieties diminished, he was able to find a job. The storm subsided.
Despite the fluctuations in attitudes, through recessions, depressions and periods of prosperity, there has in the last 80 years been at least one area where impulses of empathy and charity have increased regularly. Ever since 1911, when Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, started the first of what have been annual appeals to help the Neediest Cases, responses have grown with each year.
In that first year when funds were solicited with the headline: "Santa Clause, Please Take Notice," 117 contributors gave $3,630.88. The campaign last year was the most successful ever, with 16,415 people giving $5,083,550.81. Among the contributions was a marked increase in the numbers of modest donations, reflecting gifts from people of moderate or limited means.
All of this suggests that compassion is on the rise and that perhaps we may be entering a time of greater fraternity. One can hope.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION: The Economic Team;
CHOICE OF BENTSEN IS CALLED A SIGNAL OF NEW TEAMWORK

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton picked Senator Lloyd Bentsen to be his Treasury Secretary to send the political signal that the deadlock between the White House and Congress is over and to assure the financial markets of a calm, steady hand on the nation's economic levers, Clinton advisers said today.
But the advisers, here and in Arkansas, also said the Texas Senator's selection and the fact that the top candidates for the directorship of the Office of Management and Budget also come from Congress indicated how, after 12 years of Republican Presidents, Congress is the only realistic place to turn for experts who have dealt with pivotal matters like taxes and the budget deficit. 
 The President-elect apparently set aside concerns that Mr. Bentsen might be more valuable in his current post as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and that Republicans might win his Senate seat in Texas in a special election next spring.
 
Announcements in Midweek
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said today that if he replaced Mr. Bentsen as finance chairman, as he expected, his most important priority would be "to get the President's agenda through."
Mr. Clinton is expected to announce his choice of Mr. Bentsen officially on Wednesday or Thursday after returning to Little Rock, Ark., from a two-day trip to Chicago and Washington.
Clinton staff members said that the selections for some other top economic posts would probably be announced then as well, but that the need to complete background checks might delay some announcements.
Roger Altman, a Wall Street investment banker who was a student at Georgetown University with Mr. Clinton in the 1960's, is in line to be Deputy Treasury Secretary, the staff assistants said.
The top candidates to be budget director, probably the second most important economic post after Treasury Secretary, are said to be Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Alice M. Rivlin, the first director of the Congressional Budget Office, who is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.
Ms. Rivlin was the early betting favorite, partly because of Mr. Clinton's determination to have women in top positions in his Administration. But an associate of Mr. Clinton said the President-elect's thinking began to change after he read Ms. Rivlin's new book and interviewed Mr. Panetta. The Congressman is now said to be the more likely choice.
In her book, "Reviving the American Dream" (The Brookings Institution), Ms. Rivlin argues for a huge shift away from Washington and to the state capitals of programs like job training and public works that are intended to foster economic development. That is a sharp contrast to Mr. Clinton's position that his foremost responsibility as President is to promote economic growth and job creation.
On the other hand, Mr. Panetta, a legislator with moderate political views and a firm grasp of the budget, was said to have made a strong impression on the President-elect during their interview last week.
Mr. Panetta would not take reporters' calls today. But in a recent interview, before the prospects of his joining the Administration became apparent, he argued that the new President should move quickly to win Congressional approval of a five-year plan to cut the Federal budget deficit in half. That squares almost precisely with Mr. Clinton's stand during the campaign.
 
'An Institutional Memory'
 In selecting Mr. Bentsen, who is 71 years old, Mr. Clinton turned to a veteran lawmaker whose steady temperament and statesmanlike presence became nationally known in 1988 when he was the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate.
A Clinton adviser said Mr. Bentsen's main asset in the President-elect's eyes was his "deep knowledge of Congress."
"The issue of overcoming gridlock is fundamental to the success of his Presidency, both substantivally and politically," the adviser said.
Another Senator who has talked with Mr. Clinton about economic appointments characterized Mr. Bentsen this way: "He has an absolute familiarity with all the issues on the table. He has an institutional memory for all the economic decisions, good and bad, in the last generation. He knows taxes. And he has the credentials for fiscal responsibility."
But this Senator and others said one of Mr. Bentsen's strongest suits was that with his lanky stature, white hair and soothing voice he looked and sounded like a Treasury Secretary.
Two others under consideration for the position, Mr. Altman, who is 46, and Robert E. Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, who is 54, look young for their ages, and that was said to be detrimental.
Two others who had been on the list for Treasury Secretary, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation in New York, were thought to be unlikely to subordinate their own strong philosophies and ideas to the new President's, Clinton advisers said.
Although Mr. Bentsen has normally voted with the mainstream of his party, he is probably somewhat more conservative than most other Democratic lawmakers and more oriented toward the views of business.
As chairman of the Finance Committee, he has been a strong supporter of tax breaks for real estate interests and oil and gas producers, and he has advocated more favorable tax treatment of savings by affluent taxpayers.
The Finance Committee also has jurisdiction over such crucial issues facing the new Administration as Social Security, health policy, trade and welfare, and Mr. Bentsen has mastered those topics like few other lawmakers.
Nonetheless, Mr. Bentsen and the others Mr. Clinton picks for economic positions may have only limited influence in developing policy.
Mr. Clinton took such detailed stands on these matters in his campaign that the main responsibility of the Cabinet members and others will be as implementors and lobbyists with Congress.
Though it was bitterly cold this morning in Little Rock, Mr. Clinton emerged from the Governor's Mansion to drive his daughter, Chelsea, to a school outing, and then he jogged and went for a round of golf in the rain and sleet.
At the end of his jog, he stopped at a McDonald's downtown and was asked by reporters about the selection of Mr. Bentsen. "I never discuss appointments until I make them," he said with a chuckle. "Next week, you'll know."
Asked about the possibility of an international crisis interfering with his domestic programs, he said: "It's just part of the job. I can't control it. We're living in a time of instability. The United States has responsibilities there, too; we can't shirk them."
 
Other Possibilities
 Mr. Rubin, a major Democratic fund-raiser with a reputation as a good manager, is a leading candidate to head the Economic Security Council, the White House office Mr. Clinton intends to set up to parallel the National Security Council, which helps the President make foreign policy.
Robert B. Reich, director of the economic policy transition team, is another possibility for that post. Mr. Reich is said to prefer a spot where he could be a strong advocate for his own views rather than having to spend much of his time analyzing the views of others. He would probably prefer being chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
But Mr. Reich (pronounced REISH) is a lawyer, not an economist, and to make him chief economic adviser would be, to some minds, like putting an economist on the Supreme Court.
Some people here who follow these matters closely but have no inside information think that Mr. Reich might be named Commerce Secretary and that, with Mr. Panetta as budget director, Ms. Rivlin, who has a strong reputation as a professional economist, might be named chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to have a woman in a top economics slot.
Another person under consideration to be the chief economics adviser is Lawrence H. Summers. Mr. Summers, who is now working on the transition, is on leave from his position as chief economist at the World Bank, a post he took after going on leave from his tenured position on the economics faculty at Harvard University.
At age 38, he has an incomparable pedigree. His father, Robert Summers, and his mother, Anita Arrow Summers, are both widely published economists. Two of his uncles, Paul A. Samuelson and Kenneth J. Arrow, have won the Noble Prize in economics.
 
Back Home in Texas
 Senator Bentsen's new position would open the way for what politicians in both parties expect to be a bloody campaign to fill his Senate seat.
The history of Texas politics is that once someone gets into the Senate, it is difficult to dislodge them. But Gov. Ann W. Richards, a Democrat, is said to have warned the Clinton staff that Democrats could have a tough time holding Mr. Bentsen's seat. The other Texas Senator, Phil Gramm, is a Republican, and President Bush carried the state in the November election.
The primaries could be as early as March, with the general election in May.
One possibility was that Governor Richards would name former Mayor Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio to fill the seat until the election, possibly giving him a campaign advantage. But Mr. Cisneros, one of the nation's most prominent Hispanic politicians, may also be in line for a spot in the Clinton Administration.
On Wall Street, the choice of Mr. Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary was mostly applauded. Many senior executives from the financial industry said in interviews that they were comfortable with his politics and personality and had developed a close working relationship with him over the years.
"Bentsen has clearly gained the respect of the business community in the Senate," said Donald Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, "and I think he is basically a solid choice. The markets are more comfortable with known quantities than unknown quantities, and Bentsen is a known quantity."

HEADLINE: Mixed Blessings Seen In Student-Loan Rules

BYLINE: By States News Service

 BODY:
WHEN Federal lawmakers revamped aid programs to help pay college bills, they increased eligibility for grants and loans. Next month a loan that does not require students to prove need will be available, and in July the Government will stop considering the value of a family's house when determining need.
That sounds like good news, particularly for high school seniors from the middle class, students, who are frequently left out of financial aid. Aid counselors often assume that parents can borrow on their home equity, which often bars children of middle-class homeowners from obtaining assistance. 
 "The home equity came from two things," said Sarah Flanagan, an aide to the Senate education subcommittee that helped draft the changes to the Higher Education Act. "At the very basic level, families should not have to put up their home for a college education.
"In a very specific sense it was put in because of increasingly fluctuating home and farm values, particularly on both coasts and the Northeast. Home prices tripled in some areas. Eligibility was fluctuating on the real-estate market."
But some counselors on Long Island said they were concerned that the changes were not necessarily improvements.
 
Decrease in Grants, Rise in Loans
 "The supposed goal of Congressional reauthorization and the changes was to increase grants for students and decrease student borrowing," said Larry Seligman, associate director of financial aid at the New York Institute of Technology. "What they ended up with will decrease grants and increase student borrowing."
The new loan allows first-year students to borrow up to $2,625 and others to borrow up to $4,000 a year at an interest rate of 6.94 percent. The interest rate for subsequent years is capped at 9 percent overall.
But unlike other Government-guaranteed loans, students have to start paying back the interest right away,or they can to wait until after graduation to begin payments, a strategy that ends up costing much more in the long run. Under the new system, unpaid monthly interest payments are added to the balance, and subsequent interest payments are calculated on the new total, substantially increasing the amount of the loan.
"Even though it's a good thing on its face, in the long run we're giving them quite a burden to bear when they graduate," said Jacqueline Pascariello, associate director of financial aid at the State University at Stony Brook. "Is it good to have a student graduating from a state university owing between $13,000 and $15,000? No matter how much you counsel them, they have no idea what that really means."
Many private institutions say they are continuing to require the home-equity information or are going to start requiring it.
"We plan to still use the home value," said Jean Belmont, director of financial and academic records at Hofstra University. "If you take two parents who are both 45 and make $35,000, and one lives in an apartment and has no assets and the other has a $500,000 house -- because our assets are limited we would need that information."
The guidance director at Garden City High School, Irvin Faust, said the provision was highly controversial. He said: "I can only tell you after talking with them that the colleges independently will factor in the home equity. My guess is almost all of them will do it."
Not enough money has been allocated for the increased demand that could stem from the change, some counselors said. Congress authorized $2 billion more for the fiscal year that began in October, up from $11.7 billion last year, for the program.
But borrowing limits may be lower. Students last year could borrow up to $2,400 under the Pell Grants, the biggest Government-aid program, that has been trimmed to $2,300.
The Education Department has not estimated how many more students will seek aid, but counselors estimate that requests could jump as much as 50 percent. Last year, 5.1 million students received loans, according to the department.
"It sounds wonderful depending on how they sell it to the public, but I don't know where all this money is going to come from," said Joanne Graziano, director of financial aid at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University.
Some counselors are more positive. The executive director of the National Association of School Financial Aid Administrators, Dallas Martin, said although his group was not in favor of removing the home-equity provision, "simply because we knew there was not enough money to serve all the students that apply," it did support the new loan. He added:
"As I go out and do college-aid talks, I'm hearing from middle-class families, 'I don't want student aid, I just want a loan.' It will provide some needed help to a lot of them having cash-flow problems. I personally was glad to see Congress address that group of families."
High school guidance counselors are dealing with problems like parents who are jittery because financial aid forms that usually arrive in mid-November will not be available until the middle of this month, at the earliest. "We think it's a mess from my standpoint," Mr. Faust said. "A lot of this is still unofficial in that we have not received any of the materials. It's making kids and parents a little itchy."

HEADLINE: Where to Place Blame For Latin Misery

 BODY:
"Immigrants Grab a Toehold of American Dream" [Nov. 15] is one of a series of reports the Long Island Weekly has written concerning illegal aliens on Long Island. We are told of their poverty and working two or more jobs or of being unemployed. We are told Some cannot go on welfare, and most are exploited by Long Island businesses and landlords. We are told that many came from El Salvador, fleeing from war. We are told of our obligations and the illegal aliens' rights to medical care and education. 
 What we are not told of is these people's responsibilities. We are not told how they came to this country knowing they were entering illegally. We are not told that having a fake Social Security card is a crime. We are not told of many illegals who have jobs, are paid in cash and pay no taxes. We are not told how much it costs us in taxes to pay welfare for these people, how much for special education and bilingual teachers. We are not told how hospitals must provide medical care for free and how they shift those costs to those of us with insurance. We are not told that the wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua have ended long ago.
We are not told that the United States admits more legal immigrants than any other country, of those who wait years to legally come to this country. Why do American citizens, who joyfully help those who come here legally, have obligations to those who have criminally entered this country? We citizens must say enough. Our resources are not limitless. We must demand rights of our own; rights to secure borders; rights to end exploitation of these illegals in jobs, which, in turn, causes depressed wages for United States citizens, the right to not pay for people who come here against our laws.

HEADLINE: Where to Place Blame For Latin Misery

 BODY:
While I am sympathetic to the struggling largely El Salvadoran immigrants, it should be apparent by now that most of them are not political refugees, but rather victims of an economic and social order that has long abandoned them, and they're here more or less permanently. 
 El Salvadorans I've met through my family, and as exemplified by the recent election in El Salvador, are politically conservative and condemn, almost without exception, the leftist insurrection.
One of my biggest surprises and learning experiences was that my El Salvadoran in-laws did not see the guerrilla movement as a response to social and political injustice, but more as an anarchistic power struggle fueled by the Russians and Cubans. This, believe it or not, is mainstream El Salvadoran thinking, regardless of what the refugee activists in this country claim.
The injustice in El Salvador and in much of Latin America predates the influence of the United States and should be viewed as a legacy of the brutal Spanish conquest of the Indians, with reverberations that continue to this day.
The political culture and the despotic leaders, with their juntas, that sprang from this culture deserve the blame for a situation that resulted in one of the largest waves of immigration to the U.S. in history -- not the United States -- as some still insist on having us believe. Add to that severe overpopulation and the revolution of rising expectations.
El Salvadorans and other illegal aliens have filled jobs throughout the 80's and until now that most Americans do not want. The welfare system is responsible for taking a lot of people out of the work force, creating a need to fill jobs at an undesirable wage. The Salvadorans, in fact, met a very strong need created by an expanding economy and our welfare system. At the same time, they have placed additional demands on our already overtaxed school system.

Boogying With the Romper Room Set

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE

 BODY:
Mother Goose now raps her rhymes and, in keeping with a hipper image, calls herself Mama Goose. Thanks to Little Richard, Old MacDonald and his farm animals have soul. Raffi is celebrating mankind's power to preserve the earth's beauty; Alvin and the Chipmunks are crooning country, and Cedella Marley-Booker, Bob Marley's mother, is telling stories to reggae and calypso rhythms.
Both in content -- and in competitiveness -- children's music is not what it used to be. 
 With an eye toward adults eager to pass on their musical tastes to their children, record companies in recent years have been offering music that can appeal to everyone from infants to grown-ups. Record and specialty shops that used to carry only a limited selection of children's music are now crowded with classical and Cajun music, reggae, jazz and blues aimed at youngsters.
Issues like divorce, racism and child abuse are also turning up on children's albums. On the critically acclaimed "Pluggin' Away," Peter Alsop explains to children that hugging people who have AIDS is fine but touching their blood must be avoided. Dan Crow discusses children with disabilities on the song "Walking on My Wheels," on his latest album, "A Friend, a Laugh, a Walk in the Woods."
To be sure, there is "an awful lot of cutsie stuff out there that is saccharine sweet or preachy or written for children as if they are a separate species," says Joanne Oppenheim, who publishes a quarterly guide and review of children's media. But while still often sweet-natured, today's music is increasingly less saccharine. And silliness and predictability are making room for sophistication and wit to please children in the 90's.
"If the songs are too teachy or preachy or insipid and candylike, forget it," says Dave Lovald, sales manager at Silo-Alcazar of Waterbury, Vt., one of the largest independent distributors of children's music.
Until recently, music intended specifically for young listeners was the province of two big companies, Walt Disney and A&M Records, and roughly 200 small independent record labels, many of which operated out of performers' homes or the trunks of their cars. But beginning two years ago, major entertainment conglomerates began to revitalize children's music divisions or started up new ones, lured in part by the success of the independents and the huge popularity of the Canadian folk singer Raffi. They had seen the steady growth in births among baby boomers, which took a big leap a couple of years ago, suggesting that the time was right for expansion into the children's field. Sony created Sony Kids' Music, and the Bertelsmann Music Group brought out BMG Kidz. Warner Brothers Records bought 49 percent of Music for Little People, a highly respected children's catalogue and record company, and MCA acquired the rights to Raffi recordings and his library of albums from A&M.
All this attention is being given to a segment of the industry that last year accounted for only 0.3 percent of the $7.8 billion music business. Nonetheless, record executives say, it is a field with tremendous growth potential, partly because of the modern-day baby boom. To bolster their argument, industry executives like to cite census figures that show that more than 4 million births were reported in 1990, the most since 1961.
"THE MARKET IS LARGER than it currently appears," said Linda Morgenstern, director of children's programming for Sony Kids' Music. "The market will grow proportionately with every step we take in making the consumer aware of what's available. Our challenge is in allowing the consumer to become aware of this richness, in educating parents that buying audio or video products for children offers a good alternative to buying a toy for them."
The parents being targeted by the record companies often grew up on a hearty diet of music. "When most of us baby boomers were in our formative years in college, it was music that was the critical part of our lives," says Dr. Eugene V. Beresin, director of residency training in child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "Music has always been loved in our society, but the meaning of music in the 60's was somehow different; it had a social and political kind of consciousness raising. We're more tuned in to music as being a part of our lives than our parents were and we've transmitted that to our kids."
Many of today's families have two working parents; although short on time, they have disposable income to spend on albums, despite the current recession. Leib Ostrow, co-founder of Music for Little People, says that these parents are looking for "a product that affects their lives with their children in a positive way."
And a few of these parents are recording company executives. "Baby boomers are in decision-making positions, including in the music business," says Mr. Lovald of Silo-Alcazar. "So they go into a store and see children's music that their own children enjoy and say, 'Why isn't my company involved?' And a lot more women are in corporate America, women who all along accepted and acknowledged the importance of quality music for children. That's the personal interest that wasn't there before."
Along with their parents, children are influenced by MTV and other televised music video shows, as well as by radio, where they hear performers like Paula Abdul and Bruce Springsteen. But just like Shari Lewis and her fleecy charmer Lambchop, Ms. Abdul and Mr. Springsteen can be heard on children's albums. Performers like Bob Dylan, Glen Campbell, Taj Mahal, Michael Feinstein and James Taylor are also making music for children, either individually or as part of compilations. Walt Disney Records has produced Little Richard's album for children, "Shake It All About," and "Country Music for Kids," featuring artists like Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris and Buck Owens.
"Historically, children's music has generally rested in the folk domain, but we felt it important to move forward beyond that," says Mark Jaffe, vice president of Walt Disney Records, which continues to dominate the children's music business and, unlike other children's labels, has sales volumes that compete with those of mainstream rock labels. Its "Beauty and the Beast" soundtrack has sold more than 2.5 million copies, and more than one million copies of its new "Aladdin" soundtrack were shipped to stores two weeks ago.
"We felt it important to make music that takes many of the contemporary melodic influences that children are exposed to," Mr. Jaffe says, "and use them with lyrics written for children to create a contemporary listening experience for children and their families."
Some artists who usually make music for grown-ups and are now populating the world of children's music are simply doing what they know best but redirecting it. For example, Little Richard's children's album features the same hard-driving, pumping piano and frenzied, shrieking vocal style -- punctuated by his trademark "woo" -- that helped expand the boundaries of rock-and-roll. The group Sweet Honey in the Rock retains its complex a cappella arrangements, African influences and uncompromising stance while creating songs for children on its "All for Freedom" album. And reggae music from Gregory Isaacs, J. C. Lodge, Yellowman and Bunny Wailer provides a familiar beat on "Reggae for Kids."
"More and more parents are aware of the need to expose their children to various kinds of music, everything from traditional to world music to folk and rock and Cajun and old standards," says Stephen McArthur, a partner in Re-Bop Records, which has released "Oldies for Kool Kiddies" and other albums. "The market for this is bigger than anyone has yet tapped. As long as there are kids and as long as there are parents who buy tapes for their kids, there will be a market for children's music."

When Airline Fares Are Hardly Fair

BYLINE: By DONALD L. PEVSNER; Donald L. Pevsner, a lawyer and aviation consumer advocate in Miami, was assistant general counsel of Air Florida in 1982.

 BODY:
AFTER nearly a decade of laissez-faire neglect, it is imperative that the Government restore pricing equity to the nation's troubled domestic airline industry.
Federal law once mandated that airlines serve the "public convenience and necessity," and that all fares and charges be "just and reasonable," meaning reasonably related to the cost of providing service and unencumbered by inequitable restrictions. As a result, if you wished to fly from Point A to Point B, whether you bought your ticket two months, two weeks or two hours before departure, you were not gouged by virtue of your choice. Neither were you forced to remain at your destination over a Saturday night in order to obtain the only affordable air fare. And, if you canceled your trip, or changed the date or flight, your ticket was fully refundable or bore minimal penalties. 
 All of this vanished after Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. On Jan. 1, 1985, Federal oversight was removed from domestic airline pricing. Result: "on demand" unrestricted economy fares skyrocketed, outstripping the rate of inflation by more than 250 percent. Cancellation penalties on excursion fares swiftly escalated until they reached a confiscatory 100 percent level. "Fences" designed to mulct the "captive" business traveler sprang up, so that the only affordable air fare in most markets today remains saddled with a 14-day advance-purchase and Saturday-night minimum-stay requirement.
Deregulation was not supposed to be this pernicious. The bitterest irony is that, by fiscally offending business and leisure travelers alike, virtually every member of the current domestic airline oligopoly is losing its shirt. A notable exception: Southwest Airlines, which offers only reasonable fares in every market it serves.
It is time to restore this basic and decent precept to the rest of the industry:
* Under President Clinton's guidance, the new and chastened Congress must restore the "just and reasonable" rule to domestic airline pricing.
* The Department of Transportation must swiftly proceed to reregulate domestic airline pricing, a function that it has never abdicated in the international arena, where Congress never blindly trusted private industry not to overcharge the public.
It costs the major carriers about 13 cents to fly each seat in their fleets one mile assuming all planes are 70 percent full -- a figure surpassed during this summer's "fare war," when airlines cut their cheapest excursion fares in half and millions of people took to the sky. But planes became half-empty again as high fares returned.
American Airlines largely blames the fare cuts it started for an $85 million third-quarter loss. However, a bit more fine-tuning would have produced a financial triumph. If each of American's 25.2 million quarterly passengers had paid just $3.37 more, its loss would have been erased. Had they paid $13.37 more, the airline would have had a profit of $252.3 million. And these minuscule sums could have easily been added to such rock-bottom fares as $232 round-trip Miami-Seattle.
There is obviously plenty of room to spread further drastic cuts in on-demand fares among all passengers. Instead, these fares today range from 35 to 80 cents per mile. The Civil Aeronautics Board, which set all fares in prederegulation days, would not have tolerated such fares for an instant -- and neither should our new elected leaders.
HAS no pricing executive at the other seven major carriers realized the obvious? Southwest Airlines is earning record profits while charging up to 80 percent less for similar-length flights. Southwest's fleetwide seat-mile cost is just 7 cents, due to higher aircraft utilization and lower operating costs. The other carriers have a seat-mile cost of about 9 cents. They should simply adopt Southwest's overall pricing structure, adding 29 percent to cover their higher costs. Then, watch the public fill up most of the seats that short-sighted greed has left empty.
It's up to you, Bill.

Commonwealth, Heal Thyself

BYLINE: By Liesl Schillinger

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, Aleksandra Yakovleva had to stop publicizing her new-age magazine, Inward Path, on Soviet television. It was too expensive to advertise, she said. Now, a year after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a commonwealth television channel has asked Miss Yakovleva to produce a series about the spiritual approach to life that she advances in her popular monthly.
"Now that nothing in our country is under control economically or politically, people want to know how they can at least solve their personal problems," Miss Yakovleva, said last week in a telephone interview from Moscow. "And that is what we do in my magazine. We find ways that Russian people can change their lives by changing their consciousness. We are the first magazine to write about these questions." 
 In the Commonwealth of Independent States, a new-age movement is gaining ground, and Miss Yakovleva is at the forefront, with her magazine (called Put k Sebe in Russian), the new television program and a shop that opened earlier this year in Moscow selling everything from candles and incense to bean sprouts and crystals.
Proponents of the movement hope to solve the commonwealth's ills with a list of cures that Miss Yakovleva enumerated in her editor's note in the pilot English-language edition of the magazine last year. On the list are parapsychology, yoga, faith healing, Russian Orthodox Christianity, auto-suggestion, white magic and the study of U.F.O.'s. The booming interest in parapsychology has amazed even those who egged it on.
"There is a strong need for my magazine, because there has always been spirituality in my country, even during Communism," Miss Yakovleva said over herbal tea at a New York cafe during a trip to the United States last year. "But now the interest is very, very high, and people want to know how to be religious, how to be spiritual. Some are going to remote Russian villages to find old people who still know the traditions and Orthodox rituals. It happened to me, too. I studied journalism at Moscow State University, and I also worked at newspapers, but when I got interested in spirituality, I knew I had to start Put k Sebe" [pronounced poot-kseh-BYEH].
With 33 monthly issues under its belt, the magazine has a circulation of 100,000 and a sizable subscriber base of 70,000. Miss Yakovleva had come to the United States to find distributors for the English-language edition of the magazine. The search was successful. She has not been able to publish an English-language edition every month, but since last fall, four such editions have made it to the stands in new-age bookstores in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Toronto and in places like New York's Open Center in SoHo, a holistic learning center.
The autumn 1992 English-language issue has a face lift, with smoother paper, a more modern design and savvy teasers for advertisers ("89 percent of our readers are in the top 10 percent income bracket") and for subscribers ("through our magazine you can acquire friends and co-thinkers in Russia").
In the former Soviet Union, as in America, the road from spiritualism to capitalism appears well lighted. Not to say that Miss Yakovleva's cause is not altruistic. "Technically, I suppose we are a profit organization," she said last week. "But I have found that you don't make a profit selling spirituality in Russia."
The television series "Inward Path" premieres the second week in January and will be broadcast every two weeks. Miss Yakovleva and the staff at the magazine will write, produce and direct the half-hour shows. The first program, she said, will feature segments dealing with issues like vegetarianism, the use of positive thinking in combating cancer and how Russians have moved from believing in the Communist Party to placing their faith in the Orthodox Church.
In August, Miss Yakovleva opened the Inward Path Center in Moscow, offering tools for a holistic life like a new-age library and a store stocked with what she referred to as spiritual necessities: books, tapes and new-age food and paraphernalia. "We also have healing cones that are very interesting," said Valeriya Spitsyna, the magazine's deputy editor. "They are made from different types of wood, and they cure all the diseases of the head and hair. They are very powerful instruments for healing." The center's director, Nina Nikolayeva, recently spent 10 days in New York training with the Open Center's holistic experts.
Miss Yakovleva proudly showed off the magazine's pilot English-language issue during her New York visit last year. "Look at the beautiful cover of our magazine," she said, referring to the O'Keeffean watercolor. "The woman who painted it did it automatically, without thinking. It is a symbol." She leafed through the magazine, flipping past advertisements for the National Association of UFOlogy, the Interdepartmental Center for Research on Astro-Levitating Objects and other organizations. She paused at feature articles -- an interview with a village witch, an article titled "Water Knows Everything" and essays on spiritual midwifery and the Upanishads.
Miss Yakovleva started Inward Path in 1990 with her husband, Yevgeny Shestinsky, its publisher. Perhaps journalism is in her blood. Her father, Yegor Yakovlev, was a champion of openness in the Gorbachev era as the editor of the weekly newspaper Moscow News, and until he was dismissed late last month by Boris Yeltsin, he was the head of Ostankino, the Moscow-based television network. Mr. Yeltsin accused him of showing biased programming regarding a conflict in the northern Caucasus, but Miss Yakovleva said he was dismissed because his coverage was too honest. On Nov. 30, "Yeltsin offered him a job as press minister," she said. "But my father says it's impossible to take such a job from Yeltsin because he thinks it will be a difficult time for the press again."
Miss Yakovleva, who does not foresee any problem with her show's getting on the air, said that her father used to ignore Inward Path because he didn't understand it, but that now he reads every issue. "He thinks it's very important for Russia now, when we have so many problems to solve," she added, "and my mother thinks so, too."

HEADLINE: Riverside South's Goal Is to Keep Park in Touch With River


DATELINE: After extensive design and environmental studies have confirmed the soundness of Riverside South, Craig Whitaker chooses to exaggerate the difficulties while pushing his own proposal for the site ("Slow Down, Mr. Trump," Op-Ed, Nov. 14). Sadly Mr. Whitaker does not understand the goals of Riverside South or the implications of his own proposal.
To the Editor:

 BODY:
 Riverside South was motivated primarily by the chance to create a waterfront extension of Riverside Park that, in contrast to other parks in Manhattan, would allow intimate contact with the Hudson River.
The key to achieving that goal, and to accommodating a primarily residential development, is to relocate inland and grade the elevated highway that now dominates the site, subduing its impact as much as possible.
Mr. Whitaker's solution -- putting the highway at grade next to the river -- was considered and rejected during Riverside South's development. I initially rejected the idea because a river-edge highway would sever the park from the waterfront.
At a June 1991 workshop organized by the American Institute of Architects, a team of urban designers from around the country endorsed the basic outlines of Riverside South after rejecting several other schemes for the site, including one incorporating Mr. Whitaker's suggestions.
Finally, a recent Urban Development Corporation planning study rejected a river-edge alignment because it would necessitate building the highway over the water between 66th and 70th Streets.
Rather than saving money, Mr. Whitaker's solution would cost far more than Riverside South. And then what will we have gained: a park 30 feet above the river, the waterfront connection foreclosed; constricted park entrances, north and south, through tunnels under the highway; two and a half park acres beyond the seawall, inaccessible and unusable? It makes no sense.
Mr. Whitaker asks why the Federal Government should spend more than $100 million to tear down and relocate a highway it is now spending $63 million to rebuild, but such a public investment can be justified.
First, the developer will contribute an equal amount of private funds for what are normally public expenditures -- for the new waterfront park, improvements to two subway stations, affordable housing and a Bronx rail freight terminal. Second, the developer will contribute another equal amount to construct new streets, sewers and other infrastructure to be turned over to the city. Finally, considering the project as a whole, a $100 million Government investment will generate $2 billion of private funds.
The planning process over the last year and a half, though disappointing in some respects, has succeeded in fashioning a package worthy of City Council approval.

HEADLINE: 3 WOMEN ARE SAID TO BE CANDIDATES FOR CABINET POSTS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 6

 BODY:
Concerned that his first Cabinet appointments might signal the wrong intentions for his Adminstration, President-elect Bill Clinton plans to expand this week's announcements to include posts that would be filled by female and minority appointees.
Aides to the President-elect said that Madeleine M. Kunin, the former Governor of Vermont; Donna E. Shalala, the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, and Jill L. Long, a Congresswoman from Indiana, are leading candidates for major positions.
 
May Head the E.P.A.
 Mrs. Kunin, who is serving on the transition board and helped Mr. Clinton select Senator Al Gore of Tennessee as his running mate, is the likely nominee to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, a sub-Cabinet post. Mrs. Kunin is credited with rewriting Vermont's environmental laws, including new rules for toxic waste and garbage dumping, and she favors greatly increased regulation of businesses and industries. 
 Ms. Shalala (pronounced shuh-LAY-luh), who met with Mr. Clinton here last week and held a reception for Mr. Clinton and Senator Gore at her Madison, Wis., home during a campaign visit this fall, is in the running for Secretary of Education, Secretary of Commerce or possibly one other position.
A former president of Hunter College in New York, Ms. Shalala was Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Carter Administration, taught politics and education while a professor at Columbia University and served as treasurer of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Representative Long, who was interviewed by Mr. Clinton on Saturday, is considered a top prospect for the Department of Agriculture. She owns an 80-acre farm in northeastern Indiana.

 Mr. Clinton said repeatedly during the campaign that his closest circle of advisers would "look like America," his way of promising a Cabinet that would include men, women and members of minorities.
But some of his advisers have worried that as he grew closer to making his first public announcements -- probably on Thursday -- this promise would conflict with his desire to fill economic posts first.
His leading choices for the financial jobs, including Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for Secretary of the Treasury, Roger C. Altman as Mr. Bentsen's deputy, and Robert E. Rubin or Robert B. Reich as Economic Security Adviser, are all white men.
"There's sensitivity about rolling out four white males," said one Clinton aide. "They want to show their sense of diversity." Mr. Reich is also being considered for Commerce Secretary, aides said today.
Alice M. Rivlin, an economist who was the first director of the Congressional Budget Office, is the only woman who has been mentioned in the first rank of economic appointments, and it has remained unclear to which post she might be appointed.
Rather than scour the country further for women or minority candidates for the economic jobs, Clinton aides, who are aware of how closely watched the President-elect's first appointments will be, have been working instead to expand the pool of announcements.
 
Blacks Under Consideration
 The transition team is also helping the President-elect pick candidates for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Energy and Interior.
Aides are also concerned that none of Mr. Clinton's first appointees will be black. Black candidates have been mentioned most often for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Health and Human Services, two departments which have been led by blacks in past administrations.
Among those mentioned for these jobs have been Joycelyn Elders, the Secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health, Vincent Lane, the head of the Chicago Housing Authority, and Marian Wright Edelman, the executive director of the Children's Defense Fund, a children's advocacy group.
 
Two Mayors Mentioned
 Alexis Herman, a transition official who has been a deputy at the Democratic National Committee and ran the national convention for Mr. Clinton, is under consideration to become Secretary of Labor and would be the first black in that position. She once headed the Women's Bureau in the Labor Department.
And at least two black big-city mayors -- Maynard Jackson of Atlanta and Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore -- have been mentioned for Administration posts. Mr. Schmoke, however, has said that he plans to remain in Baltimore.
The Democratic National Committee chairman, Ronald H. Brown, has also met with Mr. Clinton to discuss a Cabinet post, but it is unclear whether he is seeking or being considered for a foreign policy or a domestic policy role.
A more distinct problem has emerged in the search for Hispanic Cabinet candidates. Henry Cisneros, a Clinton friend, transition adviser and a former Mayor of San Antonio, is considered likely to be appointed by Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas to the Senate seat that would be vacated by Mr. Bentsen's elevation to Treasury Secretary.
 
2 Mayors Being Considered
 And Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico, another Hispanic possibility who was interviewed in Little Rock for a Cabinet job, is considered by some to be to have insufficient experience for a senior position.
Federico Pena, the former Mayor of Denver, has been considered along with Mr. Jackson of Atlanta to be a prospect for the Department of Transportation.
But while some of the appointments to the domestic posts are becoming firm, there has been some turmoil within the tentative economic team. Lawrence H. Summers, who had been considered a top choice to be Mr. Clinton's Economic Security Adviser, has come under fire from environmentalists who are allies of Mr. Gore.
At issue is a memorandum written by Mr. Summers while he was chief economist at the World Bank. In it, he argued that it might make sense to dispose of toxic industrial waste in developing countries.
He has said the memorandum was merely a working paper and not a statement of belief. But the dispute has ounded his chances for the White House job, aides said.

HEADLINE: High Seas and Fire Hamper Effort To Contain an Oil Slick Off Spain

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LA CORUNA, Spain, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Rough seas and fires burning aboard an oil tanker frustrated attempts today to contain an oil slick that spread along Spain's northwestern coast, damaging marine ecosystems and polluting beaches.
"We tried yesterday to check the ship to see if we could remove the crude, but it was impossible because of the state of the sea," said the Governor of La Coruna, Pilar Lledo. "We made an other attempt this morning, but it was impossible." 
 Galicia Province, Europe's principal fishing region, could face severe problems. Nearly 20 percent of the population live from the industry, which is worth about $300 million a year to the regional economy.
The oil slick covered 19 square miles early today, leading environmentalists to fear that it could spread as far as 60 miles and devastate shellfish beds. Fishing has been banned in the area until Dec. 16, affecting 215 boats and 800 fishermen.
 
Authorities Are Criticized
 Local unions and environmental groups have accused the authorities of failing to take preventive measures and are hoping that the crude oil will disperse quickly because it is of a light variety.
In an effort to limit the damage, the merchant marine authorities have placed 16 barriers across estuaries east and north of La Coruna, but the oil slick was still spreading toward Cape Prior, 20 miles north of here.
Today, beaches along the Betanzos and Ares estuaries, northeast of La Coruna, were covered with oil, and the slick was bearing in on Ferrol, just south of Cape Prior.
The tanker, carrying nearly 24 million gallons of crude and chartered by Spanish state oil company Repsol, ran aground on Thursday and split in two after multiple explosions. Exactly how much oil has been leaked is not known.
Environmentalists fear that the slick may spread much farther and that it has the potential to be worse than the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989, when 11 million gallons of crude oil leaked into Prince William Sound.
In Geneva, the World Wide Fund for Nature said Friday that the spill was ravaging coastal ecosystems and threatening birds, fish and dolphins in the area.
"The first visible victims are tens of thousands of migratory birds," the organization said in statement. "Experts also expect that the damage to mollusks, cockles, oysters, clams, barnacles and various species of fish will be irreversible in the long term, with disastrous implications for the fisheries-based economy of the region."

HEADLINE: MISSION TO SOMALIA;
Mogadishu Port Opens to Allow Some Food Deliveries

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Food backed up at the port here began to roll today as a 400-ton shipment of United Nations wheat and sorghum reached the northern sector of the capital. Behind it came a second convoy with 800 tons.
The cargo, part of a 12,000-ton shipment stranded at the harbor since early last month, was delayed again on Saturday when rival clans failed to honor their agreements to insure the food safe passage. 
 But today trucks rumbled toward feeding centers, impeded by only minor looting. There was only one tense incident, when dozens of gunmen crowded around the gawking skeleton of the State Bank of Somalia and threatened to shoot any stranger who wandered too close.
 
Provincial Town Under Attack
 While the situation in the capital steadied slightly today, marauders laid siege to the nearby town of Baidoa, intensifying the constant threat of looting and underscoring once again how uncontrollable the armed gangs have become.
In August Baidoa, a one-street town about 150 miles northwest of Mogadishu, became the first global symbol of the ravaging extent of Somalia's famine.
Relief officials say that for American troops to succeed in their planned relief mission, they must quickly secure the road to Baidoa as well as the adjacent countryside. But disarming the gunmen who guard the area could become the troops' biggest challenge.
Abdi Osman Farah, vice chairman of the United Somali Congress, warned today that any such action would be considered an infringement on Somali sovereignty. The congress is headed by Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, leader of one of the largest armed bands.
In an impromptu news conference, Mr. Farah demanded that United States military officials consult his group before arriving in Somalia and cooperate with his party, one of the most powerful groups in Somalia.
"We dislike to be interfered without our consent," Mr. Farah said, "but we are interested in peace and making contact with the United States.
"We are here to defend the interests of our country," Mr. Farah warned. "We cannot predict what will happen after the arrival of the United States forces."
General Aidid, who is known as the most aggressive Somali leader, controls the southern sector of the capital; the northern sector is controlled by Mohammed Ali Mahdi.
The two men, both in their mid-50's, belong to the same clan, the Hawiye, and conspired in January 1991 to oust President Mohammed Siad Barre. They later fell out and have fought a war that has destroyed Mogadishu and closed the port.
 
Three Relief Planes Land
 In addition to the truck convoys in the capital, three relief planes landed today at Bardera, west of the capital, The Associated Press reported. It was the first food to reach Bardera in nine days; in the meantime hundreds have starved. On Saturday, for example, 160 people died of starvation in the town, said Ian MacLeod, a United Nations aid spokesman.
Bardera is under the control of Gen. Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan, the son-in-law of the deposed President.
In the days of waiting for the United States troops, Baidoa has become a cruising ground for hundreds of heavily armed vehicles that have fled Mogadishu to avoid American troops. The young toughs riding the jeeps are fighting among themselves as well as with other youthful gangs that have arrived in search of food.
 
Threats Against CARE
 Baidoa also reflects the increasing tension throughout the countryside. The International Committee of the Red Cross today pulled its staff of two out of Obbia, 360 miles northeast of the capital. In the southwest, toward the Kenyan border, Kismayu port is still closed, and there is heavy tension among the fighters.
In Baidoa, gangs in armed vehicles control the streets, firing at random, and have threatened to loot relief organizations, an official of CARE said. When security collapsed, the local governor locked himself in his house and the police chief fled to Mogadishu, Rick Grant, the CARE spokesman, said.
Linda McClelland, a development officer for the relief group Irish Concern, said, "People in Baidoa are aware that American troops are coming, and they're reacting." The group evacuated five staff members to Nairobi because "the situation is very tense and we're just not taking any chances." Irish Concern has also recalled its workers from nearby villages because the roads to Baidoa have become treacherous.
 
Mud Is a Slight Deterrent
 So far, the only thing that seems to have slowed the warring factions is mud. Daily torrential downpours have prevented more forces loyal to various factions from reaching Baidoa.
But the looting has continued. The CARE office was robbed of $20,000 and its Somali workers were warned that their compounds would be raided and the staff beaten up, then foreign workers would be assaulted, and finally the gunmen would kidnap the women, Mr. Grant said.
CARE has pulled out all but two of its foreign staff members.
In contrast Mogadishu seemed calm, but alive with merchants hawking wares as diverse as rusted kitchen faucets and silver jewelry. Gasoline vendors advertised their fuel in large cans stacked on wooden tables. And everywhere the question was, "When are the Americans coming?"

Cultural Frictions of a Border Town

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALPINE, Calif.

 BODY:
For nearly a year, employees of the grocery store in this quiet town near the Mexican border kept a yellow ledger titled Mexican Incident Book, which chronicled their complaints about the migrant workers who camp across the road.
"Record all Drunks, Shoplifters, Customer Complaints, Stabbings (Ha, Ha)," read the instructions on the book's cover. 
 In its log of daily irritations and minor incidents ("He laughed as he left the store," it recorded about one suspected shoplifter) the ledger is a portrayal of the frictions that characterize many San Diego County communities, where a comfortable middle class brushes against the poverty that is spilling north across the border.
Throughout the county, and elsewhere in California, homeless Hispanic day laborers and migrant workers play an important role in the local economy but have become the target of growing anger as their numbers increase and their encampments become more visible.
"I realize these are people who are hungry and who come across the border to find work," said William Logan, who owns the Alpine shopping center that includes the grocery store, as well as the land where the immigrants make their camp.
"But it would help if they were more respectful of our property," he said. "It gets filthy and it looks like Tijuana."
Over the years, cultural frictions throughout the county have flared into violence that has included beatings, shootings and, in at least one instance, hunting down migrant workers for sport.
On the night of Oct. 1, this hillside town of 12,000 residents -- which has become, for reasons no one seems to understand, a regional focal point for the hiring of Hispanic day laborers -- was the scene of a particularly gruesome incident. Half a dozen white men swinging baseball bats charged into the workers' camp and severely beat three migrants, all of them legal residents of the United States.
"They said we raped a woman," said Oscar Alfonso Mendoza, 33 years old, who came to the United States 14 years ago to escape violence in his native Guatemala. "I said it wasn't true, but they didn't believe us. I was trying to protect my head, and then I managed to run away."
The baseball bats shattered his left arm and caused cuts requiring 55 stitches on his arm and 18 on his head, he said as he rested at the home of a relative in nearby National City. He also said he owed a hospital $19,400 for five days of treatment.
Mr. Mendoza's friend Leobardo Zarco, also 33, who came here from Mexico 16 years ago, fared worse. He slipped as he tried to run up the side of the gully, and he remembers losing consciousness to the thudding sound of the baseball bats.
His head, arms, legs and body were battered, he has lost the hearing in his left ear, his left knee was splintered and he can walk now only with the aid of crutches.
Like many of the other subsistence workers who offend some residents as they wait for work on street corners, Mr. Zarco has lived his life from day to day and has no savings. He has been taken in for now by a well-to-do widower in San Diego who read a newspaper account of his mistreatment.
The incident has embarrassed the residents of Alpine. The yellow log book has been removed from the grocery store by the manager, and developments in the town's most celebrated Mexican incident are now chronicled in local newspapers.
Sheriff's deputies have charged five men with assault, battery and commission of a hate crime.
Officials decided not to pursue the rape accusation after they found inconsistencies in the woman's account and because of evidence that she may have had consensual sex with one or more of the laborers.
One of the men charged in the beating is the woman's 35-year-old husband. He has twice been convicted of abusing his wife.
The husband has denied any connection with the beatings of the laborers, but he was quoted by local newspapers as saying: "Good for them, whoever it was. Maybe they'll get rid of the Mexicans down there."

WHITE ELEPHANTS IN CONNECTICUT
The lush suburban landscape of Fairfield County, Conn., has become home to hundreds of vacant executive offices that analysts say are among the worst white elephants of American business. It was places like Stamford, Greenwich, Westport, Fairfield and Danbury that provided new and spacious homes for the first large wave of corporations that moved from Manhattan in the late 1960's and the 1970's. But the takeovers, leveraged buyouts and reorganizations of the 1980's -- compounded by the recession -- have wiped out or drastically shrunk many of those companies, which can no longer use all the suburban space they created for themselves. And experts say that because of bad judgments in the design and location of the offices, many have been unable to attract new tenants. A1.
 
RESOLUTION OF AN INSURANCE FAILURE
The insurance commissioners of New York and New Jersey have agreed on how to resolve the largest insurance company failure in history, increasing the interest that will be paid on the savings of hundreds of thousands of customers of the failed Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company. But most customers may still have to wait up to seven years before they have access to all their money. A1.

HISTORIC DECISION FOR TRIBECA
TriBeCa is nearing a decisive moment. Tomorrow, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is to consider a plan to create three new historic districts there, a move that would bring all or part of 34 blocks northwest of City Hall under its regulation. While historic district status would not rule out construction, the design of any new structure would have to be deemed appropriate by the landmarks panel before it could be built. B3.
 
OFFICER CHARGED WITH TAKING A BRIBE
A Port Authority police officer was arraigned on charges of taking a $300 bribe to escort an undercover agent posing as a cocaine dealer past drug-detection security systems at La Guardia Airport. Officials said the suspect was the first officer in the 65-year history of his force to be charged with a felony of the highest level, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years to life in prison. B2.
 
KEEPING CUSTOMERS HAPPY
Ed Germano, owner of the Hit Factory, likes to say his business is making people happy. Not that the recording-studio owner doesn't charge people like Madonna, Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson plenty for the use of equipment reminiscent of the starship Enterprise. But he delights in throwing in some extras. Things like a 24-hour gym and steam bath, two-bedroom apartments for out-of-towners, and mountainous baskets of fresh fruit. This might all sound irrelevant to most business people, but Mr. Germano, who rents space to record companies and producers, sees his function as basically that of a hotelier. He provides not only the musical precision demanded by artists of a studio, but the human comforts as well. Strictly Business, B4.

HEADLINE: No Sleighs For Santas Trudging Sidewalks

 BODY:
The night-sky sleigh riding, the last-minute list checking and the down-the-chimney ho-ho-hoing are the easy part. For some sidewalk Santas in Manhattan, December means long days collecting donations for the Volunteers of America, the nonprofit group that is New York State's largest provider of shelter services for single adults. The group provides a home away from the North Pole, a shelter on the Upper East Side.
The Santas' presence creates some only-in-New-York scenes: suited Santas clambering onto the M5 bus, Santas picking up midday snacks in a deli, Santas trudging along a lonely sidewalk as night falls. 
 Sixteen Santas, mostly homeless or unemployed men from upstate New York, fanned out across the city yesterday, ready to keep track of who was naughty and who was nice.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Mood Supports Clinton

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The sharp rally in the bond market after the release of employment data on Friday seems to show a surprising comfort among market players with President-elect Bill Clinton, a Democrat who will govern with a Democratic-controlled Congress.
The bond market is peopled by investors, traders, speculators and analysts who have had little confidence in Democrats in the past and a real fear of rising deficits. Yet, the avid buyers of Treasury bills, notes and bonds on Friday appeared to be giving Mr. Clinton every benefit of the doubt.
 
Shift in Investor Mood
 "The shift in mood in the last six to eight weeks is phenomenal," said Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens & Clark. "They thought the economy was going down the drain and he was evil incarnate. Now they think the economy is growing at a 4 percent rate and that Clinton is smart, practical and will do the right thing." 
 Mr. Clinton's reported choice of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, as Secretary of the Treasury, may be unsettling to the bond market, and trading today may reflect that. Many bond traders and analysts preferred Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who had an unchallenged anti-inflation reputation.
But if Mr. Clinton is gaining the confidence of Wall Street already, Mr. Bentsen's choice will not be judged in isolation; it will be read in an overall context that will also include other appointments and the President-elect's commitment to cutting the Federal budget deficit.
 
Stronger Economic Signs
 The employment report for November was solid across the board. Nonfarm payrolls were up 105,000. The September decline of 72,000 jobs was revised to an increase of 12,000. The average workweek and hourly earnings rose, two factors that had forecasters like Ed Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence and Joseph Liro of S. G. Warburg & Company preparing to increase their growth forecasts for the fourth quarter.
Normally, these kind of data would be bad for the bond market, especially coupled with Mr. Clinton's promise to stimulate the economy with new spending on road and environmental projects and tax incentives to encourage business investment.
For shorter maturities, a stronger economy raises the possibility that the Federal Reserve could soon increase short-term interest rates. For longer maturities it makes investors wonder if the stronger growth will push inflation higher.
In fact, it was worry over a stronger-than-expected economy and Mr. Clinton's fiscal stimulus package that caused much of the recent selloff in Treasury bills and notes.
But instead of declining on Friday, bond and note prices rose and the discount rates on Treasury bills declined. The price of the 30-year bond was up 25/32 to yield 7.48 percent, down from 7.55 percent on Thursday and the first time the yield has been below 7.50 percent since Oct. 14.
And the apparent faith in Mr. Clinton is one of the reasons why.
 
Fine-Tuning Fiscal Stimulus
 Bond traders, fund managers and economists indicated in numerous interviews that they assumed Mr. Clinton would scale back the stimulus program he promised during the campaign if the economy grew stronger and strengthen it if the economy was weaker. Mr. Clinton and his transition aides have indicated that this is the case. But no one knows yet whether a reduced Clinton program would be close to what the bond market would consider scaled back.
Mr. Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence said in his commentary on the employment report, "Job report reduces likelihood of Clinton short-term stimulus program."
The rally also seemed to reveal two other factors at play in the market. One is that investors appear more scared of a yet-to-be-detailed fiscal stimulus program than of an economy that is growing faster then anticipated just two months ago.
The second factor is that skeptical investors, traders and analysts, who have been burned in the past, are showing growing comfort with the thought that inflation will remain low for some time to come. This is one reason the long bond has outperformed other Treasury securities in recent trading.
 
Economic Drag
 The General Motors Corporation's announcement last week of its plans to shut nine plants within the next three and a half years is a vivid reminder of the painful corporate restructurings that have kept the economy sluggish, at best, for the last four years.
Economists and executives hope that the paring of debt and the cutting of costs will lay the groundwork for future robust economic growth.
 
Only Moderate Growth Predicted

 
 But in a report on the economic outlook next year here and abroad, Salomon Brothers warns that debt restructuring for both companies and individuals is not yet over. And that is one reason the firm projects only moderate growth in the economy next year.
Combined with a continued low rate of inflation, the moderate growth will open the way to a decline in the yield on the 30-year bond to the vicinity of 7 percent. The firm does not think, however, that a break of 7 percent, if possible, can happen before 1994.
On the consumer side, the report notes that while debt service burdens have fallen from their peak, they are still high enough to limit the burst in spending needed for a conventional recovery. The analysis also contends that consumer behavior may be becoming more conservative, meaning less willingness to take on new debt and a stronger tendency to save.
One reason for this view is the pattern of mortgage refinancings, which show a marked move to 15-year mortgages, from 30 years. This means that consumers still make about the same monthly payments. That makes for a slower-spending consumer as individuals build up equity in their homes much faster.
 
Rise in 15-Year Mortgages
 Overall mortgage data show that the share of 15-year mortgages has risen to about 30 percent in 1992 from 10 percent in recent years. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation data show that refinancings to 15-year mortgages jumped to 43 percent in the first three quarters of 1992, from 17 percent in 1990.
On the corporate side, the change has also just begun."The recuperation owes more to the absolute decline in interest rates and a strong stock market rally than to corporate balance sheet restructuring or robust income growth," according to the report written under the direction of John Lipsky, Salomon's chief economist.
Among other conclusions: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates until the second half of 1993; when it does, the increase will be modest.
Mr. Clinton's economic stimulus plan and the need to create jobs will mean that "deficit reduction plays a subordinate role," a fact that may eventually shake the bond market, the Salomon report says. As for the actual fiscal stimulus, much of the spending on road, environmental, communications and other projects may be delayed by "significant legal and regulatory obstacles."

HEADLINE: 28 Suspects in Suffolk Drug Ring Arrested

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE, L.I., Dec. 6

 BODY:
A Long Island man who the police said bragged that for $5,000 he could make people disappear was arrested early this morning and identified as the leader of a major narcotics ring in western Suffolk County.
The suspect, Raymond Kaisen, and 27 other suspected members of the drug-distribution ring, were seized in several simultaneous raids on the Island by Federal, state and county drug-enforcement agents. The police also seized 12 luxury cars, a 33-foot speedboat, numerous weapons, explosives, anabolic steroids, marijuana plants and about two pounds of cocaine. 
 Maj. Anthony J. DiResta, commander of New York State Police Troop L, said Mr. Kaisen was a supplier of one to two kilos of cocaine a week, from which Mr. Kaisen alone profited more than $45,000 weekly.
 
Weapons on Display
 He said the electronic surveillance of Mr. Kaisen's house at 7 Stafford Drive in Huntington Station disclosed that Mr. Kaisen not only bragged that he could make people disappear, but also that "no cops would ever take him down."
He said Mr. Kaisen's narcotics operation was "a violent organization," as reflected by the nearly two dozen weapons seized by the agents this morning. The evidence, spread out for display at Troop L headquarters here at Republic Airport, included an Uzi, shotguns and handguns and ammunition.
The display of weapons was banked by several marijuana plants and had been seized at the home of one of suspects, Albert Lowe, at 84 Rhode Island Avenue in Massapequa.
The agents who raided Mr. Kaisen's home said they entered a house of mirrors, which made it difficult to find their way around. The house was also surrounded by an extensive security system, including lights and television cameras connected to monitors in every room.
The agents said they found Mr. Kaisen trying to stuff packages of cocaine down a toilet near his bedroom. Capt. Walter Heesch, head of Troop L's narcotics-enforcement unit, said Mr. Kaisen lived in the house with his wife, three children and his parents. He said Mr. Kaisen was unemployed. The police said the parents were under investigation.
James Catterson, the Suffolk County District Attorney, said the case began six months ago. Mr. Catterson said the drugs were supplied to the Suffolk ring by dealers in New York City.
The suspects were charged with criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance, criminal possession of weapons and conspiracy. They were to be held overnight in Suffolk County Jail in Hauppauge for arraignment on Monday in First County Court. Those convicted of the sale of a controlled substance could face a minimum of 15 years to life in prison.

HEADLINE: Landmarks Panel to Hear TriBeCa Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
After years of veering between conflicting impulses -- to preserve its architectural heritage (about five stories high) or exploit its development potential (more like 50) -- the TriBeCa area of lower Manhattan is nearing a decisive moment.
Tomorrow, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission is to consider a plan to create three new historic districts there, a move that would bring all or part of 34 blocks northwest of City Hall under its regulation. 
 While historic district status would not rule out construction, the design of any new structure would have to be deemed appropriate by the landmarks panel before it could be built.
Best known in recent years as a cutting edge of social and cultural life, TriBeCa was once a thriving center of textile and dry goods dealers, warehouses and factories. On the outside, at least, many blocks remain almost unchanged.
 
Interest in New Offices
 Depending on the extent of the new districts, which would join one created last year, TriBeCa West, the designation may put the landmarks panel at odds not only with real-estate interests but with the City Planning Department, too.
That is because one of the proposed districts, TriBeCa South, includes the Church Street corridor, which city planners described in a recent study of lower Manhattan as an area that "may be appropriate for new office construction."
Since the existing five-story scale is a prime quality in many parts of TriBeCa, it seems improbable that the commission would approve anything like the new 52-story Tribeca Tower on Duane Street, between Church Street and Broadway, even though it was allowed by zoning rules.
Leslie Feldman, an owner of several properties in the proposed TriBeCa South district, said he worried that the commission would say, "Everything should be frozen."
 
Playing Down Conflict
 City planners, in an August study, noted a conflict between zoning and the proposed TriBeCa South district. They also cited reasons for development: Church Street is a main artery, subway stations are at hand and the area is close to the civic and financial centers.
Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the landmarks commission, minimized any potential conflict. She noted that the discussion was part of a study by the planning agency staff, not a formal report by the City Planning Commission, which will not review the districts until the landmarks panel has acted.
Ultimately the matter will go the City Council. "I don't know what side the Council will come down on," Ms. Beckelman said. "They did remove a few buildings from the TriBeCa West district, but on the whole, they kept the district we recommended."
But preservationists fear that the planning commission may recommend the deletion from the district of Reade Street, east of Church Street, and that the Council would go along. This block has a remarkably uniform fabric of five-story, mid-19th-century buildings, with arched and ornamented windows arrayed in almost regimental precision.
Hal Bromm, a leader of the local preservation movement for eight years, said that "the concern we have about the conflict on TriBeCa South is only heightened by the fact that the district is so tiny to begin with."
The chairman of the Council's landmarks subcommittee, Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat, would not discuss the new TriBeCa districts until they come before him. But generally speaking, he said, "The work of preserving history and architecture has to be viewed as economically important."
Under the plan, TriBeCa South would take in all or some of six blocks between West Broadway and Broadway, Chambers and Worth Streets.

HEADLINE: Texas View of Its Senator Is Quite Rosy, Of Course

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Not surprisingly, the news that President-elect Bill Clinton had settled on Senator Lloyd Bentsen as his Treasury Secretary was welcomed by the Texas business community.
"He has been in the business world, and he understands the necessity of jobs and economic growth," Norman Brinker, chairman and chief executive of Brinker International Inc., said. "I don't think he will do anything short-sighted that would compromise that." 
 A Republican who supported President Bush, Mr. Brinker said he was concerned that the Democratic White House would seek higher business taxes, raise the minimum wage and force business to make costly changes in health-care programs. His Dallas-based restaurant company has 30,000 employees and annual sales of $780 million. "Jobs cost money," he said. "In our industry, it's $20,000 of capital per job."
Mr. Bentsen would provide business with a sensible if not always sympathetic channel to the President, he said.
Ronald G. Steinhart, president of Bank One, Texas, the second-largest banking company in the state, said Mr. Bentsen's "tremendous knowledge" of the ways of Congress would be a great advantage for the Clinton Administration.
"I think he will be very high on business tax incentives to get the economy moving, and that reducing the Federal debt will be a very high priority," Mr. Steinhart said.
Bernard L. Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of North Texas, predicted Mr. Bentsen would be a "good counterweight" against forces in the Clinton Administration that are expected to favor higher taxes on business and wealthy individuals and Federal spending on new job programs of as much as $50 billion.
"He is a pragmatist, a compromiser and a leader," said Dr. Weinstein, who worked for Mr. Bentsen as a staff economist on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. "He is the best economist in the Congress. He is far and away the best choice for the job."

HEADLINE: Better Times May Lead Clinton to Focus on Deficit

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The economic team that President-elect Bill Clinton has chosen and a recent pickup in economic growth mean that Mr. Clinton is likely to take a tougher approach to reducing the Federal budget deficit than he expressed during the campaign, transition team members said this weekend.
In interviews, a number of advisers said the encouraging economic news and the likelihood that the President-elect would choose a deficit "hawk" to be his budget director made it less likely that Mr. Clinton would decide to push the deficit up temporarily to give the economy a quick jolt. 
 "If, come January, employment is substantially on the rebound, then obviously there's less need -- there may be no need -- to take immediate action" to stimulate the economy in the short term, Robert B. Reich, the head of Mr. Clinton's economic transition team, said.
Mr. Clinton's advisers have been weighing whether the Government should spend $20 billion to $50 billion more on public works next year with the aim of creating more than a million jobs. But, they said, the drop in the November unemployment rate to 7.2 percent, from 7.4 percent, is making them reconsider whether a stimulus program is needed. They add that if job growth stalls, action may be required.
 
Focus May Shift
 Mr. Clinton's apparent choice for Treasury Secretary, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, and the other members of the new economic team are expected to follow most of the economic proposals Mr. Clinton promoted during the campaign, the advisers say. Nonetheless, a few advisers suggested that Mr. Bentsen might seek to graft on some of his own ideas, like expanding individual retirement accounts in the hope of increasing the amount that Americans save.
Because of the surprisingly strong economic growth in recent weeks, transition team members said, Mr. Clinton may shift his economic focus away from short-term stimulus and toward long-term problems, like slow income growth, low investment and poor worker training.
Mr. Reich, who aides say is being considered to be Commerce Secretary or to run the proposed economic security council, said that "when job growth comes back, the long-term challenges will still be there." He said those included reducing the deficit, improving the quality of the work force, and rebuilding highways and other public works "to insure that our children have a higher standard of living."
Over the last decade, neither Senator Bentsen nor Mr. Reich has made deep reductions in the deficit a top priority, many economists say. But the other candidates whom Mr. Clinton is considering for his economic team are all known for tough views on the deficit. They include the two candidates favored to be budget director, Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Alice M. Rivlin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Roger C. Altman, an investment banker at the Blackstone Group who advisers say has been tapped to be Deputy Treasury Secretary, shares Wall Street's concerns about bringing down the deficit. So does Robert E. Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, who, like Mr. Reich, is being considered to run the economic security council.
One adviser said that because Mr. Bentsen, Mr. Panetta and Ms. Rivlin all knew their way around Congress, Mr. Clinton might find it easier to push some tough deficit-reduction measures through the House and Senate.
 
 
'Great Deal of Experience'
 Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said of Mr. Bentsen, "He certainly would bring to the job a great deal of expertise about the tax system and how revenues might be raised," as well as "the likely Congressional reaction to those proposals."
In the past, Mr. Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has favored tax breaks for the oil and gas industry and for real estate investment. But several Clinton advisers said they would expect him to put those preferences on the back burner while pushing for Mr. Clinton's agenda, which calls for increasing taxes on the rich.
Aides to Mr. Clinton say Mr. Panetta has the edge in the competition to be director of the Office of Management and Budget. He was one of the most outspoken Democrats in Congress for deficit reduction, and in an interview last month he said that as part of any economic program, Mr. Clinton's advisers needed to "lay out first and foremost their deficit-reduction plan."
"This is a guy who has talked about deficit reduction as an overarching goal," said Gary D. Bass, director of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal budget research group in Washington. "And I'd say Alice Rivlin has much the same viewpoint."
 
 
Possible Criticism
 Several advisers acknowledged that if the President-elect appoints Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta this week, the man who ran on a platform of change might be lambasted for turning his Administration over to pillars of the Washington status quo.
"Whatever the first week's perception of these people as Washington insiders, what the country cares about is whether or not you produce change," one Clinton adviser said, adding that with their contacts in Congress, Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta would lubricate the wheels of change.
As for the economic security council, Mr. Clinton's advisers admit they have not figured out its exact structure and scope. In proposing such a council during the campaign, Mr. Clinton sought to signal that he wanted to roll up his sleeves in taking on the economy and get tougher with America's trading partners.
At the least, Clinton aides say, the council will coordinate economic policy under an economic security adviser and supporting staff. It would resemble the National Security Council, and like that body would present policy options -- and perhaps recommendations -- to the President after consulting with other departments.
Mr. Clinton's advisers say the council will replace Mr. Bush's Economic Policy Council and will take a less piecemeal approach to stimulating the economy than previous such councils did. While past councils focused on taxes, deficits and regulation, the proposed council, they say, will also look at how schools, job training and technological research can be improved to make American industry more competitive. The council would also focus more on international issues, like removing foreign trade barriers.
 
 
'Honest Broker'
 That Mr. Clinton is weighing two very different men to run the council indicates that he has not made up his mind on what its role should be. Some advisers say the council should be run by an "honest broker" who would analyze proposals from Treasury, Labor, the Office of Management and Budget and other agencies and then impartially present policy options to the President.
Some advisers say Mr. Rubin of Goldman, Sachs would be well suited for this role. He does not have a policy ax to grind and has shown considerable managerial talent, and this might help him get this new council running smoothly.
Under another view, the council would not just coordinate policy, but would develop new ideas. The problem with this structure, aides say, is that other agencies might conclude that the council too often favors its own proposals over those from other agencies.
If Mr. Clinton decided that the council should be a hothouse of policy ideas, several advisers said, then Mr. Reich, a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, would be best as the economic security adviser.
In an interview this weekend, Mr. Reich said Mr. Clinton had not totally written off the idea of a short-term stimulus plan.
 
 
'Bringing Jobs Back'
 "We'll be looking closely at every indicator between now and Inauguration Day which sheds light on whether jobs are really coming back," he said. "Bill Clinton is committed to bringing jobs back, and he'll do what's necessary to accomplish that."
Even if the economy continues to pick up, he said, Mr. Clinton would still probably embrace a plan to give tax credits to businesses when they buy new equipment -- a measure aimed at making American industry more competitive over the long term.
Mr. Reich voiced fears that many Americans would conclude that as the economy gathered steam, its long-term problems had gone away.
"If people say that the economy is recovering and thus there is no need for Clinton's economic plan, then they fail to understand what we're getting at when we talk about improving the quality of American jobs and earnings," he said.
Mr. Reich said that if any national leader was capable "of using the bully pulpit to maintain that focus on the long term, even when the economy is recovering, it's Bill Clinton."

HEADLINE: New Rules For Rating Insurers

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Insurance regulators from all 50 states approved a new standard yesterday for measuring the financial strength of life and health insurance companies.
The new yardstick, similar to the one used for commercial banks, is intended to make it easier for policyholders and investors to evaluate insurers. Regulators also hope it will help reduce the number of failures, which has been rising in recent years. Among those that have collapsed were the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark and the insurance units of the First Executive Corporation in Los Angeles. 
 "It means that insurance regulators will have another arrow in their quiver to use in protecting the solvency of the life and health insurance industry," William H. McCartney, Nebraska's Director of Insurance and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said after the vote at the group's annual winter meeting in Atlanta.
The model law, which sets thresholds for regulatory action, must be adopted by each state. Mr. McCartney said that the association had moved slowly so as not to make any grave mistake in drawing up regulatory mandates and that he expected all states to adopt the model.
The uniform formula contrasts sharply with the current system, in which each state has its own criteria for rating insurers and taking action against troubled ones.
Companies like A. M. Best & Company grade insurance companies, but the new system is the first tied to state enforcement.
Under the plan, called the life risk-based capital model law, insurance companies will be rated on how much capital they have to buttress the risk inherent in their investments and operations. A score of 100 percent or more will suggest an insurer is healthy because it has met or surpassed its risk-based capital requirement. Those that score below 100 will be subject automatically to action by regulators.
Companies scoring above 35 percent but under 50 percent could be seized by regulators, for example. Those scoring at least 50 percent but below 75 percent would be ordered to take specific action. Those with a rating of at least 75 percent but less than 100 would have to file a plan with state regulators to bolster their risk-based capital.
 
Many Executives Critical
 Many industry executives have criticized the new rule as potentially misleading to consumers. Others believe the standard may hamstring companies' competitiveness if they must sell high-risk assets, such as real estate, common stock or junk bonds, and shift increasingly to safer government bonds.
Insurance companies will have to post their ratings in their 1993 annual reports, which will be published in the spring of 1994, and in each annual report after that.
Life insurance companies have contended that the scores should be kept secret because some insurance agents may use them to criticize competitors, thereby misleading consumers.
 
Use in Ads Prohibited
 Regulators have added a provision banning the use of scores in sales or promotional materials.
The lines of argument against the grading system have been played out often in recent months. Richard H. Jenrette, chairman and chief executive of the Equitable Companies, said in October that insurance commissioners should have delayed their vote by six months "or pending some further sign of rejuvenation of the economy."
He argued that it was a mistake to enforce new capital adequacy requirements "in the face of what has become a worldwide recession and worldwide asset deflation." Mr. Jenrette was not available for comment yesterday.
Insurance industry regulators are researching a similar measure for the more complex property and casualty insurance industry. That is expected to take at least another year.

HEADLINE: If Only Barry Bonds Were Too Expensive

 BODY:
IF only a snag in the Barry Bonds deal with the as yet unapproved new owners of the Giants had developed earlier.
If only the Giants' new owners had done what the Yankees and the Red Sox did: spurned the sixth year in the contract sought by Bonds and Dennis Gilbert, the 28-year-old outfielder's agent. 
 If only none of the 28 teams wanted Bonds at what turned out to be the Giants new owners' price: $43.75 million for six years.
If only no team wanted him, sooner or later Gilbert would've said, "We've decided we'll take a five-year contract."
If only all 28 major league teams then decided that even for five years, Bonds was too expensive.
If only all 28 major league teams decided that for even four, three or two seasons, or for even one season, Bonds was too expensive.
If only that had happened, Bonds and Gilbert would have hollered "collusion."
If only that had happened, the 28 teams would have hollered: "It's not collusion. It's collateral. We can't afford to pay the money Bonds wants. He's just too expensive." So expensive he had priced himself out of the major league market. Priced himself out of baseball.
If only.
But there's always been one team that thinks it can afford the most expensive baseball player. In the beginning of the free-agent era, with George Steinbrenner offering millions, the Yankees were that team. Through the years, the Angels, the Dodgers, the Mets and the Padres paid the big bucks. Now the as yet unapproved new owners of the Giants are paying top dollar.
Yes, the same Giants who appeared on their way to St. Petersburg, Fla., until a San Francisco group was allowed to purchase the franchise from Bob Lurie for $100 million, $15 million less than the St. Petersburg buyers had offered.
By agreeing to Bonds's price, the new owners of the Giants obviously wanted to make a statement: that money will be no object in trying to create a pennant contender and trying to attract more than last season's attendance of 1,561,987 to Candlestick Park despite the usual chill and the wild winds that swirl on the backside of San Francisco Bay.
But the new owners not only jumped the gun in negotiating the Bonds deal but may have shot themselves in the foot with it.
If the other club owners don't think any player is worth $43.75 million for six seasons, they may disapprove the Giants' sale.
Suddenly in the middle of all this is the head of the Giants' new owners: Peter Magowan, the president of Safeway Inc.
If a loaf of bread suddenly costs more at a Safeway supermarket, inflation won't be blamed. Barry Bonds, the new Giants owners and Peter Magowan will be blamed. That's the flip side of their collaboration in negotiating to break baseball's contract record: an average of $7,291,667 a season for six seasons.
"I want to do the best job I can for my client," Gilbert has been saying recently. "The best should be paid the best."
Over the last few seasons, Barry Bonds has been baseball's best player. No argument. But he never shone in any of the last three National League championship series, each of which the Pirates lost. If his deal is eventually signed, his burden will be to lift the Giants not only to the N.L. West title, but to the pennant and to a tray of World Series rings.
If Bonds does that for the Giants, he'll be a bargain at $43.75 million. If he doesn't, he'll be hooted in his hometown.
Bonds grew up in San Carlos, Calif., not far from Candlestick Park, where his father, Bobby, was an All-Star Giants outfielder two decades ago. His father now would be the Giants' batting coach, as Barry had demanded. Maybe that's one reason Barry accepted the Giants' offer even though he knew that the Candlestick Park chill might reduce the numbers he put up in Three Rivers Stadium.
Going home, or staying home, has been the trend so far in this year's free-agent auction.
Doug Drabek, who has a home in Houston, and Greg Swindell, who grew up in Houston, signed four-year contracts with the Astros for $19.5 million and $17 million, respectively.
Kirby Puckett decided to remain in Minnesota even though it cost him a total of $5 million.
"Who's to say that you will be much happier elsewhere?" the Twins' center fielder said. "The grass isn't always greener on the other side. I'm happy to be a Minnesota Twin for the rest of my career."
Not that Puckett sold himself cheap. He got $30 million for five years. But the Red Sox and the Phillies reportedly offered him more.
"Breaking contract records," his agent, Ron Shapiro, said, "is not a goal in and of itself."
Puckett realized that he's happy with the life style he and his family have in Minneapolis, that he's happy playing for the Twins, that it wasn't worth another $1 million a year to risk being unhappy somewhere else. That's why he is who he is: one of the most likable and loyal players in baseball. One of the wisest, too.
If only there were more like Kirby Puckett. If only.

Thud! Economic Report Lands on Baseball's Desk

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 6

 BODY:
A long-awaited study committee report on baseball's economics recommends that players be eligible for free agency after three years instead of six, a move that would eliminate salary arbitration. The committee also recommends that clubs increase the amount of revenue they would share among themselves in order to protect financially weaker teams and that clubs and players enter into a partnership for the future financial benefit of the industry.
The report, which was supposed to have been completed by Sept. 1, 1991, was distributed to the clubs last week. A copy of it was obtained today by The New York Times from a member of management. 
 Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association, and Bud Selig, chairman of the Player Relations Committee's board of directors, declined to comment on the report.
 
Fehr Isn't Happy
 Fehr was angry when he learned that the report had become public. Selig agreed that "it wasn't supposed to be out for a while," adding he wanted the clubs and players to digest it before he says anything.
The report surfaced on the eve of a critical meeting Monday at which the owners will decide whether or not to reopen the collective bargaining agreement. They have until Friday to notify the Players Association whether they want to to reopen a year ahead of the contract's expiration.
The owners will enter the meeting sharply divided on the issue. Even owners who favor reopening acknowledge that the group is evenly divided.
Some owners oppose reopening because they don't want to put themselves in a position where, barring a new agreement, they would lock out the players next spring. Some of those owners also are among the opponents to reopening who don't want to adopt the increased revenue sharing that Richard Ravitch, their chief labor executive, has proposed.
 
A Compromise Plan
 A compromise plan was floated recently under which the labor contract would be reopened, but the owners would pledge not to lock out the players and the players would pledge not to strike. The plan, however, was rejected by the hard-line element of the owners who want to reopen, and the players never were formally asked to agree to it.
The proponents of reopening believe they have added ammunition in the flurry of free-agent signings the past week, especially the series of four-year contracts given to pitchers. Those owners argue that the contracts show how important it is to negotiate a new system now.
"We're not getting it done," one owner said.
But a reopener opponent countered, "They're saying we should save them from themselves."
 
Report Contains Audit
 The economic study report suggests ways of saving baseball from the potentially catastrophic events that owners generally predict but that players view with skepticism. The report was compiled by the four independent members of the committee: Henry Aaron (not the former Braves star) and David Feller, who were appointed by the players, and Peter Goldmark and Paul Volcker, who were named by the clubs.
The report includes an accounting audit of club financial figures for the 1991 season, the latest report that has been compiled. The audit shows that industrywide profits from baseball operations fell 31 percent, from $142,867,000 to $98,953,000. Since earning record profits in 1989 of $214,509,000, the 26 clubs have seen their profits drop 54 percent.
The report shows that from 1990 to 1991, operating revenues rose from $1,336,530,000 to $1,537,395,000 and operating expenses from $1,193,663,000 to $1,438,442,000. It says club projections indicate that the industry will suffer substantial losses in 1993 and 1994.
 
The Free-Agent Issue
 In probably the report's most interesting recommendation, the committee suggested that reducing the eligibility for free agency from six years to three could benefit both sides.
The change would eliminate salary arbitration, a procedure basically for players with three to six years of major league service. The clubs hate arbitration more than free agency because they cannot control the players' salaries when an aribtrator is involved. The change also could lead, the committee said, to an increased number of long-term guaranteed contracts by which clubs would retain promising players.
"We have not agreed," the report stated, "to recommend any changes in the rules governing player compensation other than the reduction in the service requirement for free agency from six to three years."
On the subject of revenue sharing among clubs, the report noted that such arrangements have not been updated "to reflect enormous recent changes in revenue sources."
As an example, the committee said, "The fixed nominal payment to visiting clubs in the National League represents a steadily declining share of steadily rising ticket prices. Such practices may have made sense a century ago. They are now inadequate to bridge current disparities in revenue among the clubs."
It is vital, the report said, to "fashion a mechanism that will support the financially weaker teams."
"A number of existing and potential revenue sources could be dedicated in whole or in part to an extended revenue sharing arrangement," the study added.

HEADLINE: The Senate's Ethical House of Cards

 BODY:
Acting expeditiously, the Senate Ethics Committee has started a preliminary inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment lodged against Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon. But the committee still owes a better response on another unpleasant matter: the strange case of Senator Phil Gramm's vacation home.
The home-building bargain afforded Mr. Gramm, a Texas Republican who is a leading member of the Senate Banking Committee, was disclosed last week by The Times's Jeff Gerth and Dean Baquet. Under a highly unusual arrangement -- there was no written estimate or contract -- Mr. Gramm paid a builder who also operated three troubled savings and loans only $63,433 of the $117,000 it cost to complete a two-story waterfront house in rural Maryland. 
 Mr. Gramm then gave the builder, Jerry Stiles, help -- "routine" according to the Senator -- as the builder defended himself against complaints by savings and loan regulators. The Senator advised Mr. Stiles privately and repeatedly passed his letters to regulators with cover notes urging that they listen to his requests.
Mr. Gramm says he received no special favors from the builder. But it's hard to imagine any ordinary citizen getting such a nifty deal. Why did Mr. Gramm hire a Texan who specialized in large subdivisions to put up a house in Maryland? Mr. Gramm's explanation -- that he wanted to stimulate the Texas economy -- seems odd at best.
So do other aspects of his account. He says, for example, he did not learn that Mr. Stiles had picked up nearly half the cost of his house until two years later, in late 1989, when he called a carpenter who worked on the house about another job.
Mr. Gramm says he immediately sent a check for the difference and asked for the Ethics Committee's advice. It's conceivable he was motivated to do so by the news, conveyed by the carpenter, that the F.B.I. was investigating.
In any case, Mr. Gramm didn't end up paying. Chairman Howell Heflin and vice chairman Warren Rudman of the Ethics Committee gave Mr. Gramm a letter declaring that Mr. Stiles's $53,567 contribution to the Senator's home was merely a contractual cost overrun, and not a "gift" under Senate rules. They relied only on affidavits from Mr. Gramm and Mr. Stiles, and skirted the committee's own public disclosure rules. Their letter may have discouraged further investigation by both the F.B.I. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The haste to give this suspicious-looking transaction a clean bill of health comes as no surprise, not after the committee's weak-kneed disposition of the contemporaneous Keating Five case. The committee has also responded lamely to ethics charges against Republican Senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
Indeed, the Ethics Committee has only itself to blame if the public smells a cover-up. The committee owes immediately a full accounting of its handling of the Gramm case. If that fails to clear the air, it needs to open an investigation into Mr. Gramm's peculiar home financing, or explain publicly why the scrutiny isn't warranted.

HEADLINE: Lloyd Bentsen: Insider at Treasury

 BODY:
By choosing Senator Lloyd Bentsen to be his Treasury Secretary, President-elect Bill Clinton would gain instant clout in Congress for his legislative package. Mr. Bentsen, who has run the Finance Committee with an iron first, won't need any road maps to guide him through the corridors of Capitol Hill.
Mr. Bentsen will also be well received on Wall Street and Main Street. The Texan has been a pragmatic legislator whose generally conservative views on tax and budget policies won't threaten business investors or foreign leaders. 
 He's shrewd. He's tenacious. He's statesmanlike. He's effective. That's a lot of positives.
But there's another, troubling side to Mr. Bentsen's record. Rather than the "new kind of Democrat" Mr. Clinton vowed to bring to power, he's the polished insider who has too easily sacrificed fiscal prudence for undeserving special interests. He's fought for loopholes for real estate investors, the oil and gas industry and other corporate interests. Worse, he's resorted to budget trickery to get his way.
Mr. Bentsen single-handedly got Congress to reinstate tax subsidies for retirement savings of wealthy families in the 1992 urban aid bill. The provision was carefully rigged to pay for itself for five years, as technically required by the budget law. But after five years, the provision would have opened up a gaping deficit.
Rather than serving the sublime purpose of raising savings, as Mr. Bentsen advertised, his provision would be little more than a windfall for the rich. It would have become law had President Bush not vetoed the bill for unrelated reasons. But what, taxpayers will want to ask, if there had been a Democrat in the White House?
That said, Mr. Bentsen's views do square with most of Bill Clinton's program. He would probably be comfortable raising investment in infrastructure, education and training, even if that meant only gradually reducing the deficit. And his yeoman efforts to beef up health programs for poor children fit nicely with Mr. Clinton's promise to bring affordable health care to every American.
More than most Presidential candidates, Mr. Clinton staked out firm positions on many economic issues. The role of his Cabinet, especially Treasury Secretary, will be to translate those positions into law. On that score, Mr. Bentsen should be a gem.

HEADLINE: Vacated Corporate Headquarters Scatter the Suburban Landscape

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Dec. 3

 BODY:
After more than 20 years as a magnet for large corporations, the lush suburban landscape of Fairfield County, Conn., has become home to hundreds of vacant executive offices that analysts say are among the worst white elephants of American business.
It was places like Stamford, Greenwich, Westport, Fairfield and Danbury that provided new and spacious homes for the first large wave of corporations that moved from Manhattan in the late 1960's and the 1970's, beginning a trend that permanently decentralized big business in the New York region. 
 But the takeovers, leveraged buyouts and reorganizations of the 1980's -- compounded by the recession -- have wiped out or drastically shrunk many of those companies, which can no longer use all the suburban space they created for themselves. And experts say that because of bad judgments in the design and location of the offices, many have been unable to attract new tenants.
The situation is hurting the companies themselves, the real-estate industry and the banks that have foreclosed on some of the properties. And the problem also weighs heavily on some Fairfield County towns, which were reluctant to accept large corporate complexes in the first place. Many exacted promises from the corporations not to subdivide the office space for new tenants, but now have been forced to negotiate new terms.
 
Not 'Jobs Machines'
 "It is bad luck for Fairfield that there was a lot of myopic decision making," said James Hughes, an urban planner at Rutgers University in New Jersey. "These companies were to be the great American jobs machines. We know differently now."
To be sure, Fairfield remains a vibrant center of business. The county is home to more than 25 major multinational corporations, giving it the nation's third-largest concentration of corporate offices, behind New York City and Chicago.
Nor have all the headquarters and large corporate divisions that left New York City for the suburbs proven disappointments. In this county, the Xerox Corporation, the GTE Corporation, the General Electric Company and others have flourished.
In Westchester County, Pepsico, Texaco and other major corporations settled into suburban settings, while New Jersey has attracted others from New York, including the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Merrill Lynch.
But the experts say Fairfield County's vacant and near-vacant headquarters buildings stand as monuments to corporate planning gone awry, and may provide object lessons for the region, where the competition for business remains fierce between states, counties and cities.
"One lesson we've learned is that if you create a unique suburban setting for one company, there is a great risk, at some point, that it will no longer want the space," said Al Remsen, executive vice president of William Pitt Commercial Real Estate, a brokerage in Stamford trying to find tenants for several corporate buildings.
Some analysts have criticized the relocations to Fairfield for more than a decade, saying they were prompted largely by a desire among senior executives to seek a more comfortable business setting than they had in Manhattan. Now, the most severe critics say, that the shortsighted desire for pleasant surroundings has proved emblematic of the companies' inability to cope with far larger problems in their global markets.
"They deserved what they got," said William H. Whyte, a New York City urban analyst who studied the relocations to Fairfield County extensively for his 1988 book, "City: Rediscovering the Center."
 
Closer to Home, Literally
 He looked at 31 relocations to Greenwich and Stamford from the late 1960's to 1976 and found that, in almost every case, the new suburban office was closer to the chairman's home. The average commuting distance for the chairmen was eight miles, Mr. Whyte said.
Other experts say the relocations were not the problem.
"There is no convincing evidence that these companies would have done any better if they had kept their headquarters in Manhattan," said Karen Gerard, a former New York City deputy mayor for finance under Edward I. Koch, and now executive vice president of Moran, Stahl & Boyer, a firm that advises corporations on relocation.
"But they didn't need crystal balls to know the world was becoming a more competitive place," Ms. Gerard added. "They should have planned for more flexibility."
The office vacancy rate in Fairfield County is 24.5 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real-estate company; before the recession set in in 1988, the rate was below 15 percent.
 
A Corporate Orphan
 Cushman & Wakefield said only three other urban or suburban areas have higher office vacancies: West Palm Beach, Fla., Hartford, and northern New Jersey. But real-estate analysts said most vacancies in the other areas -- particularly in New Jersey -- were in multipurpose buildings suitable for many tenants, which are likely to have an easier time attracting new tenants than the specialized headquarters of Fairfield.
One of the orphans of corporate life in Fairfield is the former headquarters of the Singer Corporation. A maker of sewing machines and advanced aerospace products, Singer moved from Rockefeller Center in Manhattan to a new glass-and-steel building in Stamford in 1978.
But by the mid-1980's, Singer faced huge debts, had sold off its flagship sewing-machine business, and was shedding other operations. In 1988, it was acquired by Paul A. Bilzerian, a New York City investor, who sold most of its remaining assets and moved its headquarters to Tampa, Fla. In 1989 Mr. Bilzerian was convicted of violating Federal securities law and is in prison.
Now, the former Singer headquarters remains in downtown Stamford along with the home bases of GTE, Champion International Corporation and the General Reinsurance Company. Other tenants have taken 60 percent of the space formerly occupied by Singer, but the rest remains vacant. "At least it is in a downtown setting," Mr. Remsen said. "Other buildings are going to be harder to dispose of."
 
What Could Have Been
 Some of the most troubling prospects for Fairfield's towns and real-estate industry, as well as banks that have foreclosed on corporate buildings, are those that were carved into long-established residential enclaves, or on remote wooded acreage.
Several were built only after lengthy negotiations with town officials, and with firm assurances that they would never be subdivided or altered for other tenants.
One is the former headquarters of the American Can Company, built in the late 1960's on 150 acres of wooded acreage here. American Can moved from Manhattan in 1970. "It could have been a golf course, and what a magnificent thing that would have been," said James Sandy, Greenwich's director of planning.
 
Renegotiating Terms
 Less than five years after the move, the company began disposing of its manufacturing operations, shedding management employees and transforming itself into a financial services company with far stronger roots in Manhattan than Greenwich. In the early 1980's, American Can renamed itself the Primerica Corporation and left Greenwich.
In a five-year legal battle, Primerica tried to alter the original commitment by American Can to never subdivide its Greenwich building for other tenants. In 1990, Mr. Sandy said, Greenwich officials agreed to allow Primerica to seek several tenants, but not to exceed 1,700 workers in the building, the most employed by American Can in the 1970's.
Despite aggressive marketing efforts, the Greenwich complex remains without a single tenant.
In other cases, tenants have been found for Fairfield County's vacant corporate buildings, but not without heated negotiations between town and business officials. Perhaps the most innovative approach came in Stamford, where GTE abandoned a 10-story building before construction was complete in 1986.
The building was to have housed GTE's regional telephone company subsidiaries, but GTE decided to move the subsidiaries to Dallas instead.
The building was purchased for $45 million by the City of Stamford, which has made it its new City Hall and Government Center, consolidating dozens of city agencies that had been housed in several older buildings. Many citizens protested that the purchase was extravagant, but nearly all the space is now filled by city agencies and the Board of Education.
Real-estate executives in Fairfield say one of the county's most difficult blocks of corporate space to fill may be in the headquarters complex of the Union Carbide Corporation in Danbury, where the company developed 100 wooded acres in 1980.
Union Carbide's headquarters, a circular complex, was derided by architecture critics from the time of its completion. But Union Carbide soon had far more serious problems.
In 1984, the company was embroiled in the chemical disaster at its plant in Bhopal, India. It also faced financial problems in the United States and elsewhere, and it sold off several large divisions, including its automotive-products and household-goods businesses, by the end of the 1980's.
Union Carbide's building is now 30 percent vacant.
 
A Bitter Battle
 Another corporate void is in Westport, where the Stauffer Chemical Corporation developed 53 acres -- formerly a diary farm -- in 1970. It built an impeccably landscaped "corporate campus," with five buildings surrounding a broad lawn, but only after assuring Westport officials that the complex would never be used by more than one tenant.
The commitment proved a problem by the mid-1980's, when Stauffer was dismantled in a series of hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts. By 1988, its Westport complex was vacant.
Like Greenwich and Primerica, Westport and Stauffer engaged in a bitter fight over the fate of the complex. In 1989, in an out-of-court settlement, the town agreed to allow as many as 20 tenants in the complex.
 
Looking Backward
 Although corporate tenants have now rented half the space in the complex, its layout and design are a handicap, and new entrances and lobbies are under construction to allow easier access by several tenants.
Westport officials now say they are ambivalent about the town's decision 20 years ago to accept any corporate headquarters.
"It seemed to fit at the time, it brought office space closer to a lot of commuters, and it preserved open space," said Kathy Barnard, the town's director of planning and zoning, adding that the Stauffer site might have been developed for a factory if not a corporate campus.
"But we know now that if they had built something suitable for multiple tenants, it would be a lot easier to manage," she said.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Monday with an article about vacated corporate buildings in the suburbs misidentified the picture at the left. It showed a building built for GTE that now houses Stamford city offices. The picture at the center, labeled the GTE building, was the company's corporate headquarters, also in Stamford.

For the Real Potholes, See Moynihan

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"ISN'T it about time we had a Senator" rivals George Wallace's "send them a message" as a campaign slogan that resoundingly struck a responsive chord. The time was 1970. The would-be Senator was James L. Buckley. The "we" were New Yorkers who for one reason or another felt disenfranchised.
Mr. Buckley, the Conservative Party candidate, won a three-way race. But a political power shortage that left New York State less franchised for nearly half a century has finally been rectified by Mr. Buckley's successor. This fall, after the death of Senator Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, Daniel Patrick Moynihan took over the Environment and Public Works Committee, becoming the first full-fledged Senate committee chairman from New York since Robert F. Wagner Sr. The father of the former Mayor of New York City and the grandfather of the former Board of Education president headed the Banking and Currency Committee until the Democrats lost control of the Senate in 1946. 
 If Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas joins the Clinton Administration as Treasury Secretary -- the announcement is expected this week -- Mr. Moynihan will automatically ascend to the chairmanship of the Finance Committee. Only three New Yorkers have headed the committee, the last, Daniel Dickinson, in 1849. By Senate standards, Mr. Moynihan's rise has been meteoric since he was first elected in 1976. When he got a seat on the Finance Committee after lobbying vigorously, he became the first New Yorker to serve on that panel, possibly the Senate's most powerful, since 1927.
In the House, where disparate New Yorkers have not been known as team players, Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, has risen to fourth rank on the Ways and Means Committee. Two other New Yorkers, the investment bankers Roger C. Altman and Robert E. Rubin, appear likely to be offered top economic posts by Mr. Clinton.
As the committee's second-ranking Democrat in seniority, Mr. Moynihan automatically inherited the chairmanship of Environment and Public Works in September when Mr. Burdick died. The committee's traditional credo has been "give a dam," the sort of government handout that may not ordinarily rank high on the agenda of urban coalitions.
But Mr. Moynihan has already derived more benefits for his home state from log rolling than from the pork barrel. He is credited with legislation to increase job-related mass transit subsidies and projects ranging from the belated repainting of the Hell Gate railroad bridge to the planned revival of the 42d Street trolley. Now, watch the groundswell develop for Mr. Moynihan's proposed magnetic-levitation express train from the Bronx to Buffalo.
"We have currency," Mr. Moynihan said. "Everybody needs something from Environment and Public Works. Either something they don't want in their state or something they have to have. Every senator who wants a dam has a committee from which we may want something." And everybody wants something from Finance.
Senator Jacob K. Javits headed the Republican Committee on Commitees. His successor, Alfonse M. D'Amato, has risen to ranking minority member on the banking committee. He headed a securities subcommittee, and, even as a member of the minority, has won a reputation for helping his constituents and contributors.
But in comparing the priorities of New York's two Senators, potholes versus policy is an oversimplification. Mr. Moynihan is known as the more cerebral Senator. He does not dispute that characterization. But he challenges two other perceptions: that he rarely delivers and that Mr. D'Amato always does.
Still, while Mr. Moynihan dutifully campaigned for the Democratic challenger, Attorney General Robert Abrams, he avoided dumping on Mr. D'Amato publicly. "It's the culture of the place," he said.
Mr. Moynihan's appreciation of the Senate's culture, coupled with its strict seniority system, his own sense of history and the inauguration of a Democrat as President, endows him with vast influence. But getting local officials to translate legislation into reality is another matter, even when money is appropriated.
"We can't even build a trolley across 42d Street," the Senator said. "We got money to scoop up PCB's from the Hudson, but 14 years went by because New York State can't find one-quarter acre to put them on. So we can't eat the bass that stopped the state from building Westway. We have not had the executive capacity to do something we decided was worth doing."
Few people doubt his capacity, or his potential, whether or not he always realizes it.

Diamandis Resurges in Cable Effort

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
In a long-expected comeback, Peter G. Diamandis, a dominant figure in the magazine industry until he was abruptly dismissed from Hachette Magazines in 1990, will resurface as a publisher of cable television guides.
TVSM Inc., publisher of The Cable Guide and Total TV, said that on Jan. 15 it would split into two companies. One of them, called TVSM, will continue to publish the monthly Cable Guide, which has a circulation of six million. A new company, Total TV Inc., will publish the weekly Total TV. Mr. Diamandis, 61 years old, will be chairman of both companies. 
 "If there is any industry that boomed during the recession, it's been the cable industry," said Mr. Diamandis, who spent 21 months negotiating the restructuring of TVSM. "Our goal is infinite. We expect to be a major force in the magazine business."
 
A Tricky Business
 Publishing cable guides is a tricky business. The average home now has 36 cable channels. But new technology involving fiber optics and digital compression raises the possibility that some systems may be able to provide 500 or more channels to cable subscribers by the end of the decade. Cable guide publishers have to figure out how -- and in what form -- a magazine will be able to print this much information.
To make matters worse, channel lineups vary from system to system. For instance, WLIW can be seen on Channel 21 on Cablevision on Long Island, on Channel 10 on Paragon Cable in parts of Manhattan, and on Channel 34 on Manhattan Cable in other parts of the borough. A cable publisher needs three different "system-specific" editions for cable subscribers to know what channel to turn to even though all live in the same area.
Cable television guides have encountered increasing competition from television supplements in Sunday newspapers, but the ever larger number of cable channels will make it more and more difficult for these supplements to remain viable. On the other hand, electronic on-screen television guides, which are now being developed, will eventually allow viewers to call up television schedules on their computers or television screens to find out what is on.
 
Precarious Finances
 TVSM was started in 1980 by a group of investors and the Chase Manhattan Bank, which originally lent the company some $60 million. The Cable Guide is sold to cable operators, which in turn distribute it to their subscribers, and the magazine makes a profit. But decisions to take it from digest size to a larger size three years ago and the introduction of a weekly magazine cost the company about $10 million and put it in a precarious financial position.
In February 1991, Chase Manhattan called in Mr. Diamandis as a consultant on how to solve the cable company's problems. He said he suggested bringing in cable system operators as minority partners.
TVSM, publisher of the monthly Cable Guide, decided to enter into distribution agreements with some cable systems operators: Time Warner Cable in Stamford, Conn.; Continental in Boston; Comcast in Philadelphia and Cox in Atlanta. Subsidiaries of these companies have been given equity in the company.
Chase has refinanced about $40 million at lower interest rates and remains a minority stockholder, a person close to the negotiations said.
Mr. Diamandis said TVSM had to split into two companies because some cable operators were interested only in the monthly magazine and others in the weekly.
Total TV Inc. will take over publishing of the weekly Total TV, which has a circulation of 225,000. It will merge with Total, a weekly cable guide published by the Atlantic Cable Television Publishing Corporation for the Cablevision Systems Corporation of Woodbury, L.I. The merged magazine will have a total circulation of 425,000.
"Both properties will be in the black as of Jan. 15," Mr. Diamandis said. "We expect the weekly to grow to well over a million by 1994."
The dominant weekly in the industry is the mammoth TV Guide with its circulation of 15 million. It is the third largest magazine in the country after Modern Maturity and Reader's Digest, and it has many of the same advertisers as The Cable Guide.
"I just don't see this as having any real bearing on our business," said Joseph W. Cece, TV Guide's president and publisher, referring to the revamping of TVSM. "The Cable Guide has been out for years, and it has gone from 10 million to under 6 million. It doesn't really seem to affect my business.
"As for the weekly, the fact that a couple of competing cable guides are combining two money-losing magazines with a combined circulation of 400,000 just means that Cablevision gets out from under the burden of publishing a magazine on its own.
"And all I can tell you is that the publishing economics of publishing weekly system-specific versions of TV Guide is a very expensive proposition," Mr. Cece said. "Time Warner lost $50 million trying to publish TV Cable Week."
Richard Sperry, vice president for marketing of Comcast Corporation, a cable operator in the Philadelphia area that will obtain equity in TVSM, hailed the completion of the deal. "It frees TVSM to move ahead and to start marketing and promoting a weekly guide and competing on a more aggressive basis," he said.
Frank Smith, vice president and group director of the print services group of the ad agency Young & Rubicam, said that Mr. Diamandis "is certainly a man who has credibility in the print marketplace."
The magazine industry has been buzzing for a long time about what Mr. Diamandis might do next. In the 1970's he was the founding publisher of Conde Nast's highly successful Self. In the early 80's, he reversed the tide for Women's Day, then owned by CBS Inc. In 1983 he became president of the CBS magazine group and led a management group that paid CBS $650 million for 21 magazines. He sold off nine for $250 million and the rest to Hachette for another $712 million, reportedly making a profit of $312 million, which he shared with publishers, editors and even secretaries.
