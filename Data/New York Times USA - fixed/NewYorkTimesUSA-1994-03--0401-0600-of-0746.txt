HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Heartstrings, not heartbeats, drive Chevy's new campaign.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky 

 BODY:
BY Chevrolet's accounting, four times in recent history the flagship division of General Motors has "redefined" what Chevrolet means to life in the United States through its advertising campaigns.
The first came in the 1950's when Dinah Shore told Americans in song to "See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet." Twenty years later, an oil crisis reminded Americans of the perils of economic dependence, and Chevrolet responded with nationalist pride, advertising itself as an All-American icon, along with baseball, hot dogs and apple pie. Then came the invasion of Japanese cars in the 1980's and more nationalism -- Chevrolets as the heartbeat of America. 
 Well, the fourth moment has arrived. Drumroll, please:
Genuine Chevrolet.
No, that's it.
Genuine Chevrolet.
Beginning on Monday night, with a two-minute commercial during the Academy Awards telecast on ABC, those two words, Genuine Chevrolet, will serve as the backbone of a big print and broadcast campaign designed to return Chevrolet to a position of prominence in the American consciousness.
But what does that mean, Genuine Chevrolet? Does that mean that current Chevrolet cars and trucks are not genuine? Does that mean that the nation's 36 million Chevy owners have been driving the metaphoric equivalent of Jarvik hearts and frozen apple pies? Does that mean that unscrupulous dealers have been disguising other cars as Chevrolets and pawning them off on unsuspecting customers?
Not exactly.
At a press conference yesterday, Chevrolet executives stressed that Genuine Chevrolet was no mere slogan. These words reflect a bold, new "way of life" for the Chevrolet family, said Jim C. Perkins, a General Motors vice president and Chevrolet's general manager. "They will be more than a blip on the radar screen."
Never mind what that might say about Chevrolet's previous way of life. But in truth, that is what gave rise to the change.
The new campaign, developed by Lintas Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., evolved out of Chevrolet's rocky goings of the last two decades, caused in part by the car maker's failure to respond effectively enough to the ever-changing American tastes in style, quality and pricing. In that context, the new campaign ostensibly projects what Chevrolet promises to be, with better products, better features, better service, better value, better dealers, better prices. The aim is to reverse the downturn within the next few years or so.
"We can't just ask people to trust us," Mr. Perkins said. "We have to prove where we are."
But to convince buyers that a fundamental change is under way, the new advertisements rely heavily on something altogether different. They reflect the past. They challenge the memory. In a gauzy, touchy-feely montage with sweet piano music in the background, the two-minute commercial features Chevrolets of all ages, including a 1953 Corvette and a 1956 wagon, familiar American scenery, like the Golden Gate Bridge and lots of smiling people.
The overall feeling is one of reminiscence -- of a first date, a special friend, the first car you owned or the car you dreamed of owning -- with the message that sometime in life, something good happened to you and a Chevrolet played a part -- unless, of course, it was a Caprice or a Corsica. As the company's white elephants of recent years, they were not included in the commercial.
So in general, the idea seems to be that if you buy a new Chevrolet, something good will happen to you, a rationale determined by market research. Market research convinced Chevrolet executives that the best words to convey those feelings were, Genuine Chevrolet. By Chevrolet's data, among people under 35 years old, 92 percent said Genuine Chevrolet caused "extremely positive" or "very positive" feelings toward Chevrolet, with a margin of error of 5 percent. Older people felt the same way by more than 4 to 1.
If true, that should translate into dramatic improvements in sales.
But it should not be too surprising if those buyers of the new Chevrolets are mostly white Americans. For all the pretty pictures flashing by, the soothing music and earnest explanations of what the company is becoming, nearly all the people having a good time in the two-minute commercial are white.
Other than one black woman with a baby in her arms, another by herself and a little girl who appears to be Asian, the commercial is populated only by white people, one of whom looks a lot like Luke Perry, the television star.
Mr. Perkins winced when asked about the racial mix of people in the commercial having such good times with Chevrolets.
"We're very, very sensitive to diversity marketing," he said. "There's a built-in standard we have to meet, and we meet them in every case."
He called on another Chevrolet executive, Jeff P. Hurlbert, general marketing manager, to elaborate, and Mr. Hurlbert promised that if you watched closely, "all types of people are represented."
If so, you'd better not blink.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Cleaning the California air and speeding traffic with a road tax.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
WITH Southern Californians battered by earthquake, fire and recession, it seems cruel to remind them of yet another reason to emigrate to Boise. But that's not stopping the Environmental Defense Fund, which has published a new study on road congestion and air pollution in the land of gridlock.
Happily, this spinach may not prove hard to swallow. For while the report, "Efficiency and Fairness on the Road," by the economist Michael Cameron, documents the mess that is Southern California's car-dependent transportation system, its conclusion are, at heart, optimistic. 
 Like many other economists, Mr. Cameron believes that charging for road use according to free market principles would both clean the air and speed traffic. Unlike others, though, Mr. Cameron offers equally compelling evidence that pricing away pollution and congestion need not come at the expense of the poor and marginally middle class. "You could create a system that benefits every income group," Mr. Cameron asserts.
Traffic jams are close relatives to the long lines outside Soviet shops that Americans used to snicker about. When prices are too low to equate supply and demand -- whether the commodity is sausage or space on roads -- rationing takes place in other, almost always more frustrating, ways. The Russians have figured this out; Californians haven't.
By popular reckoning, the two-hour commute is now as much a fixture of life in Southern California as the all-night supermarket and drive-by shooting. In fact, relatively modest efforts to link the price of road use to its cost in terms of pollution and slower travel times could probably make a big difference. Mr. Cameron estimates that simply adding a nickel-a-mile charge to the current 37-cents-a-mile average cost of operating a car would reduce both miles driven and emissions in Southern California by one-tenth. Traffic delays would be reduced by roughly one-fourth.
This does not come as a surprise to Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation in Los Angeles and a longtime supporter of market-based incentives in transportation. More carefully aimed fees on auto emissions, use of key roads at peak hours and parking, he notes, would generate yet greater benefits. What is new here is a breakdown of who would pay and who would gain.
The use of direct "command and control" regulation (as opposed to indirect financial incentives) is widely seen as more equitable because the rich can't buy their way out of sacrifice. After all, a nickel-a-mile tax -- or for that matter, 50 cents a mile -- wouldn't reduce the number of Porsches cruising Rodeo Drive on Saturday afternoon.
And at least as a first take, Mr. Cameron's research reinforces intuition. He estimates that the net benefits of a 5-cent tax in terms of pollution and congestion would be six times greater for those in the top 20 percent of the income pecking order than for those in the bottom 20 percent. That's largely because the affluent drive more and place a higher value on the time they are stuck in traffic.
However, Mr. Cameron also shows that the distribution could be sharply changed by targeting the use of revenues from anticongestion or antipollution fees. A flat cash rebate per person, for example, would leave low-income families far better off because they drive much less than average. Using the funds to reduce mass transit fares would have less of an effect on the bottom fifth since most would remain dependent on cars for commuting. But the few percent who do use mass transit regularly -- and who are probably the poorest of California's working poor -- would get a giant boost.
Tom Graff, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, doesn't believe this research will eliminate resistance to market-based regulation in the traffic-and smog-choked southland. "This is a step in a long campaign," he predicts. But he does think it will begin the process of altering the political equation in which "representatives of the middle-class block user charges on behalf of the poor."
One way or another, change must come. Kenneth Small, an economist at the University of California at Irvine, observes that traffic congestion is ultimately self-limiting: people and businesses spread out sufficiently to prevent terminal gridlock. But air quality in the region does not meet the standards of the Clean Air Act and no easy fix (other than modifying the standards) is in sight.
Indeed, with Southern California out of fashion as a place to live and do business, the politics of expensive direct regulation on emissions is already problematic. Initial efforts to force employers to organize car pooling has largely been abandoned in the face of popular resistance.
Mr. Small expects a period of "fitful starts and demonstrations" of market-based traffic control, and perhaps growing acceptance as the lesser of evils. Mr. Graff agrees. "The politics may not yet be ripe" for pollution solutions that require out-of-pocket expenses, he concedes. "But they're ripening."

HEADLINE: Workers' Earnings Off 1.5%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The real average weekly earnings of American workers, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors, fell 1.5 percent in February, the biggest drop since September 1992, when it also declined 1.5 percent, the Labor Department said today.
Last month's decline followed a rise of 1.4 percent in January. The January figure was revised downward from a previously reported 1.5 percent gain. 
 The February report reflected a 1.4 percent decrease in average weekly hours, coupled with a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, the department said. This was partly offset by a rise of two-tenths of a percent in average hourly earnings.
In constant 1982 dollars, weekly earnings for nonsupervisory private workers outside the farm sector averaged a seasonally adjusted $254.60 in February, versus $258.36 in January and $254.27 in February 1993.
In current dollars, weekly earnings averaged a seasonally adjusted $378.33 in February, compared with $383.15 in January and $369.46 in February 1993.
The January weekly earnings figures were revised from the previously reported levels of $258.83 in constant dollars and $383.84 in current dollars, the department said.

HEADLINE: Publisher Pulls a Textbook In Furror on Sexual Content

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
A publisher has decided not to sell a health textbook in Texas rather than make hundreds of revisions demanded by state officials after the book was criticized by anti-abortion groups and others for its discussion of condom use, homosexuality and other sexual issues.
The publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston Inc., of Austin, Tex., said it was pulling its 700-page high school health text out of the huge Texas textbook market not only because making scores of requested revisions was economically unfeasible but also because ethical issues were at stake. 
 "Some of the mandated revisions are in opposition to the fundamental philosophy of our program and are potentially injurious to the students of Texas," William A. Talkington, Holt's president wrote to Education Commissioner Lionel Meno. "We simply cannot produce a product that does not provide children with adequate instruction on life-threatening issues." The state released the letter on Tuesday.
The publisher's decision came after months of Texas Board of Education hearings in which family-planning, anti-abortion, gay-advocacy, fundamentalist Christian and other groups debated the merits of five health texts, written by Holt and four other publishers.
 
What Was Objectionable
 The board, which buys all textbooks for the state, last month requested a total of 400 revisions in the five texts, with the largest percentage of them for the Holt book, including the deletion of toll-free numbers for gay and lesbian groups and for teen-age suicide prevention groups.
The state wanted to see passages on homosexuality abridged, the addition of language describing Texas's sodomy laws and the deletion of a number of clinical illustrations, including a self-examination for testicular cancer and two comparing circumsised and uncircumsised penises.
"This underlines how hard it is getting to produce a textbook that appeals to a general audience and to satisfy all the pressure groups," said Gilbert T. Sewall, director of the American Textbook Council, a private group based in New York that reviews curriculum materials. "Especially in books dealing with health and sex education, highly opinionated, sometimes obsessive people come to the table -- from the homophobic to the libertine -- and publishers are increasingly inclined to retreat from subjects that bring so many marketing headaches."
Holt is the only publisher so far that has decided against making the revisions for Texas, which is planning to spend $7.5 million on the health texts. The other publishers appear to be seeking to comply with the state's requests, said Roger R. Rogalin, vice president of the Association of American Publishers, a trade organization.
 
'They Are Not Happy'
 "I know they are not happy, but they may stay in there," he said.
Textbook sales in Texas represent about 8 percent of the $2.2 billion national market for textbooks. The state is second only to California, which represents about 12 percent. Texas is also one of 22 states in which government committees must approve all texts sold in the state. Because Texas controls such a large market share, publishers often develop texts to meet the standards set by its 15-member Board of Education and then market them nationwide.
Peter Farwell, vice president of Harcourt General Inc, the corporation in Massachusetts that owns Holt, Rinehart and Winston, said yesterday that the changes would have made the book, titled "Holt Health," too expensive.
"When you look at the costs of making the changes, versus the potential sales, it wasn't feasible, especially because the changes made it a Texas-only book," Mr. Farwell said. "We created the book by talking to a lot of administrators and teachers involved in health education, who told us what they felt kids needed to know in order to deal with their health. The changes would have left out issues we feel are important."
Della May Moore, spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Education, said yesterday: "We regret that Holt has left the process, but we have a long cooperation with them and we're sure we'll be working with them again."
For a decade, Texas's official tastes in health education have swung wildly, Mr. Rogalin said. "The problem here is that the state asked for one thing and then changed their mind when the books were all done," he said. "And it was done for political reasons. This was another case in which factions of the religious right are getting more involved in boards of education all over the country."
 
'I Had No Choice'
 Monte S. Hasie, a board member and a stockbroker from Lubbock, was one of those who pressed for the deletions. He said he considered the Holt book unacceptable under any circumstances. He said, "I had no choice but to try to correct them."
Mr. Hasie said he was not opposed to sex education "done appropriately," but considered many passages and sexual illustrations in the Holt text too explicit.
"I didn't think this stuff should be part of the public schools," he said. "They were promoting homosexuality as an acceptable alternative life style and promoting sex as being O.K. if you use a condom. We were going to put Playboy and Penthouse out of business."
Rosemary D. Merriam, a spokeswoman for the Texas Family Planning Association, said that there were 49,000 teen-age pregnancies in the state, the second-highest number in the nation, and that the deletion of family planning information from textbooks could worsen the problem.
"We were upset because Holt's was a well-written book that doesn't talk down to children, and this means there will be less choice for Texas school districts on health education," she said.

HEADLINE: Top Arkansas Lawyer Helped Hillary Clinton Turn Big Profit

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH. 
The following article is based on reporting by Dean Baquet, Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton and was written by Mr. Gerth.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
 Starting just before Bill Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas, Hillary Rodham Clinton made about $100,000 in one year in the commodities market with the help and advice of a friend who was the top lawyer for one of the state's most powerful and heavily regulated companies.
The investments, made in a commodities trading account that was opened three weeks before Mr. Clinton was elected Governor in 1978, substantially altered the finances of the Clintons. At the time, Mr. Clinton was Attorney General. He and his wife were rising stars in Little Rock whose salaries were modest by the standards of their peers.
 The proceeds helped them to buy a home, to invest in securities and real estate and eventually to provide a nest egg for their young daughter, according to the couple's associates and a review of the family's financial records. Tyson's Fortunes 
 But the trades, which came to light during a two-month examination of the Clintons' finances by The New York Times, also left them in the position of having relied significantly on the help of one of the state's premier powerbrokers, James B. Blair, a Clinton confidant who at the time was the primary outside lawyer for Tyson Foods Inc., of Springdale, Ark., the nation's biggest poultry company.
 During Mr. Clinton's tenure in Arkansas, Tyson benefited from a variety of state actions, including $9 million in government loans, the placement of company executives on important state boards and favorable decisions on environmental issues. Even today, critics in Congress and elsewhere have complained that the Clinton Administration is too close to Tyson and the poultry industry it dominates, sparing it from some of the tougher Federal inspection guidelines enacted against the meat industry. Her Money, Her Risk
 In a written statement, the Clintons' personal lawyer, David Kendall, said today that Mrs. Clinton had traded in commodities futures "with her own funds and assumed the full risk of loss."
 "She did so through two different trading accounts in her own name in Little Rock and Springdale, Ark.," he said. "Mrs. Clinton reported gains and losses on her tax returns as appropriate."
 Mr. Blair, in telephone interviews on Wednesday and today, confirmed that he had encouraged Mrs. Clinton to invest in the normally risky commodity markets and to open an account at a Springdale brokerage, and that he then used his investing skills to help guide her through a series of lucrative trades.
 Mr. Blair and Administration officials designated to discuss the matter -- but who would speak only on condition of anonymity -- said Mrs. Clinton had put up the stake with which she began trading. The officials would not say how much money Mrs. Clinton had put at risk.
 Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said in a statement tonight: "Mrs. Clinton consulted with numerous people, and she did her own research. This was her own risk; the commodity investments were her own responsibility."
 The Administration officials said that Mrs. Clinton also studied financial data, including some in The Wall Street Journal.
 John Podesta, a White House spokesman, said tonight: "Hillary and Jim were friends. He gave her advice. There was no impropriety. The only appearance is being created by The New York Times."
 Mr. Blair, who himself made several million dollars trading commodities, said he saw no conflict of interest; he said he had helped Mrs. Clinton as a close friend, not because of the position held by her husband.
 Speaking of the Clintons, he said: "Do they have to go weed their friends out and say they can only have friends who are sweeping the streets? They have friends who are high-powered lawyers. They have friends who write books, who write poetry."
 Mr. Blair and the Administration officials estimated Mrs. Clinton's profits at $100,000. The officials said she opened her trading account in mid-October 1978, three weeks before Mr. Clinton was elected with 63 percent of the vote. She got out of the market on Oct. 17, 1979, just as the rising market in cattle futures from which she had profited was collapsing. Protecting State Jobs
 As Governor and as a candidate for President in 1992, Mr. Clinton was forthright in defending the assistance that the state government gave to Tyson, which is among Arkansas's largest employers, saying that it was good for the state's economy.
 Archie Schaffer, director of media, public and government affairs for Tyson, denied that Mr. Clinton had done any special favors for the company or the Arkansas poultry industry.
 "I can tell you that I disagree totally with any suggestion that the Clinton gubernatorial administration gave the poultry industry or Tyson any breaks," he said. "That's just nonsense." Mr. Schaffer said he knew nothing of the commodity trading.
 The history of the commodities trades casts a new light on the Clintons' personal finances and on their relationship to the poultry industry and to Mr. Blair, who remains a powerful figure where politics and business intersect in Arkansas. Source of Down Payment
 The trades have never been publicly disclosed. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, the Clintons and their aides gave conflicting accounts when asked to explain where the couple got the money to make a $60,000 down payment on a house in 1980. During the campaign, aides declined to release the Clintons' tax returns for the late 1970's and did so again today.
 When the question of the down payment first arose, the campaign said it had come from an investment by Mrs. Clinton, one that the officials declined to describe. At another point, the officials released a statement in Mrs. Clinton's name that said the money had come from "our savings and a gift from my parents."
 Today, the Administration officials said that the down payment had come from savings, including the proceeds of the successful commodities trade. The Clintons and Blair Low-Paid Stars, Longtime Power
 Bill Clinton came from a family of modest means, and for all his political prominence, neither he nor his wife, Hillary Rodham, had ever made much money.
 Mr. Clinton was elected State Attorney General in 1976, at the age of 30. His annual salary then was $26,500. Two years later, on becoming the nation's youngest governor, his salary rose to $35,000, leaving him one of the nation's lowest-paid governors.
 Mrs. Clinton, like her husband a Yale Law School graduate, had joined him in teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville in the mid-1970's. For the nine-month 1975-76 school year, each was paid $18,090, a university spokeswoman said. When Mr. Clinton's election as Attorney General took them to Little Rock in 1977, she joined the Rose Law Firm there as an associate. Her starting salary is not public, but within a year after making partner in 1980 it was $46,000.
 Mr. Blair, 11 years older than Mr. Clinton, was already established in the world of business and politics in Arkansas. By the late 1970's, he had become one of the state's most successful trial lawyers.
 His firm, Crouch, Blair, Cypert & Waters, was in Springdale, the center of Arkansas's booming poultry industry. In addition to advising some of the state's biggest poultry companies, it represented big trucking companies and the local utility. Mr. Blair was also a force in statewide political circles. In 1974, he ran the final, doomed re-election campaign of Senator J. William Fulbright, Mr. Clinton's political mentor.
 While a partner at Crouch, Blair, Mr. Blair became general counsel to Tyson, which was founded in 1936, when John Tyson began hauling live chickens from Arkansas to Chicago. Mr. Blair eventually left the law firm and went to work directly for the founder's son, Donald J. Tyson, now chairman and chief executive. Over the years Mr. Blair has served as a director of more than 20 Tyson-controlled companies across the country. The Trades Exquisite Timing In a Risky Game
 Mr. Blair said in the interview that he first ventured into the stock market in 1956, when he was 20 years old. Through the 50's and 60's, he said, he made more money in stocks than he did practicing law. In the 1970's, he began trading commodity futures.
 Mr. Blair's timing was impeccable. In the tiny Springdale office of Refco Inc., a trading firm based in Chicago, a rag-tag group of brokers, some of whom had been small-town liquor salesmen and clerks, was making millions of dollars, capitalizing on a stunning boom in futures contracts prices. The office's founder, a professional poker player named Robert Bone, was a 13-year Tyson executive who had turned a knack for gauging odds into a small fortune.
 Mr. Blair said Mrs. Clinton had got into the commodities market at his suggestion.
 "I recommended to her that she open an account at the Refco office," he said. "I was on a streak, on a streak that I thought was very successful, and I wanted to share this with my close friends, as I did with my fiancee, as I did with my law firm, as I did with my children, as I did with my fiancee's children and as I did with the person who was the best person at my marriage, which was Hillary, a tennis partner and friend."
 Mr. Blair advised Mrs. Clinton to get into the cattle futures market because, he said, "I specifically was trading the cattle futures, and thought I knew what I was doing." He added, "I'm damn good at it." On Blair's Advice
 Mr. Blair, a close friend and lawyer for Mr. Bone, who was known as Red, said Mrs. Clinton had started with a small stake. Mr. Kendall declined to say today how much money she had put up.
 According to trading records examined by The New York Times and people familiar with the trades, she opened her account in the Refco office, using Mr. Bone as her broker. The account was opened in mid-October 1978, when Mr. Clinton was described in Arkansas newspapers as the favorite in the governor's race.
 Mr. Blair said he had helped guide Mrs. Clinton's trades. "We discussed whether she ought to be long or short" in her trades, Mr. Blair recalled, referring to betting whether prices would rise or fall. "It was done in consultation," he said. "I gave her my best advice."
 Mr. Blair said that while he would make specific trading recommendations, Mrs. Clinton "determined the size of the trade."
 Around the time of Mr. Clinton's 1978 election, Mrs. Clinton opened another commodity trading account, this one with Stephens Inc., a large brokerage firm in Little Rock, Administration officials said. But they said that the bulk of her trading profits had come from the Refco account.
 Mr. Blair said he had nothing to do with the decision to trade from the Stephens account.
 People familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading said she had profited from most but not all of the trades.
 In commodities trading, a speculator essentially bets on the future value of a commodity, like cattle or pork. Trading in such futures contracts is among the riskiest and most volatile of investments. By some estimates, more than three-quarters of all investors lose money. But a sophisticated trader, or one with special knowledge of a market, can turn a small stake into millions of dollars.
 According to records and people familiar with the trades, Mrs. Clinton made most of the $100,000 in proceeds trading in cattle futures.
 But after several go-go years, the cattle futures market collapsed in the fall of 1979, shattering the Refco office, leading to huge losses and lengthy litigation and sending some of the traders, including Mr. Bone, into bankruptcy.
 The Administration officials said Mrs. Clinton closed her Refco account in mid-October 1979 and her Stephens account in early 1980.
 Administration officials said she had got out of the market because after she became pregnant with her daughter, Chelsea, she did not have the time to keep up with developments and found the investments too nerve-wracking.
 Mr. Bone does not recall how much money Mr. Blair made during the boom or lost during the bust. But he remembers that when Mr. Blair departed from the markets, "He left happy." The Benefits Proceeds Gave Clintons Nest Egg
 Other than a brief reference to $449 in commodities trading losses on their 1980 tax return, there is no evidence that the Clintons ever returned to the highly volatile commodities markets.
 But their brief involvement substantially improved their fortunes. Based on the tax returns they have released, the commodity trades were by far their most successful investment.
 In mid-1978, in seeking a loan from a bank in Flippin, Ark., that financed the real estate venture called Whitewater, the Clintons reported having few assets, executives of the bank have said. The main reason they got the loan, the bankers added, was the creditworthiness of the Clintons' partner in Whitewater, James B. McDougal, who at the time was a developer.
 But in November 1979, shortly after Mrs. Clinton closed her Refco account, the Clintons were able to acquire $55,463 in bonds, according to their 1980 tax return. And in December 1980, after Mr. Clinton was voted out of the governor's office, the Clintons were able to make the house down payment.
 Mr. McDougal has also said that in 1980, Mrs. Clinton approached him for advice about putting money in tax shelters. Mr. McDougal, who made his remarks in a 1992 interview with the Times, recalled Mrs. Clinton saying that she needed to shelter large profits that Mr. Blair had helped her make in the commodities market.
 The personal ties between Mr. Blair and the Clintons have remained strong. On some visits to Arkansas, the Clintons stay at the waterfront vacation home of Mr. Blair and his wife, Diane. The Wall Street Journal has reported that on the President's inauguration night, the Blairs spent the night at the White House.
 During the 1980's, Mr. Blair was appointed to the board of the University of Arkansas, where he served as chairman. Mrs. Blair, a political science professor at the university, was appointed last year to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps channel Federal funds to the nation's public broadcast stations.
 Mr. Blair has also remained a behind-the-scenes adviser to Mr. Clinton since his first days in public office. For example, during the 1992 campaign -- and after the election -- Mr. Blair helped devise strategies for blunting criticism about the Clintons' involvement with Mr. McDougal and Whitewater, said Mr. McDougal and Susan Thomases, a campaign aide. The Growth of Tyson Company Thrived In Clinton Years
 The ties between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair's client remained strong as well. Mr. Clinton's record of support for the poultry industry and Tyson in particular has been a subject of debate for years in Little Rock, and it became an issue during the 1992 Presidential campaign. Even today, critics in Congress and others have accused the Clinton Administration of not being tough enough on the industry, particularly in inspecting chickens. Today, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department defended its record and said the department was moving to tighten inspections after years of neglect.
 The criticism of Tyson's connection to the White House goes beyond its poultry interests. The company owns Arctic Alaska Fisheries, a large fish-trawling business based in Seattle. Last April, small fishing outfits in the Northwest complained that Tyson's relationship with the Clinton Administration was one reason the Government reversed course and instituted rules that would allow Arctic Alaska and other big trawlers to dominate the nation's $100 million whiting catch. The Commerce Department, which wrote the rules, denies the accusation.
 Mr. Podesta, the White House spokesman, said: "The President and Jim Blair have never discussed Blair's clients' business with the Federal Government. During the Clinton Administration, we know of no instance of his ever lobbying a Clinton White House official or discussing matters of concern between his client and the Federal Government."
 Throughout the 1970's and 1980's, Governor Clinton and his administration made several significant decisions that helped Tyson become one of the world's biggest poultry companies. In campaigns for Governor and President, when questioned about his support of the company, Mr. Clinton said he had fought for the industry because it was one of the biggest employers in a depressed state.
 As Attorney General in 1978, Mr. Clinton intervened in a lawsuit that eventually loosened Federal regulations so that Tyson and other Arkansas poultry processors could vastly increase their productivity.
 As Governor, Mr. Clinton reappointed a Tyson veterinarian to the Livestock and Poultry Commission, a regulatory body often criticized as being too close to the industry. 'Clinton Understands'
 Mr. Tyson, in turn, has been a major fund raiser for Mr. Clinton and has praised him for creating a friendly environment for the growth of the poultry industry.
 Last year, three days after Mr. Clinton's inauguration, Mr. Tyson was asked what influence he hoped to have with the new President.
 "I would be irresponsible to my company and my industry if I didn't have any input," Mr. Tyson said after a speech in Anchorage. "Clinton understands the needs of business. There were several times in our company's growth that we could have taken opportunities outside of the state, but we chose to stay in Arkansas because he understands the balance between economic development and environmental issues."
 Mr. Schaffer, the Tyson spokesman, said the company received no special treatment on environmental questions. The company has spent "tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars" upgrading its plants to avoid pollution problems, he said.
 But environmentalists and many Arkansas residents have complained that the balance was often tilted toward industry. The instance they cite most frequently was a long legal battle that followed the discovery that a Tyson plant in Green Forest, a town of 1,600 in northwest Arkansas, had been leaking waste into Dry Creek. After Delay, Disaster
 In 1977, the state pollution control agency reissued the license for Tyson's Green Forest plant on the condition that the company meet with city officials to work out a plan for treating its wastes. But the state never enforced the order, and in May 1983 the waste from the plant seeped into the town's drinking water. Residents became ill, and 15 months later Governor Clinton declared the town a disaster area.
 In a lawsuit in 1989, some residents contended that the company was responsible for a pattern of pollution around the state, abetted by a state government that refused to do anything about it.
 "The various regulatory authorities legally charged with protecting the water, land and people of Arkansas from this well-known pollution have failed to take any meaningful enforcement action," the Green Forest residents said in their lawsuit. The lawsuit produced evidence that Mr. Clinton was personally briefed on the pollution problems at Green Forest, and it contended that his administration had failed to take significant action. State officials and the company denied any wrongdoing.
 As one example, the residents cited the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, which levied an $11,000 fine when Tyson's was found to have dumped waste from its plant in nearby Berryville onto private property. Mr. Blair took part in negotiating that settlement, according to court papers. Dropping Clinton's Name
 The lawsuit also revealed one instance in which Mr. Blair threatened to go to the Governor's office when the state's top health officials tried in 1987 to get the company to stop dumping sludge into Green Forest's drinking water supply.
 On May 19, 1987, in response to a letter from Dr. Ben N. Saltzman, director of the state Department of Health, Mr. Blair wrote that the Pollution Commission had given the company permission to dump sludge. Tyson, he wrote, was caught in a turf battle between warring agencies.
 "It seems to me it is time to have a major meeting in the Governor's office with the Governor's staff and get the turf problems ironed out," he wrote.
 The meeting never took place.
 The Green Forest case was recently settled out of court. The terms were sealed. Correction: For the Record

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 5, 1994, about James B. Blair, then the general counsel for the Tyson Foods company and a longtime confidant and personal emissary for Bill and Hillary Clinton, misstated benefits that Tyson received from the state of Arkansas while Mr. Clinton was governor. Although the company did benefit from at least $7 million in state tax credits, it did not receive $9 million in loans from the state. (The error appeared in three other articles and in an editorial in 1994, all of which were corrected on April 20 of that year. The should have been then in The Times's archives to those articles: one on the front page on March 18 about Mrs. Clinton's commodity trades in the late 1970s; a March 19 article about President Clinton's defense of Mrs. Clinton's investments; a March 30 article about the White House's disclosure of the amount Mrs. Clinton invested in commodities trades, and a March 31 editorial.)

A20) Charts: "Commodies Trading: A Primer" OVERVIEW -- The original purpose of the commodities market was to allow farmers and food companies to protect themselves from the vagaries of weather and consumer demand that can make supply, demand and prices swing wildly through the course of a year. Today most of the trading is done by people who never take possession of the actual commodity, but who seek to profit by being on the right side of such a swing. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission estimates that 75 percent of all of its investors lose money. REWARDS -- Profits can be great because an investor puts down only a fraction of the total cost upon buying or selling the futures contract. RISKS -- If prices go the wrong way, an investor can lose several times the original investment and also must come up with additional cash, sometimes within hours or days. If the investor is unable to do so, the commodity will be sold at whatever the current market price is and the investor will have to make up the difference. HOW IT WORKS 1. Buyer agrees to purchase a certain amount of a commodity (like cattle or soybeans) at some date in the future, for a preset price. 2. If the market price for the commodity then DROPS, the buyer is still obligated to pay the prearranged price, and loses money. 3. If the market price for the commodity the RISES, the seller is obligated to honor the prearranged price, and the buyer makes a profit. (pg.

HEADLINE: Top Arkansas Lawyer Helped Hillary Clinton Turn Big Profit

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH. 
The following article is based on reporting by Dean Baquet, Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton and was written by Mr. Gerth.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
Starting just before Bill Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas, Hillary Rodham Clinton made about $100,000 in one year in the commodities market with the help and advice of a friend who was the top lawyer for one of the state's most powerful and heavily regulated companies.
The investments, made in a commodities trading account that was opened three weeks before Mr. Clinton was elected Governor in 1978, substantially altered the finances of the Clintons. At the time, Mr. Clinton was Attorney General. He and his wife were rising stars in Little Rock whose salaries were modest by the standards of their peers.
 The proceeds helped them to buy a home, to invest in securities and real estate and eventually to provide a nest egg for their young daughter, according to the couple's associates and a review of the family's financial records. Tyson's Fortunes 
 But the trades, which came to light during a two-month examination of the Clintons' finances by The New York Times, also left them in the position of having relied significantly on the help of one of the state's premier powerbrokers, James B. Blair, a Clinton confidant who at the time was the primary outside lawyer for Tyson Foods Inc., of Springdale, Ark., the nation's biggest poultry company.
 During Mr. Clinton's tenure in Arkansas, Tyson benefited from a variety of state actions, including $9 million in government loans, the placement of company executives on important state boards and favorable decisions on environmental issues. Even today, critics in Congress and elsewhere have complained that the Clinton Administration is too close to Tyson and the poultry industry it dominates, sparing it from some of the tougher Federal inspection guidelines enacted against the meat industry. Her Money, Her Risk
 In a written statement, the Clintons' personal lawyer, David Kendall, said today that Mrs. Clinton had traded in commodities futures "with her own funds and assumed the full risk of loss."
 "She did so through two different trading accounts in her own name in Little Rock and Springdale, Ark.," he said. "Mrs. Clinton reported gains and losses on her tax returns as appropriate."
 Mr. Blair, in telephone interviews on Wednesday and today, confirmed that he had encouraged Mrs. Clinton to invest in the normally risky commodity markets and to open an account at a Springdale brokerage, and that he then used his investing skills to help guide her through a series of lucrative trades.
 Mr. Blair and Administration officials designated to discuss the matter -- but who would speak only on condition of anonymity -- said Mrs. Clinton had put up the stake with which she began trading. The officials would not say how much money Mrs. Clinton had put at risk.
 Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said in a statement tonight: "Mrs. Clinton consulted with numerous people, and she did her own research. This was her own risk; the commodity investments were her own responsibility."
 The Administration officials said that Mrs. Clinton also studied financial data, including some in The Wall Street Journal.
 John Podesta, a White House spokesman, said tonight: "Hillary and Jim were friends. He gave her advice. There was no impropriety. The only appearance is being created by The New York Times."
 Mr. Blair, who himself made several million dollars trading commodities, said he saw no conflict of interest; he said he had helped Mrs. Clinton as a close friend, not because of the position held by her husband.
 Speaking of the Clintons, he said: "Do they have to go weed their friends out and say they can only have friends who are sweeping the streets? They have friends who are high-powered lawyers. They have friends who write books, who write poetry."
 Mr. Blair and the Administration officials estimated Mrs. Clinton's profits at $100,000. The officials said she opened her trading account in mid-October 1978, three weeks before Mr. Clinton was elected with 63 percent of the vote. She got out of the market on Oct. 17, 1979, just as the rising market in cattle futures from which she had profited was collapsing. Protecting State Jobs
 As Governor and as a candidate for President in 1992, Mr. Clinton was forthright in defending the assistance that the state government gave to Tyson, which is among Arkansas's largest employers, saying that it was good for the state's economy.
 Archie Schaffer, director of media, public and government affairs for Tyson, denied that Mr. Clinton had done any special favors for the company or the Arkansas poultry industry.
 "I can tell you that I disagree totally with any suggestion that the Clinton gubernatorial administration gave the poultry industry or Tyson any breaks," he said. "That's just nonsense." Mr. Schaffer said he knew nothing of the commodity trading.
 The history of the commodities trades casts a new light on the Clintons' personal finances and on their relationship to the poultry industry and to Mr. Blair, who remains a powerful figure where politics and business intersect in Arkansas. Source of Down Payment
 The trades have never been publicly disclosed. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, the Clintons and their aides gave conflicting accounts when asked to explain where the couple got the money to make a $60,000 down payment on a house in 1980. During the campaign, aides declined to release the Clintons' tax returns for the late 1970's and did so again today.
 When the question of the down payment first arose, the campaign said it had come from an investment by Mrs. Clinton, one that the officials declined to describe. At another point, the officials released a statement in Mrs. Clinton's name that said the money had come from "our savings and a gift from my parents."
 Today, the Administration officials said that the down payment had come from savings, including the proceeds of the successful commodities trade. The Clintons and Blair Low-Paid Stars, Longtime Power
 Bill Clinton came from a family of modest means, and for all his political prominence, neither he nor his wife, Hillary Rodham, had ever made much money.
 Mr. Clinton was elected State Attorney General in 1976, at the age of 30. His annual salary then was $26,500. Two years later, on becoming the nation's youngest governor, his salary rose to $35,000, leaving him one of the nation's lowest-paid governors.
 Mrs. Clinton, like her husband a Yale Law School graduate, had joined him in teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville in the mid-1970's. For the nine-month 1975-76 school year, each was paid $18,090, a university spokeswoman said. When Mr. Clinton's election as Attorney General took them to Little Rock in 1977, she joined the Rose Law Firm there as an associate. Her starting salary is not public, but within a year after making partner in 1980 it was $46,000.
 Mr. Blair, 11 years older than Mr. Clinton, was already established in the world of business and politics in Arkansas. By the late 1970's, he had become one of the state's most successful trial lawyers.
 His firm, Crouch, Blair, Cypert & Waters, was in Springdale, the center of Arkansas's booming poultry industry. In addition to advising some of the state's biggest poultry companies, it represented big trucking companies and the local utility. Mr. Blair was also a force in statewide political circles. In 1974, he ran the final, doomed re-election campaign of Senator J. William Fulbright, Mr. Clinton's political mentor.
 While a partner at Crouch, Blair, Mr. Blair became general counsel to Tyson, which was founded in 1936, when John Tyson began hauling live chickens from Arkansas to Chicago. Mr. Blair eventually left the law firm and went to work directly for the founder's son, Donald J. Tyson, now chairman and chief executive. Over the years Mr. Blair has served as a director of more than 20 Tyson-controlled companies across the country. The Trades Exquisite Timing In a Risky Game
 Mr. Blair said in the interview that he first ventured into the stock market in 1956, when he was 20 years old. Through the 50's and 60's, he said, he made more money in stocks than he did practicing law. In the 1970's, he began trading commodity futures.
 Mr. Blair's timing was impeccable. In the tiny Springdale office of Refco Inc., a trading firm based in Chicago, a rag-tag group of brokers, some of whom had been small-town liquor salesmen and clerks, was making millions of dollars, capitalizing on a stunning boom in futures contracts prices. The office's founder, a professional poker player named Robert Bone, was a 13-year Tyson executive who had turned a knack for gauging odds into a small fortune.
 Mr. Blair said Mrs. Clinton had got into the commodities market at his suggestion.
 "I recommended to her that she open an account at the Refco office," he said. "I was on a streak, on a streak that I thought was very successful, and I wanted to share this with my close friends, as I did with my fiancee, as I did with my law firm, as I did with my children, as I did with my fiancee's children and as I did with the person who was the best person at my marriage, which was Hillary, a tennis partner and friend."
 Mr. Blair advised Mrs. Clinton to get into the cattle futures market because, he said, "I specifically was trading the cattle futures, and thought I knew what I was doing." He added, "I'm damn good at it." On Blair's Advice
 Mr. Blair, a close friend and lawyer for Mr. Bone, who was known as Red, said Mrs. Clinton had started with a small stake. Mr. Kendall declined to say today how much money she had put up.
 According to trading records examined by The New York Times and people familiar with the trades, she opened her account in the Refco office, using Mr. Bone as her broker. The account was opened in mid-October 1978, when Mr. Clinton was described in Arkansas newspapers as the favorite in the governor's race.
 Mr. Blair said he had helped guide Mrs. Clinton's trades. "We discussed whether she ought to be long or short" in her trades, Mr. Blair recalled, referring to betting whether prices would rise or fall. "It was done in consultation," he said. "I gave her my best advice."
 Mr. Blair said that while he would make specific trading recommendations, Mrs. Clinton "determined the size of the trade."
 Around the time of Mr. Clinton's 1978 election, Mrs. Clinton opened another commodity trading account, this one with Stephens Inc., a large brokerage firm in Little Rock, Administration officials said. But they said that the bulk of her trading profits had come from the Refco account.
 Mr. Blair said he had nothing to do with the decision to trade from the Stephens account.
 People familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading said she had profited from most but not all of the trades.
 In commodities trading, a speculator essentially bets on the future value of a commodity, like cattle or pork. Trading in such futures contracts is among the riskiest and most volatile of investments. By some estimates, more than three-quarters of all investors lose money. But a sophisticated trader, or one with special knowledge of a market, can turn a small stake into millions of dollars.
 According to records and people familiar with the trades, Mrs. Clinton made most of the $100,000 in proceeds trading in cattle futures.
 But after several go-go years, the cattle futures market collapsed in the fall of 1979, shattering the Refco office, leading to huge losses and lengthy litigation and sending some of the traders, including Mr. Bone, into bankruptcy.
 The Administration officials said Mrs. Clinton closed her Refco account in mid-October 1979 and her Stephens account in early 1980.
 Administration officials said she had got out of the market because after she became pregnant with her daughter, Chelsea, she did not have the time to keep up with developments and found the investments too nerve-wracking.
 Mr. Bone does not recall how much money Mr. Blair made during the boom or lost during the bust. But he remembers that when Mr. Blair departed from the markets, "He left happy." The Benefits Proceeds Gave Clintons Nest Egg
 Other than a brief reference to $449 in commodities trading losses on their 1980 tax return, there is no evidence that the Clintons ever returned to the highly volatile commodities markets.
 But their brief involvement substantially improved their fortunes. Based on the tax returns they have released, the commodity trades were by far their most successful investment.
 In mid-1978, in seeking a loan from a bank in Flippin, Ark., that financed the real estate venture called Whitewater, the Clintons reported having few assets, executives of the bank have said. The main reason they got the loan, the bankers added, was the creditworthiness of the Clintons' partner in Whitewater, James B. McDougal, who at the time was a developer.
 But in November 1979, shortly after Mrs. Clinton closed her Refco account, the Clintons were able to acquire $55,463 in bonds, according to their 1980 tax return. And in December 1980, after Mr. Clinton was voted out of the governor's office, the Clintons were able to make the house down payment.
 Mr. McDougal has also said that in 1980, Mrs. Clinton approached him for advice about putting money in tax shelters. Mr. McDougal, who made his remarks in a 1992 interview with the Times, recalled Mrs. Clinton saying that she needed to shelter large profits that Mr. Blair had helped her make in the commodities market.
 The personal ties between Mr. Blair and the Clintons have remained strong. On some visits to Arkansas, the Clintons stay at the waterfront vacation home of Mr. Blair and his wife, Diane. The Wall Street Journal has reported that on the President's inauguration night, the Blairs spent the night at the White House.

Mrs. Blair, a political science professor at the university, was appointed last year to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps channel Federal funds to the nation's public broadcast stations.

 On May 19, 1987, in response to a letter from Dr. Ben N. Saltzman, director of the state Department of Health, Mr. Blair wrote that the Pollution Commission had given the company permission to dump sludge. Tyson, he wrote, was caught in a turf battle between warring agencies.
 "It seems to me it is time to have a major meeting in the Governor's office with the Governor's staff and get the turf problems ironed out," he wrote.
 The meeting never took place.
 The Green Forest case was recently settled out of court. The terms were sealed.

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 5, 1994, about James B. Blair, then the general counsel for the Tyson Foods company and a longtime confidant and personal emissary for Bill and Hillary Clinton, misstated benefits that Tyson received from the state of Arkansas while Mr. Clinton was governor. Although the company did benefit from at least $7 million in state tax credits, it did not receive $9 million in loans from the state. (The error appeared in three other articles and in an editorial in 1994, all of which were corrected on April 20 of that year. The should have been then in The Times's archives to those articles: one on the front page on March 18 about Mrs. Clinton's commodity trades in the late 1970s; a March 19 article about President Clinton's defense of Mrs. Clinton's investments; a March 30 article about the White House's disclosure of the amount Mrs. Clinton invested in commodities trades, and a March 31 editorial.)

A20) Charts: "Commodies Trading: A Primer" OVERVIEW -- The original purpose of the commodities market was to allow farmers and food companies to protect themselves from the vagaries of weather and consumer demand that can make supply, demand and prices swing wildly through the course of a year. Today most of the trading is done by people who never take possession of the actual commodity, but who seek to profit by being on the right side of such a swing. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission estimates that 75 percent of all of its investors lose money. REWARDS -- Profits can be great because an investor puts down only a fraction of the total cost upon buying or selling the futures contract. RISKS -- If prices go the wrong way, an investor can lose several times the original investment and also must come up with additional cash, sometimes within hours or days. If the investor is unable to do so, the commodity will be sold at whatever the current market price is and the investor will have to make up the difference. HOW IT WORKS 1. Buyer agrees to purchase a certain amount of a commodity (like cattle or soybeans) at some date in the future, for a preset price. 2. If the market price for the commodity then DROPS, the buyer is still obligated to pay the prearranged price, and loses money. 3. If the market price for the commodity the RISES, the seller is obligated to honor the prearranged price, and the buyer makes a profit. (pg.

HEADLINE: Christopher Is Drawing Fire In Washington on China Visit

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's trip to Beijing has come under attack from inside and outside the Administration, both for its timing and for the way Chinese officials publicly humiliated him as he tried to lecture them on human rights.
Hoping to silence his critics, who include senior officials at the White House and the Treasury and Commerce Departments, Mr. Christopher took the offensive today at a House Appropriations subcommittee meeting. He said canceling his trip to Beijing after China's arrest of more than a dozen dissidents would have been a "grave error." 
 While such a step would have signaled displeasure with the crackdown, Mr. Christopher said, it would have also ended any possibility of reaching common ground with the Chinese before Mr. Clinton must decide whether China has made enough progress on human rights to win an extension of its preferential trade benefits in June.
 
Business Leaders Criticized
 Without naming his critics, Mr. Christopher also chastised American business executives and officials in the Administration who have signaled that the United States would put trade considerations ahead of human rights in relations with Beijing.
"The Chinese have been hearing mixed signals and needed to hear our position stated directly and clearly," Mr. Christopher said. "In my sessions with China, I pulled no punches and yielded no ground."
However, if Mr. Christopher had chosen to cancel his trip, he would have had a ready-made, face-saving excuse: the urgency of the Administration's moves to get the Israelis and Palestinians back to the peace table in Washington.
In any event, the mission has left Mr. Christopher facing the criticism virtually alone, since President Clinton has not come to his support publicly, even though Mr. Clinton himself was the architect of the policy. Asked on Monday whether the United States was backing away from its strong human rights stand, Mr. Clinton said that he was "disappointed" by the results of Mr. Christopher's meeting, adding only that "the policy is the same," and that he would make a judgment on China's trade status "at the appropriate time."
Today, Mr. Christopher's aides put out word that despite the crackdown on dissidents, Mr. Clinton had approved the decision to go ahead with the trip.
But even lawmakers who profess to support Mr. Christopher today questioned the Administration's approach toward China.
"I think this Administration or our policy is headed -- it's like a train headed for a cliff and I don't see that the brakes have been turned on," said Representative Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who is co-chairman of a group studying China's trade status. "Our failure to resolve this, to engage the third-largest economy in the world, would be absolutely devastating and I hope you would agree with that."
Mr. Christopher replied, "I felt good about being in China, carrying out the President's policy and carrying out a policy that was overwhelmingly supported here in Congress."
But while Mr. Christopher was still in Beijing, some colleagues in the White House and the Commerce and Treasury Departments began a whispering campaign, questioning his judgment in going to Beijing.
 
3 Predecessors of Christopher
 They were joined by voices that included those of three former Secretaries of State, who pronounced the policy to be a failure at a Council on Foreign Relations forum on Tuesday.
The criticism from Henry A. Kissinger and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who served as Secretary of State under Republican Administrations, was predictable. But even Cyrus R. Vance, who was Secretary of State when Mr. Christopher was Deputy Secretary, told the group that although some rights-trade links are appropriate, the United States "should not make one interest determinative" in a relationship that also involves arms control, economic development and regional security.
Underneath the debate over whether Mr. Christopher should have gone to Beijing to deliver a stern message on human rights is a deep division within the Administration over Mr. Clinton's approach. And even as the Administration is sharply criticizing China on human rights, it has been mollifying China with six months of intensive diplomatic engagement.
When Mr. Clinton announced an executive order last May stating that China would have to make "significant, overall progress" in human rights in order to win renewal of its preferential trade status, the move was touted by both the Administration and Congress as a brilliant compromise.
But the executive order really just delayed a tough decision on China for a year, while setting up specific tests the Chinese would have to pass. It also deprived Washington of the flexibility to interpret its own regulations braodly. With Mr. Clinton's attention focused elsewhere, Mr. Christopher has provided a convenient target for the policy's critics.
 
Visits by U.S. Officials
 As part of the Administration's policy of engagement, Mr. Christopher allowed his first visit to Beijing as Secretary of State to be preceded by the visits of other senior officials, including Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy trade representative. Although they delivered the message on human rights, their main pitch was to outline ways to increase cooperation with Beijing.
Other senior Administration officials, however, have argued that if Washington alone tries to modify China's behavior on human rights by revoking trade privileges, then Washington alone will lose. The officials making this case include Commerce Secretary Ron Brown; Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Security Council; W. Bowman Cutter, the deputy assistant to the President on Economic Policy, and Lawrence S. Sommers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury.

HEADLINE: Top Arkansas Lawyer Helped Hillary Clinton Turn Big Profit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times; The following article is based on reporting by Dean Baquet, Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton and was written by Mr. Gerth.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Starting just before Bill Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas, Hillary Rodham Clinton made about $100,000 in one year in the commodities market with the help and advice of a friend who was the top lawyer for one of the state's most powerful and heavily regulated companies.
The investments, made in a commodities trading account that was opened three weeks before Mr. Clinton was elected Governor in 1978, substantially altered the finances of the Clintons. At the time, Mr. Clinton was Attorney General. He and his wife were rising stars in Little Rock whose salaries were modest by the standards of their peers. 
 The proceeds helped them to buy a home, to invest in securities and real estate and eventually to provide a nest egg for their young daughter, according to the couple's associates and a review of the family's financial records.
 
Tyson's Fortunes
 But the trades, which came to light during a two-month examination of the Clintons' finances by The New York Times, also left them in the position of having relied significantly on the help of one of the state's premier powerbrokers, James B. Blair, a Clinton confidant who at the time was the primary outside lawyer for Tyson Foods Inc., of Springdale, Ark., the nation's biggest poultry company.
During Mr. Clinton's tenure in Arkansas, Tyson benefited from a variety of state actions, including $9 million in government loans, the placement of company executives on important state boards and favorable decisions on environmental issues. Even today, critics in Congress and elsewhere have complained that the Clinton Administration is too close to Tyson and the poultry industry it dominates, sparing it from some of the tougher Federal inspection guidelines enacted against the meat industry.
 
Her Money, Her Risk
 In a written statement, the Clintons' personal lawyer, David Kendall, said today that Mrs. Clinton had traded in commodities futures "with her own funds and assumed the full risk of loss."
"She did so through two different trading accounts in her own name in Little Rock and Springdale, Ark.," he said. "Mrs. Clinton reported gains and losses on her tax returns as appropriate."
Mr. Blair, in telephone interviews on Wednesday and today, confirmed that he had encouraged Mrs. Clinton to invest in the normally risky commodity markets and to open an account at a Springdale brokerage, and that he then used his investing skills to help guide her through a series of lucrative trades.
Mr. Blair and Administration officials designated to discuss the matter -- but who would speak only on condition of anonymity -- said Mrs. Clinton had put up the stake with which she began trading. The officials would not say how much money Mrs. Clinton had put at risk.
Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said in a statement tonight: "Mrs. Clinton consulted with numerous people, and she did her own research. This was her own risk; the commodity investments were her own responsibility."
The Administration officials said that Mrs. Clinton also studied financial data, including some in The Wall Street Journal.
John Podesta, a White House spokesman, said tonight: "Hillary and Jim were friends. He gave her advice. There was no impropriety. The only appearance is being created by The New York Times."
Mr. Blair, who himself made several million dollars trading commodities, said he saw no conflict of interest; he said he had helped Mrs. Clinton as a close friend, not because of the position held by her husband.
Speaking of the Clintons, he said: "Do they have to go weed their friends out and say they can only have friends who are sweeping the streets? They have friends who are high-powered lawyers. They have friends who write books, who write poetry."
Mr. Blair and the Administration officials estimated Mrs. Clinton's profits at $100,000. The officials said she opened her trading account in mid-October 1978, three weeks before Mr. Clinton was elected with 63 percent of the vote. She got out of the market on Oct. 17, 1979, just as the rising market in cattle futures from which she had profited was collapsing.
 
Protecting State Jobs
 As Governor and as a candidate for President in 1992, Mr. Clinton was forthright in defending the assistance that the state government gave to Tyson, which is among Arkansas's largest employers, saying that it was good for the state's economy.
Archie Schaffer, director of media, public and government affairs for Tyson, denied that Mr. Clinton had done any special favors for the company or the Arkansas poultry industry.
"I can tell you that I disagree totally with any suggestion that the Clinton gubernatorial administration gave the poultry industry or Tyson any breaks," he said. "That's just nonsense." Mr. Schaffer said he knew nothing of the commodity trading.
The history of the commodities trades casts a new light on the Clintons' personal finances and on their relationship to the poultry industry and to Mr. Blair, who remains a powerful figure where politics and business intersect in Arkansas.
 
Source of Down Payment
 The trades have never been publicly disclosed. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, the Clintons and their aides gave conflicting accounts when asked to explain where the couple got the money to make a $60,000 down payment on a house in 1980. During the campaign, aides declined to release the Clintons' tax returns for the late 1970's and did so again today.
When the question of the down payment first arose, the campaign said it had come from an investment by Mrs. Clinton, one that the officials declined to describe. At another point, the officials released a statement in Mrs. Clinton's name that said the money had come from "our savings and a gift from my parents."
Today, the Administration officials said that the down payment had come from savings, including the proceeds of the successful commodities trade.
 
The Clintons and Blair
Low-Paid Stars, Longtime Power

Bill Clinton came from a family of modest means, and for all his political prominence, neither he nor his wife, Hillary Rodham, had ever made much money.
Mr. Clinton was elected State Attorney General in 1976, at the age of 30. His annual salary then was $26,500. Two years later, on becoming the nation's youngest governor, his salary rose to $35,000, leaving him one of the nation's lowest-paid governors.
Mrs. Clinton, like her husband a Yale Law School graduate, had joined him in teaching law at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville in the mid-1970's. For the nine-month 1975-76 school year, each was paid $18,090, a university spokeswoman said. When Mr. Clinton's election as Attorney General took them to Little Rock in 1977, she joined the Rose Law Firm there as an associate. Her starting salary is not public, but within a year after making partner in 1980 it was $46,000.
Mr. Blair, 11 years older than Mr. Clinton, was already established in the world of business and politics in Arkansas. By the late 1970's, he had become one of the state's most successful trial lawyers.
His firm, Crouch, Blair, Cypert & Waters, was in Springdale, the center of Arkansas's booming poultry industry. In addition to advising some of the state's biggest poultry companies, it represented big trucking companies and the local utility. Mr. Blair was also a force in statewide political circles. In 1974, he ran the final, doomed re-election campaign of Senator J. William Fulbright, Mr. Clinton's political mentor.
While a partner at Crouch, Blair, Mr. Blair became general counsel to Tyson, which was founded in 1936, when John Tyson began hauling live chickens from Arkansas to Chicago. Mr. Blair eventually left the law firm and went to work directly for the founder's son, Donald J. Tyson, now chairman and chief executive. Over the years Mr. Blair has served as a director of more than 20 Tyson-controlled companies across the country.
 
The Trades
Exquisite Timing In a Risky Game
 Mr. Blair said in the interview that he first ventured into the stock market in 1956, when he was 20 years old. Through the 50's and 60's, he said, he made more money in stocks than he did practicing law. In the 1970's, he began trading commodity futures.
Mr. Blair's timing was impeccable. In the tiny Springdale office of Refco Inc., a trading firm based in Chicago, a rag-tag group of brokers, some of whom had been small-town liquor salesmen and clerks, was making millions of dollars, capitalizing on a stunning boom in futures contracts prices. The office's founder, a professional poker player named Robert Bone, was a 13-year Tyson executive who had turned a knack for gauging odds into a small fortune.
Mr. Blair said Mrs. Clinton had got into the commodities market at his suggestion.
"I recommended to her that she open an account at the Refco office," he said. "I was on a streak, on a streak that I thought was very successful, and I wanted to share this with my close friends, as I did with my fiancee, as I did with my law firm, as I did with my children, as I did with my fiancee's children and as I did with the person who was the best person at my marriage, which was Hillary, a tennis partner and friend."
Mr. Blair advised Mrs. Clinton to get into the cattle futures market because, he said, "I specifically was trading the cattle futures, and thought I knew what I was doing." He added, "I'm damn good at it."
 
On Blair's Advice
 Mr. Blair, a close friend and lawyer for Mr. Bone, who was known as Red, said Mrs. Clinton had started with a small stake. Mr. Kendall declined to say today how much money she had put up.
According to trading records examined by The New York Times and people familiar with the trades, she opened her account in the Refco office, using Mr. Bone as her broker. The account was opened in mid-October 1978, when Mr. Clinton was described in Arkansas newspapers as the favorite in the governor's race.
Mr. Blair said he had helped guide Mrs. Clinton's trades. "We discussed whether she ought to be long or short" in her trades, Mr. Blair recalled, referring to betting whether prices would rise or fall. "It was done in consultation," he said. "I gave her my best advice."
Mr. Blair said that while he would make specific trading recommendations, Mrs. Clinton "determined the size of the trade."
Around the time of Mr. Clinton's 1978 election, Mrs. Clinton opened another commodity trading account, this one with Stephens Inc., a large brokerage firm in Little Rock, Administration officials said. But they said that the bulk of her trading profits had come from the Refco account.
Mr. Blair said he had nothing to do with the decision to trade from the Stephens account.
People familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading said she had profited from most but not all of the trades.
In commodities trading, a speculator essentially bets on the future value of a commodity, like cattle or pork. Trading in such futures contracts is among the riskiest and most volatile of investments. By some estimates, more than three-quarters of all investors lose money. But a sophisticated trader, or one with special knowledge of a market, can turn a small stake into millions of dollars.
According to records and people familiar with the trades, Mrs. Clinton made most of the $100,000 in proceeds trading in cattle futures.
But after several go-go years, the cattle futures market collapsed in the fall of 1979, shattering the Refco office, leading to huge losses and lengthy litigation and sending some of the traders, including Mr. Bone, into bankruptcy.
The Administration officials said Mrs. Clinton closed her Refco account in mid-October 1979 and her Stephens account in early 1980.
Administration officials said she had got out of the market because after she became pregnant with her daughter, Chelsea, she did not have the time to keep up with developments and found the investments too nerve-wracking.
Mr. Bone does not recall how much money Mr. Blair made during the boom or lost during the bust. But he remembers that when Mr. Blair departed from the markets, "He left happy."
 
The Benefits
Proceeds Gave Clintons Nest Egg
 Other than a brief reference to $449 in commodities trading losses on their 1980 tax return, there is no evidence that the Clintons ever returned to the highly volatile commodities markets.
But their brief involvement substantially improved their fortunes. Based on the tax returns they have released, the commodity trades were by far their most successful investment.
In mid-1978, in seeking a loan from a bank in Flippin, Ark., that financed the real estate venture called Whitewater, the Clintons reported having few assets, executives of the bank have said. The main reason they got the loan, the bankers added, was the creditworthiness of the Clintons' partner in Whitewater, James B. McDougal, who at the time was a developer.
But in November 1979, shortly after Mrs. Clinton closed her Refco account, the Clintons were able to acquire $55,463 in bonds, according to their 1980 tax return. And in December 1980, after Mr. Clinton was voted out of the governor's office, the Clintons were able to make the house down payment.
Mr. McDougal has also said that in 1980, Mrs. Clinton approached him for advice about putting money in tax shelters. Mr. McDougal, who made his remarks in a 1992 interview with the Times, recalled Mrs. Clinton saying that she needed to shelter large profits that Mr. Blair had helped her make in the commodities market.
The personal ties between Mr. Blair and the Clintons have remained strong. On some visits to Arkansas, the Clintons stay at the waterfront vacation home of Mr. Blair and his wife, Diane. The Wall Street Journal has reported that on the President's inauguration night, the Blairs spent the night at the White House.
During the 1980's, Mr. Blair was appointed to the board of the University of Arkansas, where he served as chairman. Mrs. Blair, a political science professor at the university, was appointed last year to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps channel Federal funds to the nation's public broadcast stations.
Mr. Blair has also remained a behind-the-scenes adviser to Mr. Clinton since his first days in public office. For example, during the 1992 campaign -- and after the election -- Mr. Blair helped devise strategies for blunting criticism about the Clintons' involvement with Mr. McDougal and Whitewater, said Mr. McDougal and Susan Thomases, a campaign aide.
 
The Growth of Tyson
Company Thrived In Clinton Years
 The ties between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Blair's client remained strong as well. Mr. Clinton's record of support for the poultry industry and Tyson in particular has been a subject of debate for years in Little Rock, and it became an issue during the 1992 Presidential campaign. Even today, critics in Congress and others have accused the Clinton Administration of not being tough enough on the industry, particularly in inspecting chickens. Today, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department defended its record and said the department was moving to tighten inspections after years of neglect.
The criticism of Tyson's connection to the White House goes beyond its poultry interests. The company owns Arctic Alaska Fisheries, a large fish-trawling business based in Seattle. Last April, small fishing outfits in the Northwest complained that Tyson's relationship with the Clinton Administration was one reason the Government reversed course and instituted rules that would allow Arctic Alaska and other big trawlers to dominate the nation's $100 million whiting catch. The Commerce Department, which wrote the rules, denies the accusation.
Mr. Podesta, the White House spokesman, said: "The President and Jim Blair have never discussed Blair's clients' business with the Federal Government. During the Clinton Administration, we know of no instance of his ever lobbying a Clinton White House official or discussing matters of concern between his client and the Federal Government."
Throughout the 1970's and 1980's, Governor Clinton and his administration made several significant decisions that helped Tyson become one of the world's biggest poultry companies. In campaigns for Governor and President, when questioned about his support of the company, Mr. Clinton said he had fought for the industry because it was one of the biggest employers in a depressed state.
As Attorney General in 1978, Mr. Clinton intervened in a lawsuit that eventually loosened Federal regulations so that Tyson and other Arkansas poultry processors could vastly increase their productivity.
As Governor, Mr. Clinton reappointed a Tyson veterinarian to the Livestock and Poultry Commission, a regulatory body often criticized as being too close to the industry.
 
'Clinton Understands'
 Mr. Tyson, in turn, has been a major fund raiser for Mr. Clinton and has praised him for creating a friendly environment for the growth of the poultry industry.
Last year, three days after Mr. Clinton's inauguration, Mr. Tyson was asked what influence he hoped to have with the new President.
"I would be irresponsible to my company and my industry if I didn't have any input," Mr. Tyson said after a speech in Anchorage. "Clinton understands the needs of business. There were several times in our company's growth that we could have taken opportunities outside of the state, but we chose to stay in Arkansas because he understands the balance between economic development and environmental issues."
Mr. Schaffer, the Tyson spokesman, said the company received no special treatment on environmental questions. The company has spent "tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars" upgrading its plants to avoid pollution problems, he said.
But environmentalists and many Arkansas residents have complained that the balance was often tilted toward industry. The instance they cite most frequently was a long legal battle that followed the discovery that a Tyson plant in Green Forest, a town of 1,600 in northwest Arkansas, had been leaking waste into Dry Creek.
 
After Delay, Disaster
 In 1977, the state pollution control agency reissued the license for Tyson's Green Forest plant on the condition that the company meet with city officials to work out a plan for treating its wastes. But the state never enforced the order, and in May 1983 the waste from the plant seeped into the town's drinking water. Residents became ill, and 15 months later Governor Clinton declared the town a disaster area.
In a lawsuit in 1989, some residents contended that the company was responsible for a pattern of pollution around the state, abetted by a state government that refused to do anything about it.
"The various regulatory authorities legally charged with protecting the water, land and people of Arkansas from this well-known pollution have failed to take any meaningful enforcement action," the Green Forest residents said in their lawsuit. The lawsuit produced evidence that Mr. Clinton was personally briefed on the pollution problems at Green Forest, and it contended that his administration had failed to take significant action. State officials and the company denied any wrongdoing.
As one example, the residents cited the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission, which levied an $11,000 fine when Tyson's was found to have dumped waste from its plant in nearby Berryville onto private property. Mr. Blair took part in negotiating that settlement, according to court papers.
 
Dropping Clinton's Name
 The lawsuit also revealed one instance in which Mr. Blair threatened to go to the Governor's office when the state's top health officials tried in 1987 to get the company to stop dumping sludge into Green Forest's drinking water supply.
On May 19, 1987, in response to a letter from Dr. Ben N. Saltzman, director of the state Department of Health, Mr. Blair wrote that the Pollution Commission had given the company permission to dump sludge. Tyson, he wrote, was caught in a turf battle between warring agencies.
"It seems to me it is time to have a major meeting in the Governor's office with the Governor's staff and get the turf problems ironed out," he wrote.
The meeting never took place.
The Green Forest case was recently settled out of court. The terms were sealed.

 CORRECTION:

Tyson did not receive $9 million in loans from the state; the comp. did benefit from at least $7 million in state tax credits, according to a Tyson spokesman. (The error was also reflected in an article on March 19 about President Clinton's defense of his wife's investments in an interview with news agency reporters; in an article on March 30 about the White House's disclosure of how much Mrs. Clinton had invested in 1978 in the commodities trades, and in and editorial on March 31.)

Charts: "Commodies Trading: A Primer"
 OVERVIEW -- The original purpose of the commodities market was to allow farmers and food companies to protect themselves from the vagaries of weather and consumer demand that can make supply, demand and prices swing wildly through the course of a year.
 Today most of the trading is done by people who never take possession of the actual commodity, but who seek to profit by being on the right side of such a swing.
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission estimates that 75 percent of all of its investors lose money.
 REWARDS -- Profits can be great because an investor puts down only a fraction of the total cost upon buying or selling the futures contract.
 RISKS -- If prices go the wrong way, an investor can lose several times the original investment and also must come up with additional cash, sometimes within hours or days.
 If the investor is unable to do so, the commodity will be sold at whatever the current market price is and the investor will have to make up the difference.
 HOW IT WORKS
 1. Buyer agrees to purchase a certain amount of a commodity (like cattle or soybeans) at some date in the future, for a preset price.
 2. If the market price for the commodity then DROPS, the buyer is still obligated to pay the prearranged price, and loses money.
 3. If the market price for the commodity the RISES, the seller is obligated to honor the prearranged price, and the buyer makes a profit. (pg. A20)

HEADLINE: EMPIRE BLUE CROSS MISLED EXAMINERS, ALBANY CONCLUDES

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield repeatedly obstructed state insurance examiners and tried to mislead them about the company's operations and finances, according to a report made public yesterday by the New York State Insurance Department.
Attempts at obstruction were frequent and caused significant delays in the Insurance Department's effort to unravel the finances of the troubled insurance giant, the report said. 
 The report, a review of the activities of the state's largest health insurer since 1988, makes sweeping criticisms of virtually every aspect of the company's operations during a period when its finances sank to near-insolvency.
 
'Frequent Runarounds'
 Empire employees, including some high-ranking managers, denied the existence of two sets of books, withheld profit and loss information, misled examiners about the existence of a memorandum detailing failures in fraud detection, and understated by $20 million the cost of a computer contract awarded to a dentist who had been on an Empire board, the report said.
"In short, the examiner experienced frequent runarounds trying to get necessary information and data as well as what were sometimes very basic explanations of the material supplied," the report said.
"Taken together," the report concluded, the actions violate state insurance law "and cast serious doubt upon the trustworthiness of Empire's management as it was then constituted."
 
New Management Team
 Much of the obfuscation occurred last spring and summer as revelations about management mistakes and the use of false financial data put Empire in the most tumultuous period of its 60-year history.
Under a new team of managers installed last summer and a reconstituted board of directors, the obstruction has largely ended, Salvatore R. Curiale, the New York State Insurance Superintendent, said yesterday.
The 154-page report is the first examination of Empire released by the Insurance Department since 1991. The document draws a portrait of an embattled company whose board of directors took little interest in important issues and whose managers, content to keep the board uninformed, bridled at scrutiny from state regulators.
The report, which was completed last November, made 52 recommendations for changes and reforms that Mr. Curiale said would be necessary to keep Empire afloat. They include clearly defining business strategies, tightening anti-fraud measures, abandoning the practice of lavishing expensive gifts and perquisites on board members and employees, requiring that the directors approve major contracts, toughening conflict-of-interest rules and altering some accounting procedures.
John Calagna, a spokesman for the Insurance Department, said legal action against Empire itself was unlikely because most of those responsible for obstructing the examiners had left the company or been dismissed.
Empire officials, who received a draft of the report last fall, declined to discuss it yesterday. In a written statement, the company said it "does not agree with all of the audit findings, particularly the conclusion that some employees of the company failed to cooperate fully with the department's examiners."
The company has "addressed many of the recommendations in the report and others will be implemented as soon as feasible," it said.
 
A Hidden Black Book
 Last year the examiners were repeatedly told by some Empire officials that certain internal financial reports did not exist. But they later learned that the reports, known as the Black Book, did exist and had been obtained by The New York Times.
Empire officials acknowledged last summer that figures in the Black Book, which included profit and loss data for certain types of accounts, differed significantly from the inaccurate figures that Empire gave the Insurance Department. The inaccurate figures were used by Empire to bolster its lobbying campaign for a major change in state insurance law.
The financial condition of Empire, the largest nonprofit insurer in the nation, has improved somewhat since its reserves plunged to $40 million at the end of 1992, far below the $500 million considered safe by insurance regulators and by the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
The company ended 1993 with $235 million in reserves, largely because of an unexpected slowing in medical cost inflation, Mr. Curiale said. He added that he was unlikely to grant Empire's pending request for rate increases that average 8 to 9 percent.
 
No More Cheerleading
 The report is very different in tone from previous Insurance Department examinations of Empire, which are made every three or four years. In the past, Empire and its regulators have been cordial and supporting, a relationship that some critics say led to Empire's financial decline.
Last summer in Washington, investigators for a Senate subcommittee said the Insurance Department had abdicated its responsibility for monitoring Empire and had taken the company at its word when it blamed all its problems on "unfair competition" from profit-making insurers. The investigators described the Insurance Department as "more a cheerleader for Empire's cause" than "an aggressive regulator."
In its report yesterday the Insurance Department said unfair "cherry-picking" of healthy customers by Empire's competitors was a major reason for the company's financial problems, but added that management mistakes were also to blame.
The report strongly criticized Empire's directors for apparently taking little interest in operations but accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts, meals and trips for themselves and their spouses as well as free medical insurance.


GRAPHIC: From 1988 to 1991, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield held an annual three-day seminar for executives and their spouses, with Thursday "reserved for social purposes" and business discussed "for only a few hours each day" on Friday and Saturday, according to a state report issued yesterday.

Bonuses Triple for Chrysler Officials

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 17

 BODY:
After a year of soaring sales, stock prices and spirits at the Chrysler Corporation, the company more than tripled bonuses for its top executives, according to a proxy statement made public today.
Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, received a bonus of $1.9 million in 1993, up from $575,000 in 1992. For the year, he earned $6.79 million in salary, bonus, stock awards and stock options. In addition, Mr. Eaton exercised stock options in the company worth another $4.47 million. 
 Yet Mr. Eaton, who left the General Motors Corporation two years ago to join Chrysler, has repeatedly refused to take credit for the recent sales success of the nation's No. 3 auto maker. He joined the company after many of the models that have attracted new buyers -- from the LH sedan to the Dodge Ram pickup to the Jeep Grand Cherokee -- were already being developed.
 
Criticism From Union
 Chrysler's president, Robert A. Lutz, who is widely credited with developing the new vehicles, received a bonus of $1,500,000 last year, up from $450,000 in 1992. His total compensation for 1993 was $4.86 million. Mr. Lutz exercised stock options worth another $5.96 million. The other three top officers at the company also saw their bonuses more than triple.
The generous pay packages drew criticism from the United Automobile Workers. "This kind of conspicuous, excessive compensation helps nothing worth helping in our society," Stan Marshall, a union vice president, said in a written statement. "It's too much for too little. It sends the wrong message to workers and especially to young people about what is really worthwhile and what essentially makes our economy work."
Because of an expanding car and truck market -- and because of the strong yen, which drove up prices of many Japanese vehicles -- all three major domestic auto makers improved their performance in 1993.
With demand rising for its vehicles, Chrysler was also able to increase its profit margins in 1993 by cutting rebates from an average of $1,020 per vehicle in the fourth quarter of 1992 to $650 by the end of 1993.
As a result, Chrysler posted record earnings of $777 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, however, Chrysler lost $2.55 billion because of a $4.68 billion charge to cover the health benefits of its future retirees.
Chrysler's shareholders and some workers have already benefited from the company's strong year. The company announced in January that it would pay record profit-sharing checks, averaging $4,300, to 65,000 unionized employees.
Shares in Chrysler ended the year at $53.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up 63 percent from $32.625 at the beginning of the year. Today, Chrysler closed at $58.875, down $1, in active trading.
The Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation have not yet released their proxy statements. While Ford is expected to pay bonuses, G.M. is not expected to give bonuses to executives in its North American operations.
In determining bonuses, Chrysler said it paid special attention to improvements in vehicle quality, the area where critics still raise the most doubts about its cars and trucks.
Bonuses were only part of the total compensation packages. Mr. Eaton, for example, also received $928,750 in salary, up 56 percent from $597,000 in 1992. He also received 33,500 shares of stock, valued at $1.8 million, as a reward for corporate performance between 1991 and 1993. He was promised another 11,100 shares tied to performance from 1993 to 1995.
And Mr. Eaton received 140,000 options to buy stock in Chrysler at $46.25 cents a share before July 2003. Using a popular economic model for valuing options, Chrysler in its proxy statement priced those options at $2 million.

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Senate Panel Snips Piece of the Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The Senate Budget Committee surprised Democratic leaders by voting 13 to 8 today to cut an extra $23 billion from Mr. Clinton's proposed five-year, $8.5 trillion spending package.
Although $23 billion is a lot of money, today's vote was every bit as symbolic as substantive. The budgets are so huge, and the economy so unpredictable, that the impact of the latest cuts, if they survive the remainder of the legislative process, is tough to forecast. 
 The nine Republicans and four Democrats who pushed the reductions through the committee could not muster a majority to approve cuts in any specific programs, and instead told Congress's appropriations committees to make the decisions -- and anger constituents -- on their behalf.
The measure would cut a bare $1.6 billion from the $1.5 trillion budget that President Clinton has proposed for the 1995 fiscal year. But that is deceptive; the panel exempted popular benefit programs, like Medicare and food stamps, which comprise about two-thirds of all Federal spending. That means the cuts would fall on the military and on discretionary programs like education and road-building.
The Budget Committee's version still must survive a full Senate vote and a conference with the House, which passed its Mr. Clinton's package last week virtually intact. MICHAEL WINES

HEADLINE: Brick Scavenger Is Killed When a Wall Collapses

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
One of four men who were scavenging bricks -- at 15 cents apiece -- from an abandoned building in the Bronx was killed yesterday when a wall collapsed and crushed him.
The police said that the four men were being paid by a construction company. It is common in the poorest areas of the city, officials said, for the bricks of abandoned and partially destroyed buildings to be taken for recycling into patios in the suburbs or decorator fireplaces in the city's more expensive neighborhoods. 
 Although police officials declined to estimate the extent of the scavenging, one officer at the scene of the collapse at 1123 Nelson Avenue, in the High Bridge section, said taking bricks from abandoned buildings in the area is "a common, everyday thing -- part of the neighborhood economy."
Captain Tom Purtell of the 44th Precinct said the three surviving scavengers were not being charged. "We don't think there's any criminality involved here," he said, "But we are not overlooking that possibility." The victim was not immediately identified.
 
15 a Brick
 One neighborhood resident, Freddie Rodriguez, said he had been offered 15 cents a brick to help the four others. He said he turned down the offer, which he said came from a local company that hired the four others.
Police officials said last night that they did not know who owned the abandoned building -- which was burned out and already partially collapsed -- or if the construction company had permission to remove the bricks.
Neighbors said the company, called American, had an office in a building two doors away. But when reporters rang the bell there was no answer.
The neighborhood, where many buildings are abandoned, and some of them gutted, is a half mile south of the abandoned building where Police Officer Sean McDonald was posted when he was shot to death trying to stop a robbery Tuesday night.
According to an executive of a large brick company not involved in the case, the New York area offers a highly lucrative market for old bricks because of the desirability of their antique patina. Emil Puswald, an official of the Long Island City Building Building & Mason Supply Company, said he was attempting to fill two orders of 8,000 bricks each for decorating two Manhattan apartments.
He said such bricks sold for from 25 to 30 cents a piece.
While one brick company official said old bricks were banned in some areas for new construction, many contractors, decorators, apartment and home owners used them for sidewalks, patios, and interior redecorating.
"There's quite a market for them," Mr. Puswald said. "People want that look."
According to the police, the three-story building was destroyed by a fire 18 months ago. Last week, they said, parts of the building collapsed and that it was amid the rubbled inside that the four men were working in yesterday afternoon, chipping bricks, one by one, from the rear wall, much of which was still standing.
At 3:40 P.M., however, the wall fell inward, crushing one of the workmen, who was removed about two hours later and pronounced dead.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance on Good Inflation News

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
When the stock market got a third day of good economic news yesterday, traders fought their tendency to ferret out the specter of inflation in even the cheeriest reports. Instead, they bid up all the leading stock indexes, and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index set a record.
Economically sensitive stocks like Caterpillar and Alcoa, as well as oil and chemical companies like Exxon and Du Pont, rose. Technology stocks like Tele-Communications, Oracle and Lotus, helped lift the Nasdaq index. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 16.99 points, to 3,865.14, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.48 points, to 470.90. The Nasdaq index rose 4.86 points, to 803.85, up from its previous record of 800.47 on Jan. 31.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.77 point, to 261.11, on moderate volume of 304 million shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining issues by 1,149 to 1,015. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.81 point, to 470.63.
 
 
Bonds Slip
 The stock market gained, even though the bond market did not. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Government bond reached 6.82 percent, up 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. When prices fall, yields rise.
Bond traders failed to believe inflation was in check, despite a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia survey yesterday showing that an index of prices paid by manufacturers had fallen sharply, indicating a possible slowing in inflation.
When the same survey last month showed the index rising, indicating a possible increase in inflation, bond traders believed it and bid bond prices down.
Earlier this week, both the Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index indicated scant inflation.
For much of the session, two of the three popular stock indexes tracked the price of the 30-year Government bond. The exception was the Nasdaq index, which rose strongly at 9:30 A.M. and continued to do so for the entire session. Around 2 P.M., both the Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500 parted company with the bond market and rose steadily.
Hanson P.L.C.'s American depository receipts were the most actively traded issue on the Big Board yesterday, with 7.9 million shares changing hands. Hanson rose 1/4, to 21 1/8. One A.D.R. represents five ordinary shares.
There was no discernible news to spur the activity, but the A.D.R.'s for Hanson, a British consumer-products company, often trade heavily around its ex-dividend date, which was Monday. When a stock trades ex-dividend, current purchasers are not entitled to a dividend until the next payment is declared.
 
 
Intel Gains
 Intel, the dominant maker of computer chips, rose 3/8, to 72 1/4.
Analysts have raised their assessments of the stock despite inroads by Intel rivals. Apple Computer recently introduced a new Macintosh that uses the PowerPC chip that will compete with Intel's new Pentium microprocessor. Also, the rival Advanced Micro Devices recently won an important copyright infringement case against Intel.
Acclaim Entertainment, a maker of home video games, saw its stock fall for a second day because of concern that a key vendor, WMS Industries, may not renew a licensing contract due to expire next year. Acclaim, whose shares fell 3/4, to 22 1/4, said it did not know whether WMS had reached a decision.

HEADLINE: For 2 Slaying Suspects, Quiet Lives, Odd Hours

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
The two young men charged yesterday with the murder of Police Officer Sean McDonald migrated to New York City from the Caribbean not long ago in search of opportunity, and they ended up in the perilous streets of Washington Heights, where drugs and guns are as common as the throbbing beat of salsa.
Interviews yesterday with acquaintances and landlords indicated that the suspects, Rodolfo Rodriguez, 20, and Javier Miranda, 27, both came from the Dominican Republic, but neither was known to have relatives in the city, and they rented cheap rooms in buildings about five blocks apart. 
 Acquaintances said the two men lived quietly, sleeping late and hanging out in a neighborhood just across the Harlem River from High Bridge in the Bronx, where the officer was shot to death Tuesday night as he interrupted a robbery in a clothing shop.
 
Drug Connections
 Law-enforcement officials said there were no indications that Mr. Miranda had been in trouble before. But they said Mr. Rodriguez, who arrived from the Dominican Republic last fall, had become a small-time drug dealer and was arrested in Washington Heights for selling crack cocaine to undercover police officers on Jan. 10.
While the charge against him was a class B felony carrying a maximum penalty of 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison and a prosecutor asked for $1,500 bail, a judge released him without bail the day after his arrest because he had no record, and two other judges affirmed that decision in his later court appearances.
Betty Reyes, 25, who said she had been Mr. Rodriguez's girlfriend for about three months, said he was unemployed but had formerly worked for a neighborhood supermarket. She called him "very sweet and nice," and said he had denied any involvement in the slaying of the police officer. "He said he didn't do it," Ms. Reyes said. "I know him. He wouldn't do it."
Franckline Jean, the owner of a four-story tenement at 558 West 173d Street, said he had rented Apartment 3A -- one room in the back of the building -- to Mr. Rodriguez last fall, and that the young man had lived there quietly, paid his $300 a month rent in cash and rarely had visitors.
"I never saw any of his friends," said Mr. Jean, who owns the building and occupies the first floor. He said Mr. Rodriguez told him he worked at night, but did not explain what he did for a living. He said he kept odd hours, slept until early afternoon and stayed out late at night. He said he never detected any signs that his tenant was involved with drugs or possessed a gun.
 
'A Nice Person'
 Other neighbors said they did not know and had never seen Mr. Rodriguez, but several teen-agers outside said they knew him. "He was a nice person," said Jenina Benitez, 16. "He would let us chill in his house and watch TV. If he was a criminal, he would not have turned himself in."
Natalia Encarnacion, 15, also expressed skepticism about the charges. "I didn't believe it," she said. "He wouldn't do it."
A spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, Wayne Brison, said Mr. Rodriguez was arrested at 3:10 P.M. Jan. 10 at 156th Street and Edgecombe Avenue after selling two vials of crack cocaine to undercover officers of a police Tactical Narcotics Team.
Charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, he was arraigned the next day in Criminal Court before Judge Laura Safer Espinoza. Assistant District Attorney Cheryl Blackman asked for bail, noting that he had given two addresses and said he had come from Miami and had lived in New York only two months, a background that suggested he might be a bail risk.
But a Legal Aid lawyer said it was Mr. Rodriguez's first arrest, and the judge ordered him released in his own recognizance. He was indicted by a grand jury three days later, and pleaded not guilty at his next court appearance, on Feb. 15, before Acting Justice Herbert J. Adlerberg of State Supreme Court, who left his bail status unchanged.
Mr. Rodriguez appeared next on March 10 before Acting Justice Herbert I. Altman of State Supreme Court, who also continued his bail status and set a hearing for April 8 to hear pretrial motions in the case. Legal experts said it was not unusual for judges to release a defendant without a criminal record on no bail. The case is still pending.
Less was known yesterday about Mr. Miranda. Gloria Almanzar, 59, who occupies a sixth-floor apartment at 2201 Amsterdam Avenue, at 169th Street, said she rented a room -- actually a cubicle fabricated of plywood within a bedroom -- to Mr. Miranda for $75 a week about two weeks ago.
He had answered a notice she had posted on neighborhood streets seeking a roomer, she said, and had identified himself only as David. She said she learned the name Javier Miranda only when the police came to her door Wednesday night in search of him.
She said her Spanish-speaking roomer was quiet, though he sometimes entertained a woman in his room and kept erratic hours. But she said there had been no signs of drugs or guns in his life. "He said he worked in a bodega," she said.
 
Teddy Bear and Cigars
 While he told her little about himself, she said he did mention that his father was Dominican and his mother Puerto Rican and that, while he had come originally from the Dominican Republic, he had arrived in New York recently from Puerto Rico.
In his cubicle, a mattress without sheets had been set up beside two dressers, one with a mirror leaning against the wall. There were rumpled clothes and other personal effects lying about, a radio, a yellow toothbrush, a small white teddy bear, a box of cigars and a box of aloe candy.
But there was no picture in the frame on the dresser -- no photos anywhere in the room, in fact -- and no obvious clues to his recent past or the crime of which he stands accused.

HEADLINE: In the Humble Ashes Of a Lone Incinerator, The Makings of Law

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 11

 BODY:
Every day, like enormous worker bees tending a hive, an endless procession of trucks haul 1,300 tons of garbage to Chicago's trash incinerator and carry away 400 tons of resulting ash to a modern, plastic-lined landfill in the nearby town of Elwood, Ill.
The ash is the end product of 14 percent of all the garbage that Chicagoans toss out, and it is tainted with two toxic elements: lead and cadmium. Whether the city is disposing of it safely is a question in dispute. Whether it is doing so legally is a question for the United States Supreme Court, which is due to decide before the current term ends in three months. 
 A lot is at stake. The city argues that an adverse decision, requiring that the ash be dumped at specially designed hazardous-waste sites, would increase the ash disposal expenses of Chicago -- and those of dozens of other incinerator-operating municipalities across the country -- perhaps tenfold.
And that starkly higher cost, the city says, could well force a shutdown of much of a new generation of waste management tools: the nation's 125 trash-to-energy incinerators, which consume almost a fifth of all of America's garbage. These new plants, which became popular during the 1980's and can cost as much as $400 million apiece to build, not only burn away 90 percent of the volume of trash that is fed to them but in the process also produce modest amounts of steam and electricity. (Chicago's incinerator generated energy worth $1.5 million last year.)
 
Many Allies for Chicago
 Few decisions of the Court have been so eagerly awaited by cash-short states and cities. Already burdened by the cost of complying with environmental mandates, many of which they view as the work of idealists who have never had to balance a municipal budget, other local governments have rallied to Chicago's side as its six-year-old legal battle against the Environmental Defense Fund moves toward climax.
"The Chicago incinerator case is a classic example of the central problem cities have identified with environmental policy," said Michael Pompili, Assistant Health Commissioner of Columbus, Ohio, which also operates a waste-to-energy incinerator and, like Chicago, dumps the ash in an ordinary plastic-lined landfill that it considers perfectly safe. "There is just not an unlimited amount of economic resources available. When it comes to the environment, we have to be smarter and set priorities."
Naturally the Environmental Defense Fund sees the issue differently, and not without reason.
Whatever the merits of plastic-lined landfills -- and the fund views them as insufficient to handle toxic ash -- the fact is that many cities that operate incinerators dispose of ash in dumps that have only clay liners, or no liners at all. Richard Denison, a senior scientist with the fund, says there has been one documented case, in Washington State, in which groundwater beneath a clay-lined ash dump was contaminated by leaking cadmium. Two states -- Florida and Alabama -- even permit incinerator ash to be used as fill in road construction.
Lead, one element of incinerator ash, is considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the chief toxic threat to children. Children are particularly susceptible to neurological damage and other ill effects if lead invades the body at substantial levels. The toxic effects of cadmium, another ash element, are also well documented.
Lead and cadmium are present in all manner of debris hauled daily to Chicago's incinerator -- in cans, in light bulbs, in batteries. But the toxins are not present in proportions high enough to be deemed hazardous under the nation's waste disposal law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. The problem, however, is that these toxins do not themselves burn, and so they concentrate in the incinerator ash at levels that tend to exceed the law's thresholds of hazard: for lead, five parts per million when measured in testing solution; for cadmium, one part per million.
 
Expensive Protection
 To provide special protection against toxic leaching into the water table, the law requires that hazardous waste be dumped not in ordinary landfills, like the one Chicago nontheless uses to dispose of its ash, but instead at licensed hazardous-waste sites. These dumps are built with a double lining of plastic (instead of the single lining that characterizes the ordinary modern fill) and have two collection systems -- one inside each lining -- to capture any toxin that nears escape.
All this sounds expensive, and it is. For equivalent volumes of waste, hazardous-dump operators charge municipalities as much as 1,000 percent more than do ordinary landfills. By Chicago's own reckoning, its ash-disposal expenses would be about $50 million a year if it used a hazardous-waste dump, as against the current outlay of $4.5 million.
 
One Law, Differing Views
 Still, since the concentrations of lead and cadmium in Chicago's ash are hazardous by Federal definition, the city would seem to have little choice: either pay up or shut down the incinerator.
But maybe not.
At issue before the Supreme Court are the two sides' differing interpretations of a 1984 amendment to the waste disposal law. The amendment, aimed at encouraging the development of technology to deal with the nation's mountains of garbage, says that as long as trash incinerators that produce energy are burning only household waste or nonhazardous commercial waste, they "shall not be deemed to be treating, storing, disposing of, or otherwise managing hazardous wastes."
What does that mean?
By Chicago's reading, it means that the ash hauled from the city's incinerator enjoys an exemption that allows it to be dumped in an ordinary landfill, a conclusion shared by the Clinton Administration, which has filed a brief with the Court in support of Chicago's position.
By the reading of the Environmental Defense Fund, though, the "plain language" of the exemption makes clear that it applies only to the collection of garbage and the incineration of that garbage itself. What about the ash? "We say an exemption does not exist," said Karen Florini, a lawyer in the Washington office of the New York-based fund. "And if the Supreme Court strictly interprets the law, they will agree."
 
Split at Appellate Level
 A Federal appeals court has already agreed. Last year the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, reversed a Federal district judge and found in favor of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Noting that hazardous-waste dumps had been created as a result of the very waste-disposal law now at issue, the appeals court said it seemed "unlikely," if not "absurd," that "Congress, in an express effort to promote the proper disposal of dangerous substances that otherwise would seep into the ground and water table, would sanction the dumping of massive amounts of hazardous waste in the form of ash into ordinary landfills."
But a similar challenge in New York by the Environmental Defense Fund went just the other way, with victories at both the district and circuit levels for the operator of an incinerator in the Westchester County town of Peekskill. Faced with a conflict in decisions issued by the Seventh Circuit and the Second, the Supreme Court agreed last year to take up the Chicago case. The Justices heard arguments in January.
 
Big Stake for Connecticut
 Chicago has attracted no dearth of allies. Briefs supporting the city's position have been filed not only by the Administration but also by New York State, the National League of Cities, the National Governors Association, the United States Conference of Mayors and 29 cities and counties that operate waste-to-energy incinerators in 17 states.
None of those states have more at stake in the Court's decision than Connecticut, where six incinerators burn 6,000 tons of garbage a day. That is 62 percent of all the state's trash, by far the highest proportion in the country, according to the National Solid Wastes Management Association. New York State has 14 such incinerators, which burn 15,000 tons daily, or 20 percent. The figures for New Jersey: six incinerators, 4,600 tons daily, 9 percent.
 
The Threat of Landfills
 The fund's lawsuit against Chicago was filed in 1988, after years in which the city disposed of its ash by dumping it at an old quarry where gusts of wind often sent clouds of it billowing into a neighborhood nearby.
Now, at a time when Chicago has long since cleaned up that act, largely as a result of the fund's efforts, the city portrays the suit as not only errant but indeed self-defeating -- not a plus for the environment, but a minus. The reasoning is this:
In the absence of quick Congressional action to reverse a Court decision favoring the fund, most incinerators would have to shut down, the city says. As a consequence, it maintains, there would be a need to build vast new landfills to handle volumes of garbage that would otherwise be burned away.
The trend in landfill construction has been to build enormous regional dumps, each covering hundreds of acres. Most are being built in previously untouched forests and fields of rural America, bringing deterioration of natural landscapes held most dear by environmentalists.
Chicago's defeat would only accelerate that process, the city contends. "If people take a careful look," said Lawrence E. Rosenthal, deputy Chicago corporation counsel, "they'll be surprised by which way the environmental issues cut in this case."
To Ms. Florini, the Environmental Defense Fund lawyer, all this is just so much overstatement. Chicago and other cities, she says, can escape the steep rise in ash disposal costs -- and so keep their incinerators running -- simply by doing a better job of trash management. For instance, by separating from incinerator-bound waste any products that contain heavy metals, the cities could keep cadmium and lead out of incinerator ash, or at least keep concentrations of them below hazardous levels. And that would allow continued disposal of the ash in ordinary landfills.
Chicago's response: Easier said -- and far less expensively -- than done, given the sheer volume of garbage destined for the city's incinerator.
Each side continues to claim environmental correctness as its own, and that is not likely to end. By the time the Supreme Court's term concludes in June, though, everyone should know at least on which side the law comes down.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Recovers vs. Mark And Registers Slight Gain

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar posted a marginal gain against the German mark yesterday, rebounding from an early selloff that was touched off by news that the Bundesbank, the German central bank, had left two key interest rates unchanged.
The dollar fell more than a pfennig in Europe and in early New York trading after the German central bank said it was holding its discount rate steady at 5.25 percent and the Lombard lending rate at 6.75 percent. 
 Although almost no one had expected the Bundesbank to trim the discount rate, some traders had thought that the central bank would cut the Lombard rate as a symbolic gesture to show that it remained committed to lower rates.
 "A lot of people expected the Lombard rate to come down as low as 6.25 percent," said Robert Mograbi, senior vice president at NatWest Bank P.L.C.
The Bundesbank's failure to act left the dollar mired near 1.6780 marks for most of the morning. But market speculation that the Federal Reserve Board may move to increase interest rates in the United States next week averted heavier losses, dealers said.
"The threat that U.S. rates could go higher will keep the dollar from getting annihilated," said the Bank of Boston's chief foreign exchange trader, Paul Wong.
Later, reports that the German Finance Minister had hinted that rates in Germany need not remain low simply because the bank failed to act contributed to the dollar's recovery.
Dealers also noted a flurry of mark selling against both the dollar and the British pound late in the afternoon, which cut into the mark's gains.
In the end, the dollar rose to 1.6882 German marks in late New York trading from 1.6881 marks on Wednesday.
With attention focused on American and European interest rates, the dollar drifted between 105.50 and 105.95 yen. It ended in New York at 105.78 Japanese yen, down from 106.05 yen.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Canada was seen intervening, buying Canadian dollars in an attempt to halt a slide that has sent the currency repeatedly to seven-year lows against the United States dollar. The United States dollar ended in New York at $1.3685 (Canadian), up from $1.3638 (Canadian).
Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.4925 in late New York trading from $1.4950 Wednesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lumber Falls on Oversupply; Good News Hurts Metals

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Lumber futures prices tumbled the daily limit for the second day yesterday as abundant supplies continued to depress the market.
Lumber for delivery in May fell $10 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to $416.70 for each 1,000 board feet. 
 The price of lumber has been depressed as the result of bad weather in recent weeks that delayed housing starts. "The weather has caused people to hold inventories," said Bud Merrill, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in Eugene, Ore. "The hope was the weather was going to clear up and there would be a lot of pent-up demand, but we just haven't seen that so far."
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 4.1 percent last month, but lumber-futures traders were dissatisfied with the gain, which followed a 22 percent drop in January.
Traders also appeared concerned about rising mortgage rates as the spring building season approaches.
On other commodity markets, platinum futures continued to fall, leading a decline in precious metals in recent days. Reports of low American inflation and strong economic growth is the sort of news that makes metals traders unhappy, as is the relative calm in some of the world's hot spots. Investors tend to buy the metals as a hedge against inflation and during times of turmoil abroad.
Platinum for April delivery sank $4.90, to $398.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, April gold lost $2.60, to $383 an ounce, and May silver fell 2.5 cents, to $5.377 an ounce.
Nina Lipton, vice president of the Platinum Guild International in New York, contended that the recent price slide did not indicate a long-term trend. "There's basic underlying strength to all the metals," she said, "and you're just going to have choppiness coming day to day until we get some new news."
Energy futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil prices rose and then dropped sharply in the last hour on technical trading. The price of light sweet crude oil for April delivery settled 24 cents lower at $14.82 a barrel.
In other energy contracts, April home heating oil fell 0.23 cent, to 44.24 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline dropped 0.56 cent, to 45.99 cents, and April natural gas fell 0.39 cent, to $2.124 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain futures prices ended mixed, and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago Board of Trade in sluggish trading. Wheat for March delivery settled 1.25 cents higher at $3.375 a bushel; March corn was unchanged at $2.80 a bushel; March oats were 2.75 cents higher at $1.295 a bushel, and March soybeans were 1.75 cents lower at $6.9025 a bushel.

HEADLINE: 2 Banks Raise Prime Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and the Harris Trust and Savings Bank said yesterday that they would raise their prime lending rates today to 6 percent, a move that brings both banks in line with the rest of the industry.
The prime rate has been at 6 percent since July 2, 1992. But Harris and Morgan broke ranks with other large banks last fall, cutting their rates in a bid to bring in new business and turn up the heat on competitors. 
 No other major banks moved yesterday to raise their prime lending rates, an important benchmark for many types of fixed- and adjustable- rate loans, including credit cards.
"I wouldn't take what Morgan and Harris are doing as an indication of what the rest of the industry would do," said Michael Foley, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service. "They're just coming in line with the rest of the market."
The Chicago-based Harris lowered its prime to 5 3/4 percent on Sept. 17 and to 5 1/2 percent on Oct. 18. Harris eased the rate back to 5 3/4 percent on Feb. 4.

HEADLINE: U.S. Approach to Japan: 'Economic Acupuncture'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, March 17

 BODY:
Having succeeded in its efforts to pressure Japan to open its most lucrative cellular phone market to Motorola Inc., the Clinton Administration plans to keep up the pressure on Tokyo to unilaterally open other markets with a strategy that some disdainfully call "managed trade," but that might best be thought of as "economic acupuncture."
That policy seeks to bring down Japan's trade barriers not with a single, big blow that would destabilize the whole United States-Japan relationship, but instead through a series of carefully targeted pressure points aimed at loosening some of Japan's other tightly constricted markets. 
 Critics charge that this approach constitutes managed trade, which inevitably requires more regulation, benefits certain companies over others, and undercuts arguments for free trade elsewhere. Despite such criticisms, however, the Clinton Administration's targeted policy seems to be producing results for the United States, and officials say it is actually reversing managed trade practices that already exist.
No sooner had President Clinton brandished the possibility of sanctions under the Super 301 trade law, than Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa promised Washington that by the end of March he would produce a package of unilateral Japanese initiatives to open the other closed markets to which the United States has spent the last eight months fruitlessly trying to negotiate access: autos, medical equipment, insurance and telecommunications.
This issue will no doubt be a topic of discussion between Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Japanese economic officials attending the meetings here this weekend of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, known as APEC.
For all the Administration's tough rhetoric, though, it is proceeding very cautiously with Tokyo, so as not to derail other aspects of the relationship or ignite a tit-for-tat trade war. For now, American officials seem satisfied that their speak-loudly-and-carry-a-small-needle strategy is working.
"Any time you maintain a strong and consistent position with the Japanese, it is helpful," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said.
President Clinton's approach to Japan, Mr. Kantor added, is very much colored by the fact that he was a governor, who accompanied Arkansas businessmen on trade missions to Japan in an effort to win them access. He looks at Japan as much through the narrow lens of a typical American exporter as he does through the wide-angle lens of a global strategist worried about cooperation with Japan on issues like Korea and Russia.
The American public, Mr. Kantor said, "wants a realistic trade policy grounded in practical experience, not in theory."
But if the public is pleased with the results, economists still contend that the absence of sound theoretical grounding will ultimately undo the pragmatic Clinton approach.
 
 
Trade Balance
 One of the economists' complaints is that the President and his aides often hold up the $60 billion trade surplus of Japan with the United States as proof that it is closing its markets to American goods. That $60 billion figure may make a nice emotional banner to gather under, economists say, but as any student of Economics 101 knows, the trade balance is not a measure of how open markets are between countries. Rather, it is a reflection of how much a country is saving and investing.
If the United States spends too much, instead of saving, it must make up the difference by getting capital from abroad. The United States buys lots of Japanese cars and the Japanese then lend the dollars they earn back to the United States Treasury.
"The Administration has lost the analytical high ground by couching the problem with Japan as a trade deficit," Robert Z. Lawrence, a trade economist at Harvard University, said. "Trade balances tell you about a nation's spending patterns, not whether its markets are open or closed."
The United States should be demanding that Japan lower its trade barriers because they exist and are unfair -- not because this would eliminate its trade surplus, Mr. Lawrence said.
 
 
Japanese Recession
 The real thing that the Administration should be focusing its energies and public attention on, Mr. Lawrence said, is the spending and investing habits of Japan -- the fact that it is in a recession and its Government is not spending enough, or lowering taxes enough, to stimulate Japanese consumer demand for imports from the rest of the world.
Barry Bosworth, a former top economic adviser in the Carter Administration, said: "If we really want to start to change the trade balance, we have to encourage Japan, as the world's second-largest economy, to adopt a more aggressive fiscal expansion, so it will import more of everything. The Japanese are very adept at resisting the important changes and then, at the last minute, giving in on the high-visibility trivial items."
Administration officials concede that at times their declarations on Japan put too much emphasis on the trade balance for public relations reasons. But, they argue, if people looked at the substance of their approach, they would see that it is precisely what the economists are demanding: asking Japan to stimulate domestic demand with tax cuts and Government spending programs and compelling the Japanese Government to lower trade barriers in those markets that it regulates, such as Government procurement.
 
 
'Rhetorical Issues'
 "Some of my friends have picked on some rhetorical issues and failed to recognize the substance of the Administration's policy," said Lawrence Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
While, of course, it is true that the trade balance is determined by savings minus investment, said Mr. Summers, a former Harvard economics professor, that does not mean that working to open Japanese markets is a useless exercise.
"As a rough estimate, the impact of each billion dollars in extra demand for American products that we generate -- which leads to a stronger dollar and makes American imports cheaper -- translates into about a billion dollars in extra real income for Americans," Mr. Summers said. "So market opening, even if it does not reduce the trade balance, has important benefits for American workers and producers."
As for accusations that the Administration's approach constitutes managed trade, that might be true, Mr. Summers said, if the United States were asking Japan for special deals only for itself that would close off the rest of the world. But the fact is, he said, the whole thrust of American policy is to open those Japanese markets for the world where market forces do not now operate because of managed trade practices by Japanese companies or the Japanese Government.
That is important for American companies, he added, because if they have access to this huge market, they benefit from economies of scale by exporting more and because the tougher competition hones them up to better compete with Japan elsewhere around the world.
While this strategy may require certain hardball tactics to carry out in the real world, Mr. Summers noted, "Pure economic theory needs to be leavened at times with a little political theory."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Off in Week

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
New claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week, the Labor Department said today.
The department said 342,000 people signed up for first-time jobless benefits, down from a revised 350,000 in the week that ended on March 5. Wall Street economists had expected 343,000 new applications for state benefits. 
 "It would suggest that labor market conditions have improved," said Michelle Laughlin, economist with Sanwa BKG.
The department said its four-week average tally of benefits claims slipped to 345,250 in the week that ended last Saturday from a revised 349,250 the previous week. The average, considered a more reliable measure than the more volatile weekly figure, has been steadily declining.
A total of 2,749,000 people received state jobless benefits in the week that ended on March 5, the latest period for which the data were available. That compared with 2,778,000 recipients a week earlier.
The department said 18 states and one territory reported increases in claims of more than 1,000 in the week ended March 5, the latest period for which the data were available. The largest were California, with 9,493 and New York, with 6,598.

On Another List: Scholars Saved From the Nazis

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG 

 BODY:
In the United States and elsewhere, there were daring "Schindlers" who also kept lists. In different ways, far-sighted Americans rescued thousands of victims of the Third Reich's assault on the minds of people in every profession. Although few of these Americans risked their lives, they were often maligned by their own countrymen. On the eve of World War II, their humanitarian efforts met surprising resistance in the State Department and even in some universities.
The Johnson list was probably the most valuable. Alvin Johnson, the intrepid director of the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, saved nearly 200 European scholars from the Nazis. Many of these refugees later became indispensable Americans. Some of their activities have been touched upon before in biographies and documentary films, but what "Intellectuals in Exile" usefully provides is historical perspective from the German as well as the American side of the story. 
 That the author of this outspoken book is a German scholar, Claus-Dieter Krohn, professor of modern history at the University of Luneburg near Hamburg, adds another level of interest. For instance, Professor Krohn, who was born in 1941, is unafraid to declare that during the Hitler years anti-Semitism existed among the professoriate in some American as well as German universities.
The book briefly describes the origins of the New School, which was founded in 1919 by a group of liberals, including Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, Charles Beard and Johnson. Until 1933 it was only a small experimental institution for adult education.
With the rise of Nazism, various committees were formed to aid threatened scholars and artists. They had to be: American immigration quotas were not relaxed even after the defeat of France in 1940. Among the most important of these groups was the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars in the United States, to which the Rockefeller Foundation made a strong financial contribution. (Unfortunately, as Arthur D. Morse pointed out in his seminal work, "While Six Million Died," no such special committees could save the vast numbers of anti-Nazis and nonscholars of Jewish origin who wanted to reach freedom's shores.)
Johnson founded a "University in Exile" at the New School in 1933, beginning with a list of 12 social scientists who became known as the Mayflower group. Among these "dismissed or furloughed" German professors were Emil Lederer, Frieda Wunderlich and Karl Brandt. Max Ascoli (who established the liberal magazine The Reporter after the war) became the first Italian political scientist on the faculty that year. When the "University in Exile" opened in October 1933, it was officially renamed the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science.
After the defeat of France, the New School became the last refuge for endangered German and other European scholars. Professor Krohn writes: "Quite clearly, too, the New School served as an alibi for the inaction at a number of universities. This is especially true of Harvard University, whose faculty recommended many of the most highly qualified scholars to the New School but did not itself accept any immigrants."
The author adds that some of the professors themselves caused problems: "The New School people had to deal not only with vexing placement policies but also with the indifference of many German scholars who had found teaching jobs and showed little interest in helping their less privileged colleagues."
The main resistance to rescuing the professors on Johnson's list, Professor Krohn documents, came from the State Department. While President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt encouraged granting visas to political refugees, State Department officials threw up roadblocks. The author writes that even as the German occupation forces were closing all exits out of France, the State Department's bureaucratic visa division refused all entry applications from Johnson and specifically denounced the New School as an un-American institution:
"Representatives of the State Department asked some scholars who had just come to New York from France if they knew that the place where they were going to work was headed by Communists. These machinations did not stop until Johnson threatened to request a public hearing on these attempts at sabotage."
Between 1933 and 1945, the New School managed to help hundreds of European scholars and artists, including such familiar names as Mario Einaudi, Claude Levi-Strauss, Wilhelm Reich and Gaetano Salvemini, in the social sciences and history, and Herbert Berghof, Fritz Eichenberg, Erwin Piscator and George Szell in the arts.
"Intellectuals in Exile," which is smoothly translated by Rita and Robert Kimber, can be faulted for one heavy-going section, on the influence of the New School's European economists in exile. Professor Krohn tries to show that their theoretical concepts were instrumental in the New Deal, but in this respect, he gives credit where it is not due. The Roosevelt Administration had its own economic idealists and reform programs to pull the country out of the Depression and create new regulatory and public-assistance agencies. America's New Dealers did not have to rely on the exiled European intellectuals for inspiration.
The author also discusses the New School scholars in relation to postwar Germany. He notes that there was no concerted effort to offer the exiled faculty members their former professorships in their old universities. Some of the Americanized professors criticized the United States for its role in the cold war and also for failing to change Germany's postwar political structure, "including the totally inadequate denazification," writes Professor Krohn, who leaves the strong impression that the Bonn Government should have made better use of its own well-kept lists of possible war criminals.
It is such freewheeling interpretations that make "Intellectuals in Exile" a challenging as well as informative book.

HEADLINE: The Broadway Ticket Game: Bargain-Hunters Can Play

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
THE complaint is heard so often it's mundane. You've even made it yourself: tickets for Broadway shows are too expensive. But it's only three months until your anniversary, so you decide to bite the bullet. A couple of seats for a big musical would be a great way to celebrate.
You can't go to midtown Manhattan, so you call one of the ticketing services, order the seats -- not bad, 20th row center -- and pay $65 apiece, plus $4.50 or $5 each for a service charge, and maybe a handling charge, too. Finally, the big evening arrives. You go to the theater and sit down. Just as the curtain goes up, the seats next to you are filled by another couple, who are gushing about what a great deal this is. 
 "Two tickets for the price of one," they are clucking to themselves. "And we just walked up and got 'em!" Or maybe: "Hey, a third off! How about that! And right in the center of the orchestra!"
What's going on here? Well, a myth and an enigma. The myth is that Broadway tickets are hard to come by. Its corollary is the basic tenet of discounting, whose murky illogic can be simply summarized: make some tickets cheaper, but don't tell people how to get them.
Underlying it all is the reigning paradox of the Broadway theater business: the same high ticket prices that producers say are needed to pay the bills also keep a lot of people out of the theater. It frustrates producers; it frustrates audiences. Nobody has any effective solutions, and not many theater people are even willing to discuss the issue openly.
"I am thoroughly convinced that people in the business are totally aware of the truth, and the truth is, nobody in the business would ever pay that much to go to the theater," said one producer with several Broadway shows to his credit. "The reason people won't talk about it is that it's very difficult to have to start lying immediately. If you say it's not worth it to come and see what we're offering at this price, what happens to the already jaded theatergoing public when they read this? What happens when an investor reads this? Sometimes I'll sit in a room and feel guilty myself."
 
Affordable Seating
 Sixty-five bucks for a musical? Fifty for a play? And prices are on their way up?
The theater experience is singular, the argument for higher ticket prices goes. But if you're willing to forgo any of the privileges of a full-price-ticket buyer -- performance selection, for example, or seat selection -- you can have that singular experience for less.
In the theater business, this is actually a bit of a dirty little secret. Although no producer would deny the existence, or the usefulness, of lower-priced seats, most aren't terribly enthusiastic about publicizing ways to get them. And many of those interviewed echoed the words of one, who spoke on condition of anonymity, for obvious reasons.
"Great," he said with a groan. "You're going to tell people all the ways they can avoid paying full price."
In fact, this is so. Limited numbers of regularly priced cheap seats, binoculars not included, are available for many shows. You can see "Miss Saigon" or "Les Miserables" for $15; "Angels in America" has $10 seats for some performances. In addition, producers employ a variety of discounting programs to seduce theatergoers into the orchestra. The best-known of these, responsible for between 10 and 15 percent of Broadway ticket sales, are the TKTS booths, operated by the Theater Development Fund in Times Square and at the World Trade Center. At the booths, if you're willing to stand in line and take potluck as to what shows are available, tickets for that day's performances are on sale for half or, sometimes, three-quarters of their face value.
There are also group sales programs, twofers (the bookmark-shaped coupons distributed in various locations for some shows, redeemable at the box office for discounted tickets) and other means of getting in for less.
"The most expensive tickets in a theater often do sell at the big price," said James B. Freydberg, a producer whose latest Broadway show was "Fool Moon" last season. "But only the people who can afford the big price have to pay the big price."
 
A Broadway Paradox
 The reason producers are wary of discounting has to do with another Broadway paradox. It's a Marxist idea -- Groucho Marx, that is: Everyone wants to go to a show that he can't get into, and nobody wants to go to one that anyone can get into. In other words, the idea that Broadway provides an elitist form of entertainment is one of the things that make it attractive, and producers go out of their way to keep up the fiction that it's a cool, hopping place.
Why else is the pure myth that Broadway is a tough ticket so widely believed? The first week in March, for instance, not a single one of Broadway's 18 shows sold out every performance. Most had tickets available anytime; 12 shows had less than 70 percent attendance, and many perceived hits were truly hurting. "Crazy for You" and "Tommy" drew less than 60 percent of capacity, "The Sisters Rosensweig" and "Laughter on the 23d Floor" less than 50 percent. Last year's Tony Award winner for best play, "Angels in America," was less than three-quarters full, and the Tony winner for best musical, "Kiss of the Spider Woman," sold only 56 percent of its seats.
Discounting, producers say, sends the message that the show is not popular enough for people to buy tickets at full price. Theatergoers expect Broadway prices to be exorbitant, the argument goes, and when this isn't so, they suspect damaged goods. It's common knowledge among producers that the highest-priced seats sell fastest, then the lowest-priced sell. Quality first, economy next. The seats priced in the middle are the toughest to get rid of.
"There are more buyers for a $65 seat seat than for a seat almost as good for $20 less," said Michael David, whose company, Dodger Productions, is responsible for "Guys and Dolls" and "Tommy," among others.
Such is the mindset that has undermined the Broadway Alliance, producers say. The three-year-old alliance, a consortium of producers, craft unions and theater owners who have forged an agreement to curb their own costs to bring lower-priced drama to Broadway, has yet to produce a successful show.
And such is the mindset that persuades some producers to leave seats unsold rather than make them available at the TKTS booth. In that same March week, the producers of four shows -- "Tommy," with 43 percent of its seats empty; "The Phantom of the Opera" (10 percent empty), "Les Miserables" (25 percent), and "Angels in America" (26 percent) -- declined to make half-price day-of-performance seats available.
"We'd rather go dead with a limited number of tickets than have people say, 'Oh, it's at the booth now,' " said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway theaters and produces many shows, including "Angels" and "Tommy." "There comes a point even in the run of hits where the show goes to the booth, and at that point people begin to think the show is running down. We want to keep the perception that it's a hard-to-get ticket."
"There's a Zen proverb," Mr. Landesman concluded. "It says you can always have what you don't want." He paused, then added his own Groucho-style postscript to make it appropriate for the theater business. "Or vice versa."
 
Doing the Math
 There are no laws governing ticket pricing. Producers are responsible for setting the tariffs for their own shows (with the approval of the theater owners) and generally tailor prices to the demands of the particular shows. That is, the prices depend on things like the number and configuration of seats in the theater and the show's weekly operating budget.
"You price according to need," said Philip J. Smith, executive vice-president of the Shubert Organization, which owns 16 Broadway houses. "In theory, you price a show so that you break even at 50 percent capacity."
But producers also tend to watch one another to avoid seeming either greedy or foolhardy.
"We try to create a price scale not aberrational according to what everybody else is doing," said Michael David.
Some shows do come to Broadway with the aura of extenuating circumstances and can get away with prices above the norm: the limited-run, eight-and-a-half-hour "Nicholas Nickleby," say or "Miss Saigon," with its functioning helicopter onstage, which commanded $100 for an orchestra seat. (For "Miss Saigon," the $100 price tag was for only 200 seats a performance, and it lasted only until the capitalization was recouped.) But most shows hover in the same region and bump their heads on a tacitly agreed-upon ceiling. When prices go up, they tend to do so collectively, and only after one show has tested the waters.
For two seasons, the top price for a Broadway seat -- which also means the price of most seats, since the whole orchestra and at least half the mezzanine are priced the same for most shows -- has been $65 for most musicals and $50 for most plays. ("Angels" is now $65, a record for a play.) But in the fall, the $75 ticket will arrive on Broadway, borne in by a revival of "Show Boat," and "Sunset Boulevard" tickets will go for $70.
While nobody disputes that that's a lot to pay for an evening's entertainment (not to mention eating dinner out, paying the baby-sitter and parking the car), producers say prices are justified, at least from a simple business standpoint. Labor and advertising costs have driven up budgets alarmingly, they say. And singing, dancing, costumes and special effects, not to mention the presence of a star, are what it takes to draw people out from in front of a movie or television screen these days; for the mass audience, live theater has become synonymous with extravaganza.
It's a bit of a circular argument -- the helicopter helps persuade a mass audience to part with big bucks, which is what pays for the helicopter -- and of course, one wonders whether, say, a revival of "Show Boat" really needs to be so extravagant that it couldn't survive with a $65 ticket. But in any case, all of this has helped turn the business of putting on a show into a high-risk, low-reward enterprise.
"You can do the arithmetic as well as I can," said Garth Drabinsky, the producer of "Show Boat." With a cast of 71, a 30-piece orchestra and more than 500 costumes, "Show Boat" will cost $8 million to stage and $600,000 to run every week. Even with the higher ticket prices, the show will need to run nearly a year to break even, and a good deal longer than that for the investors to see a significant return. If Broadway is going to flourish, producers say, investors need to be encouraged. Otherwise, there will be no Broadway at all.
That's the usual argument. Indeed, Mr. Landesman is fond of saying that a ticket regularly priced at $100 or more would be justified, strictly on the basis of economics.
"If we could get away with it, we'd charge $125," Mr. Landesman said. "But the public would go nuts."
 
Strategic Pricing
 If this all sounds a little hardheaded and archaic, it is. Virtually everyone interviewed for this article admitted that the theater business has lagged in marketing ideas. But in general, because producers are rarely willing to risk the fortunes of any particular show on any new idea, innovations have been few. And the fact is, in contrast with the airline business, producers have only begun to exploit the idea of ticket pricing as a marketing tool.
"The industry sees discounting as panic liquidation of inventory," said Susan Lee, the director of marketing for the League of American Theaters and Producers. "What we never do is look at what kind of customers buy at what price point, and how to keep them coming."
 
Reluctant Experiments
 As a result, experiments to create greater blocs of lower-priced seats have languished. There's no reason, for example, that instead of pricing all orchestra seats at $65, a producer could not offer the first 10 rows at a premium price and reduce the price a similar amount on the rear 10. The revenue would be the same. This technique has occasionally been tried, with varying degrees of success; it isn't in operation everywhere because producers believe the public won't understand it.
"The problem is, you create a great perception that this is being handled in an elitist way," Mr. Landesman said, "and that a select few, who are not the general public, are getting select seats."
When "Miss Saigon," in the first nine months of its run, offered about 200 tickets for each performance at $100 each, many customers assumed the worst.
"We began to encounter market research that said people believed that $100 was the price for all seats usually sold for the top price," said Alan Wasser, the show's general manager.
(There are also plans that would raise prices to certain shows that have languished as well. Producers have often discussed a system that lets the demand for tickets determine the price. This would combat scalping but might put a show like "Phantom" out of reach of all but the very affluent until months into its run.)
In the end, of course, all the explanations and rationalizations still leave many would-be theatergoers at home. In a recent letter to The New York Times, Beatrice S. Daly, a librarian at the Queens Public Library, echoed the frustration of many. "What I'd really like to know is how a person of finite resources can attend the theater," she wrote. "Do producers want to empty theaters?"
Of course, they say no. But when you bring up to them the case of a Ms. Daly, someone who wants to visit Broadway but can't afford it, or even a hypothetical case -- a Brooklyn couple, say, who have cut their regular theatergoing from six times a year to twice -- the response is pure chagrin.
"It's not like we're rubbing our hands together thinking about all the money we're going to make," Michael David said. "I don't know how to fix the situation for the couple from Brooklyn who want to go six times a year. To give them six shows they want to see at the prices they can afford? I don't know how to do it."
 
 
How to Order, With or Without a Discount
 Here are some ways to buy discount tickets for Broadway shows, along with information on telephone ticket services and ticket brokers:
 
TKTS BOOTHS. The two booths are at Duffy Square, 47th Street and Broadway, open daily, and on the mezzanine of 2 World Trade Center, open daily except Sunday. Tickets for selected shows are sold on the day of performance, with availability posted at the front of the booth. Tickets cost 50 or 75 percent of box-office prices, as determined by the producers, plus a $2.50 service charge per ticket. Information: (212) 768-1818.
 
THEATER DEVELOPMENT FUND MAILING LIST. The same organization that runs the TKTS booths has a mail-order service, selling tickets to members at $14 plus $1.50 mailing charge. Students, teachers, union members, retired people, performing-arts professionals, members of the clergy and armed forces personnel all qualify for membership. To apply, send a request, with a self-addressed stamped envelope to T.D.F., 1501 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036.
 
TWOFERS. The Hit Show Club distributes discount coupons in stores throughout the New York metropolitan area and also keeps a mailing list. The coupons, redeemable at the box office or by mail, offer discounts of 25 to 50 percent to selected shows. To join the club, send a stamped, self-addressed envelope for the first mailing to the Hit Show Club, 630 Ninth Avenue, Room 808, New York, N.Y. 10036. Recorded information: (212) 581-4211.
 
SCHOOL THEATER TICKET PROGRAM. This program distributes discount coupons to teachers, librarians and counselors at schools in the New York City area, who are to make them available to students. Prices range from $35 to $50. Saturday night performances are not available for most shows. Information: Sheila Berkowsky, (212) 354-4722.
 
MAILING LISTS. If you are a season subscriber to a nonprofit theater, like Lincoln Center Theater or Manhattan Theater Club, you may receive letters offering discounts on Broadway or Off Broadway productions. Most are for previews or the first few weeks after openings.
 
GROUP SALES. Many shows offer discounts, usually 10 to 20 percent, on the purchase of 20 or more tickets. The Shubert and Nederlander organizations have their own group-sales offices, and several independent businesses handle group sales. The telephone numbers are generally included in newspaper advertisements. The amount of the discount and when it is offered are determined by the producers, so it is possible for a group to pay less for "Show Boat" (which is offering a 10 percent discount on $75 tickets ordered before May 1) than for "Sunset Boulevard" (which is offering no discount at all on its $70 tickets).
 
WHEELCHAIR TICKETS. All three Broadway theater owners offer special discounts to theatergoers in wheelchairs, and to their companions or attendants. The Shubert Organization, which owns 16 theaters, offers tickets for $7.50. The Nederlander Organization, with nine theaters, sells tickets for $15. Tickets to shows in the five houses owned by Jujamcyn Theaters are half price. The number of available seats at a particular theater is limited by space and fire laws.
 
TELEPHONE ORDERS. Broadway tickets may be ordered by phone through Telecharge (for shows in Jujamcyn or Shubert theaters) or Ticketmaster (for Nederlander theaters), but theatergoers pay for the convenience. Telecharge, (212) 239-6200, adds $4.75 a ticket. Ticketmaster, (212) 307-4100, adds $5 a ticket plus a $2.50 handling charge for the order.
 
TICKET BROKERS. Brokers who operate in New York State or advertise in New York-based media are allowed to charge 10 percent or $5 more than the face value of a ticket, whichever is more, plus credit card charges. That, however, does not curtail abuses: recent calls to brokers advertising in New York newspapers turned up Broadway tickets for as much as $225. In a pinch, the concierges at many New York hotels have been known to find a ticket or two for hotel guests who just didn't plan well enough and are willing to pay for their forgetfulness.
 
 
Economics 101: Why 'Show Boat' Costs $75
 Tickets to "Show Boat," which is to open at the Gershwin Theater on Oct. 2, are now on sale for a top price of $75, a new high for a regularly priced ticket for an open-ended Broadway run. Here is why:
The show's producer, Garth Drabinsky, said the production would cost $8 million to open. Beyond that, he said, it will cost about $600,000 a week to run, by far the highest operating budget on Broadway.
The Gershwin, with about 1,900 seats, is Broadway's largest. With eight performances a week, that's 15,200 tickets, and if all sold for $75, that would be a potential gross of $1,140,000.
Not all the seats will be $75 seats, however; about two-thirds will be. Mr. Drabinsky said about 100 seats a night would be held as complimentary house seats.
"Then after you deduct discounts for group sales and credit-card commissions, the gross at capacity is around $900,000," Mr. Drabinsky said. "Some weeks you'll do capacity, some not. You know that when it snows in New York, you'll do less. You assume you'll do 85 percent to 90 percent capacity. That's a safe number. The show breaks even at approximately 63 percent capacity."
If the show will gross $900,000 at capacity, then at 85 percent capacity the weekly gross is about $765,000. That's a weekly profit of $165,000, which means the $8 million original investment will be recouped in 48 weeks.
If the top tickets to "Show Boat" were $65, the weekly gross at 85 percent capacity would be about $680,000, an $80,000 profit, which would mean the show would need 100 weeks, nearly two years, to break even.
"I knew we'd have to do this before I opened the show in Toronto," Mr. Drabinsky said of the ticket price. "So far the public has been respectful of what we're trying to do, and there hasn't been negative feedback on it. But it's always difficult to be the first." BRUCE WEBER

HEADLINE: Fairer Schooling for Michigan

 BODY:
This week citizens of Michigan voted courageously to toss out decades of tradition in public school financing. It is the first statewide, voluntary shift away from property taxes, as a rising national chorus of disgruntled homeowners and civil rights activists seek more equitable ways to provide one of society's most basic services.
Education in America has traditionally been seen as a local concern. Hence the reliance on property taxes, which are also less vulnerable to economic fluctuations, to finance school systems. 
 But property assessments within and among states diverge wildly. Across the country, the amounts of money spent on schools based on the taxes derived from those assessments are unconscionably unequal. In Michigan, for example, the poorest districts spend about $3,200 per pupil, while the richest spend $10,000. In New York, the bottom 10 percent of districts spend an average of $5,670 per pupil, while the top 10 percent average $11,265.
Legal efforts to challenge such disparities have rebounded from 1973, when the Supreme Court rejected such an attack from Texas and refused to declare education a fundamental right. Now 28 states are involved in lawsuits, many based on state constitutional promises of fairness, that seek to redistribute school aid.
Older voters in many communities have refused to tolerate rising property taxes to pay for schools. And many middle-class parents in cities, who send their children to private schools, have less of a stake in public schools that increasingly serve minority and poor students.
At the same time, the education reform movement of the last decade has elevated good schooling to a matter of statewide and even national concern. During that time, states and localities have reversed their stake in school financing. On average, the proportion of school aid coming from states has gradually increased from about 40 percent to 50 percent, while the proportion of aid coming from localities has dropped from 50 to 40.
Michigan will now go much further. Under a new financing plan pushed by Gov. John Engler, a conservative Republican, the state sales tax will jump from 4 to 6 percent. The increase is expected to raise about $2 billion, which would replace the same amount in property taxes. An increase in the cigarette tax will generate an additional $350 million.
Under the new plan, less than 10 percent of school funds will come from property taxes. In a state ranked eighth nationwide in property tax burden, that was surely a motivating factor for the 70 percent of voters who supported the plan. It also seeks to reduce disparities by setting a minimum of $4,200 per pupil for each district and capping spending increases by wealthier districts.
It is not yet clear if the sales tax will be a reliable source of school funds over the long term. But the status quo is unacceptable. Throughout most of the U.S., children in wealthier school districts continue to benefit from superior education while those who live in poorer districts -- and who need more resources, not fewer -- continue to be deprived.
The public schools have given generations of Americans a chance to fight their way up from poverty. If America is to live up to its promise of equal opportunity, this glaring inequity in education must be addressed. The fact that Michigan voters have voluntarily, and so overwhelmingly, tried to make school financing fairer should make other states sit up and take notice.

A Friend Differs

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: CANBERRA, Australia

 BODY:
"I think the United States has wrong-footed itself unnecessarily in its argument with Japan," Prime Minister Paul Keating said.
"If it argues that Japan should open its markets to the rest of the world, having secured so much itself in the multilateral trading system, it cannot lose that argument. But if it then argues that the way to do it is through managed trade and quotas imposed on a market economy, it's bound to lose the argument." 
 Why? I asked. His answer was that managed trade would not work:
"What American President, what Australian prime minister, what German chancellor, what Japanese prime minister can deliver on behalf of their manufacturing or service industries great chunks of market share? I suggest: None."
Mr. Keating did not direct his criticism at President Clinton. After Mr. Clinton's efforts on Nafta and the GATT negotiations, he said, "the multilateralist in him is pretty obvious." But he suggested that the President was feeling pressure for "bilateral solutions."
"Because of a slowness in reconstructing its economy in the 1980's," he said, America has had "a loss of confidence in its capacity to trade profitably in these new burgeoning markets" in Asia.
But in fact, he said, "the United States is making very large productivity changes, changes to its business culture. Look at the car industry. In quality and price you can actually win a legitimate market battle. You don't need to be tricky about that."
Americans may find it a bit surprising to have the leader of an Australian Labor Government talking in those tough market terms. But Mr. Keating has moved the Labor Party to the center on economic and other issues, and the policy has been a remarkable political success.
He became Prime Minister in 1991 by carrying out a party coup against the man who had the job, Bob Hawke. A year ago this week he faced an election that all the experts said was "unwinnable" -- and won.
On China, too, the Keating Government differs from Clinton policy. The United States is right to put its views on human rights to China strongly, Mr. Keating said -- as he has done. "But to go the next point and say, well, if you don't accept that view, we will then rupture the relationship is not an ideal solution in a less than ideal world.
"The problem in all these things is, if you put a hook in your own mouth, you've got to be able to dislodge it. I just hope that U.S. policy makers have thought that through."
Was there any compromise way out of the conflict with China, I asked, for example by Washington imposing some penalty on Chinese trade but not completely dropping China's most-favored-nation status? "Probably there is," he said, but it would require a gesture from China on human rights -- one that would take patient, firm negotiating to achieve.
The Prime Minister mixed these comments with warm praise for President Clinton. "In this Presidency," he said, "there is a chance to restore the faith Americans have had in their highest office as an agency for change.
"I think that societies find leaders like this once in a generation, if they're lucky. They've got one now, and they should value it."
There was a sense in the interview of Mr. Keating's identifying with Mr. Clinton. They are of the same generation -- the Prime Minister 50, the President 47. They have in common, too, the rise from humble origins. But Mr. Keating has nothing like Yale and Oxford in his background. He left school at 15 and entered Parliament at 25.
"I learned the hard way," the Prime Minister said. "I educated myself largely. I had to build in my head a model of this country, its society and economy, how you keep a society together, how you deliver assistance to those who are disadvantaged and low-paid without holding back those who are able to create wealth."
A striking aspect of his personality is his love of the arts. He is a hard politician with a rough tongue, dismissing opponents as "low-lifes" and "grubs." But in music he goes for the romantic: from Beethoven to Elgar and Mahler. He said esthetic interests influence his view of the world: "I've always been run by my eyes and ears."

HEADLINE: Congressional Roundup;
Tobacco Industry Tests Its Influence

BYLINE: By KATHARINE SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Smoking and anti-smoking forces clashed today in a preview of what will probably occur next week when a House subcommittee takes the first vote on far-reaching legislation that would ban smoking in most public places throughout the country.
The vote by the subcommittee on health and the environment, which is expected to take place on Tuesday, will provide a gauge of the tobacco industry's influence in Congress. More and more cities, states and businesses are banning smoking. 
 The bill being sponsored by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, and called the Smoke-Free Environment Act, would ban smoking in virtually all buildings, although smoking would be allowed in some designated areas with outside ventilation.
The pro-tobacco forces said in the subcommittee hearing today that the bill represented unnecessary regulation, impinged on individual liberties and would put tobacco farmers out of work.
A scientist from the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company said the bill was the result of a desire to be "politically correct" rather than of scientific evidence. The scientist, Chris Coggins, showed a chart that he said indicated that a family history of tuberculosis and a diet high in saturated fats were more likely to cause cancer than being married to a smoker. His chart did not show the risks from cigarettes themselves.
The anti-smoking forces included business owners who testified that banning smoking made good economic sense because it cut employee absenteeism, increased productivity and reduced other costs. They also included owners of shopping malls who had their own anti-smoking rules but said they needed a Federal law that applied to everyone so that they wouldn't be hurt by people who preferred to shop or open businesses in malls where smoking was allowed.

Winning New York Munis Took Credit Risk

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
Most of the winning New York municipal bond funds took on credit risk and won: They held big chunks of middle-tier New York issues that have rallied sharply since their ratings were lowered in early 1992.
Flagship, for example, had half its portfolio invested in debt rated BBB (just above junk-bond status) at the end of December, and Value Line had 59 percent then, according to Morningstar Inc., the mutual fund research company in Chicago. 
 Eileen Sanders, a Morningstar analyst, predicted the muni funds would chug ahead, in part because of a tighter supply of issues. Rising interest rates hurt the funds because they depress bond prices, but higher Federal taxes make the tax-free interest payments more valuable, she said.
If you believe the economy is coming out of recession, you can safely stay with the funds that own lower-rated paper.
But investors who do not want to take on that risk should look for muni funds whose BBB-rated holdings equal less than 20 percent of their portfolios, Ms. Sanders said.

Markets
 
Financial markets were alarmed at what traders saw as encroachment of the Administration on the independence of the Federal Reserve after the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, was summoned to the White House for what the Administration said was a routine meeting with President Clinton. [Page 39.]
 
The Dow climbed 30.51 points in the third-busiest day ever, with nearly 450 million shares traded. The trading volume was pushed up by the "triple witching hour" expirations of options and futures and the anxiety over the meeting between Mr. Greenspan and President Clinton. [39.]
 
Treasury securities plunged as the Clinton-Greenspan meeting also rattled the bond market. Bonds gave up almost all their gains for the week, with the yield on the 30-year bond rising to 6.90 percent, from 6.82 percent. [48.]
 
Prices of precious metals rose on the widespread turmoil in the financial markets. Gold jumped $4.60 an ounce, to $387.60, in New York. Silver and platinum also gained. [47.]
 
The dollar rose against other leading currencies on expectations that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates. [47.]
 
 
The Economy
 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen convened a meeting of finance ministers from 17 Pacific countries in Hawaii, furthering the Clinton Administration's effort to focus American business toward Asia and away from traditional European markets. [39.]
 
Dallas beat several cities to effectively win the offices of a new labor secretariat that will enforce a side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement on workplace standards. [38.]
 
 
Companies
 
Bankers Trust New York paid its chairman $10 million last year, an amount equal to about 1 percent of its profits. [17.]
 
Macy's senior creditors are squaring off with Laurence A. Tisch over his holdings in the company and his increasingly active role as the chairman of its finance committee. [39.]
 
Some drug companies dispute claims by lawyers for women with breast implants that a final settlement has been reached to compensate the women for health problems. [8.]
 
Whittle Communications will close its book publishing operations, which have failed to obtain sufficient advertising commitments for the next fiscal year. [41.]
 
Newmont Gold shareholders approved a complex stock and asset-balancing plan with Newmont Mining that will create the world's sixth-largest gold producer. [41.]
 
Hat Brands, the country's biggest hat maker, plans to acquire Texace, a maker of golf hats. Terms were not disclosed. [41.]
 
Gun makers like Sturm, Ruger are worried that rising concerns about gun violence will hurt business. [8.]
 
 
International
 
Foreign companies gained a bigger share of Japan's semiconductor market in the fourth quarter of 1993, which could help defuse another trade dispute with the United States. [39.]
 
The British Government will not hold antitrust hearings on a deal that would give a majority stake in The Independent newspaper to a group including the owner of the tabloid Daily Mirror, effectively ending the battle for control of the paper. [41.]
 
 
Your Money
 
All-weather funds can protect investors during downturns in the market and make money over time. [37.]
 
Increasing savings can be a powerful investment strategy that usually involves little sacrifice and few risks. [37.]

HEADLINE: Looking to Asia, Bentsen Sees History in Making

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, March 18

 BODY:
Since taking office, the Clinton Administration has tried to focus American business away from its traditional European markets and toward Asia, and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen took another step in that direction today.
He convened finance ministers from 17 Pacific nations here after tantalizing an audience of American investors in Los Angeles with the observation that the Asia-Pacific region would be starting the equivalent of 18 Santa Monica Freeway projects every day for a decade. 
 "I don't have to tell people in this town about the need for freeways," Mr. Bentsen told a business group in Los Angeles this morning, before flying to Hawaii for the Asia-Pacific Conference. "I've given you a lot of numbers, but here is some I think hit home. In Asia -- excluding Japan -- they will spend a trillion dollars in infrastructure of all types in the next decade. That's a Century Freeway every week."
 
Big, Even for a Texan
 Mr. Bentsen added: "If I were 30 years younger, I know what market I'd want to be in. I'm from Texas. I'm used to big. But it is difficult to comprehend how big that market is and how those economies are transforming."
Mr. Bentsen's remarks, and this weekend's first gathering ever of all the finance ministers from the key nations in the Asia-Pacific region, are part of the Treasury Department's efforts to redefine both the boundaries and content of American financial diplomacy.
Throughout the cold war, the financial diplomacy of the United States tended to be centered on the industrial democracies of the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- and confined largely to interest-rate and exchange-rate coordination.
The Group of Seven jobs conference in Detroit this week was an attempt by the Administration to begin transforming the organization to deal with more practical matters of daily life, like unemployment.
 This weekend's meeting in Hawaii of the 17-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, known as APEC, which includes economic powerhouses like China, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan, is the latest manifestation of the Clinton Administration's main message today to America's business leaders: "Go west."
As one Administration official put it: "The G-7 jobs summit is about what is going wrong. APEC is about what is going right."
 Whatever the geo-strategic thinking may be in other parts of the Administration, the Treasury Department is operating on the assumption that when the history of the late 20th century is written, the most important transformation historians will point to will not be the end of the cold war. Rather, it is likely to be the flow of more money more rapidly to one region -- Asia and the Pacific -- than has occurred in any decade in world history.
 
On Par With the Renaissance?
 As a result of those capital flows, two billion people -- two and a half times as many as those living in the industrialized West -- are bringing themselves into modernity in the space of a single generation. This growth spurt, Treasury experts argue, will ultimately rank with the Industrial Revolution and the Renaissance. In economic terms, South Korea alone grew as much in a single generation as the United States did in the last century.
If that is the direction history is going, said Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, "we want to make sure that we don't look back in the year 2050 and say that the 1980's and 1990's were when it all began and had we only done 'X' or 'Y' we would have been fully a part of it."
 Whether the Clinton team can mobilize American business capital to exploit fully the region's opportunities is an open question, but the Administration has put its mouth where it wants its money to be.
"People, especially in Europe, think we are an Atlantic nation," Mr. Bentsen said to his audience in Los Angeles. "We are also a Pacific nation. We do more trade across the Pacific than the Atlantic. Our largest state is on the Pacific, isn't it?"
Nationally, Mr. Bentsen added, 60 percent of American exports -- $270 billion worth of products -- now go to the 17 Asia-Pacific nations whose finance ministers will be represented in Hawaii this week.
"Asia is a continent that economically could be larger than Europe and the United States combined within the next 50 years," Mr. Bentsen said, warming to the subject. "By the year 2000, even leaving Japan out, some 75 million Asian households will have incomes comparable to middle-income Americans. We are talking about economies that make up half of the world's output, but the finance ministers of these economies have never met all together in one room."
 
Ideas for Financing
 Administration officials plan to use this specific meeting, which started tonight with a reception and dinner, to discuss how Asia-Pacific countries can most efficiently raise foreign capital for development projects -- something the United States wants to make sure it is influencing from the ground floor.
"To keep growth up, there has to be financing behind it," Mr. Bentsen noted. "The Asians have high savings rates. I admire them. I am envious of them. But they are not that high to pay for a Century Freeway every week. Corporate retained earnings won't do it. Borrowing at the local bank won't do it. They need outside capital."
The Secretary pointed out that multilateral development banks, like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, had been leading sources of capital in the region. But both are short of money, and because of budget cuts the United States has not been replenishing their funds as it did in the past. The Administration is trying to persuade Congress to free some money; this conference is part of that strategy.
"In these budget-axing times, I've heard people question, 'Why do we give money to those banks?' " Mr. Bentsen said. "Let me put it this way. When you have satisfied the American market for 747's, you have to sell them somewhere else. Those developing countries are the ones that need airplanes, and they are turning out to be pretty good customers."

HEADLINE: Bentsen Says China Would Lose Trade Status Now

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, March 18

 BODY:
Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said today that if the Clinton Administration had to decide whether or not to renew China's preferable trade status now, it would not do so because of Beijing's human rights behavior.
Mr. Bentsen, speaking in Los Angeles this morning before flying to Hawaii to be the host of a conference of Asian Pacific Finance Ministers, was asked about the status of the Administration's China policy after Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Beijing, which was marred by repeated arrests of Chinese human rights advocates during his stay. 
 "Human rights is a major concern," Mr. Bentsen said. "To the extent that we can influence China, we want to do so. But we must balance economic interest, which is not an easy task. You have to be careful how you do that to avoid just giving competitors an advantage."
Each year in June the Administration decides whether to renew China's most favorite nation benefits, which allow it to export products to the United States at the lowest possible tariff rate. That decision depends on China's ability to meet certain minimum human rights standards, like accounting for political prisoners or ceasing the use of prison labor for exports.
"If the decision was made today, I assume China would lose its M.F.N. privileges," Mr. Bentsen said. "But we have until June and hopefully we can work it out."
Mr. Christopher's recent visit to China has been widely criticized within the Clinton Administration and White House, because it transformed an issue that was best dealt with in a quiet low-key fashion into a high profile spat between the two countries.

HEADLINE: Clinton-Fed Chief Talk Alarms the Markets

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
A Presidential invitation to the chairman of the Federal Reserve for what the White House insisted was a routine meeting today turned into an embarrassment for both men, as financial markets reacted with alarm to the appearance of Administration encroachment on the central bank's independence.
Bond prices fell sharply and stocks briefly dipped this morning after Fed and White House officials said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, had canceled a planned trip to Houston and a short speech there. Instead, he attended the weekly meeting of the President with his top economic advisers to review the health of the economy. 
 Administration and Fed officials said the furor was a result of a succession of missteps.
 
Invitation on Thursday
 Robert E. Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, some of whose members attend the Friday meetings, began discussing with aides on Monday or Tuesday the possibility of inviting Mr. Greenspan, but did not extend the invitation until Thursday at lunchtime.
Mr. Greenspan accepted without mentioning his plans to go to Houston for a conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He canceled the trip. "What he was going to do in Houston was open a panel discussion -- it wasn't like he was going to give a major policy address," Bob Stahly Moore, a spokesman for the Fed, said.
Participants at the Houston conference, many of them economists and professional Fed watchers, became alarmed as Fed officials began to tell them on Thursday afternoon and this morning that Mr. Greenspan would not attend because he had been summoned to the White House. The Fed watchers, who had traveled to Houston to keep an eye on Mr. Greenspan, were caught flat-footed in the wrong city and began making agitated telephone calls to the East Coast to find out what was going on.
"People don't know quite what's up," Robert Eisner, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, said in a telephone interview from the conference this morning.
The White House and the Fed expressed surprise at the strong reaction to today's meeting and blamed one another for attracting attention to the meeting. "There has never been a big fuss about this before," said Gene Sperling, a senior official on the White House National Economic Council. "It appears to me that the announcement by the people who were putting on the speech seemed somehow to create a false impression."
Bonds gave up almost all their gains from the week, with the yield on 30-year bonds rising to 6.90 percent, from 6.82 percent. [Page 48.]
Administration and Fed officials went out of their way today to describe the meeting as unimportant and say that interest rates were not discussed. "We certainly didn't try to suggest or persuade Chairman Greenspan, nor should we, what his outlook or policy should be," said Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House's chief of staff. "He reviewed both the domestic and world economies, and sees good underlying fundamentals."
But Wall Street was not convinced that today's White House meeting was unimportant or routine. "I would certainly perceive it as an attempt to bring undue political pressure," said David Jones, a longtime Fed watcher at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York. A Presidential discussion of the economy's health can be a veiled way for the White House to signal the Fed that further increases in interest rates could hurt economic growth and would be unwelcome, he said.
Financial markets are particularly nervous now because the Fed's interest-rate policy committee is set to meet Tuesday and has been expected for weeks to raise rates then. Today's flap probably convinced them that higher rates were even more likely now, to avoid the public impression that the Fed had yielded to any pressure from the White House.
"The Fed is going to be tested now with regard to its anti-inflation credibility because of this meeting," Mr. Jones said. By raising short-term rates, the Fed can slow economic growth and hold down inflation.
At the Fed committee's last meeting, on Feb. 4, top Fed officials voted to raise by a quarter of a percentage point the interest rates that banks charge one another for overnight loans.
President Clinton last met with Mr. Greenspan on Jan. 21, which was a Friday, and on Nov. 8, which was a Monday. Neither meeting was publicly announced, but many Government officials and financial markets were aware of them soon after.
Today's meeting took place with the usual secrecy -- Mr. Greenspan came and went through the south entrance of the White House, out of the view of television cameras -- but became public because it was scheduled on short notice and forced Mr. Greenspan to cancel the speech in Houston at the last minute.
Robert D. McTeer Jr., the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, read aloud at the conference some excerpts from Mr. Greenspan's prepared remarks. According to a brief text of the remarks supplied by the Fed here, Mr. Greenspan had planned to offer a review of economic research into low savings rates in the United States.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan were joined at this morning's meeting by Vice President Al Gore; Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Mr. Rubin.
Alan Blinder, another member of the Council of Economic Advisers, usually attends the Friday meetings but recused himself today because he was the leading candidate for President Clinton to nominate as the next vice chairman of the Fed. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen also attends most of these meetings, but he was on the way to a meeting in Hawaii of finance ministers from Asian and Pacific Rim countries.

HEADLINE: Rally Ends Hectic Day For Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In one of the most hectic sessions ever, the stock market plunged on Washington rumors in the morning, endured the quarterly rite of passage called "the triple witching hour," then rallied as bargain hunters snapped up brand-name stocks like Honeywell, Exxon and Boeing.
But the action was over fast. In the opening 60 minutes, a record 220 million shares changed hands, two-thirds the volume of a typical day's session. 
 It was a turbulent close to a week in which most economic indicators were uniformly favorable, but market professionals continued to be unusually sensitive to any news or rumors about interest rates in advance of Tuesday's policy-setting meeting of the Federal Reserve Board.
 
Dow Up 30.51 Points
 For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.51 points, to 3,895.65. After dropping as much as 17 points before 10 A.M., the market rallied strongly, moved sideways for much of the day, then rose more than 14 points in the last seconds of trading, probably because of high-speed computer-guided trading.
The trading volume was swollen by "triple witching hour" selling activity, as well as anxiety over a suspicious-looking, although apparently innocuous, meeting between Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and President Clinton.
After record trading in the opening hour, volume slowed, but at 462.2 million shares, it was still the third heaviest in history and the highest since Oct. 20, 1987, when 608 million shares changed hands just after the stock market plunge of Oct. 19, when 604 million shares were traded.
Yesterday started anxious. At 7:28 A.M., Bloomberg News Service ran a headline that read, "Greenspan Cancels Houston Speech to Meet With Clinton Today."
 
Bond Traders Panicked
 The headline was a signal for bond traders to whisper wild rumors. "Everybody got panicked," said Jan E. Terbrueggen, a bond portfolio manager for Flagship Financial in Dayton, Ohio, which manages $5 billion in fixed-income investments.
By 8 A.M., the price for the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond began plunging in earnest, falling as low as 9120/32 shortly before 11 A.M., when the news service's headline read, "Greenspan Arrives at White House for Meeting With Clinton." By noon, the White House began describing the meeting as routine and no cause for alarm. Bond prices began to firm, but still ended lower for the day.
For the stock market, the Clinton-Greenspan meeting dovetailed with Friday's triple witching hour, when three sets of futures and options contracts expire on the same day. The impact of such sessions has lessened substantially in recent years, with traders buying or selling stocks before the expiration date.
But as Friday opened, the last remaining contracts had to be exercised, and they involved millions of shares. Suddenly those sell orders merged with a panic selling of shares brought on by the drop in bond prices, as well as parallel stock market anxiety about the Clinton-Greenspan meeting.
 
Enthusiasm on Inflation
 Meanwhile, other traders who had been buying stocks in the nascent enthusiasm following favorable Producer and Consumer Price Indexes noticed the price drops. They bid up shares.
The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.16 yesterday to 471.06. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, after establishing a record yesterday, was little changed, rising 0.08 point, to 803.93. The New York Stock Exchange rose 0.24 point, to 261.35. Declining stocks edged advancing stocks by 1,091 to 1,071. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 2.33 points, to 472.96.
Bloomberg Financial Services recorded the Dow industrials at 4 P.M. as 3,881.55, but as late trades got counted the Dow spurted to 3,895.65. For the week, the Dow moved ahead 32.95 points.
The New York Stock Exchange, as is its practice on witching days, published a list of 61 stocks with order imbalances. They included American Express, A.T.& T., BankAmerica, Du Pont, General Motors, Pepsico, Procter & Gamble, Sears and Time Warner.
"The market always gets out of kilter," said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist for Cowen & Company, "but it's self-correcting, eventually." Does that mean that Monday will mean a down market for stocks? "The answer is yes," he said.
The most active stock yesterday was Northwest Airlines Corporation, an initial public offering that began trading yesterday after sharply cutting its offering price. Even though 9.7 million shares changed hands, Northwest's price of $13 closed unchanged from the offering price.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
When Dr. Baruch Goldstein massacred praying Muslims in Hebron, condemnations by religious leaders tumbled out one after another, in language that grew stronger by the hour.
The Jewish authorities were particularly sickened, calling the act a desecration of Judaism. And even before the deadly cycle of violence reached the Brooklyn Bridge, Muslim and Christian leaders had joined the chorus of condemnations and the pleas for religious peace. 
 For many, words issued in isolation were not enough. In New York City, Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders and members of those faiths came together in solemn services, one night at a Manhattan synagogue, the next night at an imposing new mosque on the Upper East Side, the Islamic Cultural Center. During the main Sunday service at the Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue, which is affiliated with the Reformed Church in America, an imam, a rabbi and a minister conducted a three-way discussion about love.
Events that had been scheduled weeks earlier took on a new dimension. A Sufi mosque in lower Manhattan had invited representatives from the New York Board of Rabbis to observe the chants and prostrations of evening prayers and to share the breaking of the dawn-to-dusk Ramadan fast and the meal that follows.
Congeniality reigned as the rabbis sat cross-legged at the low tables and ate kosher dinners that the mosque provided. But the very hospitality of the banquet created its own ghost: sobering thoughts of the cost in lives of Muslim-Jewish estrangement.
Do these interfaith gestures make any difference? At the New York regional office of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the question haunted an early-morning emergency session of Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders who meet regularly for an interfaith "trialogue."
How could they not speak out? But what would one more declaration accomplish? What could well-intentioned phrases avail against bullets spewing from a gun or against the anger that squeezes the trigger?
Two years ago, Patriarch Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church; Archbishop Vinko Puljic of Sarajevo, a Croatian Roman Catholic, and Jakub Efendi Selimoski, a leader of the Balkan Islamic community, met in Zurich under the auspices of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, a New York-based interfaith organization. They condemned the "inhuman practice of ethnic cleansing."
So did Muslim, Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox Christian and Jewish leaders from central Asia, the Caucasus, Turkey and the Balkans when they met last month in Istanbul and denounced atrocities and violence carried out "in the name of God."
These statements -- and there have been scores of others -- always have their diplomatic lapses into vagueness. They never untie all the political knots or root out every hypocrisy. A skeptical press gives them little attention. But greater publicity would not keep them from being ignored in the churches, mosques and synagogues where distrust is bred and hatred is preached.
That people kill for religious reasons may appall believers, but it does not surprise them. It surprises only the irreligious, or at least those who have lost all sense of religion's power.
G. K. Chesterton argued that people should take up arms only for religious reasons; nothing less would do. He meant to set a high standard, not to urge low zealotry. But he was an Edwardian, and in a later age of total warfare, even talk like that seems dangerously frivolous.
Religion is deeply linked with bloodshed. Sacred texts are full of it. Purim, the religious holiday that may have set off Dr. Goldstein's rampage, has long been an innocent mix of children's masquerade and adult revelry, of Halloween and New Year's. But the festival's biblical basis, the Book of Esther, also celebrates a triumph of turnabout, when Jews in Persia were granted a spree of liquidating their enemies -- 75,000 of them, one verse says -- in a single day.
Only the modern mind can comprehend battling for land, lineage, power or gold but be baffled by religious strife. Until a few centuries ago, religion was inextricably bound up with economic and political power. Then, as today, leaders and tribes were driven to arms by greed, fear, dreams of conquest or promises of liberation -- and their gods always accompanied them.
Three centuries ago, when Western society separated life into the sacred and the secular, a major cause was revulsion from religious wars, a revulsion shared both by people who were religious and those who were secular. Since then, some secular people have felt that only the elimination of religion could free humanity of belief's bloody impulses. And some religious people have tried to create a benign blend of major faiths, purged of offensive differences and symbols.
Neither tactic has succeeded. When religion was erased from the list of things people fought about, something else, like nationhood or ideology, took its place.And attempts to devise a kind of religious Esperanto drew only coteries.
The remedy for religion's murderous toxins, it seems, must come from deep within each faith. Every world religion has its own antibodies to cruelty and fanaticism, although whether in the same proportions is an open question. Those antibodies are what interfaith encounters, rather than offering an escape from separate traditions, can discover and nurture.
To many in such encounters, they must seem terribly frail at times like these -- and utterly essential.

HEADLINE: Patagonia Fortunes Fade in Cloud of Volcanic Ash

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN JULIAN, Argentina

 BODY:
The wind whipped dust across Jack MacLean's 50,000-acre sheep ranch, where the fences are falling down, the weeds are a foot tall, and the shearing shed is coated with a thick layer of dust.
"We've hit rock bottom here," said Mr. MacLean, a 68-year-old descendant of Scottish immigrants. "It will be years before this land can recover and be used again." 
 Across the vast arid plains of Patagonia in southern Argentina, a rugged outback of legends and romance once populated by gauchos, visited by Charles Darwin and roamed by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the land and the livelihoods of its people are dying out.
To many in the country's big northern cities, Patagonia is a distant land they do not know. But it has caught the imagination of scientists and writers from around the world, not only for its stark pristine expanses, but also for the remarkable preservation of immigrant cultures not found elsewhere in Latin America.
Patagonia was settled in the 19th century by people from Wales, Scotland and South Africa who prospered from sheep farming and maintained tightly knit ethnic groups. But now they see their heritage and customs disappearing. Afrikaans and old Welsh, for example, once dominant languages in large sections of Patagonia, are seldom spoken today.
The region, roughly the size of Texas with one-tenth the population, seems to be reverting back to what Darwin first saw as "wretched gravel plains." Years of depressed wool prices and the centralization of Argentina's economy around Buenos Aires, the capital, have driven thousands of ranchers from their lands and forced the next generation to abandon its roots and look for jobs elsewhere.
 
Decades of Overgrazing
 Among the failing enterprises here are sprawling sheep ranches established in the 19th century that helped make Argentina one of the world's wealthiest countries. But decades of overgrazing has turned a fragile ecosystem of shrubs and grasslands into a barren plateau reminiscent of the Badlands of South Dakota.
But it is not just sheep regions that are suffering. In Puerto Madryn, in the province of Chubut, the Government-run aluminum smelter is cutting back production and seeking to lay off workers. In 1991, the Government shut down a major steel company in the Rio Negro city of Sierra Grande, leaving an entire city that grew up around the factory almost jobless. And in Comodoro Rivadavia, long prosperous from its oil industry, unemployment has soared as the newly privatized oil concern, Y.P.F., has laid off tens of thousands of workers over the last three years.
"All Patagonia is suffering," said James Gough, a sheep farmer in Esquel. "The only hope we have is to do a little tourism."
 
A Drought and a Volcano
 During the first half of this century, the wool produced in Patagonia was one of the exports that, along with beef from cattle raised in the Pampas to the north, made Argentina's per capita income the seventh-highest in the world. But eight years of depression in the sheep-farming sector has crippled the region. The world price for Patagonia wool has fallen from $1 a pound to under 30 cents, and such prices are expected for at least three more years.
The region has had three successive years of drought, with the San Julian area getting half its normal rainfall.
And in August 1991, the Hudson Volcano in the Chilean Andes some 300 miles to the northwest erupted, spewing vast amounts of volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Winds blew the ash over a triangular area in the Santa Cruz province of Patagonia, covering 25 million acres with fine gray dust and smothering vital pastures. More than one million sheep died over the next two weeks.
Now, almost three years later, much of the ash remains. Mr. MacLean has drifts on his farm up to a foot deep and he still discovers the carcasses of sheep buried beneath it.
"The ash gets into vegetation the sheep eat, and that grinds their teeth down," he said. "So after four years you have sheep with no teeth who cannot survive."
 
'Sheep Farming Was Done For'
 Mr. MacLean lost 2,600 animals, including 2,000 pregnant ewes, worth more than $100,000. After the Hudson Volcano, he locked the door to his farm house and left.
"The volcano only made us face the fact that sheep farming was done for," said Jorge Knoop, who lives in Comandante Luis Piedrabuena, 75 miles southwest of here. "It was a coup de grace for the Patagonian sheep farmer."
In his region, Mr. Knoop says 80 percent of the farms are not operating or have only a minimal number of sheep, and that 400 farms have been shut.
Enrique Ducca, president of the San Julian Rural Association, says the cost of raising sheep is now four times the price they get on the market. He calculates that almost half the land in Santa Cruz is without sheep or with fewer than 1,000 animals.
The troubles are also bringing social changes. Farmers have relatively few other skills, and their children are leaving to look for work in the major cities like Buenos Aires.
"There was no hope for my daughters here so I encouraged them to leave," said Juan Douglas Scott.
 
Selling Off Family Land
 Mr. Scott typifies the social change as well as the loss of large fortunes for those who once were considered among the elite of the country. His Scottish grandparents came to Patagonia from the British Falkland Islands in 1877 and began sheep farming. They became so prosperous that his mother and five aunts were sent to boarding school in Scotland. Mr. Scott attended St. George's, the most prestigious boarding school in Buenos Aires.
Hard times have forced him to sell most of the family's land.
Disaster relief from the central Government after the volcano has been paltry, a maximum of $12,000 per farmer. "What is so unfair is that sheep farmers for decades subsidized Argentina, paying more then 50 percent in taxes," said Mr. Scott. "What they are giving us is an insult."
San Julian, with its ornate banks and warehouses, now mostly shut, has all the markings of a once-flourishing town hit by hard times. Residents say life is boring. Cable television is the main source of entertainment.
Some assert that the natural disaster and the depressed wool industry may enable the land to regenerate after more than a century of sheep grazing.
Even so, ecologists say that that will not address the region's other environmental problems. Coastal oil spills have killed thousands of penguins and ponds filled with sludge from offshore drilling attract migrating geese that become covered with oil and die.
"The trouble is that talk about protecting the environment seems totally secondary," said Graham Harris, head of the Fundacion Patagonia Natural.
For its long-term survival, it seems that much of Patagonia will have to undergo major economic adjustment. But the future Patagonia will most likely be a humble shadow of its former self, with industries such as crate-making and ice production that provincial government officials say can complement the fishing industry.
"I really threw away a large part of my life," said Mr. Scott, who agreed at the urging of his brothers and sister to manage his family's ranch here, instead of pursuing a different career. "It's time I can't get back and now it's difficult to know what to do."

HEADLINE: Yankees Show Little Interest in Old-Style Stadium Renovation

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
New York City's plan to restore Yankee Stadium to the look it enjoyed in the days of Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio appears headed for a formidable roadblock: the Yankees do not seem interested.
George M. Steinbrenner, the principal owner, has not commented since the plan was formally presented by Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson to Yankees officials last month as part of a $270 million package of stadium improvements and other inducements to keep the Yankees in the Bronx after their lease expires in 2002. 
 The money would come from city, state and Federal sources, although it is not yet clear what the breakdown would be. Mr. Steinbrenner also has not scheduled any meetings with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
John Lawn, the team's vice president of operations, said Mr. Steinbrenner focused on other financial and structural aspects of the proposal when he was shown the details of the city's plan.
"The look wasn't Mr. Steinbrenner's focus," Mr. Lawn said. "He didn't say I don't care, but he asked questions about the luxury boxes and parking and other things that get people more easily into the ball park and out."
The city's proposal, which was made late last year amid rising concerns that the Yankees might abandon the Bronx for a site in New Jersey, includes a new parking garage with at least 3,000 spaces, dozens of new luxury boxes, a Metro-North station, improved roadways and a retail arcade outside the stadium.
But the most striking part of the proposal is a $90 million plan to restore the nostalgia to the 71-year-old stadium by re-creating the elegant Gothic roof facade that once ringed the ball park and by bringing some of the monuments back into center field, where they were until the stadium was renovated in 1974 and 1975.
"When they've talked about putting the monuments back on the field, that means center field will have to be 570 feet away," Mr. Lawn said, exaggerating the pre-renovation stadium's distance of 461 feet from home plate to the center-field fence. "That'll depend a lot on how good our right-hand hitters are."
Creating a new facade, which would require installing a new, overhanging roof, "was a nice touch, but the bottom line is getting fans into the seats and then out of the stadium," Mr. Lawn said. "Mr. Steinbrenner liked the luxury suite suggestions, which is what he wanted to address."
But at least one top state official has questioned whether the retro approach would be worth the money. "There are a lot better ways to use $90 million," said Vincent Tese, chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
Mr. Lawn said that whether any plan is adopted, mistrust between the city and Yankees management has to be eliminated. Last year, Mr. Steinbrenner and other club officials complained regularly that the city had not lived up to the terms of the 1992 lease. "His concern is, will the city do what it's promised?" he said. "His pleasure at the proposal was tempered by whether they do what they've proposed. I'd say if this thing goes forward, a lot of things will change."
 
Waiting on Team
 Henry Stern, the Commissioner of the Parks Department, which leases the stadium to the team, said that the next step rested with the Yankees, and that the city's plan would not change until the team reacted.
"Our plan is tentative and presented to show the city's willingness to go forward," Mr. Stern said. "We're not going to spend a lot of money on architectural plans before we know we can proceed."
The urgency to sign Mr. Steinbrenner to a lease extension, so fervent last summer, seems to have faded. The election of Christine Todd Whitman as Governor of New Jersey has taken the wind out of the behind-the-scenes efforts to woo the Yankees across the Hudson River.
Ms. Whitman has already rejected a plan to build an arena in Camden for the Philadelphia 76ers, fearing the potential tax liability. And she has suggested selling off parts of the state's powerful Sports and Exposition Authority.
Michael Francis, the authority's new chairman, said: "We won't actively seek to steal a team from New York. If the city and state can't come to terms with Mr. Steinbrenner, we'd be interested."
With the baseball season to begin April 4, Mr. Lawn and city officials have discussed ways to address the team's concerns about sanitation, parking and police protection. Last year, the city added about 1,000 temporary spaces, doubled the police contingent to about 140 officers and assigned prison work crews to clean up around the ball park.
For opening day, and selected other dates, parking will be permitted at nearby Macombs Dam Park, which has 375 to 400 spots. For most night games, about 1,200 spots will be available at a nearby garage used by court employees, Mr. Stern said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Up Sharply As Traders Grow Nervous

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices of precious metals jumped yesterday after financial markets became unnerved by an unscheduled meeting between President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery jumped $4.60 an ounce, to $387.60, while May silver gained 6 cents, to $5.437. April platinum picked up $3.80, to $402.30 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 News of the meeting fueled speculation that the President was pressing Mr. Greenspan not to raise interest rates, and that the central bank's chief planned such a move to head off inflation. The White House moved quickly to quash such speculation, calling the meeting routine. 
 Still, traders in precious metals were reluctant to go home over the weekend without covering their positions, said James Steel, a metals analyst for Refco Inc. in New York.
"The market wanted to come back a little bit off the recent losses, and when the financial markets got a little spooked it was a reason to buy the gold back," Mr. Steel said.
Some analysts cautioned, however, that inflation appeared too low to sustain the rally. Investors tend to buy metals as a hedge against inflation and at times of unrest abroad.
Currently, analysts say, the main influences on precious metals prices are rising domestic demand as the economy strengthens and supply problems stemming from turmoil in South Africa.
"Over all, there's definitely a firm undertone on all these metals, and they're performing very well," said Ian MacDonald, manager of precious metals trading for Credit Suisse in New York.
On other commodity markets, lumber futures prices tumbled the daily limit for a third consecutive day amid abundant supplies because of weak construction activity. May lumber fell $15, to $401.70 for each 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
In energy futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude oil for April delivery settled 6 cents higher at $14.88 a barrel. April home heating oil also rose, gaining 0.23 cent, to 44.47 cents a gallon. But unleaded gasoline for April fell 0.07 cent, to 45.92 cents a gallon, and April natural gas fell 0.21 cent, to $2.103 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Whittle Set To Quit Book Publishing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Whittle Communications said yesterday that it would close its book publishing operations, which have failed to obtain sufficient advertising commitments for the next fiscal year.
The decision follows the recent closing of its Special Report Network, which involved video programs, magazines, posters and brochures that helped advertisers reach people in medical waiting rooms. 
 Both closings reflect a move by the company to focus on electronic rather than print media.
Whittle's main properties are the Channel One TV news program for schools and a Medical News Network TV service for physicians, to make its debut this fall.
 
Sponsor of the Edison Project
 Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., also sponsors the Edison Project, which is developing for-profit schools. Its goals are to operate at lower costs than public schools while equaling the best of private education. Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the president of the project, said yesterday that Massachusetts had authorized the opening of three schools, in Boston, Worcester and Lowell, in 1995. They will be the first Edison Project schools.
Whittle gained a reputation as an innovator in the late 1980's by developing media that allowed companies to deliver advertising pitches in unusual settings like schools or doctors' offices.
But the company's revenue has stalled at about $200 million in the last two years. Whittle announced in mid-1992 that it would focus on electronic-based media projects.
 
Established Authors
 The company has profitably published books that contain advertising since 1989, and created a business unit called Whittle Books in 1991. The unit, which employs 14 people, published John Kenneth Galbraith's "A Short History of Financial Euphoria" and Richard Rhodes's "Nuclear Renewal." Among the other authors Whittle signed were: William Greider, the political editor of Rolling Stone; George Gilder, a conservative economic theorist, and Michael Lewis, the author of "Liar's Poker."
But William S. Rukeyser Jr., chairman and chief executive of Whittle Books, said the company's noncore operations like the book division must "justify themselves in every fiscal period by booking revenue in advance."
"We don't have signed contracts for next fiscal year, so we will be finishing producing our current books," he said. "We should have them finished by June and barring a sales miracle, we will close."
Whittle will have published 34 books by the time the book unit closes. The books each contain about 20 pages of ads and are sent free to targeted audiences.
 
Federal Express Bows Out
 The Federal Express Corporation, based in Memphis, sponsored the Larger Agenda series of 10 books from 1989 to 1991 for business, political and opinion leaders. The series ended when Federal Express did not renew its sponsorship, saying it had a changed its marketing objectives.
In 1991, Whittle introduced the Grand Rounds Press series for medical professionals, and the 16 books carried advertising from pharmaceutical companies.
The Chief Executive Press will have published eight books for the top executives of the nation's biggest companies. That series was sponsored by the Cessna Aircraft Company, based in Wichita, Kan.
Several Whittle books have sold well when reissued without advertising, Mr. Rukeyser said. He added that the book unit had generated "several million dollars a year" in revenue and was profitable, but he declined to be specific.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains in Expectation That Fed Will Raise Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against other currencies yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates next week.
In late New York trading, it climbed to 1.6960 German marks, from 1.6888 on Thursday. It also rose to 106.16 Japanese yen from 105.78. 
 After gaining in Europe, the dollar jumped in light but volatile American trading on news of an unscheduled meeting between President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Market participants interpreted the meeting as evidence that the President was trying to put pressure on the central bank to discourage it from raising short-term interest rates to restrain inflationary pressures.
The Administration sought to characterize the meeting as routine. But the conclusion in financial markets seemed to be that the Fed, which has historically acted independently of the White House, would have to raise rates to counter the appearance of capitulating to the President.
 
Treasury Yields Jump
 Indeed, Treasury yields jumped yesterday and prices fell as the bond market displayed nervousness about the White House meeting.
"The market read a great deal more into it than was necessary, even though it's a bit unusual," said Bob Lynch, a currency analyst at MMS International. "The President and the Fed chairman don't meet very often."
Currency traders expect the Fed to raise its target for the Federal funds rate, the benchmark for short-term interest rates, a quarter-point, to 3.5 percent, when its policy-making Open Market Committee meets Tuesday, Mr. Lynch said.
Higher rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to foreign investors, pushing up demand for dollars and raising the currency's value.
The bulk of yesterday's trading in the United States was in German mark-dollar exchanges, dealers said. Banks were the day's most active traders.
Market participants largely shrugged off a report by the Bank of Japan that suggested the Japanese economy was still anemic.
"It's not a focus" in currency trading, said Michael Malpede, senior analyst for Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago. "It's a fairly well-known fundamental that the Japanese economy remains weak."
The British pound slipped in New York to $1.4910, from $1.4935 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Off Balance

BYLINE: By Robert Eisner; Robert Eisner is author of "The Misunderstood Economy: What Counts and How to Count It."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Like a villain in a bad horror movie, the balanced budget amendment pops back to life every time it is killed. The proposal was defeated by only 12 votes in the House on Thursday -- just weeks after it was rejected by the Senate -- encouraging its supporters to gear up for another try next year. The amendment is bad economics, but it will keep coming back until we debunk the economic myths perpetuated by the debate.
Foremost, we need to understand what the national debt is and is not. It is not something we owe to other countries; it is a debt of the Government to its own people. Abraham Lincoln had it right in his 1864 annual message to congress: "Held as it is for the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private, property. . . . Men can readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves." 
 Government debt is, in effect, the exact opposite of private debt: The greater a person's debt, the less his net worth; the greater the Government's debt, the greater the people's net worth.
The national debt is not the $4.4 trillion figure so often cited, but is really what the Government calls the "gross Federal debt held by the public," some $3.3 trillion. (This properly excludes over a trillion dollars of accounting entries that the Treasury Department makes for accumulated surpluses in Social Security and other Government trust funds.)
Less than 20 percent of the debt is owed to foreigners, and that percentage has been coming down; it was over 21 percent before the big deficit years of the 1980's. Since the debt is overwhelmingly owed to Americans -- as individuals or through pension funds, businesses, banks, insurance companies and state and local governments -- it does not represent borrowing from the future or a burden on our children. The debt or liabilities of the Government are the assets of the American people, assets that will be bequeathed to our children.
The balanced budget amendment's chief sponsor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, makes little sense when he argues that instead of having "invested in its future, we are the first generation . . . to borrow from its future." We might just as well say that the Government has given the American people $2.4 trillion of interest-earning assets to bolster their purchasing power and that of their children.
There is also no sense to the repeated assertion that the nation is "at the brink of bankruptcy." No sovereign government can be bankrupt as a result of debt in its own currency. The Government's debt consists of paper -- savings bonds and Treasury bills, notes and bonds, promising to pay in dollars. The Government can always get dollars, printing them if necessary -- and that is far from necessary now nor will it be in the foreseeable future. In fact, the only way it could be forced to default on its obligations would be through a constitutional amendment prohibiting it from making additional outlays or borrowing.
The real issues lie elsewhere, and they stem from the fact that the Government's debt is the very liquid assets of the American people. The greater these private assets are, the wealthier Americans will perceive themselves to be, and the more likely they will be to spend. Greater spending, public or private, means increases in sales, profits, orders for production and hiring of workers.
It is true that if an economy is booming and employment is relatively full, with no more resources available to increase production, higher spending will result in inflation. If this happens, the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to fight inflation, thereby reducing investment. But now, with unemployment still close to 7 percent and indications that our brisk recent growth may be slowing, is no time to reduce spending. More spending, not less, will increase investment and consumption as business expands to meet growing demand.
Senator Simon is correct in saying that we are not taking care of ourselves and our future. Crime ravages our cities. Tens of millions of Americans are without health insurance. The environment is deteriorating. Much of a generation is growing up functionally illiterate. We are putting a grave burden on the next generation. But a balanced budget amendment will do nothing to eliminate these real deficits.

Newmont Companies Forge Closer Links in Swap Deal

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Shareholders of the Newmont Gold Company approved a complex stock and asset-shifting plan with the Newmont Mining Corporation yesterday that would in effect create the world's sixth-largest gold producer.
Because each company's common stock will continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the combination of Newmont Gold and Newmont Mining stops short of a full merger. Officials of both companies said such a merger would have resulted in a $400 million charge against future earnings related to the tax implications of the companies' good will. 
 "It looks messy at first blush," said Marc D. Cohen, a gold analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company. "It's really very imaginative."
 
Complicated Arrangement
 As part of the plan approved by 94 percent of Newmont Gold's shareholders in a meeting yesterday in Denver, ownership interests in both companies will remain unchanged. But Newmont Mining will split its shares 5 for 4, effective Monday, and Newmont Gold will issue 2.8 million new convertible preferred shares to Newmont Mining.
The purpose of the stock split and new preferred issue is to make each Newmont Mining share the equivalent of each outstanding share of Newmont Gold. The consequence should be that the share price and earnings per share of each company's common stock will now move in lockstep.
Yesterday, shares of both companies rose $1.25, with Newmont Mining closing at $54.50 and Newmont Gold ending at $45.
Newmont Mining is a holding company whose principal asset is 90 percent ownership of Newmont Gold, which controls the Carlin Trend, near Elko, Nev., one of the biggest gold fields in the world. Newmont Mining also has less-developed gold operations in Peru, Uzbekistan and Indonesia. Newmont Gold, one of 10 Newmont Mining units, was spun off to shareholders in 1986.
The combination will permit Newmont Mining to use the cash flow generated by Newmont Gold's Nevada mine to develop overseas projects, Mr. Cohen said.
 
2 Important Holders
 About 14 percent of Newmont Mining is controlled by George Soros, the head of the Quantum Fund, who bought his stake from the British financier Sir James Goldsmith in April 1993 when gold was hovering at a 10-year low of $326 an ounce. Sir James, a Newmont Mining director, retains a 4.9 percent stake and supported the stock split, a company spokesman said.
In recent weeks, concern about inflation has pushed gold prices and gold-mining stocks higher. Typically, investors turn to gold in times of rising inflation and economic uncertainty.
Yesterday, gold prices surged, with the actively traded April futures contract jumping $4.60, to $387.60 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

HEADLINE: What If Unemployed Actors Worked in Banks?

BYLINE: By Robert Plunket; Robert Plunket's most recent novel is "Love Junkie."

 BODY:

MUNICIPAL BONDAGE
By Henry Alford.
231 pp. New York:
Random House. $18. 
 SOMETIMES I lie in bed at night and think about Fran Lebowitz. What ever happened to her? She used to be so funny. I know she's still around because I saw her picture in People magazine. She was at one of those glamorous parties and she still looks exactly the same, I'm glad to report -- rather like Lord Palmerston toward the end of the Crimean War. But I haven't come across any of her articles lately, just the occasional interview in one of the glossy magazines. What happened? Humor burnout? Did the jokes just stop coming?
Whatever the reasons for Ms. Lebowitz's comparative silence, there can be no doubt that she has left behind an enormous pair of shoes to fill. She was, after all, the reigning New York humorist, and if that isn't a title to make any ordinary humorist drool with envy, I don't know what is. It is so exalted, in fact, and one would be so presumptuous even to aspire to it, that there have been few serious claimants. Several people have tried but have been lacking in that intangible ability to communicate what on earth is so funny about the Manhattan mind-set. Now, however, there is a new guy named Henry Alford, and with the publication of his first book, "Municipal Bondage," he definitely establishes himself as a contender.
I unknowingly stumbled across his work several years ago in a magazine, when I read an article about staying at several Manhattan bed and breakfasts. It was ostensibly a "reader service" article, written to explain the ins and outs of bed and breakfasting, but in reality it was a comic tour de force -- part parody, part performance art and ultimately a highly dense yet entertaining narrative that revealed all sorts of insights into both the young man and his various hosts. It was an article that lingered in my mind over the years, and when I rediscovered it in "Municipal Bondage" (where it was even better than I remembered), I immediately knew that here was a writer I had better pay some serious attention to -- which, in the parlance of the humor business, means he might have some stuff I could steal.
The bed-and-breakfast article illustrates perfectly Mr. Alford's central comedic gimmick: he investigates. He personally undergoes a somewhat unusual experience and then describes it for the reader. Sometimes these experiences seem a bit contrived (as when he signs up, as a single person, at various bridal registries around town), but most of the time they are great fun. He invents and tries to market a new snack food called Nubbins. He has photographs taken and begins to pound the pavement in an attempt to become a male model. He serves as a volunteer driver for the Governor of Colorado during the 1992 Democratic National Convention.
A few are positively inspired. My favorite concerns Mr. Alford's journey to the Frank Borman Room at the Newark Airport Holiday Inn, where he tries to pass the certification exam of the National Dog Groomers Association of America. He has in tow a borrowed cocker spaniel named Clifford, who is unpleasant in the extreme ("imagine Broderick Crawford on all fours"), and things do not go at all well.
MR. ALFORD'S second gimmick is a series of lists describing the defining moments of a "what if" situation: "What if unemployed actors worked in banks instead of restaurants?" ("11:07 A.M. Teller gives customer 10 singles, vocalizing, 'Ten! Tin! Tan! Tawn! Toe! Too!' ") "What if a predominantly gay neighborhood were suddenly overrun with cattle?" ("Drugstore. Holstein buys box of Kleenex in preparation for Tonys broadcast.")
With so much of today's humor bogged down in relationship jokes and tedious "did you ever notice?" observations about daily life, it's a relief to find someone whose beat is a little more sophisticated. Mr. Alford's world is one of restaurants, department stores, and Merchant and Ivory movies. His is a sensibility that reeks of Manhattan. Ego and ambition are what count; the lust is for status rather than sex; the ultimate goal is some sort of vague and distant celebrityhood -- though a job at Macy's will certainly do in the meantime. It is a humor that demands to be savored on the printed page, where Mr. Alford can arrange his sentences just so, with every syllable in place. He is a classicist, firmly in the mold of Wilde, Waugh, Benchley -- and Lebowitz.
Well, I'm sure Ms. Lebowitz has worked herself into a snit after reading this, but if it prompts her to plot a comeback, so much the better. Humor thrives on conflict, feuds, rivalry, revenge -- just think of the expression "getting the last laugh." If there's going to be a battle over Fran Lebowitz's shoes, let's just hope it's a long and bloody one.

HEADLINE: How Do Tobacco Executives Live With Themselves?

BYLINE: By Roger Rosenblatt; Roger Rosenblatt, a contributing writer for this magazine, is the author most recently of "The Man in the Water," a collection of essays and stories.

 BODY:
PEOPLE WHO WONDER how tobacco company executives can live with themselves conclude that they must be in denial. That would explain how they deal with their responsibility for a product that kills more than 420,000 Americans a year -- surpassing the combined deaths from homicide, suicide, AIDS, automobile accidents, alcohol and drug abuse. But to be in denial implies that one may not be held accountable, in psychological terms, for one's actions. Tobacco people squarely face the accusation of accountability, and reject it.
They reject the overwhelming epidemiological evidence in the Surgeon General's Report of 1989, connecting smoking with lung and throat cancers, emphysema and heart disease, insisting that direct causation has not been proved. They dismiss the Federal Drug Administration's suggestion that cigarettes could be banned as an addictive drug, calling smoking merely a habit that has already been broken by tens of millions. They ridicule people who say they are pushing a drug, noting that their product is legal, that the same Government that posts health warnings on cigarette packs subsidizes tobacco farmers and that what they are really promoting is freedom of choice. 
 In other words, if they experience denial as a psychological response, they also use denial as an aggressive tactic. This mirrors the way they live with themselves in general. Individually, they remove themselves from most of the rest of the country and create their own moral universe of explanations and justifications. Collectively, they embrace the country directly, involving as much of America as possible in their enormous success.
My case in point is Philip Morris, the largest tobacco company in America and the largest consumer-products company in the world, owner of Kraft General Foods, Jacobs Suchard and Miller beer and maker of Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette in America and the best-selling packaged product in the world. The connection of the company to the American economy is so deep and secure that if one were to remove Philip Morris without first finding something equally valuable to fill the hole, much of the country would cave in.
The company paid $4.5 billion in taxes in 1992 (on revenues of $59 billion) and billions more in employees' and excise taxes -- making it the largest taxpayer in the country and, outside of government, the largest tax collector. Also in 1992 it contributed $4 billion toward the balance of payments. It directly employs 161,000 people worldwide (92,000 of them in this country), not including those who sell the product or make the paper and the filters or who lobby in Washington or who advertise the product.
Philip Morris is also a mainstay of American farming. In Blackstone, Va., about 50 miles southwest of Richmond, I met with John Bledsoe, a tobacco farmer in his early 30's. Bledsoe believes there is a health risk in smoking, but he has to earn a living. "There's nothing that will ever replace tobacco as a cash crop," he said. "And the farther south you go from here, the more impact tobacco has. The local car store, the clothing store . . . people don't realize. And Philip Morris has always been on our side. They've sent us on trips to places like Canada and Brazil to meet other tobacco farmers. They've helped us to stand up for what they represent."
The company has a presence in 50 states and the District of Columbia. In 1992 it contributed more than $50 million to tax-exempt organizations. A company lawyer wryly remarked that, thanks to the number of lawsuits it generates, Philip Morris also contributes generously to the legal profession. By that logic, one might add that it contributes to the medical and mortician professions as well.
Health care companies benefit from the industry in general and from Philip Morris in particular. Pfizer manufactures flavor enhancers, which are used in cigarettes; Ciba-Geigy makes nicotine skin patches for people seeking to quit smoking, along with fungicides for tobacco growers. Kimberly-Clark is a leading supplier of paper for cigarettes and filters.
Philip Morris contends with Procter & Gamble for the title of the largest advertiser in the world, supporting advertising agencies and the mass media. The introduction of Marlboro Medium in 1991 cost $60 million, the most ever spent by the company on a single new product. The company has not only advertised itself, it has advertised against its attackers. In 1988 it spent $5 million on a campaign to emphasize the economic power of smokers. One newspaper ad read: "Today, 21 million American smokers will go out to eat. That's a market you can sink your teeth into."
Recently, the Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, stated that she would like to see cigarette advertising reduced further, especially that aimed at younger people. In fact, tobacco companies have already cut back on advertising and are pursuing other ways to reach smokers. Philip Morris's Marlboro Adventure Team -- people send in the U.P.C.'s on Marlboro packs to get free outdoor gear and the chance to join an excursion to "Marlboro country" -- has been the most successful promotional campaign in Marlboro's history.
Cigarette advertising has been a mainstay of the magazine business since 1971, when Congress prohibited tobacco advertising on radio and television. This prohibition did not hurt Philip Morris, since Marlboro ads were more effective as still pictures of the Marlboro cowboy (the most widely recognized advertising image in the world), either on billboards or in magazine pages. In 1992 the company spent over $2 billion on media advertising -- of food, beer and tobacco products -- including nearly $18 million in daily newspapers and over $215 million in magazines. Many publishers and editors who welcome cigarette advertising also run health-hazard articles that omit or minimize the dangers of smoking.
The company's connection to journalistic enterprises is widening. Philip Morris has recently made an agreement with the Time magazine group to test a system for sending magazines with tobacco ads only to subscribers who smoke. Philip Morris has also used its own data base to enlist smokers in campaigns against increased cigarette taxes. The company places a great deal of advertising with Time Inc., as it does with The New York Times Company, The Washington Post Company, Hearst Publications and Conde Nast. One member of the Philip Morris board of directors is Rupert Murdoch, owner of such publications as TV Guide, The New York Post and The Times of London.
The composition of the board of directors itself suggests the extent of the company's connections to American business, banking, arts, education, Government, intellectual and health institutions, including hospitals and even cancer research centers. Besides Murdoch, outside members of the board, who are paid about $40,000 a year, include Harold Brown, the former Defense Secretary and a director of I.B.M., Mattel and CBS; William H. Donaldson, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, former dean of the Graduate School of Management at Yale and a director of Aetna Life and Casualty and the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace; Richard D. Parsons, chief executive of the Dime Savings Bank, a director of Time Warner, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a trustee of Howard University; Roger S. Penske, head of the Penske Truck Leasing Company in Detroit and a director of American Express; John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp and a trustee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Rand Corporation and the Russell Sage Foundation and a member of the board of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
The mutually useful relationship between the company and the Government may be illustrated by the Clinton Administration's proposed excise tax on cigarettes. The tax is said to pose a menace to the tobacco industry by pricing the product off the market. Philip Morris and the other companies will, naturally, fight the tax. Yet does it matter if they lose? "You know, I don't really care about the excise tax at all," a company vice president told me. "I wouldn't mind making the Government a little more dependent on the habit."
While the President works to pass his excise tax, others in his White House have had relationships with the company that might affect their enthusiasm. When he was a lawyer in California, Mickey Kantor, the Administration's trade representative, assisted restaurant owners who were fighting anti-smoking ordinances. His law firm also represented Philip Morris. Such relationships with the White House are common. After he left the Reagan Administration, Michael Deaver represented Philip Morris in its efforts to penetrate the rich South Korean market. After he left the Bush Administration, Craig L. Fuller joined the company as senior vice president for corporate affairs.
Encouraged by Michael A. Miles, the corporate chief executive officer, Fuller helped the Clinton Administration promote the North American Free Trade Agreement. Free trade is in the company's interests, but "this is because we care about the issue," Fuller says. "Mike is willing to give time to public policies that matter." A corporate senior vice president, Murray H. Bring, a former partner in the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter, alludes to the White House connection when he says, only half-jokingly: "To ban a product that is used so widely by so many people doesn't make any sense . . . certainly not from a political point of view. There are more smokers in the United States than there are people who voted for Clinton."
In 1991-92 (the most recent figures available) the tobacco industry contributed $2.39 million to Congress, including PAC money and donations from executives. Of that, Philip Morris gave about one-quarter, or $640,000. Connections to individuals include Representatives like Charlie Rose, Democrat of North Carolina, known as Mr. Tobacco, and Scotty Baesler, Democrat of Kentucky, who represent tobacco-growing states, and Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat whose campaigns and communities have benefited from Philip Morris donations. Rangel has been under fire for his opposition to the excise tax, especially since he has crusaded against drugs and because blacks have been found to suffer from smoking-related diseases at a higher rate than other groups.
I visited Rangel, who seems to be in something of a turmoil about the smoking issue. Before I could get out a question, he exploded that his opposition to the excise tax was perfectly consistent with his opposition to all regressive taxes. Then he complained that poor people in his Harlem community would suffer nervous breakdowns because they would not be able to afford cigarettes. Finally he said that he was likely to change his mind on the tax to help pass the Clinton health package.
Philip Morris's involvement with social projects and the arts ranges from donations to a variety of organizations and communities to efforts toward minority employment and civil liberties within the company. Under the former leadership of Joseph F. Cullman 3d and George Weissman, Philip Morris became the first tobacco company to hire blacks in high positions. For that the company was boycotted in the South. The white supremacist publication White Sentinel wrote that Philip Morris had the "worst race mixing record" of any large company in the nation. The company was among the first to advertise in black and Hispanic newspapers and magazines. It has been vigorous in its employment of women.
Philip Morris makes large and frequent contributions to the National Urban League, the N.A.A.C.P., the United Negro College Fund, Goodwill Industries, the National Puerto Rican Forum, the Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, United Way, Y.M.C.A., hospitals all over America, the Legal Aid Society, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Salk Institute, the National Association on Drug Abuse. In 1990-91 it sponsored a 200th anniversary national tour of the original document of the Bill of Rights.
The company has supported teacher education and adult literacy, backed reform in elementary and secondary schools and helped minority students go to college. In 1993 it donated more than $1.3 million to hunger relief organizations and over $1 million to AIDS. When I asked Stephanie French, vice president for corporate contributions and cultural affairs, whether any of the gift recipients ever expressed reservations or unhappiness about taking tobacco money, she pointed out that grantees apply to the company, not the other way around.
As for the arts, Philip Morris is not only the largest tobacco company contributor but one of the largest corporate contributors of any kind. Nor does it give its money only to the "safer" arts projects; it has long supported the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and as early as 1965 it supported the well-received exhibition of "Pop and Op" art. A report on 35 years of its arts contributions runs to 130 pages and lists grants to the Joffrey Ballet, Morgan Library, Jewish Museum, the Guggenheim, the Yaddo artists' colony, the Whitney (a branch of which is located in its corporate headquarters building in New York), the American Museum of Natural History and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
George Weissman, the chief executive after Joe Cullman and before Hamish Maxwell, has been chairman of Lincoln Center since 1986. French serves on the board of the Joffrey. William Campbell, president of Philip Morris U.S.A., the domestic tobacco company, is a member of the board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the MacDowell Colony.
Perhaps the company's single most-publicized arts donation was a $3 million-plus grant for the Vatican art treasures exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1983. When Terence Cardinal Cooke, then the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, offered a benediction at a banquet celebrating the exhibition, Frank Saunders, a Philip Morris vice president, remarked: "We are probably the only cigarette company on this earth to be blessed by a Cardinal."
The company enjoys its association with art and artists on philosophical as well as esthetic grounds. French believes that art fosters creative risk-taking within the company. Philip Morris may also like to relate the independent thinking of artists with its promotion of freedom of choice for smokers. The freedom to choose to smoke is the company's main philosophical, and legal, position, one which it links to other American freedoms. Usually, however, it does not advertise this linkage. In a pamphlet available to the public, the company announces: "We seek to lift the human spirit." In a set of in-house guidelines, it sounds more pragmatic: "We believe that business activities must make social sense, and social activities must make business sense. . . . Alexis de Tocqueville gave a name to this concept . . . 'the principle of self-interest rightly understood.' "
Every time one raises a spoonful of Jell-O or Post Raisin Bran or Breyers ice cream or pours Log Cabin maple syrup or squirts Miracle Whip or spreads Parkay Margarine or Philadelphia Cream Cheese or Cheez Whiz or takes a bite of an Oscar Mayer weiner or an Entenmann's cookie or a Toblerone chocolate or sips Maxwell House coffee or Kool-Aid or Miller Beer -- whether or not one also lights up a Marlboro, Benson & Hedges, Parliament, Merit, Alpine, Chesterfield or a Virginia Slims -- he or she is proving the principle of self-interest rightly understood.
ALL OF PHILIP MORRIS'S CONNECTIONS TO THE country have produced, and are sustained by, a corporate culture that gives company executives immense, if guarded, self-confidence and helps them do battle with opponents. The culture is nurtured in their New York City corporate headquarters, a tall gray stone-and-steel building largely unnoticeable where it stands on Park Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets because that is where the Grand Central Terminal auto ramp dominates the avenue. After the World Trade Center bombing, many New York office buildings had to make protective structural alterations; this had already been done at Philip Morris.
The building is clean, quiet and decorated in the not-tasteless taste of most office buildings -- grays, off-whites and tans; egg-box light fixtures; plants in the offices, fabric on the walls. Large works of contemporary art are on display. Except for the blown-up photos of cigarette brands and omnipresent ashtrays, 120 Park might be taken for any prosperous business tower. Well-dressed women and men in shirt sleeves make self-conscious chatter on the elevators and small, quick jokes in the halls, which are not smoke-filled.
Not long ago I visited the Philip Morris headquarters on several occasions and spoke with upper-level executives. Leery of journalists, they were nonetheless forthcoming in describing what they do and how they feel about it, though, to be sure, they are shrewd and, in terms of legal jeopardy, know what they can and cannot say. All of them are intelligent and companionable; most are family-oriented and community-minded. All feel beleaguered by portions of society (one vice president complained of being accosted at a cocktail party in his hometown by someone calling him a "mass murderer") and by the news media and the "antis," whom they alternately call "Nazis" or "smoking police." All are well paid, but not much more than executives at other large companies. Every one of them expresses enormous affection and respect for the company.
Steven C. Parrish, who turns 44 in April, grew up in Moberly, Mo., a town of 13,000 once known as the home of Banquet Foods TV dinners. His father was a railroad cop; his great-uncle a lawyer involved in state Democratic politics. Originally, Parrish thought he would go into politics himself. But after graduating from the University of Missouri, where he made Phi Beta Kappa, and from the University of Missouri Law School, where he was an editor of the law review, he joined the Kansas City law firm of Shook, Hardy & Bacon. Five years later, he was made a partner. He represented Philip Morris and Lorillard in the noted Cipollone case, in which the Liggett Group, Philip Morris and other companies were sued for contributing to the death by lung cancer of Rose Cipollone, who had smoked from an early age. An initial judgment of $400,000 against Liggett was eventually overturned and the case was never retried.
Parrish, who smokes, is a small, neat, compact man, young in manner and appearance in spite of graying hair. In a blue shirt with a white collar, he looks slightly overfashionable. His voice rises and falls like a boy's in the process of changing. Everything about him suggests that he had to struggle his way through the likable country boy demeanor to assert ability, sophistication and authority. He is general counsel and senior vice president for external affairs, Philip Morris U.S.A. He and his wife live in Westport, Conn., with their daughter, 11, and son, almost 4:
"The Cipollone trial took several months. As soon as it was over, I took a sabbatical, and when I came back, Philip Morris approached me about working for them exclusively. I took the job because I liked being a trial lawyer. I enjoy the ego rush you get when you're up and performing in court. And there's something about being an in-house lawyer that had always intrigued me. Philip Morris is a great company in terms of its business success, its reputation and all that sort of thing. The people really impressed me. And I really like representing the tobacco workers, who run the machinery and make the cigarettes. Really good people -- the kind I thought I'd represent when I was growing up. I also had always wanted to live on the East Coast. My friends in Kansas City think I'm nuts.
"I didn't have any qualms about joining a tobacco company, partly because I had dealt with the issue already in the Cipollone case. We got nasty letters and a lot of confrontational things. My biggest qualm was: 'Gee, I have a very successful practice here in the Midwest. My wife is from the Midwest. I've always been very happy here. You never know. I may go to Philip Morris and they might think I'm terrible and then what am I gonna do.' That's what I thought. But I didn't have other qualms. I'd worked it out.
"And I certainly didn't divide my job and my feelings in the Cipollone case. I didn't attempt to keep myself from feeling bad for Mrs. Cipollone, who was a really neat lady. I met her a couple of times before she died. She was sort of spunky, you know. And Mr. Cipollone was a very nice man. So I didn't try not to feel bad for Antonio Cipollone, because No. 1, I didn't think I could do it, and No. 2, what would that say about me? But I really did feel strongly that he was not entitled to get money because his wife chose to smoke. I mean, she was very clear about that. That she liked it. How it made her feel glamorous. That she enjoyed the taste of it. And never made a serious attempt to quit until she was told she had a problem. So when I met Mr. Cipollone, when he told about how his wife died, it was a very moving thing. It was a terrible thing. But she chose to smoke.
"But I wouldn't be honest with you if I didn't tell you that when I see Sam Donaldson, for example, on 'This Week With David Brinkley,' as he did a few months ago, say 'I don't see how an executive with a tobacco company can look himself in the mirror in the morning.' . . . It troubles me. The day that happened I was sitting on a couch with my wife and my kids. We'd just gotten home from church. I love that show, so as soon as we get home I flip it on, and there's Sam Donaldson saying that. And it was upsetting.
"Obviously, one way to deal with that is to say: 'O.K., I'm not going to work for a cigarette company. Then they wouldn't be saying those things about me.' But I feel good about what I do, both in how I go about my job and what my role in the company is, so I try not to let it bother me. But anybody would feel hurt if somebody says you are a merchant of death and you shouldn't be able to look yourself in the mirror in the morning. I wish they wouldn't say things like that.
"During the trial, I got to be pretty good friends with the plaintiff's lawyer. We used to get together every once in a while after the case was over, and he told me once . . . he and I were screaming at each other in front of the judge about something and he was calling me every name in the book and the company every name in the book and then I got up to do my response. And as he walked by, he said: 'You take this too seriously. You take this too personally.' And he was right.
"My philosophy about everyday life is that you really have to constantly re-examine everything. Your convictions, I mean, your religious beliefs or whatever. And if you don't, you're not doing the right thing. And I ask myself the question: 'Are you one of these people that just says, I make a nice salary. I have a job. There are a lot of people that don't have jobs at all. And so have you rationalized your way into saying, yeah, this is what I ought to be doing?' I ask myself that a lot, along with a lot of other questions that don't have anything to do with Philip Morris. And I don't think I do. I don't think I do.
"A year or two ago, my daughter came home from school, and said: 'I have a homework assignment I need you to help me with. Tomorrow we're going to talk about drugs like marijuana, cocaine and alcohol. We're also going to talk about cigarettes and whether they're addictive. I want to know what you think about cigarettes.' And I told her that a lot of people believe that cigarette smoking is addictive but I don't believe it. And I told her the Surgeon General says some 40 million people have quit smoking on their own. But if she asked me about the health consequences, I would tell her that I certainly don't think it's safe to smoke. It's a risk factor for lung cancer. For heart disease. But it's a choice. We're confronted with choices all the time. Still, I'd have to tell her that it might be a bad idea. I don't know. But it might be.
"Is the affection that people have for one another in this company based partly on the fact that we're all in the bunker together? I don't think so, and I'll tell you why. The atmosphere here is not really different than it was at my law firm in Kansas City. There is stress, there's pressure . . . but that was true there as well. I notice more people locking arms and getting together behind a business strategy than I see worrying about the externalities of charges about tobacco and health and things like that.
"But that other lawyer was right about me. I do take things personally. My wife constantly tells me: 'You worry too much about what other people think. You're doing fine.' So, while in some ways the worst thing about me is that I take things personally, part of the reason that I think I do a good job or see things through is also because I take things personally. And I say to myself: 'If I could just sit down with Sam Donaldson, he's not going to change his attitudes about smoking, but doggone, he'd probably realize that this guy's not a bad guy. He's got two little kids. He worries about all the issues that a parent worries about with their kinds -- drugs, AIDS, violence, all that stuff.'
"You might say that we ought to do everything we can do reasonably to make sure that nobody ever smokes another cigarette. But you wouldn't say that people who work for tobacco companies can't look at themselves in the mirror because they're somehow lesser human beings than people who work for a drug company or a steel company."
DAVID E. R. DANGOOR, 44, WAS appointed executive vice president for Philip Morris International in 1992. He has spent virtually his entire working life with Philip Morris, having served the company in Switzerland, Germany, England and Canada. Reared and educated in Sweden, he has the easy, gracious manner and unidentifiable accent of the fictional character known as "the Continental" -- wire-rimmed glasses, iron-gray hair combed straight back, a blue-and-red striped tie over a blue-and-white striped shirt and a gray double-breasted suit with a white handkerchief peeking up from the jacket pocket. Slightly jowly and soft-looking, he nonetheless has one of those faces that says, "I will beat you with sheer brainpower, and I will do it so deftly and politely that you will love every minute of it."
He was married for the first time almost two years ago, and he and his wife expect their first child imminently. They live in the city. Dangoor, a smoker, oversees worldwide marketing, finance, strategic planning and personnel:
"It's so different working in international from Philip Morris U.S.A. In the United States, you have a company that's under siege. Everybody's watching every move you're making. In the international division, it's the opposite. We are growing gangbusters, and as much as people are writing about how we are corrupting the world, in truth we only have 12.5 percent of the world market of cigarettes. So what you have, in the international division, is a company and a group of people who are entrepreneurs, and who are really focused on growing the business, rather than defending the business. In a way, international is much more like the old Philip Morris.
"Do you know that story? I'm surprised that business magazines don't look at the genius of the origins of Philip Morris. The reason we're the powerhouse we are is because of a couple of guys in the 50's and 60's. They rolled the dice four times and always came up double sixes. The Cullmans. With the Cullman family coming in, the Jewish mind entered the tobacco industry, which had been traditionally, 'clinically' free of Jewish executives and Jewish interests. I should tell you that I am Jewish myself -- a Jewish Swede.
"The industry, till then, was run by Southern Protestants. What happened was that Jewish executives took over. I don't want to name all the executives, because, you know, some Jews don't like to be remembered as Jews and others do. So I'm not going to get into trouble here. But there were five extremely senior executives who would sit down at meals in the 1950's and remind themselves that there were six competitors in the market and they were ranked No. 8. That's how they would begin every meeting.
"So they decided to look at their brand portfolio and reposition their brands and stock. And the brand they started with was Marlboro. And you know the rest. They made a macho campaign for men out of a woman's cigarette. The point is, the whole attitude of the company changed. These guys never agreed on anything and they would argue about everything, and they would kill each other and involve everyone high and low, talented people. But when they had to make a decision, the decision would emerge. This made Philip Morris.
"Joe Cullman really did it. And more. He also created this incredible family feeling, by taking a personal interest in everybody. He would go to weddings and christenings or whatever, and he was one of the first to decide to implement a profit-sharing system in the company. Joe has never got the recognition he's deserved, but he's in his 80's today. I'm sure God's rewarding him because he's blessed with health. If you got to know all the people in that group, you would find each one of them -- they are still alive -- remarkable. All Democrats, all a little bit socialistic. And you ask: 'How could these people all be in the cigarette business?' If you knew them, you would understand that there must be much more to the issue than what comes to mind.
"Imagine me, growing up in Sweden in 1976, extremely frustrated by a country where socialism was really going too far, where equality was everything but equality meaning everything should be average, rather than quality at a high end. And then I got an opportunity to get interviewed by Philip Morris, in Switzerland. I had no interest in working for them. I had an antipathy toward smoking. I must tell you, I met five executives and after that I walked out and the only thing on my mind was how am I going to land a job in this company. I had met people that spoke to me about the business, life, family, in a way that I had never been exposed to in school. I realized that I wasn't talking to a rigid company, where everybody had to toe the party line. It was a company were one could remain an individualist.
"I don't believe I would do anything that would benefit me if I thought at the same time that I was cheating society, that I was lying to society, that I was doing something truly immoral. Everybody knows that smoking must be a terrible idea. I mean, it's not a secret. In actual fact, we live in a perfect world. We are allowed to conduct our business, and the press and the antis are allowed to rip us apart and kill us. The debate is in the forefront. And this is a shocking statement to make, but I'm sure that people think smoking is even more dangerous than it ever could be. Yet they do it. Why? Is it an addiction issue? I don't believe it. People do all sorts of things to express their individuality and to protest against society. And smoking is one of them, and not the worst.
"When you are in the business, and when you're confronted with all the issues, I promise you, you come out of it saying, 'I don't feel that bad about doing this.'
"Is this denial? My wife says I'm a specialist in denial, and so does my doctor. Let me try to answer you in the following way. If people are staying with the company because of denial, they must be incredibly resilient. I had a tremendous amount of job offers; a lot of our people did. I could have gone into the cereal business, the cosmetics business. I must tell you, the people you have around you every day, and the kind of environment that you live in every day, become an incredibly important part of the quality of your life. The issues that you refer to become less important, not because you deny the problems but because as a whole it's not the question of making more money. It's the question of being very happy at doing what you're doing.
"You know, actually, it sounds crude and simplistic, but ultimately it's not up to the tobacco industry to deal with the cigarette issue. The final solution to the cigarette issue, that's up to society. If they want to ban cigarettes, you know, we live in a democracy, it should be done in a democratic way and discussed how the hell to deal with the economic consequences, and that's not meant as a threat. It's just a fact.
"I'll tell you what I like about the business. First, there are no surprises. There is nothing more to be said or discovered about the cigarette business or the industry. And there's no way to write an article that could do us any more harm than what has already been written. Second, no new company wants to get into the tobacco business. That's great. Third, we have the best partners in the world: the governments. In a lot of countries, it's incredibly important to the whole welfare state that we sell our products to collect taxes. When you sit with a finance minister or deputy of any government to discuss taxation, he's much cruder about the financial analysis of that taxing than we are. He asks, 'How much can I put up the tax, to make sure that the demand is not going to go down so much so that my net intake goes down?' Amazing. So no matter how you look at the cigarette business, it's incredibly predictable, it's extremely secure as an investment vehicle and, therefore, it's a great business to be in -- if you can deal with the fact that some people are not going to like you."
AS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR Corporate affairs, Craig L. Fuller, 43, helps to shape and superintend the company's definition and image. Fuller came to the company in January 1992, after having served as assistant for Cabinet affairs for President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1985, chief of staff for then-Vice President George Bush from 1985 to 1988 and chief executive of Hill & Knowlton U.S.A., the public relations firm. He has spent most of his career moving between public relations and politics. His first full-time job was as manager of public affairs for the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company; his second, with Michael Deaver's firm, Deaver & Hannaford. He grew up in the late 1960's in Walnut Creek, Calif., and went to U.C.L.A.
Fuller and his wife, Karen, still keep their house in Virginia from their Washington days. He is about six feet tall, has a large belly, an open merry face and is slightly bucktoothed. His dark brown hair is slick and neatly cut, like a teen-ager's of the 1950's.
"My wife, Karen, has -- had -- more concerns about joining a tobacco company than I did. I smoke cigars. She's a nonsmoker. But Mike Miles [the corporate chief executive] was the first to tell me, 'Think it through.' I was very interested in understanding what the company's point of view was. I was impressed with programs that existed before I came here, about 'accommodation.' We think smokers and nonsmokers alike have rights. And that they ought to be accommodated. So I was concerned to take time to understand what the company's point of view was, and it was consistent with my own. I think that it's important to have a match with respect to some basic values.
"The link between working for George Bush and working for Philip Morris is that not only must you believe, you have to make the others believe in themselves. My job with Bush was telling him, in effect, 'This is who you are and this is what you believe.' I've always thought of myself as a good listener and a good communicator between and among groups. I'd like to have people better understand what we're about. I don't know if I ever said to myself, 'What I really want to go do is represent people who might not be able to represent themselves as well,' but I sort of have done it.
"My corporate job is a little different -- and I'm not sliding away from the tobacco issue. But my job is to help the company work through how you can have a great deal of pride and respect, and care a lot, and nurture a very, very successful tobacco business, while recognizing that you are a global leader in the food business. If you analyze constituencies or audiences, you find out that the general public, the media, opinion leaders, business leaders, investors really don't understand this company very well. And regardless of how they feel about tobacco, I'd like them to judge us for what we actually are -- a company of some of the world's best brands. Among our strongest brands is Marlboro; that, I think, is going to be the case for a long time to come. It gives us a chance to do a lot of other things and it gives us a strength that other companies don't enjoy. It gives us cash flow, a financial base to invest in food businesses and expand the beer businesses. And so I'm for a strong tobacco identity.
"People under attack here sometimes say, 'Why don't we change our name to Kraft?' I think that would be wrong, because that would be stepping away from the world's largest tobacco company and a business that succeeds because people know that folks on this floor, and shareholders and others, have a great deal of respect for what it is is that they do. And they are a wonderful group of people. Again, I have to help people figure out who they are.
"You know, there's been a deep reluctance here about talking to the press. We almost never do it. I say we should. My thinking is: If there's one more negative story, so what? I mean, if we can't describe what we think and feel and how we go about our business and we're not willing to share some of the challenges and some of the human dimensions to it and the pride, well what are we doing? Once you know what you're doing, you've got to believe in it.
"When I first came here, Fortune magazine did a story on us, and it's funny because, at the time, people thought it was a terrible story. I told them, I think it's a terrific story. If you open the magazine, you see a big full page picture of Mike Miles. He looks terrific, like Clint Eastwood. Next to it is this bar chart that shows our cash flow. Just looking at it, within 10 seconds, you know that our cash flow is greater than the next 10 companies combined. I said, I'll take it. We now use that article to recruit people."
ELLEN MERLO, A self-described social smoker, has worked for Philip Morris for 25 years. Born in 1940 in the Bronx, she grew up in West New York, N.J., a town on the Palisades cliffs that overlooks the Hudson. Her parents were in the embroidery business. "I hated New Jersey and I hated West New York," she says matter-of-factly. "I used to look at Manhattan across the river and say to myself, 'I'm a New Yorker.' " After high school, she spent two years studying at Katharine Gibbs, then found employment first with Young & Rubicam, then at Revlon, Ziff Davis and Petersen Publishing. Starting out as a secretary at Young & Rubicam, she rose at Petersen to be managing editor of Motor Trend magazine, though she had little interest in cars.
Joining Philip Morris in Canada in 1969, she later transferred to New York where she was brand manager successively for Parliament, Virginia Slims and Benson & Hedges. She moved up further in various executive marketing positions and today is vice president for corporate affairs for Philip Morris U.S.A. Her work focuses on government relations and supervising lobbying interests.
Merlo dresses business-stylishly, has dark brown hair and dark brown eyes and carries herself with the self-assurance of someone who has worked long and hard to get where she is. She is steadfastly loyal to her colleagues, though she speaks wistfully of the days when Joe Cullman wheeled a wagon of Champagne around what were then the four floors of the corporate building at Christmas and everyone knew most everyone else. "Now we have a Christmas party for 2,000 people at the Metropolitan Museum." A lifelong liberal Democrat, her fondest memory is of shaking hands with Eleanor Roosevelt. She lives in the heart of Manhattan:
"Dealing with government, state or national, the first thing you have to think about is what are the company objectives, overall. Secondly, what legislation is out there that is either positive or negative for the company. Then you put a strategy together to deal with various legislators or issues.
"The way you win the most battles is to have information. Contrary to what people think, it's not having influence. Yes, it's knowing who the legislators are and having a good relationship and having access. But once you have access, you have to be able to deliver a message that makes sense. If it's a tax that we're against, then we have to be able to prove that there are going to be job losses, that it's not going to produce the revenue that is being projected, that if a state raises its taxes so high and it's next to another state that has low taxes, there are going to be cross-border sales and those sales will not only be a loss in tobacco revenue, but once someone goes over a border to buy their tobacco or their liquor or something else, they're probably making a lot of other purchases.
"You ask, 'What if Rangel changes his position and supports on the excise tax?' If he does change his mind, we will show him the facts and figures -- that an excise tax will not produce the revenue. Philip Morris supports health care reform. I don't know anybody who's against health care reform. But it's a matter of how extensive it is, how quickly it's implemented and how it's paid for. What we're saying is that an excise tax is an unreliable way of paying for health care. No. 1, it will not produce the revenue to pay for the plan, so there's going to have to be other taxation, and No. 2, it's going to play economic havoc, because it probably will cost the country 275,000 jobs. So we will talk to Charlie Rangel, not to dissuade him from supporting health care reform but to get him and others to think about alternative ways of funding and reducing costs.
"We really don't care how people feel about smoking; we're not asking anyone to endorse our product. It's not a smoking issue. We say: 'This is what an excise tax will do to this city, state, to people in your district. This is what a smoking ban will do to restaurants, the impact it'll have on revenue.' It's not about the tobacco.
"Of course, the economic and the smoking issue are related. I'll tell you an interesting story about a Philip Morris employee. This was in California. He was taking a group of business associates to a restaurant, and when they got there -- there were six or seven of them -- he said we'd like a table in the smoking section. They said, 'Sorry, but this is a no-smoking restaurant. We don't allow smoking anywhere in the restaurant.'
"He turned to his guests and said: 'I'd just as soon not stay here. Do you mind if we go to another restaurant?' After all, it was Philip Morris money. So his guests said no problem, and they went down the block and they had a lovely time and he paid the bill, which was about $500 for everybody. And he got a copy of the bill and sent it to the first restaurant with a note: 'Just thought you should know. Here is the receipt of the funds that I spent that night, that could have gone to you. Multiply it by all of the other people who might want to come in and have a cigarette.'
"Two days later, he gets a phone call -- and he never put his phone number in the letter. 'We just want you to know that we received your letter and we thought about it, and we decided that we are going to employ an accommodation in our restaurant from now on, so we hope that the next time you go out to dinner, you and your smoking friends will think about us again.' "
WILLIAM I. CAMPBELL WAS born in Regina, Saskatchewan, and grew up in the oil boom town of Edmonton, Alberta. His father's family goes back several generations in Canada; his mother came over from Scotland. Campbell's grandfather had been a small-town grocer but got wiped out in the Depression. Neither of his parents went to college. They invested their hopes in their one son -- they also had two older daughters -- and were pleased when he studied economics at the University of Alberta and considered pursuing a Ph.D., with the idea of becoming a college professor.
But a mentor saw in Campbell a flair for business, and Campbell felt that was right. He had, he says, an ability to "see through the data." He went east to get an M.B.A. from the University of Western Ontario ("that was my rebellion"). He went directly to work for Philip Morris, first in the marketing division of Benson & Hedges, Canada, then in a number of increasingly higher marketing and sales positions. In September 1990 he was appointed president and chief executive officer of Philip Morris U.S.A., placing him in charge of everything in the tobacco company.

inauguration. Like Steve Parrish, Campbell is thin, smallish and young-looking. He turns 50 in May. He has sharp blue eyes, wavy silver hair and a face that looks both rugged and malleable. He has a ready, explosive laugh and he frequently talks with his hands. Campbell is divorced. His two young daughters live with their mother:
"You know, even today I go out with the sales reps. There are things that you can learn at that level of contact that you just can't learn any other way. You can't read it off the computer or in the reports. Especially at the early stages of a launch. Sales reps are a continuous source of real, hands-on information. And of how you're really being perceived. They react a lot like consumers. So you can get a sense of where you are, what kind of adjustments you should make and so on.
"So I still go out with the sales force. Because any good leader has to be able to see the data as something else. If the skills are purely objective, at some point they'll tend to falter. And if the skills are purely subjective, where they'll falter typically is in the people area. The principal responsibilities are people-related. In a decision like Marlboro Friday, you have a tremendous obligation to your employees, your customers, your shareholders. [On April 2, 1993, called "Marlboro Friday," Philip Morris rattled the stock market when it cut the retail price of a pack of Marlboros by 40 cents to compete with the cheaper generic cigarettes, which had cut its market share to 22 percent. The move cost the company an instant $2 billion, but now, not a year later, the stock is up and the market share, at almost 27 percent, is at its highest point ever.]
"You know, you just can't take the responsibility lightly. And people did feel good about that. And particularly my ex-boss, Hamish Maxwell. Early in my career, I was describing to Hamish my new plan for the Canadian sales organization. And I was going on blah-blah-blah. And I said, 'You know, the morale will be much better,' et cetera, et cetera. And he said: 'Bill, you go ahead with that. I'm sure you're right. But all in all, through the years, I've found that there's nothing better for morale than a sales curve going up.'
"I'm a smoker. Not a heavy smoker. I like it. Smoking slows me down, gives me a pause. I'm very active and I tend to sometimes jump. A cigarette will sort of slow me down to that level of not jumping around quite so much. My girls ask why I smoke. And I can only answer that I enjoy it, and I think I'm informed about it. And I tell them, 'You'll be facing decisions like this one, when you're an adult.' It requires thought. I think that people do have to take a step back and say, 'Isn't individual freedom and individual choice an important characteristic of our society?' And that's more philosophical than 'Don't.'
"But the attacks on the company are hard on the people. I feel deeply for our sales people across the country. They go into some very hostile environments, and because they're sales people, without any escape, they basically have to take what's given to them. And, you know, some people can be downright rude if they think that right is on their side. And we always have to try to be as well-mannered as we can be, because it only makes us look bad when we're not. And yet nobody in this company I know, including the time that I've been president, and before, has ever come and said: 'I don't believe this any more. I want out.' Never. In 27 years. That's a lot of people we're talking about. All over the world.
"This company is a town, and a city, a large town. It has shared values. It's a centrist town, but it's surprisingly liberal. If you added the town up, you would still statistically be on the right side of center, but the liberal attitude is significant. It's not sophisticated enough to be real Northeast. And it's not Southern, like its roots. But it's an interesting combination of South and North and probably more East than West. It's not New York, although there are some very New York elements about it. Cultural stuff and so forth. Something different. It's an American town. Yeah. An American town."
IF I HAD ASKED ANY OF THE Philip Morris executives directly, "How do you live with yourself?" each would have taken the question personally. None of these executives think of themselves as morally bankrupt, and I do not think of them individually in that way, either. What often happens to people who work for a large, immensely successful company, however, is that they tend to adopt the values of the company, regardless of its product. Loyalty supersedes objectivity.
How good, smart, decent individuals manage to contribute to a wicked enterprise is a question that has been applied to murderous governments as well as to industries. The best answer, which isn't particularly satisfying, is that people in groups behave differently, and usually worse, than they do singly. In speaking with these Philip Morris executives, I felt the presence of the company within the person. In the end, I felt that I was speaking with more company than person, or perhaps to a person who could no longer distinguish between the two. In this situation, in which the company has effectively absorbed its employees in its moral universe, the more responsible employees are the company and thus are to blame.
What the company feels, then, is what its people feel. And these days Philip Morris is on top of the world. Like all tobacco companies, it operates under monopoly conditions, raising and lowering prices at will and using billions in monopoly profits to buy up other businesses. While functioning as a monopoly, it cannot be touched by the Government because, as Dangoor said, other companies could get in the business if they wanted to, but, given the risk of liability, they don't.
Also, recent polls suggest that more young people -- women and teen-agers especially -- are smoking cigarettes these days. The number of blacks who smoke is on the rise. Articles are beginning to appear on the pure pleasure of smoking -- how a cigarette eases tension, aids thought, delineates the best moments of a day. Several executives mentioned the idea of "pleasure revenge" -- a term coined by Faith Popcorn, a specialist in identifying pop business trends. They relate an upsurge in smoking to a rebellion against what they perceive as the country's neo-puritanical attitude toward health. Several executives see in such cultural phenomena as the return of cigarette smoking in movies the signs of such a revival.
The company takes the position that it does not seek to make smokers of nonsmokers. But when I asked Bill Campbell and Ellen Merlo, "Why not?" -- that is, if they believe in free choice, why shouldn't nonsmokers be free to choose and why shouldn't the company, like any other, seek new customers? -- they responded simply that it is not industry policy. In a climate where smoking appears to be growing more attractive, that may change. But, as many of them point out, even if the total domestic market shrinks to nothing, there is still the rest of the world.
The company plant in Cabarrus County, N.C., is undergoing a $400 million expansion to increase production by 25 percent. The 1.6-million- square-foot plant in Richmond, which I visited, houses a network of tubes, pipes and rollers, resembling a vast model train exhibit, which is being geared up to produce between 580 million and 600 million cigarettes a day.
In short, the company is feeling as robust and secure as it ever has. It continues to face attacks, like a recent $5 billion lawsuit brought by Stanley M. Rosenblatt (no relation) on behalf of flight attendants who claim to have been afflicted by secondary smoke. Yet increasingly it is taking the offensive. Last June, the company sued the Environmental Protection Agency for citing secondary smoke as a carcinogen. Last month, it sued the city of San Francisco to overturn its anti-smoking ordinance, one of the strictest in the country. On March 9, it helped organize a tobacco workers march on Washington against the proposal to raise the cigarette tax.
These executives think of themselves as the best company, and with much of the country acting on their side, they are also in the best company. Of course, there is also the evidence of illness and death that result from their product, but they do not accept that and, so far, neither does the country, formally. If it did, tobacco companies would be illegal. One might say that this absolves the company of special responsibility, since the responsibility is so widespread. But a tobacco company is where the entire process begins. It often ends elsewhere.
On an icy Wednesday afternoon, Victor L. Crawford sits in the conference room of his law office in a colonial house in Rockville, Md. The cold sun shoots bright light into the room without warming it. Photographs of Crawford, who was once a Maryland State Senator, hang on the walls. The house, said to be the oldest in Rockville, dates from the 1780's. "See these?" Crawford points to the stone fireplace and the white chips in its mortar. "They're oyster shells," he says. "That's what they used to fill the holes." His voice sounds raspy like Sinatra's.
He is 61 years old, about six feet in height, gaunt, and he wears a three-piece sharkskin suit; the vest hangs loose. He also wears a light gray wig -- noticeable but well-made and by no means comical. A trial lawyer today, he served five years as a lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute and was instrumental in defeating major anti-smoking bills in Maryland:
"At that point, I had no particular feelings about smoking. I had stopped smoking cigarettes about 15, 18 years earlier. I was 52 then. So I'd stopped smoking in my mid-30's. But I still smoked pipes and cigars. I inhaled a little bit on the pipe, unfortunately. Not on the cigars. I smoked pipes and cigars right up until the time that I was diagnosed. And, of course, I'd smoked cigarettes all those years, since I was 13.
"One day I was sitting in one of the smoke-filled rooms in the Tobacco Institute -- they all smoked -- and thinking, 'My God, maybe we're on the wrong side of this issue, because I can hardly breathe.' But I was very impressed with the institute -- their expertise in P.R. and lobbying. The fees were great, and I was useful to them. I knew everybody in Maryland politics. So I served them well, from the mid-80's till 1991.
"And '91 is when I started getting the problems. Pains in the head, pains in the eustachean tube. My biopsy was in right before Christmas '91. And Jan. 3 of '92 I got the diagnosis of throat cancer. Originally, I stopped cigarettes because I was having trouble breathing. Too late, maybe. It's the most insidious habit, an addiction. I was an addictive personality. I'd stop six or eight weeks. Then I'd have one cigarette and the next day I was back up to two packs and the next day I was back up to three. It is highly addictive.
"I am undergoing chemotherapy. You can tell by the wig. I started off with radiation first, because they wanted to reduce the tumor before they operated. And they operated on me in the first week in April of 1992. They took away everything there in my lower neck and left shoulder, all of the muscles. You can't see the scar. They did a magnificent job.
"I've aged 10 years in six months. This chemotherapy has really just torn the hell out of me, worse than the operation. . . . There's no cure, of course. There is a chance -- a good chance, since I've had such a tremendous response lately -- that they can put it in remission. It might give me anywhere up to five years. When you're 61, five years looks pretty good.
"I have no animosity, though. I've got nobody to blame but myself. I knew what it was. But the tobacco companies were culpable, too. I had some twinges when I was lobbying for them. Why don't they have a feeling of responsibility? Maybe it's the corporate mentality. I defend criminals. And the biggest charge of criminal law is to get a hopeless case and win. The reason it's hopeless is because the son of a bitch is guilty. Because he did it. And by putting him out on the street, I might help him do it again.
"For 33 years, I've been doing this. Just like these hard-nosed tobacco execs say that they have a perfect right to do what they do. But they must know. They have to know. Because they're brilliant people. And they're tough, hard businessmen. They know. But they're able to sublimate it, I'm convinced, because of the similar mentality that we lawyers have. 'Freedom of choice is more important than anything!' Well, that's not necessarily true. But it offers a way that you can live with yourself.
"I'm not proud of having lobbied for them. I think it's ironic. And in a way, I think I got my just deserts, because, in my heart, I knew better. But I rationalized and denied, because the money was so good and because I could always rationalize it. That's how you make a living, by rationalizing that black is not black; it's white, it's green, it's yellow. But I knew, in my heart, that what the Surgeon General said was right. I think these people know that.
"Do I feel guilty about what I did? Yeah. Would I do it again, knowing what I know now? No. Would I do it again not knowing what I know now? Yes. Why? Because it might be unhealthy, but it will never happen to me. And after all, there's freedom of choice. And it's a free country. And if you want to make an ass out of yourself, you have the right. It sounds good. But the fact of the matter is that it's a killer."

HEADLINE: THE SEED CONSPIRACY

BYLINE: By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan, editor at large of Harper's Magazine, is author of "Second Nature: A Gardener's Education." His essays on gardening appear regularly in these pages.

 BODY:
THIS IS THE SEASON OF THE garden seed, that time of pure promise when the entire contents of a quarter-acre patch of vegetables -- the yield of which will burden a small truck come August -- can still fit inside an envelope and be sent cross-country by Fed Ex. The seeds themselves betray no sign of the prodigies they contain, but there, in a handful, they are: this weightless, buff disk packs a complete set of instructions for the making of a two-pound beefsteak tomato; that crinkled, blond tablet is etched with the blueprint for a 10-foot-tall sweet-corn tower.
But this is not the only kind of information encoded in a garden seed. For the seeds I order are inscribed with cultural, political and economic information as well. And if I am to believe some of the more polemical seedsmen whose catalogues-cum-tracts have found their way to my mailbox this season, the decision to plant one variety and not another is freighted with moral and environmental significance. A political fight is not exactly what I came to vegetable gardening to pick, but I seem to have stumbled into one anyway. 
 There I was, looking for a new variety of corn to try, and I wind up reading in the catalogue from Seeds of Change -- part of a growing army of seed firms fired with a sense of political mission -- about the negative impact that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), of all things, will have on the free exchange of seeds and global biodiversity. Then Seeds Blum, a boppy counterculture catalogue published in Boise, Idaho, buttonholes me to explain that by planting modern hybrids, I am helping multinational corporations to monopolize the gene pool. And J. L. Hudson, Seedsman, who publishes the somewhat forbidding Ethnobotanical Catalogue of Seeds, preaches that by planting traditional nonhybrid seeds in my garden I can help to preserve cultural as well as genetic diversity.
The alternative seed catalogues paint the "F-1" hybrid, in particular, as an environmental menace and make a point of refusing to handle the dread seed. In the last few decades F-1 hybrids, which are simply the first generation produced by the crossing of two plant varieties, have become the stock in trade of the commercial seed industry, and they are gradually crowding traditional "open pollinated" varieties (ones pollinated by bees, birds or wind instead of plant geneticists) out of the marketplace. According to the Seed Savers Exchange, an organization established in 1975 to encourage backyard gardeners to preserve certain open-pollinated varieties, almost half of all the nonhybrid vegetable varieties on the market just 10 years ago have been dropped from mail-order catalogues. This often results in extinction, since many domesticated species will not survive unless they are planted over and over again by humans. W. Atlee Burpee & Company would tell you that the disappearance of traditional varieties is simply the Darwinian operation of the marketplace: if the old varieties were any good, they'd compete more successfully. In fact the chairman of Burpee made exactly that argument last spring in a Times Op-Ed piece in defense of the embattled hybrid, likening open-pollinated seeds to Model T's.
The seed savers see another, darker reason for the hybrid's predominance. As the Seeds Blum catalogue puts it, in words plain as those of Marx and Engels, "The reason hybrids exist is to protect the breeding investment of the seed company." Unlike the seeds of open-pollinated varieties, the seeds produced by an F-1 hybrid plant don't "come true" -- their offspring are apt to exhibit the undesirable traits of one or the other parent. In other words, seeds of these hybrids can't be saved or reproduced; their biology makes them proprietary. By forcing gardeners and farmers to return for new seeds each season, the companies selling F-1 hybrids have effectively taken control of the means of production.
These are not the only ways in which modern hybrids remake nature in the image of capitalism. Given heavy doses of fertilizer, F-1 hybrids grow swiftly and produce high yields. They also produce genetically uniform plants. What could better suit factory farming than a robust field of identical tomato or corn plants genetically coded to ripen all at once, thereby facilitating mechanical harvesting?
But the same uniformity that smoothes capitalism's way into the farm and garden also violates one of nature's cardinal principles: genetic diversity. A field of genetically identical plants is much more vulnerable to disease, as American corn farmers discovered in 1970 when a blight decimated the nation's crop, which had grown dependent on a few genetically similar hybrids. After such blights, breeders have historically turned to traditional varieties of corn, found in places like Mexico, to refresh the gene pool and provide new resistance. But what happens when Mexican farmers have been sold on fancy new hybrids and their traditional varieties have become extinct?
Seeds of Change claims in its catalogue that, second to destruction of habitats, "possibly the biggest single trigger of extinctions is the introduction of hybrid seeds." This sounds like hyperbole, and yet the seed insurgents are probably right to perceive a threat to biodiversity in the commercial seed trade's promotion of hybrids. We're accustomed to think of biodiversity only in connection with wild species in places like the rain forest, but the species that humans have selected and bred since the invention of agriculture are no less important. They represent a priceless worldwide store of genetic and cultural information, the heritage of some 10,000 years of coevolution between humans and their crop plants.
As the seed savers see it, the battle for the survival and control of that heritage is about to intensify. The promise of genetic engineering has set off a "gene rush" as breeders seek to identify and control plant genes for a variety of traits -- resistance to disease or frost, say, or to weed-killing chemicals. At the same time, under the new GATT accords, which will be phased in over the next five years, the world will take a giant step toward the privatization of seeds. That's because the GATT provisions on "intellectual property rights" require all signatories -- many for the first time -- to set up a system for the patenting of plant varieties.
This development has already ignited powerful protests in the third world. Many farmers worry that by promoting F-1 hybrids and patenting local plant varieties that were previously saved and exchanged freely, multinational corporations will ruin traditional agriculture. Last July a group of Indian farmers destroyed a Cargill seed-processing plant under construction in southern India, the second attack on the American seed giant's facilities there. (During the first, in December 1992, 300 protesters broke into Cargill's office in Bangalore and made a bonfire of corporate documents.) And in October, in what may be the largest protest ever against GATT, more than 500,000 farmers in India rallied in defense of their "sovereignty over seeds." Though it has gone virtually unreported in this country, India's "seed satyagraha" suggests that freedom of seeds is becoming a point of sharp contention between North and South.
SEEDS OF CHANGE, WHOSE LATEST CATALOGUE brings news of this seed savers Boston Tea Party, bids me to see a connection between my garden and the freedom and diversity of the world seed trade. Take the packet of corn seeds I'm in the market for. What I'm really in the market for, the catalogue makes clear, is a particular set of corn genes, and the choice I make will constitute a kind of evolutionary vote. I could, for example, order a hybrid from Burpee. This year I see they're offering several of the modern "supersweet" hybrids (several years ago some university researchers figured out how to double the gene for sugar in corn and slow its conversion to starch), including Illini Xtra-Sweet, which the catalogue claims is "four times as sweet as standard hybrids 48 hours after picking!" This is a revealing boast. It suggests that Illini Xtra-Sweet and hybrids like it were developed with factory farmers rather than backyard gardeners in mind. For what gardener would need a corn that holds its sweetness for two days?
To order Illini Xtra-Sweet would be a vote not just for a particular kind of corn but for a kind of agriculture -- indeed, for a kind of culture. You could probably deduce a great deal about contemporary America from the genes of Illini Xtra-Sweet; for example, that this is the product of a capitalist economy whose farms rely on petrochemicals (which most hybrids require to thrive) and are typically located a long truck ride away from their consumers, who prize sweetness over nutrition and tend to boil rather than roast their corn. (New corn hybrids have been bred for sweetness and tenderness, usually at the expense of nutritional value.)
The alternative seed catalogues brim with unusual varieties whose genes encode whole different cultures and culinary possibilities that seem worth experiencing -- and helping to preserve. From Seeds of Change I can order Black Aztec, said to be a pre-Columbian Aztec variety that does well in poor, dry soils and whose kernels stand up well to roasting. (At maturity the kernels turn blue black and can be ground into a highly nutritious cornmeal.) Seeds Blum recommends Trucker's Favorite, an heirloom "dent corn" that supposedly makes up in corn flavor what it lacks in sweetness and looks. J. L. Hudson, the most radical of the seedsmen, offers several native American field corns whose appeal seems distinctly less gustatory than, well, ethnobotanical (but then J. L. Hudson believes that we work for the seeds rather than the other way around). This year he's carrying Pod Corn, an ancestral strain whose every kernel is encased in its own husk, and Mandan Bride, "a beautiful multicolor corn said to be from the Mandan people in what is now called North Dakota."
Hudson's catalog is such a vast, teeming democracy of seeds that it makes room for common weeds such as mullein and burdock, four varieties of leaf tobacco (including one grown by Zapotec Indians), even seeds for giant sequoia trees. As one of his cranky, enlightening catalogue essays makes clear, Hudson believes in preserving human as well as genetic diversity -- hence the Zapotec tobacco and the Mandan Bride corn, both of whose genes encode specific cultural practices he's bent on saving. And who knows, one of the old Indian varieties he carries might turn out to contain a trait we will desperately need someday, perhaps the gene that will help us adapt corn to a warmer, drier climate.
That's the wager J. L. Hudson and his fellow seed insurgents are urging me to make -- to turn a corner of my garden into a kind of botanical ark, a blooming, fruiting archive of genetic and cultural information, a multicultural free-port city of open-pollinated, public-domain seeds to be saved and freely disseminated, Burpee and Cargill and GATT be damned! Hudson, Seeds of Change and Seeds Blum hold out a powerful, beguiling and wildly ambitious vision of the garden -- and yet it awaits nothing more than a handful of seeds.
I'm expecting my packet of Black Aztecs in the mail any day now.

DO MOLES MATTER

BYLINE: By Nicholas Wade 

 BODY:
The cold war is dead but the spy business still lives. Last month, a C.I.A. officer, Aldrich Ames, was arrested on charges of being a longtime Moscow mole. And from dark and secret waters there suddenly surfaced a previously unknown class of Navy submarines that for decades has apparently retrieved cold war booty from the abysses of the ocean floor. These echoes from the past prompt a question: Since the Soviet Union's foremost enemy was its own economic system, what difference did 45 years of intelligence operations really make to the outcome of the cold war?

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
In hot wars, it certainly helps to have spies to signal the enemy's intentions, like those who warned Stalin of Hitler's invasion plans; too bad that Stalin didn't believe them. But when the shooting stops, spy agencies seem to spend a lot of time just chasing each other rather than things that matter. The C.I.A. vigorously tries to penetrate the K.G.B. and G.R.U. -- several of the Russians whom Ames allegedly betrayed were counterintelligence officers, as was he. Moscow's prime target is the C.I.A. and National Security Agency. It's hard for outsiders to assess the importance of these cloak-and-dagger duels because the insiders so seldom tell the truth about them. But even the figures of speech in which they are usually described -- Russian matryoshka dolls, wildernesses of mirrors -- hint of much ado about not much.
My father worked in British counterintelligence, where one of his jobs was to monitor East European emigre communities in Britain. I assume he thwarted spy rings operating against Her Majesty's Government and tried to turn them against their own. He only once told me any operational detail of his activities. He came across a Czech or Hungarian spy ring that was reporting to an unusual master -- the American Embassy in London. This was unfortunate, since the United States and Britain had agreed they would not run such operations on each other's soil. As my father told the story, he called in the C.I.A. station chief and laid out the evidence before him. "Gee, Michael," the man replied, "is my face red."
Spies are embarrassments when caught. Even with those who survive detection, fidelity cannot always be assumed, since changing masters tends to be addictive. Satellites, at first blush, have none of these frailties. They never switch allegiances or fall into sex-baited honey traps. Resembling the Hubble Space Telescope, except that they point not up to distant galaxies but down to dirty laundry, these delicate instruments provide streams of good-as-eyewitness information.
But satellites have their own limitations. Their costs, mercifully hidden in black budgets, are probably huge. They have doubtless suffered their share of setbacks, like the Hubble telescope. They can photograph the ground from their lofty orbits as well as low-flying planes can, but unlike planes, they follow predictable orbits. Devious minds seek to trick them, whether with decoys or by timing activities so no satellites are overhead. The Soviet preparation to move an army into Afghanistan was apparently undetected by satellites. So, for many years, was the Krasnoyarsk missile-detecting radar, a large and illegal edifice being constructed nakedly on a site prohibited by treaty.
Maybe more productive means of cold war espionage than either spies or satellites will prove to have been methods like signals intelligence, a less glamorous art about which little is on public record, and the Navy's salvage submarines. This fleet's existence was first reported last month by William J. Broad in The New York Times, although a few of its activities were already known. The submarines, in principle, can monitor anything that drops into the sea or runs across the ocean floor. Unlike many spies, their targets were items of direct strategic importance. Unlike satellites, they can reach down and examine their targets of interest.
Converted for use after retirement from other duties, the submarines' special equipment includes thrusters to keep them poised above their target and giant spools carrying miles of cable. The cables plummet to the ocean floor, presumably carrying devices like lights, cameras, manipulators and collectors. Unlike surface ships, the submarines can operate undetected over sensitive sites.
One submarine, the Halibut, visited the Soviet Golf-2 class nuclear-armed submarine that sank in 1968 near Hawaii and that was salvaged six years later by the Glomar Explorer. The Halibut apparently did so good a job that the Navy and Defense Intelligence Agency doubted the need being asserted by the C.I.A. to build the Glomar Explorer for a further visit. "Optimum recovery of intelligence information from this accident was achieved," the former Navy official who planned the Halibut mission wrote to Congress.
The harvest of the Halibut and its cousins is a matter of the purest speculation. The Navy has admitted to nothing. But in the case of the Golf-2 submarine the phrase "optimum recovery of intelligence information" suggests booty of some strategic weight.
Nuclear warheads are one such item. The Soviet Union is thought to have lost about 40 at sea, according to William M. Arkin of Greenpeace. Dr. Theodore B. Taylor, a former nuclear weapons designer at Los Alamos, pointed out that "bombs can be very different from one another" in a recent discussion of what might have been recovered from the Golf-2 submarine. "There's a good chance Soviet weaponry held big surprises for us."
Another prize, the guidance units of the warhead's missiles, would yield data about the missiles' accuracy. Sunken submarines might also yield code rooms and cryptographic gear.
Besides submarines, the ocean floor holds test missiles that fell short of their target and communications links like undersea cables. Ivy Bells, an eavesdropping project revealed to the Soviet Union by a National Security Agency employee, Ronald W. Pelton, is reported to have involved a large eavesdropping pod, placed round a Soviet cable carrying military communications in the Sea of Okhotsk. The Navy's submarines, whether of the Halibut or some other type, retrieved tapes from the pod, now a prime exhibit in the Moscow museum founded by the K.G.B.
The submarines' take from the ocean floor surely enhanced national security. Whether they or any other means of intelligence collection made a decisive difference in the cold war seems less certain. The C.I.A., according to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, reckoned that the Soviet G.N.P. was roughly three times as large as it turned out to be. The agency thus missed the most critical secret of all -- that the Soviet economy could not support the Soviet empire. Beside this mountainous destructive force, a regiment of moles burrowing away in Moscow or Washington added up merely to molehills.

They're Dancing as Fast as They Can

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby 

 BODY:
IF YOU'RE IN A MOOD TO CONSIDER alternative theater, you couldn't do much better than to check out "Marathon Dancing," the vivid new site-specific performance piece now being presented by En Garde Arts at the Masonic Hall at 71 West 23d Street. The Masonic Hall? Yes, but read on. "Marathon Dancing" is a musical and a melodrama as well as a very entertaining slice of American social and architectural history. It's not your average theater experience.
The time is early 1932, the hopeless height of the Great Depression, when bread lines were commonplace and bindlestiffs camped out by the railroad tracks, waiting to hop the next freight west. It's at the bleak end of Herbert Hoover's Administration and a few months before the appearance of patrician, fatherly Franklin Delano Roosevelt with his N.R.A., W.P.A., C.C.C. and various other alphabetized New Deal panaceas. The place is the sleazy Dreamland Ballroom (I arbitrarily think of it as being somewhere in the Middle West, possibly Chicago) where a marathon dance contest is in progress. 
 As the sweaty, hyped-up emcee Frankie Aragon (P. J. Benjamin), in tired black tie, welcomes his WIND radio listeners to the evening's broadcast, six couples move zombielike around the dance floor. They are the survivors of 721 hours of virtually nonstop dancing, which continues. For more than four weeks, they have been dancing 45 minutes out of each hour, using their 15-minute breaks to sleep, eat, brawl, take care of bodily functions and consider man's fate as America confronts collective despair. In the course of the next four weeks, there will be one wedding (the bride dressed in cellophane), one death and a couple of breakdowns. At the end, most of the contestants will be exactly where they were when they started: broke and bewildered.
This is why marathon dancing, which outdrew flagpole-sitting as a 1920's spectator sport, became the metaphor of choice for Depression stasis. The classic of the genre: Horace McCoy's laconic, piercing 1935 novel, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?," which was the basis for Sydney Pollack's still disturbing 1969 film. (I've never seen June Havoc's "Marathon '33," which was originally produced in New York in 1963 and was also about the marathon dance craze.)
Yet "Marathon Dancing," conceived and directed by Anne Bogart and written by Laura Harrington, is only a part of the show on 23d Street. The other part is the performance site, the recently restored Grand Lodge Room on the Masonic Hall's third floor: a big, handsome, ornately decorated space that's something more than two stories high, all gold gilt and red and vaguely Spanish-Moorish in motif, under a ceiling of back-lighted leaded windows. Though the building was completed in 1909, the Grand Lodge Room seems to anticipate the most exotic fancies of the Roxy, Loew's Paradise and all those other huge, architecturally cross-bred movie palaces that were to be built in later decades.
The room's opulence and secure, self-assured all-American optimism don't really call to mind a place as desolate as the Dreamland Ballroom -- remember the tacky amusement park pier that was the setting for the Pollack film? Instead, the rich decor suggests everything that's beyond the reach of even the aspirations of these dance contestants. It's in this way that the site lends perspective to "Marathon Dancing," which isn't a gritty representation of a time, place and condition but a coolly stylized dream of reality. The Grand Lodge Room is the ironic frame.
As put together by Ms. Bogart and Ms. Harrington, with the collaboration of Christopher Drobny, who adapted and supervised the music, and Alison Shafer, the choreographer, the show is performed by more than two dozen dancing and singing actors. The score is played by a combo (piano, drums and bass) and contains 16 period songs. Most of these are standards, but some, such as Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's "That's Love" (written for Samuel Goldwyn's 1934 flop film, "Nana") and "You Need Someone, Someone Needs You" (music by Lewis Gensler and Dudley Wilkinson, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2d) are brand new to me.
"Marathon Dancing" is played without an intermission. This fits the show's kaleidoscopic narrative method by which characters reveal themselves in bits of dialogue, songs, dances, strobe-lighted cinematic montages, production numbers and what amount to specialty acts. The Dreamland is always looking for ways to bring in customers to watch the freaks on the dance floor. One night, there's a brutal prizefight between a marathon contestant, Kid Alexander (Jonathan Fried), who's asleep on his feet, and a volunteer from the Dreamland audience. On another occasion, the audience is lured by the chance to gawk at Harry Miller (Andrew Weems), whose wife and partner, Jo-Jo (Jennifer Wiltsie), is pregnant, after he has hung upside down for 18 hours and attempts to hang on for another six.
All of the performers are good, but a couple are memorable: Frank Raiter as Mack, an over-the-hill vaudevillian, and Maureen Silliman as Juliet, his much younger partner, a former acrobat. Real time stops and the other performers freeze when Juliet coaxes the flagging Mack to keep on dancing, not to look down, as she sings to him Harry Warren and Al Dubin's "Sweet and Low." A lovely moment. Kristen Flanders as Ingrid, the reluctant cellophane bride from Denmark, is also fine as she sings the sentiment-loaded "Boulevard of Broken Dreams," another Warren and Dubin standard.
Not as effective, if only because they are so obligatory, are the vignettes dramatizing the social conditions (strikes, unemployment) that provided not only the contestants for marathon dance contests but also their audiences. The people who signed up to participate were hanging onto life by their fingertips. The audience came because admission was cheap, and the 24-hour-a-day show was more riveting than any radio soap opera could be.
Ms. Bogart and Kyle Chepulis, the set designer, have made no alterations to the Grand Lodge Room to turn it into the Dreamland. The principal playing area is the large open space at the room's center, which, as defined by lights, becomes the Dreamland's dance floor. When the dancers take their breaks, they retire to one end of the room where there are cots, those for the men on the left, for the women on the right. As in any site-specific presentation, the compulsion is to use every inch of the space. A certain lack of dramatic focus is built into the form. It's also reflected in the production's dominant images, those in which the entire cast is spread out on the dance floor at the same time.
In constructing this site-specific show, Ms. Bogart and her associates are intentionally deconstructing the conventionally well-ordered theatrical experience that tells you where to look. At "Marathon Dancing" you often make your own choices.
 
'The America Play'
There's a seriously comic and skeptical imagination evident in "The America Play," the new work by Suzan-Lori Parks, directed by Liz Diamond, now at Martinson Hall in the Joseph Papp Public Theater. Though a lot gabbier than Samuel Beckett, Ms. Parks reveals Beckett influences in this consideration of American history from a black point of view. She's less interested in the facts of history than in casually acquired notions of history ("so says hearsay" is a repeated theme) and where we belong in it.
Her principal characters: a black gravedigger, played with great skill and humor by Reggie Montgomery, who's obsessed by the notion that he's the spit and image of Abraham Lincoln; his wife, Lucy (Gail Grate), who picks up the whispering echoes of long-gone voices and events through her ear trumpet, and their son, Brazil (Michael Potts), who wants to follow in his father's footsteps to become a "digger and a faker." Riccardo Hernandez's beautiful wasteland set is mostly slag-gray, set off by splashes of brilliant scarlet (a curtain and the satin lining of a casket, among other things).
In the first act the gravedigger, who abandoned his wife and child 30 years before, is somewhere out West, digging his "exact replica of the Great Hole of History," which sometimes seems to be a theme park back East, sometimes the hole left in Lincoln's head by John Wilkes Booth's bullet and, more importantly, the hole in black history caused by hundreds of years of invisibility in servitude. Behind the digger's obsession with "the Great Man" (he refers to himself as "the Lesser Known"), there is an inarticulated fury. From time to time we see him in the sideshow in which he has traveled the West: for a penny patrons can pick up a pistol, loaded with blanks, to assassinate his Lincoln look-alike as he sits in a makeshift theater box, watching "Our American Cousin."
In Act II Lucy and Brazil travel west to look for the remains of the digger, now dead, and to hear his last words. The play also makes use of ragtime music and scenes from "Our American Cousin."
Ms. Parks has been quoted as saying that people must make up their own minds as to what it all means. That's fine as long as the play is evocative, which it is about half the time. She's also effectively denying her own responsibility when she overwrites, and the ideas become muddled.
Ms. Parks has a singular voice, worth attending to, but I wonder whether she is well served by the comparative luxe of this handsome, supportive physical production. It lessens the playwright's obligation. She must refine her work until it is so spare, with each word so seemingly irreplaceable, that it could be played with as much effect in the middle of an ordinary living room as in Mr. Hernandez's elegant wasteland.
 
'Titus Andronicus'
"Titus Andronicus" is always included in Shakespeare's collected works, but to many scholars it remains an embarrassment. They propose that it's really someone else's play to which Will made some minor contributions. The earliest of Shakespeare's tragedies, it is also the least introspective, the bloodiest and the most stylistically inconsistent. Yet whoever wrote it, "Titus Andronicus" is not performed so frequently that one can easily overlook a production as good looking, inventive and sometimes witty as Julie Taymor's current work for Theater for a New Audience at St. Clement's Church.
Without ever shifting into a camp mode, the Taymor version is also funny, shocked amusement being about the only way to react to the nonstop succession of Grand Guignol horrors that take place on, or just off, the St. Clement's stage. Three hands and two heads are severed, one tongue cut out and, of the dozen principal characters, only one is alive at the end.
The revered old Roman general Titus returns home from his victories over the Goths, bearing as hostages Tamora, the Goth queen, and her three sons. Titus spurns the emperor's wreath, bestowing it instead on Saturnius, the son of the recently deceased emperor. Saturnius promptly jilts Titus's daughter Lavinia (who didn't want to marry him anyway) to marry Tamora. Her beloved is Aaron, a Moor like Othello, but whose evil deeds are as unmotivated as those of Iago. This may be as much of the story as you need to keep track of.
What's fascinating about "Titus Andronicus" is its obsession with pure revenge. Everyone, the foolish Titus as much as anybody, acts in such a way as to inspire an obsession for revenge in someone else. Shakespeare here wastes no time considering the emotions that fuel revenge: honor, love, sexual passion, familial loyalties. Revenge is what gives pleasure. It's the common religion and the characters are fundamental believers, which may be a lesson for today.
With the exception of Curzon Dobell, who plays Titus's son and heir, Lucius, none of the actors at St. Clement's speaks the text with uniform ease. The words are shouted, voices are strained. Yet the production consistently engages the attention. It's like a terrible fairy tale from Mars. Ms. Taymor mixes eras in costumes and props (ancient Greek with contemporary), atonal musical accompaniment (by Elliot Goldenthal) with hints of themes that sound as if they might have been written by Federico Fellini's favorite composer, Nino Rota. The effect: hypnotic and sometimes genuinely scary.
 
MARATHON DANCING Anne Bogart's coolly stylized dream of reality has an ironic frame. It's not your average theater experience.
 
THE AMERICA PLAY A history of black and white, filtered through a seriously comic imagination, by a playwright who leaves meaning up to the audience.
 
TITUS ANDRONICUS Like a terrible fairy tale from Mars, the production by Julie Taymor is consistently engaging and sometimes even witty.

Outlasting The Incas And Spaniards

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
THE CRAFTS OF THE MAPUCHE people reflect the rich mix of traditions inherited from their pre-Columbian ancestors or borrowed from their former enemies -- the Incas and the Spaniards. But the shimmering silver jewelry, bold capes and exotic musical instruments of these Latin American natives, who comprise the largest and one of the oldest indigenous groups of Chile, are virtually unknown in the United States.
At the time of the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, the Mapuche (pronounced ma-POO-chuh) dominated Chile, and their language was spoken throughout the land. By then, they had successfully resisted the Incas for a half century. And they remained independent, defying the Spaniards, until the late 19th century. Once subdued, they were banished to government-controlled reservations. Today, about a half million of them farm crowded plots, mostly in the southern part of central Chile. 
 Since no written record of the Mapuche culture survives from before the Spanish conquest, little is understood of their origins and early history. And while the dating and scholarship of their later crafts is also less than exact, some of their story is now revealed in "Mapuche: Seeds of the Chilean Soul," an exhibition at the Americas Society on upper Park Avenue, through April 20.
The show, the first in New York to focus on these people, is part of the nonprofit organization's program of exhibitions, concerts and lectures. The society was founded in 1965 by David Rockefeller to promote economic, political, social and cultural understanding between the United States and the rest of the Western Hemisphere.
The 80 objects on view, produced over more than 1,000 years, were lent by the Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art in Santiago, which organized the exhibition. Among the earliest ceramics is a round-bellied jar from the seventh century, a terra-cotta work embellished with black stripes and triangles; the pouring spout is shaped vaguely like the head of a duck. This vessel and another one -- an anthropomorphic jar with a quizzical face and large hands -- are similar to many pre-Columbian pieces from other regions of Latin America. In fact, the show's stone pipes, whistles and clubs, although undated, are reminiscent of those made by tribal peoples everywhere.
Mapuche ceramics, when decorated, are patterned with geometric motifs much like the pottery painted as early as 500 B.C. in what is now western Mexico. And Mapuche textiles woven at the turn of the century boast some of the same wide stripes, lightning streaks and ziggurats that the Navajos favored in the blankets they wore in the same period.
According to Carlos Aldunate del Solar, director of the Chilean museum, who was the show's curator, ziggurat images represent the staircases a man must ascend to achieve the highest status in the tribe. While there are no documented connections between the Mapuche and the Navajos, in both cases the women were the weavers and were influenced by Spanish culture.
The two Mapuche deities represented in the exhibition are depicted in 19th-century silver-plated metal images of a young man and woman, both shown topless -- he is wearing pants, she is in a skirt. "The Mapuche believe in a god that is masculine and feminine, old and young, all at the same time," Mr. Aldunate said.
Virtually all the extant Mapuche jewelry was produced after the conquest, Mr. Aldunate said. But the most compelling pieces are the outsized silver disks and trapezoids, forms worn as pendants and earrings in the pre-Columbian period. The jewelry is exhibited on three mannequins swathed in black cloth and bedecked with cascading chains and necklaces, headpieces and a pair or two of earrings. The displays can be frustrating to the viewer because the individual items cannot be clearly seen, and the pieces on each mannequin represent a mix of silver from different periods.
The lone mask in the show is a hawk-nosed carved wood one worn by dancers entertaining at a hockeylike game called palin since prehistoric times. "These were ritual dances," Mr. Alduante said.
Mapuche musical instruments, though primitive in form, have influenced a number of contemporary Chilean composers. The show's prize is a 20th-century trumpet, two feet in diameter, devised from a 10-foot hollow cane, bent into a circle and fitted with a mouthpiece fashioned from a bull's horn.
"It produces a wonderful sound," Mr. Alduante said. "It's very loud and screeching -- it positively roars. These instruments were used in battle -- and later to praise god."

UConn Moving Its Stamford Campus Downtown

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
STAMFORD'S quarter-century metamorphosis from factory town to diverse metropolis entered a new phase last week when arrangements were concluded to relocate the Stamford Branch of the University of Connecticut from its site north of the Merritt Parkway to the heart of downtown.
The school will move into the former Bloomingdale's outlet on Washington Boulevard, vacant since 1990 when poor sales, financial troubles at its parent company, Federated Department Stores, and the taint of a murder that took place in the parking garage forced the closing after 36 years. 
 Federated sold the 243,000-square-foot store, the 900-car parking garage and a small lot behind the store, totaling about 6 acres, to the state for $9.57 million. The property is assessed at $9.66 million. "Extensive renovations, furniture and equipment," said Dr. Karen Arms, president of UConn/Stamford, "could cost another $70 million."
The move will provide the school with an additional 167,000 square feet, enabling it to broaden its curriculum and install a gym, student and faculty lounges, career-planning services, an expanded library and bookstore, improved dining facilities and space for clubs and social activities.
Dr. Arms called Bloomingdale's three stories of high ceilings and wide-open spaces ideal for the free design of room configurations. The existing elevators and escalators are other pluses.
Originally housed in a high school, where it enrolled veterans returning from World War II, the branch moved in 1962 to a new, barracks-like classroom building of 41,600 feet five miles north of downtown. In 1975 a 34,200-square-foot library was built, but further expansion on the 37-acre campus is prohibited by wetlands, lack of sewers, and by a resolution of the city's legislative body designed to protect the residential character of the neighborhood.
The university's Bartlett Arboretum, which abuts the campus and is short of space, will be expanded into the school grounds and buildings.
"For the past several years the school has been under pressure to enrol more students," said State Senator George Jepson, a Stamford Democrat who is on the team negotiating team for the property, "and those that are there have not been getting a legitimate university education due to the physical inadequacy of the buildings."
He added that the downtown campus would boost property values around it and "contribute to increased safety, especially at night, by having more people around."
After Bloomingdale's closed several shops around it were vacated and the neighborhood declined sharply.
Loss of the store's $270,680 in annual property taxes is not a serious concern, according to Mayor Stanley Esposito.
"THE city will be partially reimbursed through the state's Payment in Lieu of Taxes program," he said, "and the rest will be compensated by the economic boom that will result from nearly 3,000 students and faculty members patronizing downtown services, shops, cultural offerings and entertainment."
A diverse student body of 1,600 is expected to increase to 2,800 at the new location. Ranging in age from late teens to adult, most of them live within a 50-mile radius and more than half have day jobs and attend classes at night. There are no dormitories, nor will there be any at the new location.
"Having a university within walking distance of many companies," said Kip Bergstrom, the city's Director of Economic Development, "and a few blocks from I-95 and Metro North allows employees not only from Stamford but from surrounding communities easy access to a master's degree in business administration. It's a unique resource in this region and it will give Stamford a competitive edge in attracting new business and retaining what it has."
A degree in Stamford's Executive M.B.A. program can be obtained in about 18 months on weekends or other schedules compatible with an individual's work hours.
"Stamford is the only regional campus in the state university system that has both a two-year and four-year program," said Mark Roy, spokesman at the home campus in Storrs. "Usually students at the branches transfer to Storrs for their junior and senior years." There are additional regional campuses in Groton, Torrington, Hartford, West Hartford and Waterbury.
In 1992 the state's capital budget included $10 million for site acquisition and a total of $93 million was estimated as the cost of new construction on a parcel it hoped to purchase four blocks east of Bloomingdale's on Broad Street. The tract was lost in the bidding process to Trammell Crow, the Dallas-based developer.
Since then Trammell Crow's Connecticut executives reorganized as a new company, called Avalon Properties, and are preparing to apply for final site plan approval on a complex of 381 rental apartments at that location.
"We think they will be ideal for leasing to UConn faculty, or two or three students taking a unit together," said Samuel Fuller, Avalon's vice president. The project will have a pool, racquetball and basketball courts, fitness rooms, on-site parking and a lounge. Rents for one- to 3-bedroom units will range from $1,000 to $1,600 a month.
Jack Condlin, vice president of Marlowe Associates, a Stamford real estate firm, is also keeping UConn in mind while renovating the old Y.W.C.A. building on nearby Summer Street. Thirty-four studios and one-bedroom units will rent for $650 to $900.
HIS company owns nine retail and office properties around Bloomingdale's. "Rents are still around $12 a square foot from $25 to $28 five years ago," he said, noting that the recession had added to the impact of Bloomingdale's departure. But as the economy improved and word spread of UConn's interest in the site, he said, "we rented three out of four vacant stores opposite Bloomingdale's on Broad Street."
Interest by the local corporate community in the value of a bigger and better downtown UConn was demonstrated two years ago by contributions totaling $500,000 from General Reinsurance Company, Champion International, Xerox and American Brands.
The money was used to establish and staff a development office for UConn/Stamford as an ongoing fund-raising vehicle for items not covered by state allocation and to heighten interest in what has been a very small and quiet university campus.
"We are opening a capital campaign for $15 million," said Mary Gorham Franco, development director for the Stamford Partnership, a nonprofit civic group, "in endowments for scholarships and financial aid, for recruiting talented minority students and top flight professors in the financial and telecommunications fields which we feel are Stamford's strengths."
Money is also needed for development-office equipment, legal fees, studies, research, and a continuously updated data base of donors. "So far we have obtained substantial pledges from several individual, corporate and foundation contributors," she said.
Senator Jepson noted that this year's bonding package contained a request of $4 million for site development, architectural and engineering planning. "If the schedule is in sync we will go back next year for construction financing of $40 to $50 million," he said. "Public construction moves slower, so the fastest we can expect to open is late 1997."

HEADLINE: In Real Estate, New Faces, Old Names

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
EVEN if you can't place the face, the name may be familiar: Durst. Galbreath. Koeppel. Malkin. Rose. Rudin. Silverstein. Wilpon. Zeckendorf. A takeover generation is coming to the fore among New York's leading real estate families. Men in their 20's, 30's and 40's are taking a more visible role in the leadership of second- , third- and fourth-generation businesses.
So too -- in a departure from their parents' era -- are a number of women, among them Robin Abada, 26, leasing representative at the Muss Development Company; Sarah K. Cohn, 32, general counsel of Koeppel Tener Riguardi; Beth Rudin DeWoody, 41, vice president of Rudin Management Company; Lizanne Galbreath, 36, vice chairwoman of Galbreath Riverbank, and Amy Rose, 27, assistant vice president of Rose Associates. 
 "Women have just as much of a gut feeling about real estate and a sense of business as men do," said Ms. DeWoody, a commercial broker who was recently named president of the Samuel and May Rudin Foundation. "In a family business, this is also their heritage and it's important for them to be part of the direction."
As a girl, Ms. Rose recalled, she would ride with her father, Elihu Rose, in the construction hoist of an apartment tower on West 57th Street or visit the site of a condominium complex in Bayside, Queens.
"I've grown up with these buildings," she said. "These buildings are in my blood."
Deal-making also seems virtually a birthright. "My earliest memories of vacation were negotiating with tenants with my father," said David M. Katz. His father, Saul B. Katz, is president of Sterling Equities. Growing up in the early 70's, Mr. Katz and his cousin, Jeffrey S. Wilpon, made up their own business cards: "President for Construction" or "President for Leasing." Today, they are both vice presidents of Sterling Equities.
At a time of convulsive change in other industries, the ascent of this younger generation -- which also includes members of the Fisher, Milstein, Resnick and Tishman families -- seems to guarantee continuity.
"My job is a lot easier because of the previous generation's hard work," said William C. Rudin, 38, the new president of Rudin Management. "I don't have to tell a tenant what my organization is about."
But the younger men and women understand that they cannot duplicate the expansive careers of their fathers and uncles, at least for the time being. With the devastation of the real estate market, they must find new ways to do business, whether in management, ownership, brokerage, assemblage or construction.
What is likely to remain unchanged is a network among the families, who have many political and charitable interests in common, even as competitors in business.
"I go to twice-monthly meetings with Adam and Amy Rose," said Anthony E. Malkin, 31, the president of W & M Properties. "Will and Arthur Zeckendorf and I get together socially. Doug Durst and I trade calls often. It's not a country club or a coterie. But these are the folks who are doing business in the 1990's."
In the 1980's, newcomers seemed "more supple in their financial thinking than the multigenerational families," Tom Shachtman wrote in "Skyscraper Dreams," a 1991 portrait of New York's real estate families. Existing clans, he wrote, were "less inclined to shift from tactics that had always proven viable" and "overly cautious in the wake of the disasters of the 1970's."
Continuity can be the enemy of innovation when heirs wed themselves to longtime family practices. "Sometimes, there's a desire to carry forward what the founder did and that becomes outdated," said Wendy C. Handler, an assistant professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., who specializes in family-business management.
On the other hand, the caution of the old families may have helped preserve them.
THAT is not to say they were completely spared. Ms. Galbreath, for example, spent a lot of time in Columbus, Ohio, working closely with her father, Daniel M., on restructuring the troubled Galbreath Company. "It was a very painful process," she said, "but I think we're a stronger company for it." Ms. Galbreath is vice chairwoman of the Columbus-based company, which is the parent of Galbreath Riverbank in New York.
Scott N. Resnick, 29, a managing director of Jack Resnick & Sons, cut his teeth on the failed attempt to renovate the 40 Wall Street office tower, which fell apart in 1991 when the building lost its largest tenant and Citicorp halted financing. "The financial unraveling was an incredible education," Mr. Resnick said. "It absolutely made me a lot more cautious and conservative in my outlook."
Conservatism is the self-professed watchword of the coming generation.
"The way to survive in this business is to be conservative, to have a relatively low amount of leverage," said 33-year-old Douglas A. Morse, a cousin of Mr. Malkin, who is director of acquisitions at the Lester Morse Company, a mortgage brokerage.
"Our fathers were more builders than we will be," said Douglas Durst, the 49-year-old managing director and executive vice president of the Durst Organization. "That's mostly due to the economic times we face. A lot of what we're going to be focusing on is rebuilding." That effort includes office towers on the Avenue of the Americas and Third Avenue.
"When there's a chance to develop," Ms. Rose said, "believe me, we'll be there." For now, she is working on renovating retail space in a block bounded by Broadway, University Place, Eighth and Ninth Streets.
"I plan and hope to be a developer," Mr. Resnick said. "However, in the 80's, I thought that would be my primary focus. I guess I've resigned myself to the fact that in the first major part of my career, I will be dealing with existing property."
After graduating from New York University, Mr. Resnick worked at the Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, then spent a year in law school before joining the family business. He was prompted by the impending construction of the Oxford, a 44-story apartment tower at 422 East 72d Street.
"I always wanted to work with my father," he said, "and I strongly felt that this might be the last time in quite a while to see a building go from the ground up. I learned an incredible amount about planning, leasing, marketing and the financial aspects."
Large projects also drew Daniel R. Tishman, 38, into the family business. Having studied environmental sciences, he moved to Maine 15 years ago, where he started a small development concern. "I realized how much I enjoyed the process of building something," he said. In 1988, the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, based in New York, was awarded Boston Crossing, an ambitious combination of offices, stores, a hotel and theaters. Tishman was also negotiating to build a large office tower in Hartford.
This prompted Tishman to open a New England office, with Daniel Tishman in charge. Although the Boston and Hartford projects were never built, the company has a "significant amount" of work, said Mr. Tishman, who is senior vice president of both Tishman Construction Corporation in Boston and the New York-based parent company.
Ms. Galbreath also came into the family fold because of a large project. She had attended Dartmouth College and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, had worked at Chemical Bank and was looking for a job on Wall Street.
But in the early 80's, Galbreath-Ruffin (predecessor to the Galbreath Company) planned a 2.5-million-square-foot office tower in Chicago, with a subsidiary of the Mobil Corporation. "It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Ms. Galbreath said.
For want of tenants, the Chicago project was never built. Meanwhile, in New York, Ms. Galbreath watched as builders took "huge risks" in the late 80's. "The way of doing business in New York no longer fit our risk profile," she said. "We decided we did want to stay, but we changed from development to third-party management."
A large project also engaged Ms. Rose, who had not expected to wind up at Rose Associates virtually the day after she graduated from the University of Michigan. What brought her in was the imposing job of converting nine Rose apartment buildings, with some 3,000 rental units, to co-ops.
The conversion was undertaken by her cousin, Adam R. Rose, who preceded her into the company. "If we had been in a steady-state operation," he said, "then I would have insisted she conform to the iron-clad theory that it's absolutely better to work elsewhere before joining the family business."
After Mr. Rose graduated from Yale College in 1981, he moved to San Antonio and worked for Guido Brothers Construction Company, a third-generation enterprise.
"I THINK I needed for myself -- and, frankly, for the family -- the validation of working in an external situation," said Mr. Rose, now 34 years old and an executive vice president at Rose Associates.
Mr. Rose said his father, Frederick P. Rose, and uncles, Elihu and Daniel, "were similar in encouraging their children to do what they wanted and in emphasizing the need to have broad interests."
Jonathan F. P. Rose, Adam's brother, once worked at Rose Associates but now, at 41, is president of the Affordable Housing Construction Corporation in Katonah, N.Y., a development and consulting firm.
One of Daniel Rose's sons, Joseph B. Rose, 34, was appointed chairman of the City Planning Commission in January. He was never at Rose Associates, although he has long been involved in land-use and development issues, as chairman of Community Board 5 and executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council.
"There was a concern by some, when I became chair of the community board, that this was an arm of the development industry," he said. "I think my record quickly dispelled any concerns about that."
As with the Roses, several members of the Rudins' third generation have come and gone from the business. A second cousin, 38-year-old Jeffrey Steinman, remains and is a vice president in the residential department.
Ms. DeWoody said her grandfather, Samuel Rudin, "was always encouraging me to come into the business." Before she joined Rudin Management in 1982, she had been a production assistant on the movies "Annie Hall," "Hair" and "The Front."
The elder Rudin took the same approach with her brother, William, who recalled: "My grandfather always said when we were growing up: 'Don't go to college. Come put a desk in my office and see how things are done.' "
Mr. Rudin went to the University of Arizona instead but wishes he had taken up the offer from his grandfather, who died while he was still in college. "If I could do something over, that would be it," Mr. Rudin said. "I could have gone to college at any time."
Grandfathers figure prominently in several stories from the younger generation.
Anthony Malkin, who had been an investor, was brought into the family business after the death in 1988 of his grandfather, Lawrence A. Wien, who had pioneered real estate syndications. "It became obvious that we were going to have our fair share of shakes in the upcoming turbulence," Mr. Malkin said, "and that the focus would have to be on a company that was management intensive."
AS boys, the Zeckendorf brothers visited their grandfather's office, a cylindrical glass turret atop 383 Madison Avenue. They might be international diplomats today, had they followed the footsteps of their other grandfather, Trygve Lie, the first Secretary General of the United Nations, whose daughter, Guri, married William Zeckendorf Jr.
"It was either Wall Street, foreign policy or real estate," William Lie Zeckendorf said, "and the real estate business -- by the time I got out of school in 1980 -- began to expand dramatically. It was a pretty easy choice."
At the age of 35, William Lie Zeckendorf is executive vice president of Zeckendorf Realty, alongside his 34-year-old brother, Arthur William Zeckendorf.
"My grandfather and father are developers -- they live to build," said William Lie Zeckendorf. "Arthur and I enjoy development, but we are willing to look at the service side as well."
In its second generation, the Milstein family became heavily involved in service, with the purchase in 1989 of Douglas Elliman & Company. Howard P. Milstein, the chairman, who is in his early 40's, prompted the current investigation into payoffs to apartment house managers by contractors after he discovered questionable practices.
Mr. Milstein refused to be interviewed for this article, as did his brother, Edward, the vice chairman of Douglas Elliman, who is in his mid-30's and their cousin, Philip L., president of Milford Management Corporation, who is in his mid-40's.
Kenneth and Steven Fisher, who are in their 30's, also declined to be interviewed. Their presence carries Fisher Brothers into its fourth generation.
Not all families stay together. The brothers Max and Harry Koeppel split many years ago, so unreconciled that neither would give up the company name. As a result, there are two firms called Koeppel & Koeppel today.
Harry Koeppel's grandson is William W. Koeppel, 34, a partner in Koeppel & Koeppel at 641 Lexington Avenue.
Max Koeppel's grandchildren are Caleb D. Koeppel, 37; David J. Koeppel, 35 and Edward A. K. Adler, 45. They are partners in Koeppel & Koeppel at 26 Broadway and officers in the Koeppel Tener Riguardi brokerage and management concern, where Ms. Cohn, the Koeppels' sister, is counsel.
How could they not be in the business, when it permeated their lives? "You never leave it at the office," Caleb Koeppel said. "It's at family dinners and holidays."
"I never really thought seriously about doing anything else," said Michael T. Cohen, 34, the president and chief executive of the Williams Real Estate Company, which has been led by the Cohen and Roos families for three generations. Andrew H. Roos, 40, is the executive vice president.
ROBIN ABADA, Joshua L. Muss's daughter, came to the business straight out of Boston University in 1989. "When I graduated," she said, "I had a month that I was allowed to take off before my father said, 'Now it's time to start in the business.' " Her 28-year-old brother, Joseph, also works at Muss Development.
Roger A. Silverstein, 30, joined his father, Larry A. Silverstein, soon after his graduation from New York University in 1986. "I jumped right into the fire," he said. He is now an assistant vice president at Silverstein Properties, in leasing and management.
But Mr. Wilpon, 32, said the "house rule" in his family was that "we all had to go outside and work somewhere else." He was drafted by the Montreal Expos and played for its minor-league team in Jamestown, N.Y. (His father, Fred Wilpon, is co-owner of the Mets.) Before joining Sterling, he also worked for the Lehrer/McGovern construction firm, the Resnicks and at the Hines Interests.
His cousin, Mr. Katz, who is 30, worked for Tishman, Niko Construction and Cushman & Wakefield before joining Sterling.
Mr. Wilpon is not the only member of the takeover generation to have played sports.
Jonathan Durst, 37, competed professionally as a triathlete and worked as a mechanical engineer for Chrysler and the FMC Corporation before joining the Durst Organization in 1984. His 35-year-old brother, Joshua, came into the company in 1983, after getting a master's degree in business.
Their cousin, Douglas, was the first to join the Durst Organization, in 1967. "I had always thought this is what I'd do," he said.
At the age of 50, Robert Durst is the oldest member of the takeover generation. In January, he was appointed managing director of the Durst Organization, together with Douglas, Jonathan and Joshua Durst.
"When I was growing up, it was the days of long hair and marijuana," he recalled. "In terms of announcing you were going into the family business -- that was extremely uncool." So why, in 1973, did he join his father, Seymour, and uncles? "I got married," he answered. "Seymour decided I lacked ambition. These type things."
A cousin, Peter Askin, 47, worked for the Durst Organization in the 1970's and 80's. But he had studied dramatic literature and the theater eventually exerted a greater pull.
"Writing was always an interest and involvement," he said, "and then directing became one as well." He is now director of the Westside Theater, 407 West 43d Street. But family ties are not wholly severed.
He leases the building from the Dursts.

HEADLINE: Board Looks at Urban Areas

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THIS city is preparing the way for construction of a traffic artery designed 20 years ago to facilitate access to the downtown business district, linking the hub to the Bronx River Parkway at the County Center.
Known as the Grove Street extension, it would ease rush-hour delays on Main Street in the morning and Hamilton Avenue in the evening and complete the city's last major road segment of its postwar revitalization plan. 
 The revival of interest in the long-dormant project came with the new administration of Mayor Sy J. Schulman, who sent a memo to County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke on Feb. 28, saying, "As you know, this key arterial link has been in various stages of planning for two decades, and it is time for all of us to move it ahead."
 
'A Key Participant'
 Mr. Schulman said he had written to state transportation officials urging action. "In recent city-county-state staff discussions there was general agreement on the project's design," he said, and the State Department of Transportation "is firmly committed to including it on its program and will be asking the Mid-Hudson Planning Group at its next meeting to confirm the project's scheduling."
"Thereafter," the Mayor stated in his memo to Mr. O'Rourke, "state and Federal approvals should be forthcoming, and funding and construction would follow." Mr. Schulman proposed an intergovernmental commitment to the project, "adding the county as a key participant in the project."
Drawing the county into a proposed Memorandum of Understanding fit neatly, and apparently coincidentally, with a new effort by the Board of Legislators to help in the revitalization of Westchester's urban areas.
The Board chairman, Stephen J. Tenore, Republican of New Rochelle, declared his interest in having the legislators pay more attention to the cities when he was named to the post two years ago and underscored this concern with establishment of a new Urban Affairs Committee in the current session.
Operating under bipartisan leadership, with two first-term Legislators, Lois T. Bronz, Democrat of White Plains, and Michael J. Spano, Republican of Yonkers, sharing the chairmanship, the committee began its work 10 days ago by inviting the county's mayors to state their needs.
 
A Change in Attitude
 Mayor Timothy C. Idoni of New Rochelle recalled the attitude in his City Hall before he took office. "It was that you don't go to the county government" for help, because "all they care about is White Plains and the Golden Mile" of corporate development along I-287, he said.
That attitude appears to be changing, he indicated. "Things have improved over the last two or three years, especially in terms of how the villages and towns view the county's cities," a point frequently made by Mr. Tenore, the author of the plan to help the cities.
"It's not just a local problem," Mr. Tenore said. "The flight of businesses from downtowns is a national problem. At the same time, these cities and their problems can't be extracted from the rest of the county."
Referring to the value of property subject to taxes, he added: "If cities like Yonkers, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon had not lost ratables, then the thriving communities would not be taxed as heavily. It's in everyone's interest to help the cities."
 
Dispute Over Bridge
 And what could the county do to help Mr. Idoni? He expressed the city's gratitude for the transfer of some county offices to downtown New Rochelle, but he said even more was involved in developing the city-owned Davids Island.
A year ago the city gave up on a developer's proposal to build a $1 billion residential complex because, among other factors, it faced governmental opposition to a bridge linking the 78-acre island with the mainland.
Mr. Idoni said members of the Board of Legislators "expressed real opposition to the bridge," which he said influenced Albany's opposition. He asked that a subcommittee of the Board work with the city in studying the feasibility of a bridge.
The Mayor has also said that it might be better for the city to set the framework for development of the island and then seek a builder rather than wait for developers to initiate plans.
The city of Mount Vernon, although experiencing "severe financial stress," in the words of Gerrie Post, the Planning Director, has a flourishing downtown. A new Pathmark store, which is open 24 hours and "carries a huge product line, including a pharmacy and bakery," has brought in "a lot of shoppers from neighboring communities," she said.
 
Reversing a Trend
 This is a reversal of the postwar trend of placing shopping malls outside city centers and giving once flourishing downtown areas the look of a ghost town. Ms. Post said Mount Vernon was "very happy with the partnership that we have been building over the last few years with the County Board and with the county government.
She said, "We look to the county to help us when it can with inquiries from businesses seeking to relocate in Westchester." The city covers only 4.4 square miles, and 99 percent of the land is developed. It has catalogued vacant space and is aware, Ms. Post said, that "this whole region is changing in terms of business environment, from manufacturing and heavy industry to more service-oriented and consumer-emphasized businesses."
Ms. Post said the city seems to have reached the limit on property taxes. "People can go only so far in terms of how much they can pay in property taxes, so we have to do something else," she said.
 
Peekskill's Turnaround
 The answer, she added, "may be to increase our sales taxes," especially through new enterprises. The planned refurbishing of Memorial Field by the county at a cost of $6 million, plus the development of a retail center on Sandford Avenue, should help bring in revenue, she said. .
Ms. Post said the Board of Legislators could help Mount Vernon and other similarly developed areas to establish affordable housing by changing limitations on the long-standing Housing Implementation Fund. The county is barred from building housing, but it can assist by supplying the infrastructure, like sewer lines.
Cities already have most of the infrastructure, but the county could help them by constructing things like sidewalks and parking areas, in order to bring the price of housing down to a level that municipal employees making $20,000 a year could afford, she said.
Another Mayor, Frances S. Gibbs of Peekskill, also spoke of a city's changing profile. In 1989, when Steinbach's Department Store closed, it signaled the beginning of the end for the city's central business district.
Peekskill's response? The Artist Spaces Program, an 18-month effort to identify appropriate space with the result that 35 studios were converted and occupied. With this start, attention was turned to broader rehabilitation of the downtown.
 
Waterfront Project in Yonkers
 Police patrols were enlarged, and parking lots were built. Youth services were expanded and a youth center opened. A Saturday farmers market was initiated, and affordable-housing sites were selected. An $8.4 million 100-unit project for the elderly and disabled was built and occupied.
Peekskill, meanwhile, has gone beyond finding space for artists; it is assisting small arts and crafts businesses. Mrs. Gibbs said that a key to Peekskill's successful rebirth was the county's Charles Point waste-to-energy plant that converts garbage into electricity for Peekskill and industries clustered nearby.
Mayor Terence Zaleski of Yonkers, who did not accept the Urban Affairs Committee's bid to say where he thought the county and, particularly, the Board of Legislators, could help the troubled city, responded later in an interview.
He said the county "has committed $15 million for downtown waterfront rehabilitation, a substantial amount that will "reproduce a waterfront esplanade, a public marina and other infrastructure." The state has pledged $1 million for roads. Also planned for the waterfront is commuter ferry service.
 
Sales Tax Continuation
 He said that the city's downtown reaches out from Getty Square, which has also been the object of plans and projects and which the Mayor insists is a thriving retail center "where rent per square foot is greater than sections along Central Avenue," the heavily commercialized artery that connects Yonkers and White Plains.
"The county can assist us in our outreach, for Getty Square and other sites around the city. They have an economic development arm that enables us to work with other communities," Mr. Zaleski said, adding that he intended to work closely with the Urban Affairs Committee.
The county government, meanwhile, has hardly ignored the plight of the cities. In Yonkers, in addition to the waterfront project, the county has opened new quarters for the Social Services Department, where it can handle 1,800 clients a day.
It is footing the $6 million rehabilitation cost of Mount Vernon's Memorial Field and will operate the stadium for 30 years as part of the deal. The county is also spending $50,000 to move utilities and make other improvements for a retail center across the street from the field.
Meanwhile, Mayor Schulman of White Plains, who met with the Board's Urban Affairs Committee a week before the first open session with the mayors, had another request. He said the county could do a lot by supporting continuation of the extra 0.5 percent city sales tax, which is to expire in the city on Aug. 31 next year.
State lawmakers have the final say in such tax matters, but Albany will act only if the Board of Legislators supports the bid.
 
Reasons for County's Support
 Joining in completion of the Grove Street extension was clearly topmost in the minds of the Mayor and members of the city's Common Council, who accompanied him in the session with the Urban Affairs Committee.
The artery, extending beyond the bus terminal, at the city's western edge, to meet the Bronx River Parkway at the County Center, would also provide access to Central Park Avenue and Route 119, which motorists currently reach as part of a Hamilton Avenue flow that takes traffic under the Metro-North Commuter Railroad station.
Mr. Schulman said White Plains needed the county's support for the Grove Street extension for several reasons.
"First, it's county property where the arterial meets the County Center, so the county must be part of the project," Mr. Schulman said.
Second, the arterial has been designed with county needs in mind, including improved access to the County Center and linking the rest of the county to what is probably Westchester's largest transportation hub.
In a memorandum that Mr. Schulman said he would like to see co-sponsored by the county for presentation to the state, which will provide most of the funds for the project, the point is made that the arterial was planned with "efficient motor-vehicle access" to the transportation center in White Plains in mind.
The area includes the White Plains station of Metro-North, the county's Bee-Line bus system, a long-distance bus station and a taxi center. Easy access to the Grove Street extension "is desirable," the memo states, "to foster increased usage of mass transportation."

HEADLINE: Art Advocates Troop to Albany to Seek a Piece of the Pie

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
AS thick as the fog rising from the melting snow, the lobbyists arrive here each March, bringing their fact sheets and well-honed pleas. Heeding the maxim, "Those who don't ask, don't get," they swarm through the state capital at budget time.
Among the recent throngs were advocates of the arts from Westchester County, who took part in a day of campaigning sponsored by the Alliance of New York State Arts Councils, based in Spring Valley. Vying for elevator space with American Legionnaires, 4-H clubbers and a host of others, they made the rounds of legislative offices, asking members of the Westchester delegation to the capital to approve more spending for the arts. 
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed $1.5 million more for the New York State Council on the Arts in next year's budget, which legislators say they expect to complete well before the April 1 deadline. Arts advocates are asking for an additional $6 million for the council, which would bring its total for "local assistance" projects statewide to $34 million -- still only about 62 percent of the peak total, in 1989, of $54.8 million. This year's total is $26.5 million.
The 11 county advocates, who included members of the Westchester Arts Council and its affiliates and several school arts coordinators, also came to ask for money for Arts Excel, the Westchester Arts Council's education program. The Westchester council must raise funds to match a $250,000 grant from the state council for the three-year program.
The advocates came ready to sell, but it seemed the legislators were already sold.
 
'The Arts Equal Jobs'
 "I know, the arts equal jobs," said Senator George E. Pataki, Republican of Peekskill, appearing cornered at the far end of a conference table in his office. Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council, was holding up fact sheets printed in oversize letters. "Funds Generated to New York State from the Arts: $2.2 Million," one sheet seemed to scream.
The Senator nodded agreeably. "You don't have to surprise me," he said. "We have to spend more on education, our correctional system and the arts. The arts in Peekskill have changed the real-estate market and the commercial market. It works. Period."
Lobbyists must often settle for a legislative aide, and the arts advocates almost did not see Mr. Pataki. After 10 minutes of discussion with Sandra Sloane, one of Mr. Pataki's aides, about why increased spending for the arts was important, a wilted-looking Ms. Langsam whispered something to one of her staff members, Joanne Mongelli. She in turn whispered something to Ms. Sloane, who went to get the Senator.
Once he was seated, Ms. Langsam warmed to her opportunity. "The arts in Westchester more than pay their way," she said, standing for emphasis.
"I know," Mr. Pataki said, calling himself "one of the many arts friends you have in the Senate" before leaving for another meeting.
Assemblywoman Cecile D. Singer, Republican of Yonkers, also called herself a friend of the arts. Exuding the warmth and naturalness that is her trademark, she spoke to the county group in the elegant lobby of the Assembly chambers. "There can be no adequate education without the arts," she told the advocates. "I support everything in the county."
 
Personal Enthusiasm
 Ms. Singer can often be seen at concerts at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College and has arranged for student musicians from Hoff-Barthelson Music School in Scarsdale to perform at centers for the elderly in her district. No one in the advocacy group questioned her personal enthusiasm for the arts.
But Ms. Singer, a Republican, also said that Saul Cohen, a Westchester resident who that day was elected to a five-year term as a regent of the State University, was eminently qualified for a top education post. Yet she was one of a handful of legislators who voted against him and the second new regent, R. Carlos Carballadi, at a rare joint session of the Senate and Assembly.
She supported the regents as individuals but voted on principle against the institution of the Board of Regents, she later explained to the arts advocates, who watched the proceedings from the balcony of the Assembly chamber. The advocates did not ask Ms. Singer what principle might keep her from voting against an increased arts budget, but in a telephone interview she later said she would vote against the budget if it did not include more school aid for Yonkers.
Mr. Pataki, who officially announced his candidacy for Governor last week, also voted against the two new Regents. (He is a sponsor of a bill to abolish the Regents altogether.)
The joint session, which took the lobbyists by surprise, nearly spoiled the trip, because it disrupted their schedule of meetings with the legislators. But Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat of Scarsdale, saved the day, not only inviting the group to observe the session but also rounding up county members of the Assembly to meet with them outside the chamber afterward.
 
All This and Jobs, Too
 The impromptu meeting -- which included all seven of Westchester's Assembly members -- resembled a huddle, as the legislators and the constituents stood elbow to elbow in a circle. During the animated discussion, there appeared to be full agreement that the arts are worth supporting, that they bring increased tax revenues to the county, that they keep elderly people stimulated and that they are essential in the schools.
"And they create jobs," Ms. Langsam added, hammering away at the economics, as she had done unflaggingly all day.
It fell to a legislator to sound a different note, one that had been conspicuously unheard. "I believe there is an intrinsic value to the arts" that shouldn't be overlooked, Mr. Brodsky said. Assemblywoman Naomi C. Matusow, a Democrat of Mount Kisco, who Ms. Langsam said had emerged, along with Mr. Brodsky, as one of the strongest arts proponents in the Westchester delegation, spoke about the arts as a bonus for the county. "We should make it possible for people to participate," she said.
The way to do that, Ms. Langsam said, was for the delegation to give the Westchester Arts Council money for Arts Excel and for capital improvements at sites like Caramoor in Katonah and Lyndhurst in Tarrytown. Mr. Brodsky balked at this, saying there was "a tradition of not financing organizations two years in a row." Last year, Arts Excel received a total of $40,000 in aid from Albany.
Repeating that this was "not a policy, but a tradition," Mr. Brodsky mused aloud about where the money might come from, starting to say something about nickel deposits on bottles. "We don't care where you get it, Richard," Ms. Langsam said half jokingly. "We just want the money!"
In the morning, the advocates had visited Senators Joseph L. Galiber, Democrat of the Bronx; Guy J. Velella, Republican of Yonkers, and Suzi Oppenheimer, Democrat of Rye, spending more time thanking Ms. Oppenheimer for her support than on persuasion.
Ms. Langsam said she was also meeting regularly with the lawmakers back home, usually at various cultural sites in their own districts.
"Our advocacy effort is year-round, not a single day in Albany," she said. She promised to "keep meeting with these people until the budget is adopted."
"I consider that my job," she said. "To get money for the arts."
 
Evaluating the Day
 When the long hours of trekking through the marble halls and endless corridors of the capitol were over, and the group was ready for the minibus trip home, the advocates took time out to evaluate their day.
"They seem to be making the arts a priority," Rita Weingarten, a Westchester Arts Council trustee, said of the legislators.
Others spoke of having given a human face to the dollars allotted for arts projects.
In a telephone interview later, Mr. Brodsky said the arts lobby had grown more effective in recent years. "The arts have come to recognize that what's important is how people vote," he said.
"Their political sensibilities have gotten toughened up over the years, and I think that's great."
Ms. Singer said it was vital for groups to come to Albany to plead their cause at budget time. "By not being here, you cede the field to all the other people," she said. "It's critically important to be a presence and get a piece of the pie."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Market Message: Business Up, Bonds Down

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE economy is growing nicely, and higher interest rates present little threat to that growth.
That, in any case, seems to be the opinion of the financial markets. Six weeks after the Federal Reserve's Friday frolic, in which both stock and bond markets plunged on news of a small increase in one short-term interest rate, the bond market continues to quake, and interest-sensitive stocks are also weak. 
 But at the same time, the small stock indexes are setting records. Last week the Russell 2000, the best indicator of small stock performance, rose every day and broke through the record it had set just before the Fed's move on Feb. 4. The Nasdaq composite also set a record.
To be sure, the more widely followed stock indexes remain in the doldrums, having recovered less than half of the losses they sustained following the Fed move. The Dow Jones industrial average remains 2.1 percent below its recent high, and the Standard & Poor's 500 is still 2.3 percent below its peak. More significantly, the Dow Jones utility average is off 19.6 percent from its peak, reached last September. It has plunged 8 percent since the Fed's surprise.
The popular perception of small stocks is of emerging growth stocks. There are some, of course, but they don't dominate the group. "There are some very boring companies," says Satya Pradhuman, a senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch who studied the universe of small stocks and discovered that it has a larger proportion of cyclical issues than does the Standard & Poor's 500. And the world of small stocks has a much larger proportion of companies that benefit from capital spending.
What the small stock world does not have is a lot of defensive stocks, the type with good dividends. And if you were valuing a stock for its dividend payout, you are no doubt less eager now that interest rates have zipped up. In the six weeks since the Fed move, which the folks in Washington hoped would raise short-term rates while perhaps lowering long-term ones, the rates on three-month Treasury bills have climbed about one-third of a percentage point, while the rates on five-year bonds have leaped by four-fifths of a point. Perhaps that is what led President Clinton to have his little chat with Alan Greenspan on Friday.
We don't know what happened at the meeting. But what Mr. Greenspan might have said is that the economy is doing just fine, thank you, and the rise in interest rates is a sign that loan demand is finally starting to pick up a bit, as businesses grow more confident about demand for their products. The smaller stocks, more likely as a group to benefit from a stronger economy, are sending out a signal that would please the Administration, if it were not so fixated on interest rates.
Stock market history shows that an unfriendly Fed is eventually fatal to bull markets, but that effect can take a long time. In the interim, it is quite possible that good earnings will carry share prices higher, even if the bond market continues to dip every time Mr. Greenspan is seen in public.

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring 

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Michigan Rewrites the Textbook on School Financing
Any list of today's fashionable political ideas has to include these: property taxes are too high, discrepancies in districts' school budgets are unfair and cigarettes are an easy target for higher taxes. In Michigan last week, the three ideas converged with a vengeance. Shattering the traditional method of financing public education, the state voted to shift most of the burden from property taxes to sales taxes. It will also triple the cigarette tax, to 75 cents a pack, to help pay the bills. Together, these taxes will raise about $2 billion. A key goal of the plan is to smooth out the disparities among school districts. The poorest now pay $3,200 per student each year, while the richest pay $10,400 (that's nothing compared with New York, though, where the high is close to $46,000). Each district will now get at least $4,200, and wealthy districts will face spending limits. Other states are probably watching carefully; 28 of them are in the midst of lawsuits involving the redistribution of school aid. 

The Endless Inflation Vigil
So much talk, so little inflation. The inflation cops keep crying wolf, the markets keep recoiling in dread, but the wolf just isn't there. At the risk of sounding like a stuck compact disk, here's the latest: inflation's still in check. February price data, out last week, showed a 0.5 percent gain at the producer level and just 0.3 percent for consumers. And even that gain was propelled by high energy demand during this nasty winter (which ends today!). Interest rates fell on this news, but, inevitably, were spooked again on Friday when Alan Greenspan was summoned to the White House -- to some, an ominous sign, since the Fed's interest-rate panel meets this Tuesday. Anybody see a wolf this time?
 
Cuomo Wants Those Nickels
When budgets get tight, many people turn to bottle deposits for a few extra nickels, and Gov. Mario Cuomo is no exception. In what one critic calls a "political obsession," he has long coveted all those nickels that pile up when bottles and cans are not returned -- an estimated $70 million each year in New York State. Last week he stepped up the battle, saying he'd use subpoenas to audit the beverage industry's books. The industry says it needs the extra money to set up redemption centers, but Mr. Cuomo just calls it "a rip-off."
 
One World, One Job Crisis
Jobs were on President Clinton's mind last week, and he had his sights far beyond our borders, far above the low-wage jobs now abundant. At a jobs conference in Detroit, he challenged the Group of Seven industrial nations to create "a high-wage, high-growth society." Among his specific messages was a call on Japan to stimulate its economy and a call on Europe to lower its interest rates. And he urged all the nations to focus on retraining and productivity. His clear message: unemployment, and underemployment, are global problems. No nation can stand apart.
 
Get Your Dirty Air Here!
To all the things that are swapped and bartered in our national bazaar, we can now add dirty air. The Clean Air Act of 1990 authorized a market in "pollution credits" -- a utility that finds it too costly to clean up to meet the law can buy from another the right to be dirty. Last week two utilities decided to try it out. Public Service Electric and Gas, of New Jersey, will cut emissions more than it has to, and Northeast Utilities, of Connecticut, will buy some of the credits. But this is better than a zero-sum game, merely shifting smog state to state. For one thing, some credits will be retired, a net gain for the air. And because of the air flow, more smog will be sent out to sea. Finally, the deal shifts more pollution to winter, when smog's less of a problem.
 
Paying to Stay in the Jet Set
If a highway is built next to a city, the city can be pretty sure the road will be there a while -- and plan its dreams accordingly. But air travel is more slippery. The jittery airlines are fickle these days, adding routes, dropping routes, in a constant fine-tuning. So just because you've got an airport doesn't mean airlines will keep coming. With such uncertainty, how is a medium-size city to lure businesses? When Amarillo, Tex., learned recently that American Airlines planned to drop jet service to Dallas, the city chipped in $1 million to guarantee American a profit on those flights if it gets to keep the jets. Now, all the airlines have to do is get these guarantees from every city they fly to, and their troubles will be over.
 
COMPANIES
 
In Paramount's Hot Seat
During that endless takeover battle, Paramount began to look like a magic carpet that would whisk the victor to a land of untold riches. Just think what now faces the person assigned to run it -- there'll be some powerful pressure to deliver on that promise. Having decided that it would not be Stanley Jaffe, the president, last week Viacom picked the person for that hot seat: Jonathan Dolgen, president of the Sony Motion Picture Group, who will head what's to be called the Viacom Entertainment Group. Mr. Dolgen is little known outside the industry, but within it he is widely respected. And it's probably a signal of what Viacom wants from the studio that what Mr. Dolgen is known for is being a tough negotiator -- and a fierce cost-cutter.
 
Kemper, Defiantly Single
Kemper was awfully huffy in its formal rejection of GE Capital's takeover bid last week. "Attend to your own business," it urged. "And allow us the same courtesy." GE Capital wants to make a bigger splash in mutual funds, and it sees Kemper as its ticket. But Kemper wants none of it. Or, some say, it merely wants a higher price -- even though the $55-a-share offer was a hefty premium. That $55 sounds good to shareholders, though, some of whom are already suing Kemper for its handling of the offer. And if GE Capital walks away in its own huff, a move sure to send Kemper's stock plunging, shareholders will be certain to storm the barricades.
 
Rich Rewards at Chrysler
If a company prospers, it makes sense to reward those who made it happen. Chrysler has done spectacularly, so it more than tripled the bonuses for top executives, including its chairman, Robert J. Eaton. But it was vehicles like the Dodge Ram and the LH sedans that fueled the comeback, and, as Mr. Eaton himself points out, they were already in the works when he arrived two years ago. No matter. Mr. Eaton's '93 bonus soared to $1.9 million, putting his total pay at $6.79 million -- equal to the total salaries of perhaps 200 assembly-line workers. "Conspicuous, excessive compensation," the U.A.W. said. "It sends the wrong message to workers."
 
Empire: Adding It All Up
New York's Insurance Department added up the facts about Empire Blue Cross in a report out last week, and it wasn't a pretty picture. Managers did just about everything, the report said, to mislead examiners -- denying there were two sets of books, withholding profit data, distorting figures.
 
At Fleet, No Job Is Safe
When a company hacks away at its work force, no one, it seems, is exempt -- not even those doing the hacking. Fleet Financial recently said it was cutting 5,500 jobs, and one executive who planned this cutback was Edward Devin, senior vice president for human resources. Last week, Mr. Devin was laid off.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Cashing In on Scarce Hondas
It makes an awfully good case for free markets: If you create an artificial shortage of something people crave, you can be sure the scoundrels will find a way to cash in on this distorted market. In the 80's, before Detroit figured out how to make cars people liked, everyone wanted a Honda, but Honda imports were limited under voluntary quotas. So Honda executives in the United States seized on this opportunity, prosecutors say, taking more than $10 million in kickbacks from dealers, who, if they got extra cars, could easily sell them well above sticker price. Last week the indictments came in, and eight former Honda executives pleaded guilty. A lot of people clearly overpaid for Hondas to feed this little game, but their complaints will have to be heard another day.
 
A Rescue for Euro Disney
For the moment at least, Euro Disney is alive -- if not exactly kicking up its heels. The losses piled up so steadily for a while that it started to look like a scene from "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" -- bucket after relentless bucket of bad news. In December, Walt Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, said it was even possible that the French outpost might close. But last week, after months of haggling, Euro Disney worked out a deal with Disney -- which owns 49 percent of Euro Disney -- and its creditor banks, giving it more than $1 billion in new capital. But everyone knows the formula has to change: the park lost nearly that much in its first year of operation.
 
More Trouble for Mexico
Mexico has stabilized greatly since President Salinas took office in 1988. The Government tamed runaway 150 percent inflation to 8 percent, and the economy expanded steadily. But on Jan. 1, when the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, the Chiapas uprising spread uncertainty through the land, and stocks soon started sliding. To top it off, new figures show that Mexico actually dipped into recession in late 1993. The Government went too far, some say, in squashing inflation.

HEADLINE: For Oil Industry, That Next 'Elephant' Proves Elusive

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
MOBIL executives thought they had a live one about two years ago. The geology looked promising for a major oil find in Peru. After long haggling over environmental concerns and hauling equipment into a remote area, the well was sunk.
"I mean this was classic -- this is the classic way of how to do it," recalled Lucio A. Noto, chairman of the Mobil Corporation. Yet, "We came up with a dry well -- $35 million later." 
 Such stories abound in the industry. Despite intense drilling and huge spending in many places in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa, oil companies have not made many big strikes.
This lack of new discoveries could ultimately lead to an increase in the price of oil. While an oil surplus has driven down prices and has weakened the pricing power of OPEC, renewed economic growth in many countries is making the world hungry for oil again. And only the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has the huge oil reserves to meet the increased demand.
With that kind of power, OPEC will be in a better position to control the price of oil, just as it did so dramatically in the 1970's. That is comforting to the OPEC ministers as they gather this week for a meeting in Vienna.
It's not that the major oil companies aren't trying. ARCO drilled 13 wells and spent $163 million in Alaska in 1993, but it came up with only modest finds. British Petroleum made a large discovery in 1992 in Colombia, which for a while had the industry anticipating an "elephant field," but that field fell short and there has been little to crow about since. The last huge oil discovery was made in the North Sea in the late 1960's.
"Whatever discoveries have been made, they have been smaller," said Constantine Fliakos, the oil analyst for Merrill Lynch. Nothing has approached the fields of the North Sea, which have reserves of about 13 billion barrels, and Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, at about 10 billion barrels.
As a result, many oil companies have moved their exploratory efforts to places where they have already found a lot of oil, like the North Sea, or are confident that a lot of oil exists, like the nations that were once part of the Soviet Union, as well as China, Vietnam and Venezuela.
"In the 1980's they spent a hell of a lot of money and a hell of a lot of time looking in funny places," said Bill Cline, an oil economist for Gaffney, Cline & Associates in London. "It didn't work out. Now we are seeing a refocusing to areas where we know there is oil."
The surge of oil from Alaska and the North Sea put OPEC on the defensive in the 1980's and cut its share of world oil production from more than 50 percent in the 1970's to about 30 percent in 1985. Since then OPEC's share of the market has rebounded to 43 percent.
THE OPEC ministers are expected this week to weigh whether to continue production at 24.5 million barrels a day, or to cut back further to raise oil prices, which have shown little resiliency.
Whatever their action, many industry experts think that despite OPEC's largely passive role and a surge in oil from non-OPEC areas, the fundamentals have not changed for the organization.
For one thing, the lack of major finds has kept the OPEC nations with about 77 percent, or 770 billion barrels, of the world's proven reserves, according to a recent survey by British Petroleum.
"The current low prices are masking OPEC's long-term strength," said John H. Lichtblau, the head of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a consulting group to the energy industry. The price of crude oil for April delivery closed at $14.88 per barrel on Friday, down from about $20 last spring.
BUT OPEC first has to deal with some short-term problems. The surge of oil coming from the North Sea, which is expected to reach an extra million barrels a day by the end of the year, is adding to the world oil surplus of a few hundred thousand barrels a day, and is keeping prices depressed.
The ability of oil companies to squeeze out more production from mature fields by using new technology has also added to the surplus.
The expected re-entry of Iraq into the oil market once the United Nations embargo is lifted, which is expected this year, could force the OPEC countries to cut production further to absorb the million barrels a day Iraq is expected to produce.
Combined with recessions in some big consuming countries, these trends have kept oil prices down.
Nevertheless, the ability of the organization to push up prices is still there. If Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and a member of OPEC, should decide to support a major cut in production, prices will rise, most analysts and economists agree. Thus far, Saudi Arabia has been unwilling to significantly reduce its output. The Saudi position, which has led to reduced revenues for the OPEC nations as the price of oil has fallen, has prevented the organization from acting.
But that stalemate should not lull consuming nations into thinking that the organization has lost its influence.
As demand for oil increases, the OPEC nations are the only ones with the reserve capacity to meet that demand. That capacity is estimated at about 10 percent of the 25 million barrels a day OPEC pumps.
Meanwhile, production in some major areas, such as the United States, is continuing to decline. That creates more demand for OPEC oil. In the United States, domestic crude oil production continued to plunge, falling to less than 6.9 million barrels a day in 1993, the lowest level since 1958.
"The fundamentals are shifting in their favor," Mr. Fliakos, the Merrill Lynch analyst, said. "Oil demand has been flat for the past four years, but there is a major recovery under way."
With economies beginning to grow again in much of Asia, India and China, and with a strong recovery in the United States, he said, the demand for oil is expected to grow by 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year. Even if demand grows by just 2 percent, he said, that would add about 1.5 million barrels a day to consumption, enough to soak up the surplus and put OPEC back in a strong position.
"The added demand has to come from OPEC," he added. "They are the only ones that can produce the additional oil that the world is going to need."
As demand recovers, the United States Geological Survey has forecast that OPEC's share of the market will grow from the current 43 percent to about 50 percent by 2010, making it even more dominant.
At the same time, the chances of oil companies finding the elephant fields that could cut into OPEC's share have become slimmer as they have shifted exploration into areas where they have already found oil, such as the North Sea.
The wild cards in this scenario are the former states of the Soviet Union, including Russia and Kazakhstan, where major oilfields exist and the potential of finding more is very high.
BUT the drilling there is still many years away for most companies, like Mobil, the Chevron Corporation and the Amoco Corporation. They plan to invest billions of dollars in new exploration in the former Soviet Union, but they are still working out agreements with highly unstable governments.
Meanwhile, the prospect of finding elephant fields elsewhere has dwindled.
Between 1981 and 1987, the 18 largest oil companies in the United States pulled out of many areas where oil deposits are promising but unproven. Spending for exploration declined from $14.3 billion to $5.6 billion during those years. Since then, the oil companies have been spending between $5 billion and $7 billion on exploration each year.
The Exxon Corporation, for example, did extensive exploration in Somalia, Mali, Tanzania, Mozambique, Chad, Nigeria and Morocco in the early 1980's. Now it is only in Chad and Nigeria. The Royal Dutch/Shell Group has pulled out of Madagascar and Guatemala, and has shifted much of its effort to the North Sea.
"Most places we're going into, by and large the governments are very receptive to having us come in," said Paul J. Hoenmans, the executive vice president for worldwide exploration and producing at Mobil. "American technology still is the leader. It is to Houston and Dallas that the world looks."
He said the oil companies could eventually find huge fields "by applying the new technology in the new areas and avoiding some of the mistakes we've made in the past by just setting out at random to search for oil."
 
 
 
CHEVRON'S LONG ROAD IN KAZAKHSTAN
 THERE is a sea of oil below the flat windswept desert of Kazakhstan, about 25 billion barrels, making it one of the largest oilfields in the world.
But Chevron is getting just a trickle out of the ground. And the oil it is getting is laden with poison and has a stench, making it difficult to handle and transport.
What could turn out to be a bonanza for Chevron remains as elusive as the nomadic horsemen who occasionally appear outside the barracks of the 3,500 workers who are helping Kazakhstan restore its shattered oil industry.
It may be many years before oil flows in large enough quantities to make a joint venture between Tengizchevroil, the state oil company, and Chevron pay off. Chevron figures the partnership will spend about $20 billion over 40 years. By 2010, the partnership hopes to be pumping 700,000 barrels a day, bringing in about $4 billion in revenue a year at today's oil prices.
Chevron has shifted its exploration from areas abroad where oil reserves are promising but unproven, and from mature fields in the United States to known fields, such as Tengiz in Kazakhstan. The challenge is not whether oil will be found, but how to get large quantities out of existing wells and ship the oil to world markets. After seven years, and after spending more than $300 million, Chevron is producing only about 30,000 barrels a day, although that is expected to grow to about 130,000 barrels soon.
Tengiz is a paradox. Its crude oil, the color of light honey, is perfect for gasoline. But it is also full of poisonous hydrogen sulfide, which must be removed at a special plant. Workers undergo safety training and carry gas masks.
The oil is also full of mercaptans, sulfur compounds that can cause a stench in the countryside if they leak from the pipeline. To be commercially viable, the crude must be transported through Russia, but the Russians limit shipments of the Kazakh oil in their pipelines because they don't have a recovery system to contain the vapors.
The partners want to build their own pipeline, at a huge cost, but there is a problem with where to build it. If it is connected to the existing Russian system, Chevron and its partner will remain hostage to expensive transport fees. Other routes would take it through risky areas, like Iran and Iraq.
While production has been restored at about 20 of the 85 wells originally drilled when Kazakhstan was part of the Soviet Union, oil from just 10 can be shipped because of the transport restrictions.
The multinational work force is made up mostly of Kazakhs, but there are many Russians, Hungarians and Americans.
The 250 workers from the United States are learning to live with the harsh conditions, where temperatures can reach 130 in summer and 40 below zero in winter. The wind blows powdery sand, making mouths gritty and contact lenses uncomfortable.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Betting the Bull Market Is Finished

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
THE sky is falling! The sky is falling! But Chicken Little and other mutual fund investors won't be hurt at all if they invest in two new bear market funds, say managers of the Robertson Stephens Contrarian and Lindner Bulwark funds.
The funds use antipodal approaches to a financial markets meltdown: Robertson Stephens aims to profit; Lindner seeks to preserve capital. 
 Even so, the funds are very risky because their managers can invest almost any way they want. "It's blind pool," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds in Chicago. "I'm skeptical."
"We created the equivalent of a public hedge fund," said Paul Stephens, who runs the Contrarian fund in San Francisco. Hedge funds usually have very high minimums -- $250,000 to $10 million or more -- and use leverage, short sales and other risky investment methods to profit in good markets and bad.
Contrarian, however, is constrained by mutual fund laws that prevent managers from taking too much risk. For instance, the fund cannot invest more than 25 percent in one industry or take short positions in more than a quarter of its assets.
But Mr. Stephens still has a fairly wide berth, and he has been making the most of it, with Contrarian's short positions nearly at the maximum. "I'm very bearish on the stock and bond markets," he said.
So far, more than a handful of investors have agreed. The fund, which started last June with $5 million, now has $345 million.
About 22 percent of Contrarian is in short positions right now, but Mr. Stephens refuses to disclose the companies' names "because they would stop doing business with us." He will say that the 50 short positions include "nearly every tea and soft drink company, restaurants, mortgage banking, overpriced tech stocks and almost all the public mutual fund companies."
Another 5 percent is invested in S.& P. put options, a bet that the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index will drop.
The fund is mostly invested in gold and other commodities stocks because the gradually rising inflation that Mr. Stephens predicts over the 90's "will be commodity driven, not wage driven," he said.
In particular, he likes what he calls "growth gold" companies, mining companies that should be able to post profits by increasing their reserves even if the price of gold stays flat. Most are Canadian companies with explorations outside Canada. Among the largest he owns today are Cambior and Golden Star Resources.
The fund's biggest holding is Santa Fe Pacific, which Mr. Stephens calls a "hidden gold company" because of its large gold operation.
Six percent of the fund is invested in three aluminum companies: Alumax, Kaiser Aluminum and Maxxam, which owns shares of Kaiser and Pacific Lumber.
Another 6 percent is invested in real estate stocks, mostly companies that have holdings in Texas, California and Florida. The largest, accounting for 2.5 percent of the fund, is Avatar in Florida; next biggest is Catellus in California.
Contrarian's charter allows it to invest entirely abroad. Only about a third is invested outside the United States today, but that should increase over the next three years, Mr. Stephens said.
Potential investors should heed Mr. Stephens's warning: the biggest risk for the fund is if the market's future performance is strong. "We've made the bet that the bull market is over," he said.
Some analysts think that's a bad bet, among them Ken Gregory, editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst in San Francisco. But, he added, Mr. Stephens is a "successful investor who may well generate good returns even without his disaster scenario unfolding." One hurdle will be Contrarian's unusually high expenses, which equal more than 2.5 percent annually of the amount invested.
The $1.9 million Lindner Bulwark Fund was started in February. Although its charter is similar to Contrarian's -- heavy investments in precious metals, short sales, options and futures -- its aim is radically different.
"It's a capital preservation fund" designed to perform when the equity and fixed-income markets are declining, said Larry Callahan, the fund's lead manager.
Like Contrarian, Bulwark grew out of the concern over the outsized gains of the financial markets. It was conceived, Mr. Callahan said, "for people who feel that now is the wrong time to invest but want to do something for their future."
The fund will invest in undervalued stocks as opportunities arise, but "at this point in the market, we don't see a whole lot of buying opportunities in individual stocks," Mr. Callahan said. Right now the fund is only 20 percent invested, mostly in shares of C.P.T., the Peruvian telephone company, and two Canadian gold companies, Wharf Resources and Hemlow Gold. No shorts, yet.
The high cash position is not unreasonable, Mr. Callahan said; as much as 60 percent of the fund could regularly be in cash when no buy opportunities exist.
Bulwark's expenses are more reasonable than Contrarian's, at 1.4 percent of assets annually, but that's still a high price for what may amount to a money market fund, almost 60 percent of which charge no fees.

HEADLINE: In Scolding China, Washington Loses Face

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In August 1944, John S. Service, a career diplomat then acting as political officer to the United States Army's observer group in Yanan, had a lengthy conversation with Mao Zedong. The defeat of the Axis powers was in sight, and Mao was thinking of how to build a new China once the war ended. He told Service he would be willing to go to Washington and discuss future Chinese-American relations with President Roosevelt. He never received a reply. 
 Coolness became overt hostility when the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in 1951. The United States Seventh Fleet plied the strait separating Taiwan from the mainland. The United States imposed an economic embargo against China and pressured its major trading partners to do the same. Guns were fired in anger just on the other side of Chinese borders, in Korea, then in Vietnam. China felt threatened. During the Korean War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur boasted his troops would be "over the Yalu by Christmas."
The effect was to thrust China into the arms of the Soviet Union, which proved very bad for China and created serious consequences for the United States. The lesson was not lost on Washington. Friendly relations with China were obviously in America's best interests. Starting with the visit by President Richard M. Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1972, the climate improved, followed by extensive commercial activities fueled by China's economic boom.
But cold war warriors die hard. Though small in number, they are vociferous. Their favorite weapon is alleged violations of "human" rights. Against Asian nations this proves to be not a spear but a boomerang.
The Chinese have a strong sense of dignity and propriety. They think it presumptuous for a mere infant of a country, historically speaking, to tell a sovereign state 10 times its age and possessed of a highly cultured civilization, how to live. China has its own Constitution and a body of laws guaranteeing internationally recognized civil rights, including the right to a decent livelihood. The Chinese consider specious the argument that economic well-being is only a "social," not a "human" right. They believe democracy cannot survive on an empty stomach, any more than a full stomach can supplant democracy. They want both, simultaneously.
While most Chinese will admit to some failings in the protection of their civil rights, they insist that interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation is a violation of international law. Moreover, they claim to be competent to deal with such problems themselves.
In any event, the Chinese are well aware of America's military incursions into little countries abroad and its miserable civil rights record at home. They witnessed the beating of Rodney King on their television news. They read in their newspapers about American jails overflowing with prisoners -- mostly black. Their daily press gives wide coverage to United States crime, drugs, poverty, homelessness, graft and corruption. Such a country, the Chinese maintain, is not fit to talk about violations of citizen rights in other lands. America is lacking in moral authority.
And now, to heap absurdity on cant, the statements of visiting American politicians and trade negotiators make it apparent that they care nothing about Chinese rights, whether labeled "human" or "civil." They promise to tone down their slanders immediately, if only the Chinese will grant them more economic concessions. That is the name of the game.
America's human rights razzle-dazzle has brought loss of face and less respect for American policy makers in China, and Asia in general. The Chinese made it clear to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his delegation that China will not accept "linkage." It is time Washington stopped the fruitless gesturing and got on with genuine, mutually beneficial, business.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
For the Presidents, The Polls Are Irresistible

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY 

 BODY:
CARTER had his Caddell and Reagan his Wirthlin. And for every President of the last 50 years, there have been polls to provide political intelligence.
Franklin D. Roosevelt indeed recognized the possibilities that arose with the beginning of modern public opinion polling in the late 1930's. F.D.R. encouraged Hadley Cantril of Princeton University, a pioneer in the academic use of polling, to periodically gauge public sentiment about increasing aid to England, changing the Neutrality Law and adopting the policy that became Lend-Lease. In 1940 and early 1941, the charts Professor Cantril provided showed a public initially reluctant, subsequently divided, and then progressively supportive of aiding England. 
 David W. Moore, in his book "The Superpollsters" (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1992), describes how more recent Presidents relied on their campaign pollsters after reaching the White House. Jimmy Carter had Patrick Caddell test support for various energy policies. After Ronald Reagan became President, Richard Wirthlin explored economic questions when Mr. Reagan's ratings dipped in the recession of the early 1980's, then sounded out public opinion on the nuclear freeze issue.
And Fred Steeper recalled in a telephone interview the extensive polling he did in the Bush years for the Republican National Committee -- polls of great interest to the White House -- on alternative types of spending cuts and tax increases.
But if Presidents have drawn on polls to anticipate public reaction, that's not to say any ever tailored his political principles to the computer printouts.
"As far as I am aware," Mr. Cantril wrote, "Roosevelt never altered his goals because public opinion appeared against him or was uninformed. Rather, he utilized such information to try to bring the public around more quickly."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
In 1994-Model Politics, Loyalty Is Often Optional Equipment

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
GLADSTONE said that the first requisite of a prime minister is to be a good butcher.
Like British leaders, American Presidents must know when they have reached the limits of loyalty, and be prepared to cut off troublesome friends and advisers, or persuade them to fall on the knife so obligingly held out. 
President Clinton has been sacrificing friends and advisers at a rather brisk pace since he came to town. From Lani Guinier to Les Aspin to Bernard Nussbaum to Webb Hubbell, Mr. Clinton has shown a willingness to part with those in whom he detects albatross tendencies.
So does this make Bill Clinton a smart politician who moves quickly to correct mistakes and protect his Presidency and his party, even if it is personally hard for him? Or does it make the President appear unsentimental and reluctant to fight for friends who are in trouble -- an image that is out of sync with his empathetic, lip-biting, share-your-pain persona?
The answer, as usual with Mr. Clinton, is all of the above.
Psychologists say that the way you exit a relationship can speak worlds about you, and Presidents are no exception. "This is one of the truest reflections of Presidential character," said Marlin Fitzwater, a spokesman for both Presidents Reagan and Bush. "Where you draw the line on loyalty, how you come down on questions about dropping people or sticking with them, are judgments so individual and personal that, in the end, the President has to make them by himself."
Loyalty was the principle George Bush held most dear, an old-fashioned view of friendship and obligation baked into him on the playing fields of Greenwich, Andover and Yale.
While Mr. Bush was admired for his steadfastness, it could be argued that this very quality led to his downfall. Even when many Republicans were yelping back in 1991 that the President was being badly served by his economic team -- Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, and Richard Darman, the budget director -- Mr. Bush tuned out all criticism.
He did send his son, George, to dismiss his fractious chief of staff, John Sununu in 1991, but it was only after Mr. Sununu had abused the perquisites of his office and alienated much of Washington.
President Bush's rigorous requirements for staff loyalty became crippling because he continually turned to mediocre Bush loyalists for top jobs over talented Republicans who had worked for his rivals.
He continued to let his old friends, James Baker, Fred Malek and Robert Teeter, run his 1992 campaign after it became abundantly clear that they were running it into the ground. Mr. Bush asked Mr. Baker to give up his cherished job as Secretary of State in 1992 and return to the role of political handler, which he despised. Mr. Baker said yes out of loyalty, but could not conceal his feeling that this was one favor too many, since he had helped make Mr. Bush President in the first place. His resentment, and his fear that he would be associated with a losing campaign, undermined his ability, and the handler once revered as "the Velvet Hammer" ended up so far behind the scenes as to be invisible.
What is surprising about Bill Clinton, given his hugging-and-sharing political style, is the absence of sentimentality when he cuts people loose.
The President, whose career was a triumph of baby boomer networking, has now shown the limits of such bonds. While it is nice, in this communitarian world, if everyone advances together, the Friends of Bill and Hillary now understand that their falling back does not prevent others from going forward.
"Yuppies don't have loyalty," noted William Kristol, the head of the Project for the Republican Future and an acidic Clinton critic. "They have useful relationships and meaningful encounters."
 
Before the Fall
 When Mr. Clinton abruptly dumped his old friend Lani Guinier, after it became clear that she would have a rough time being confirmed in a top civil rights post at the Justice Department, there were complaints, even among those who agreed with the decision, that the President had not handled it well.
Many Democrats, and many black leaders, argued angrily that the President had set up Ms. Guinier for a fall by ignoring all the red flags about the nomination from Capitol Hill, and by failing to read her more controversial articles before announcing the appointment. They felt that, once he had committed to her, he should have let her argue her case on the Hill; wasn't Mr. Clinton, after all, the "Comeback Kid" who thrived on steep odds and taking his case directly to the people?
What many people found most strange was that once Mr. Clinton dropped Ms. Guinier, he never called her again, not when they were both on vacation in Martha's Vineyard last summer, not in all the months since. Asked to explain why Mr. Clinton, who attended her wedding, has never gotten in touch, Ms. Guinier replied: "I've certainly thought about it a lot. I don't get it."
By contrast, the soft-hearted Mr. Bush not only stuck with beleaguered nominees, such as John Tower and Clarence Thomas, but when an appointment did blow up, he would make a point of trying to rehabilitate the reject with a dinner invitation or another job offer.
Another example is Les Aspin, the Secretary of Defense who got the ax. Even Democrats who agreed with the decision were angry that White House officials badmouthed the popular Mr. Aspin in background interviews. And Aspin loyalists were outraged by the suggestion that the President had dropped him once he found he was a poor administrator.
"If Bill Clinton didn't know Les ran a sloppy office, he was the only person in Washington who didn't," an Aspin crony said. "You hire Les to think, and he thought. That 'poor organizer' rap was just a cop-out."
Ms. Guinier said she agreed with a friend who had compared the political culture with the gang culture in the inner cities. "A sociopath can kill without remorse because he's conditioned by the environment to treat life with little respect as a way of gaining status in that environment," she said. "Now politicians are being trained by their environment to feel that in order to succeed, they have to be prepared to sacrifice friends and then move on."
Another Southern governor, Earl Long of Louisiana, once offered quite a different view of the nature of political loyalty.
When one of his aides said to him, "I'm with you when you're right, Governor, but not when you're wrong," Mr. Long retorted: "You stupid S.O.B., I don't need you when I'm right."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
North Korea, on Long Leash, Runs Circles Around Its Foes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
Say this about North Korea's leaders: They may be Stalinist fanatics, they may be terrorists, they may be building nuclear bombs, but they are not without subtlety. They have mastered the art of dangling Washington on a string.
Few international crises have brewed as long as the North Korean nuclear weapons project. Depending on how you count, it started 27 years ago. It has looked threatening -- first vaguely, then very -- for just shy of a decade. Yet at major milestones along the way, the West has always found reason for hope that Kim Il Sung, who is 81 and the world's longest surviving leader, was one step away from trading his nuclear ambitions for a way out of his country's economic wasteland. 
 There was hope in 1985, when he signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and hope again in 1991, when he finally obeyed the treaty's provisions and allowed international inspectors into the nuclear installations at Yongbyon. There was hope last June, when Mr. Kim's Government "suspended" a decision to become the first country to back out of the treaty, and a declaration of victory in December, when the Clinton Administration thought it had clinched a deal on inspections, in return for talks about aid and recognition.
Yet every time some last-minute glitch mocked the hopeful headlines. Last week came one of the biggest of all: After taking months to negotiate an inspection that would allow talks with the United States to go on, the North once again thwarted inspectors. On Saturday, its representatives walked out of talks with the South Koreans at Panmunjom, and threatened war if the United States and the South mounted a pressure campaign.
To many, such frustrations are the price of negotiating with the world's most impenetrable country. Others, from generals in Seoul to some of George Bush's national security officials, believe the Clinton Administration needs to dramatically toughen its approach.
"The United States has responded to every broken promise, every lie, every threat with the groundless optimism that tomorrow will be a better day," Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said last week. "It is time for North Korea to overcome our concerns or live with the consequences -- consequences that will hasten the collapse of that despicable regime."
Senator McCain represents one side in the endless sticks-or-carrots debate on how to deal with the North, but the chronology that appears below suggests that Washington's biggest problem has been the time it took to engage the issue. "We have been watching and talking for 20 years when we should have been acting," said Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control and an author of the chronology.
 
'Asleep at the Switch'
 In the 1980's, the Reagan Administration did not pay much attention to Korea, and the Bush Administration, Mr. Milhollin argues, was "basically asleep at the switch." So was the North's perpetual enemy in Seoul. "From time to time we received reports, but it didn't catch us as a big threat at that moment," Lee Hong Ku, South Korea's unification minister until 1990, said in a recent interview. "Had we given a consistent and clear warning, perhaps the North Koreans would not have made such a big investment in it."
Since the world finally awoke, North Korea has used what Leonard Spector of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace calls salami tactics: "Every time they promise a slice, they actually give us half a slice."
But the fact is that, despite all the talk of sanctions and resuming military exercises, President Clinton's options are limited. He and his allies are as divided as ever about the wisdom of provoking a country with a mad-dog reputation and so much artillery so near Seoul. South Korea swings from one anxious extreme to another, one day fearful of pushing its enemy too far, the next day fretting that the United States won't be tough enough. Japan is equally cautious, and the Chinese are not in a mood to make life for Mr. Clinton any easier.
The architects of the West's strategy are a bit defensive, arguing that they have taken the only prudent course: Pursue every hope that the North's real goal is to trade away the bomb project for benefits that will help prop up the regime. If that is so, they point out, Mr. Kim has gotten nothing so far -- not a cent of aid or trade. "We're not backsliding," argues Han Sung Joo, South Korea's Foreign Minister. "Presumably we are paving the way for ultimate resolution of the issue -- although it is not clear if we can get there at this point."
The problem is that the North has its own logic; Mr. Kim has long seen nuclear weapons as the only equalizer with the West. He has given in to threats, but only a bit, and only enough to buy time. The shell game over inspections, the carefully maintained mystery about the bomb's existence, is the one asset he holds. And he is betting, probably rightly, that no one is willing to take the considerable risks to make sure Korea is nuclear-free.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
If Money Buys Good Schools, We Can Fix the Schools. If.

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
LAST week, when Michigan voters approved a radical change in public school financing, many were probably less concerned about the future of education than with their pocketbooks. The landmark plan, which is being watched closely by policy-makers in other states, will reduce property taxes by shifting the burden of school financing to sales and other taxes.
But educators will be watching another provision of the Michigan plan, which seeks to narrow the gap between rich and poor schools by guaranteeing each district a minimum of $4,200 a student -- $1,000 more than the least affluent districts get now. 
 The idea, of course, is to improve the educational prospects of poor students by giving their schools more money. But experts have learned over the years that spending more on a school doesn't necessarily mean that its students will learn more. From an economist's point of view, the connection between money and education is maddeningly unclear.
"We have a lot of studies that show little impact from spending," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "Then, too, we have a lot that show tangible benefits."
The debate dates from 1966, with the publication of an ambitious study of some 600,000 students in 3,000 schools by the United States Office of Education. The Coleman Report, as it came to be known (after John Coleman, who led the research team), concluded that it was attitudes of families and fellow students rather than the quality of schools that largely determined educational achievement.
For all the initial stir, however, the report did not inhibit spending. Eric Hanushek, an economist at the University of Rochester, estimates that per pupil outlays, adjusted for inflation, rose from about $2,700 to $4,900 from 1965 to 1989. Average class size fell from 25 to 18, while the proportion of teachers with a master's degree rose from a quarter to half and median teacher experience went from 8 to 15 years.
As widely bemoaned, however, American students' performance on a variety of tests (notably in mathematics) remained well behind those in countries that spent far less on schools. Scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test fell about 5 percent across the quarter-century.
To be sure, there are problems with correlating spending with test scores. For example, a disproportionate chunk of the extra education dollar in recent years has gone to government-mandated programs for the disabled. And the pool of students taking the S.A.T. has grown along with the proportion attending college, making comparisons of average test scores hard to interpret.
 
Evidence of Perverse Effects
 What is more, average pay in competing professions has gone up sharply with average productivity in the economy, presumably driving up the cost of hiring comparably qualified teachers. This effect has probably been magnified by the reduction in discrimination against women, who are now freer to compete for jobs in law, medicine and business. But in Mr. Hanushek's view, these and other factors are not decisive. He analyzed the results of 187 studies of the last two decades, many inspired by the Coleman Report, and found little confirmation that teacher credentials or class size influenced test scores. Indeed, there is almost as much evidence of perverse effects as positive ones.
That is hardly the last word on the subject, though. Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, argue that the ultimate output of public education isn't the ability to answer multiple-choice questions, but to earn a living. They took averages of teacher pay and class size, state by state, and then looked at the average earnings of workers educated in those states decades later. The cumulative results over a lifetime of work were striking: Mr. Krueger estimates that for each extra dollar spent on education, total annual wages rose by 10 cents -- a return on the investment of roughly 10 percent.
Confusing matters, Julian Betts, an economist at the University of California at San Diego, tried a variation on the Card-Krueger approach with very different results. He measured the impact of individual schools on a sample of 1,810 people in all 50 states. Neither class size, teacher pay nor teacher credentials seemed to make a consistent difference on earnings a decade later. Jeff Grogger, an economist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, found similar results: The standard measures of school quality accounted for little of the variation in wages between blacks and whites who went to high school in the early 1970's.
Statistical studies are always tricky to interpret. It requires a leap of faith -- sometimes unwarranted -- to infer cause and effect from statistical correlation. Some researchers have relied instead on something closer to a controlled experiment, in which children and teachers are randomly assigned to small and large classes and tested on various skills. The largest of these experiments, analyzed by Jeremy Finn of the State University of New York at Buffalo and Charles Achilles of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, involved some 6,500 kindergartners in Tennessee from a variety of social backgrounds. Students in small classes did better in both reading and math achievement, with the greatest differences seen among non-whites.
What is one to make of these contradictions?
Mr. Betts thinks the Card-Krueger study is seriously flawed because it lumps together data from whole states rather than focusing on individual schools. And Larry Hedges, a statistician at the University of Chicago, argues that Mr. Hanushek's analysis of the 187 earlier studies is far off the mark: Crank up the computer with a different set of assumptions about how to weight the results of the same studies and out pops the opposite conclusion.
Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton University who was once in charge of evaluating the Department of Labor's research efforts, believes that, done properly, further research along the lines of the Tennessee experiments might produce decisive results. "It's a scandal," he argues, "that education programs aren't held to the same standards as new drugs."
The one very real accomplishment of the continuing controversy has been to refine the terms of the debate. It is possible that societal changes in the 1980's, like the breakdown of the family, have simply overshadowed the positive effects of increased spending. It is also possible that money matters -- sometimes. Much early spending went, in response to court mandates, to people and places that were glaringly starved of educational resources -- rural, inner city and previously segregated black schools.
It may even be possible that money could matter more under the right circumstances. Experts on both sides of the debate agree that schools vary radically in their ability to translate dollars into better educated students. "Everybody knows the differences in school quality are there," said James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, "but nobody knows how to quantify them."
Albert Shanker, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, acknowledges that a good portion of the increase in real outlays per pupil over the last quarter-century has gone for naught because "nobody sat down and thought about how to spend it."

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL URGE U.N. TO PLAN SANCTIONS FOR NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration decided today to ask the United Nations to lay the groundwork for economic sanctions against North Korea as diplomatic efforts to persuade Pyongyang to end its nuclear program neared collapse, Administration officials said.
Cabinet-level officials met at the White House today to map out a strategy to compel North Korea to allow international monitors to complete their inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear sites. 
 Administration officials said later that Washington had decided to ask the Security Council to adopt a measure next week that would warn North Korea that economic sanctions will be imposed if inspections are not completed.
 
Agency Board Meets Monday
 Administration officials said the warning would be issued after the International Atomic Energy Agency, whose inspectors were rebuffed in visits to North Korean sites during the last week, formally meets to take up the issue. The agency's board of governors, which is scheduled to meet on Monday, is expected to declare that it can no longer certify that plutonium is not being diverted to build a bomb, and to demand that North Korea allow inspectors to finish their work. They are expected to refer the matter to the Security Council.
Administration officials said Washington plans to press the South Koreans to permit the deployment of Patriot anti-missile interceptors.
Unless the North Koreans abruptly change course and allow the inspections of the nuclear sites to be completed, Washington will also ask South Korea to agree to go forward with annual joint military exercises sometime later this year.
One senior official described today's decision as a milestone for the Administration, which has spent months trying to negotiate a solution with North Korea over the nuclear issue.
 
'Ratchet Up The Pressure'
 "We are going to go step by step to ratchet up the pressure," a senior Administration official said.
But with China reluctant to support economic sanctions and ties between Washington and Beijing severely strained, the prospects for winning Security Council support for tough measures against Pyongyang are uncertain at best.
The Administration's decision came hours after North Korean officials walked out of talks with South Korea representatives at Panmunjom, and threatened war if Washington and Seoul mounted a pressure campaign.
"Seoul will turn into a sea of fire," Park Young Su, the North Korean delegate said before abruptly ending the talks.
In seeking to build support at the United Nations for sanctions, the Administration's plan is to pursue a graduated set of measures to give North Korea time to change its stance and to persuade China to abstain on the issue of sanctions rather than wield its Security Council veto to prevent them.
One sanction that could be imposed quickly would be severing financial transfers from Japan to North Korea. Cutting off oil shipments to North Korea would be among the toughest measures the Council could enact and would take time to pursue.
By starting with a warning and then taking a gradual approach on sanctions, the Administration hopes to argue that it is giving North Korea time to change its stance and to persuade China to abstain rather than wield its Security Council veto to prevent sanctions.
The breakdown of the talks in Korea today capped months of laborious diplomacy in which a complex, step-by-step agreement to end a long standoff over the North's nuclear program was negotiated and then came unraveled.
The dispute began when North Korea last spring barred international inspectors from two nuclear waste sites and withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, reviving fears that it was continuing to develop nuclear weapons.
 
U.S. Pursued Talks
 The Administration responded with a diplomatic initiative meant to find areas of common ground.
Earlier this month, the State Department announced a breakthrough in which North Korea would allow inspections of seven officially disclosed nuclear sites -- but not the two waste sites that caused the initial suspicions -- and resume talks with South Korea meant to lead to an exchange of envoys.
In return, Washington and Seoul suspended for this year their joint military exercise and announced that high-level talks with North Korea would open on March 21.
But the diplomatic initiative began to unravel when North Korea blocked inspectors from the Atomic Energy Agency from taking some samples from their plutonium reprocessing plant at Yongbyong. Then the North Koreans broke off talks today with the South.
That left the Administration with a dilemma.
On one hand, Asian nations have avoided tough sanctions, fearing that the North might lash out militarily or that the measures might topple the Government of Kim Il Sung, leading to instability on the Korean peninsula. China's support for sanctions is particularly important since it is a member of the United Nations Security Council, supplies North Korea with much of its oil and has a long common border with North Korea.
 
Seoul Aide Opposes Sanctions
 Today, Zhang Tingyan, China's Ambassador to South Korea, argued against sanctions in an interview with the Yonhap news agency.
"It's an international rule now to solve all issues through dialogue," he said. "Why should the North Korean nuclear problem be an exception? China cannot agree to sanctions or any other stringent measures."
But while Asian nations have been urging Washington to go slow, the Administration has been buffeted by criticism from Republican lawmakers and former Bush Administration officials that it has not been forceful enough with the North Koreans.
Even Democrats like Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, were saying it was time to seek sanctions through the United Nations.
"The Clinton Administration is ending up in the right place," said Arnold Kanter, the Under Secretary of State for Policy in the Bush Administration. But Mr. Kanter said the Clinton Administration's reluctance to adopt a resolute take-it-or-leave-it stance during long months of negotiation had "undermined some of its credibility."
 
Leadership Faulted
 Some former officials also say the Administration has been too solicitous of the views of China and other Asian nations and has not adopted an effective leadership role.
Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser to President Bush, says Washington should make it clear to South Korea, Japan and China that the United States is prepared to take unilateral action if Asian nations do not support tough action.
Mr. Scowcroft has also said Washington should be ostentatiously building up its forces on the Korean peninsula to put pressure on Pyongyang and to keep open the possibility of a preemptive military strike against the North's nuclear installations.
But a senior Administration official rejected the criticism by former Bush Administration officials, charging that the problem of a nuclear North Korea "developed on the Bush Administration watch" and that an overly confrontational approach to solving it would backfire.
"To go it alone is foolish in the extreme," the Clinton Administration official said, asserting that it would be more effective if world powers showed a united face to the North. "I do not believe that chest-pounding and saber-rattling are the way to go."
Further fueling the debate is the uncertainty over what effect sanctions might have on the reclusive North Korean regime.
A comprehensive intelligence analysis of the North's nuclear program provided to the White House last year argued that sanctions would be unlikely to sway Kim Il Sung's Government, which might, for instance, simply choose to subject its citizens to new levels of privation.
 
Sanctions May Prompt Attack
 The intelligence assessment also warned that sanctions might prompt an attack by the North, which has said it will consider economic sanctions an act of war.
Because of that danger, the American military has insisted that steps be taken to bolster the readiness of troops in South Korea if sanctions were imposed, including the dispatch of the Patriot anti-missile interceptors. Gen. Gary E. Luck, the commander of American forces in Korea, told Congress that it would be important to send the Patriots if tensions heated up.
It takes many cargo flights to transport the missile batteries. General Luck wants to make sure that the available cargo planes would be free to move some of the 400,000 reinforcements that would be sent if a new Korean war broke out.

HEADLINE: Fretting Over Prospect of Losses, Democrats Plot Fall Campaigns

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Facing up to the near-certainty of major losses at every level in this year's midterm elections, Democrats are increasingly looking to passage of a health care bill this fall as their best hope for limiting the damage.
But even as they set to work to overhaul health care, President Clinton's top policy priority, Democratic candidates for the House, the Senate and governorships are more and more concerned about a spillover from the President's political troubles, particularly the Whitewater investigation. 
 The nervousness among Democrats is not simply prompted by their having more House and Senate seats to defend than the Republicans, and more governorships, or the historical pattern that the party in the White House pays the price in the next midterm election. There are several factors making their task tougher this year.
 
Many Incumbents Leave
 For one thing, the Democrats are losing a particularly high number of incumbents and having a hard time recruiting strong candidates to replace them. At the same time, those remaining in office face the same anti-incumbent anger that fueled Ross Perot's 1992 Presidential race. The danger signs are most pronounced in the Senate, where Democrats are bracing for hard-fought races in states where they now hold seats, including Arizona, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.
Few analysts predict that Republicans will pick up the seven seats needed to give them a Senate majority. But at the very least, most Democrats expect their working majority in the chamber to be eroded. That is a significant problem given the closeness of Mr. Clinton's victories on issues like the budget last year, which was rescued when Vice President Al Gore broke a tie in the Senate.
Complicating all this for the Democrats is the growing preoccupation in Washington over the investigation of the Clintons and the Whitewater affair. While polls show that the case has not greatly affected public attitudes toward the President or the Democratic Party, even party officials acknowledge that it has knocked them off stride.
 
Desertion and Unhappiness
 Already, the party chairman, David C. Wilhelm, sounds defensive when he warns Democratic candidates that it would not be in their best interest to distance themselves from the White House. That tactic was used by House Republicans who disavowed President George Bush after he broke his pledge of no new taxes before the 1990 election. (The Republicans lost eight seats that year, which was fewer than many in the party had predicted.)
While a President's coattails do not often extend to local races, those contests are a way for voters unhappy with the White House to vent their frustrations. A poor showing is also bound to be cast by Republicans as a referendum on Mr. Clinton and could weaken his influence with Congress.
So the Democrats are running scared. Charles Cook, editor of a political newsletter that analyzes elections, said the situation looked as dire for the Democrats as it was when they last lost control of the Senate -- when Ronald Reagan was elected 14 years ago.
"In 1980, there was always the suspicion that Democrats could get hammered, but it wasn't obvious that it was going to happen," Mr. Cook said. "Deep down nobody had any idea of the magnitude of the losses that would be suffered. There are more dark clouds on the horizon this time."
 
Long Time to Go
 November, of course, is a long way away, and the Democrats assert that they can weather Whitewater and other controversies that may lie ahead and demonstrate to voters that they can pass important legislation, like revisions of health care and welfare. They have also successfully begun to seize Republican issues like crime as their own.
No one can predict the forces that will come into play beyond partisan politics. A foreign policy crisis could affect the voting. And if the economy continues to rebound, that would probably do more for Democrats than any strategy from the White House or Democratic Party.
"There's no single factor that is as significant in 1994 as the state of the economy," said Senator Bob Graham of Florida, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
But in recent weeks, the party has seemed to suffer only setbacks: Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, unexpectedly announced that he would retire, giving Republicans a good shot at what was considered a safe Democrat seat. In Texas, the acquittal of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison on charges that she misused her office dashed the hopes of most Democrats that they would retake the seat that had been held by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
 
Huge House Turnover
 There is also great uncertainly among Democrats in the House because of the huge turnover in their ranks. More than 40 members, most of them Democrats, have already announced their retirements or plans to run for other offices. The pace is approaching that of two years ago, when there were an unprecedented 65 retirements in the wake of the House post office and banking scandals, as well as redistricting. Many who are seeking re-election are braced for stronger challenges than they have had in years.
Some of the same problems that plagued incumbents in 1992 and in a handful of races last year are still around. Despite the victory in Tuesday's primary by Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, a titan of Capitol Hill, party strategists still report a strong anti-Washington sentiment in the country. And because of redistricting, many Democrats who won in 1992 did so by slim margins and find themselves facing tougher races this year.
Both Democrats and Republicans are also keeping a watchful eye on Mr. Perot. Despite his diminished standing in the polls, his money and influence have the potential to influence the outcome of close races, particularly in the House, should he intervene.
In races for governor, Democrats also have far more seats to lose, and Republicans are eagerly seizing on Mr. Clinton's weak points. For example, they hope to prevail in western states by underscoring the increases in grazing fees.
 
Seeking Concrete Results
 Democratic officials say the way for their party to make sure that Republican attacks over Whitewater collapse is for lawmakers to return home with results, particularly passage of a health care bill.
The Democrats are eager to prove that the oratory from the 1992 campaign about eliminating paralysis between the White House and the Democratic-controlled Congress was not empty. And in contrast to crime, another issue that is important to voters, the health care system is something that lawmakers can do something substantial about.
But while their election-year nervousness could motivate incumbents to push for health care, their goals and those of Mr. Clinton may be different. The pressure on incumbents is to get a health bill, not necessarily Mr. Clinton's bill. This could lead them to be quicker to compromise away part of Mr. Clinton's approach than the White House would like.
Mr. Wilhelm, the Democratic chairman, said the challenge is for his party to counter a Republican strategy of using Whitewater to derail the them. "Obviously, it is diversionary," Mr. Wilhelm said as he was peppered with questions about Whitewater at a breakfast with reporters on Friday. "This whole Whitewater has the effect of diverting attention from the real issues."
Republicans are not without their own problems, like failing to get former Gov. Thomas H. Kean to challenge Senator Frank R. Lautenberg in New Jersey or Gov. William F. Weld to oppose Senator Edward M. Kennedy in Massachusetts.
Democrats have had the harder time convincing strong Senate prospects to run. Among the disappointments were the decisions by these people to stay out of the arena this year: Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle; former Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan; Lieut. Gov. Buddy McKay of Florida and Representative Bill Orton in Utah.
Republicans already sound jubilant. "I don't think we can count on Bill Clinton to do everything himself, but he sure is trying," said Alex Castellanos, a Republican who is advising a handful of gubernatorial and Senate candidates this year. "He's going to help give us the biggest Republican year we've had in a long time, since the beginning of the Reagan Administration."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Maps: "Races to Watch Around the Nation"
 
For the Senate . . .
 Democrats now control the Senate, with 56 seats to the Republicans 44. There will be 34 Senate contests in November, including 21 for seats now held by Democrats and 13 for seats now held by Republicans. In eight contests, incumbents -- five Democrats and three Republicans -- are not running. Map shows senate races by state, the party that controls the seat, and whether the state is open.
Arizona: Democrats are worried that they will lose the seat now held by the retiring Senator Dennis DeConcini. In the Republican primary, the leading candidate is Representative John Kyl, who has long had his eye on the seat. There is no leading candidate so far in the Democratic contest.
 California: Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was elected in 1992, is considered relatively safe. But California is known for its anti politican mood and is always an important state to watch. Her Republican opponent, Representative Michael Huffington, is a millionaire willing to make this one of the costliest Senate battles ever.
Delaware: Democrats say one of their strongest challengers is in Delaware, where Charles Oberly, the Attorney General, hopes to unseat Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Republican.
Maine: The retirement of Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, set off an unexpected scramble. Both of Maine's United States Representatives are seeking his seat. If they win their primaries, expect a lively race between Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican, and Thomas H. Andrews, a Democrat.
Minnesota: With Democrats holding a slight voting edge in the state, the party hopes it can take the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Dave Durenberger, a Republican. Freshman Representative Rod Grams leads the Republican field; the Democratic side has yet to take shape.
Montana: Senator Conrad Burns, a Republican, is viewed as vulnerable; he beat Senator John Melcher last time mainly because the incumbent ran an inept campaign. He may face Melcher again, or Jack Mudd, a little-known lawyer.
New Jersey: Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is a major Republican target in a state where the Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, was defeated in an embarrassing upset last year. He also may suffer from his opposition to President Clinton's budget last year.
Ohio: Fierce primary battles are already under way for the seat held by Howard M. Metzenbaum, a Democrat, who is retiring. For the Democrats, Metzenbaum's son-in-law, Joel Hyatt, who runs a multistate chain of legal service offices, is running against Mary Boyle, a Cleveland official. The Republican primary pits Lieut. Gov. Michael DeWine against Bernadine Healy, who was director of the National Institutes of Health.
 Pennsylvania: Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat who is seeking re-election, won an upset victory in 1990 by largely emphasizing the health-care issue. This year, Republicans want to turn the issue against him by focusing on his record. Representative Rick Santorum is the leading Republican.
 Tennessee: Senator Harlan Mathews, appointed as a caretaker to replace Vice President Gore, is not running. An aggressive battle is developing between Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat who has drawn national attention for his health care proposal, and Fred Dalton Thompson, an actor and former Republican Watergate counsel.
Virginia: Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, is trying to overcome damage from what he now admits were personal indiscretions while he was Governor. But while Oliver L. North has built up a loyal conservative following for his involvement in the Iran-contra affair, other Republicans say he is a disgrace to the party. Challenging North in the Republican primary is James C. Miller, a budget director in the Reagan Administration.
 Washington: Slade Gorton, a Republican, has very low poll numbers, but the Democrats failed to get the popular Mayor of Seattle, Norm Rice, to oppose him.
 
. . . And the State House
There are now 29 Democratic governors, 19 Republican and two independent. There are 36 contests in November: 21 for seats now held by Democrats, 13 for seats held by Republicans and two for seats hold by independents. Incumbents -- eight Democrats, two Republicans and one independent -- are not running in 11 contests. Map races by state, the party of the governor now in office, and whether the state is open.
Arizona: Gov. J. Fife Symington, a Republican, is the subject of a Federal inquiry into his role in the failure of a savings and loan. He could face Terry Goddard, a Democrat who is the former Mayor of Phoenix and barely lost to Symington four years ago.
California: Given the size and importance of California, and the vulnerability of Gov. Pete Wilson because of the state's recession and natural disasters, this may be the most watched race for governor. Wilson will face Kathleen Brown, the state Treasurer who is the daughter and sister of the state's last two Democratic governors, or John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner. Another Democratic contender is Tom Hayden, a state senator and 1960's radical.
Florida: Gov. Lawton Chiles is viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents. Competing in the Republican primary are Tom Gallagher, the state insurance commissioner, and Jeb Bush, the former state Commerce Secretary and son of George Bush.
Illinois: Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, is preparing for a spirited challenge from the Democratic nominee, Dawn Clark Netsch, a former law professor and the first woman to win a major party nomination for governor in the state.
Minnesota: Gov. Arne Carlson, a first-term Republican, has not been particularly popular in his own party, where he has been criticized for being a proponent of abortion rights and homosexual rights. A leading Democrat rival is Mike Freeman, the Hennepin County Attorney.
New York: Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's performance ratings are down in public polls, but, as usual, he lacks a formidable Republican challenger.
Rhode Island: Gov. Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, is considered vulnerable as he seeks a third term, and Representative Ron Machtley is running an aggressive race in the Republican primary to challenge him.
Texas: Gov. Ann W. Richards, a Democrat, is relatively popular, but is bracing for a strong challenge from George W. Bush, the former baseball team owner and son of the former President. (pg. 28)

HEADLINE: DEAL WITH CHINA URGED BY BENTSEN

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, March 19

 BODY:
Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen says he would like to see a compromise worked out with China that can spare the Clinton Administration having to withdraw Beijing's beneficial trade status.
Mr. Bentsen, speaking Friday night, seemed to be going out of his way to try to lower the Administration's volume on China after Secretary of State Warren Christopher's confrontation with Chinese authorities in Beijing last weekend. Mr. Bentsen was in Hawaii for a meeting of 17 finance ministers from Pacific Rim countries, many of whom took the opportunity to tell their American hosts that it was wrong-headed, arrogant and not in America's interest to use trade leverage to try to influence China on human rights. 
 It was clear that Mr. Christopher's visit to China, during which Beijing seemed to go out of its way to arrest several dissidents to embarrass their American visitor, has rattled Asian countries, not to mention some members of the Clinton economic team. The Asians fear a confrontation between Washington and Beijing over human rights could destabilize the region.
 
U.S. Approach Is Suspect
 The dominant mood at this conference is that the Clinton Administration may have gotten locked into an overly confrontational approach with China, and that it might be more productive to explore a different strategy to persuade Beijing to make enough progress on human rights so Washington can renew its low-tariff trade benefits when they expire this June.
"I think we have to explore alternatives to see if we can work this out," said Mr. Bentsen. He said the goal must be "to keep some pressure on to try to help as far as human rights, but not find ourselves disengaging."
"I think from an economic standpoint that hurts both of our countries," he added.
Administration officials said that it is already clear that even under the best scenario, China's behavior by June is not going to be fully satisfactory from an American human-rights perspective, and may at best just barely clear the hurdles set out by the President in his executive order last year -- such as accounting for political prisoners and ending the use of prison labor. Mr. Clinton said China must meet those minimum conditions to be able to continue exporting its goods to the United States at the lowest possible tariffs.
 
Time to Prepare Public?
 Because the situation in June is likely to be ambiguous some officials argue that the Administration should start laying a foundation with Congress and public opinion now for renewing China's trade benefits.
That means, they say, avoiding more confrontations with Beijing and emphasizing instead the importance of trade for human rights development in China. It also means considering, instead of a blanket removal of China's trade benefits, possibly a more selective removal, so that most of the commerce can continue.
China's Finance Minister, Liu Zhongli, said in an interview that it was the Clinton Administration's responsibility to find a way down from this tree.
"To give you an old Chinese saying: 'It is up to the one who ties the knot to untie the knot,' " Mr. Liu remarked.
The United States, Mr. Liu added, "maintains a triple standard."
"For their own human rights problems they shut their eyes," he said. "For some other countries' human rights questions they open one eye and shut the other. And for China, they open both eyes and stare."

HEADLINE: In Miami's Little Haiti, Fears of Assassination

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 19

 BODY:
When two gunmen shot and killed Daniel Buron here last week, another wave of fear quickly spread through the neighborhood that is home to thousands of Haitian exiles and refugees.
For the fourth time in three years, a prominent opponent of Haiti's military dictatorship had been killed on the streets of Little Haiti, and for the fourth time, the police and prosecutors seemed to discount politics as a motive. 
 To supporters of Haiti's ousted President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the shooting of Mr. Buron, and the official reaction to it here, are frightening proof that the Haitian military's enforcers can act with impunity anywhere, even in a major American city. Mr. Buron's killing, they say, coincided with a campaign of terror in Haiti and was intended as a warning to the more than 100,000 exiles here to halt their marches, speeches and broadcasts promoting the overthrow of Haiti's military leaders and the restoration of Father Aristide, who was ousted in a coup in September 1991.
 
'Psychological Warfare'
 "We know they are here, too," said Marcus Garcia, the editor of the exile newspaper "Haiti en Marche," speaking of the bands of hired thugs and killers that Haiti's military leaders employ against their opponents in Haiti. "This is psychological warfare."
The authorities here are reluctant to theorize about the motives for the killings, but court papers suggest that they see drugs or personal disputes as contributing factors.
Mr. Buron, a 37-year-old bus driver for a car rental company who was buried today, was shot to death on March 9 as he and two friends were talking after the regular Wednesday night board meeting of Veye Yo, the fiercely antimilitary political organization to which all belonged. Two gunmen approached and, without saying a word, sprayed them with gunfire, a survivor said.
"I think they were trying to kill all three of us," said Max Delva, a 47-year-old carpenter who survived the attack.
 
Broadcasters Killed
 Mr. Buron's killing followed the fatal shootings of three other Haitians active in exile politics here: Jean-Claude Olivier, Fritz Dor and Dona St. Plite, all hosts of talk shows on local Creole-language radio stations that can sometimes be heard in Haiti. Like Mr. Buron, the other victims, who were killed from 1991 to 1993, were affiliated with Veye Yo, which means "Beware of Them" in Creole, the popular language of Haiti.
Nevertheless, a spokesman for the Miami Police Department, David Magnusson, said that in the Buron case "speculation that the motive may be political is premature." And prosecutors scoff at the notion that the earlier killings, which led to the arrests of several Haitians living here and a series of court proceedings that have not yet been concluded, were political assassinations. The political affiliations, if any, of the suspects is unknown, as is their immigration status.
"What you've got is a hysteria founded on rumors," said John S. Kastrenakes, an Assistant State Attorney in Dade County who is prosecuting the Olivier and Dor cases.
"It is important," he said, "that the community know there is no evidence that these murders are related to the question of who is in power in the country of Haiti."
 
'Transnational Terrorists'
 A spokesman for the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Paul Miller, said that his agency had begun a preliminary inquiry to determine if "outside forces" were involved, but that there was "no indication of that so far."
However, Beverly Bell, a spokeswoman for Father Aristide's government-in-exile, said she had no doubt that "transnational terrorists" supported by Haiti's military-run government were responsible for the killings and other acts of violence against Haitian exiles in Miami, New York, Boston and Montreal.
If the killings here were recognized as political, there could be important implications. Most Haitians arriving in the United States are considered economic refugees; acknowledging that Haiti's military is attacking exiles on American soil could strengthen refugee claims of political persecution.
Mr. Kastrenakes would not say what led him to discount politics as a motive in the shootings of Mr. Olivier and Mr. Dor, nor would he discuss what other factors might lie behind the killings.
But court documents indicate that the authorities believe the shootings may have been associated with drug dealing or involved personal feuds.
 
Dor Would 'Pay Dearly'
 In a deposition filed as part of the Dor case, a police investigator said a suspect had told him that the shooting "was a cocaine deal that went bad." But another deposition quotes a second investigator who said he was told that "Fritz Dor was going to pay dearly" for trying to undermine a concert promoted by a Haitian businessman, whose name was given as Louis Thermitus. The deposition provided no further background on Mr. Thermitus, but Haitian exiles said he was a member of the Tontons Macoute, the paramilitary units formed in the late 1950's during the dictatorship of Francoise (Papa Doc) Duvalier to kill, beat, rob and intimidate opponents.
In the Olivier case, Hitler Fleurinord, 22, has been charged with first-degree murder and is to go on trial in May. He is accused of driving the car from which a gunman, unnamed in court papers and still at large, fired three shots at Mr. Olivier outside a nightclub in Little Haiti on Feb. 18, 1991.
Mr. Dor was killed less than a month later. Glossy Bruce Joseph, a 22-year-old admitted small-time drug dealer, pleaded guilty last year to acting as a lookout in the shooting and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Mr. Olivier and Mr. Dor were killed with the same gun, but Mr. Kastrenakes said Mr. Joseph had provided no information that linked the two killings and in general "was not extremely helpful," despite the plea bargain, which also encompassed a murder attempt unrelated to Haitian politics.
 
An Exile 'Hit List'
 Mr. St. Plite, the third victim, was robbed and killed last fall outside a benefit dinner in Little Haiti in memory of Mr. Dor. Three men were arrested, but two were released after prosecutors concluded there was not enough evidence to convict them. The third suspect, Francky St. Louis Joseph, was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder and is to stand trial on April 4.
Shortly before his death, Mr. St. Plite was among more than a score of Haitian exiles here whose name was on a hit list circulated in Little Haiti. The list, whose provenance was unknown, included a preface praising Haiti's military government and proclaiming that those on the list should be killed to keep Mr. Aristide from returning to Haiti.
Rolande Dorancy, the director of the Haitian Refugee Center here, said that despite the misgivings of the police she was convinced that "these are all political murders." All four victims "were very outspoken people against the criminals who are running the country," she said, and it would have been easy for Haitian assassins to "make it look like something else."
"We are not satisfied" with the way police and prosecutors have handled the investigations, Ms. Dorancy said. If the F.B.I. and the police had been more aggressive about pursuing the earlier cases and had taken the political dimension more seriously, "then maybe Daniel would not be in the funeral home today," she said.
 
Grisly Warning From Home
 In a case that several Haitian exiles cite as another example of the Haitian military's effort to intimidate Aristide supporters here, Ms. Dorancy's childhood nanny, Orilia Joseph, was kidnapped last fall in Port-au-Prince by a paramilitary squad and shot, burned and decapitated. That killing, like Mr. St. Plite's, occurred in October, when the Haitian military stepped up its effort to prevent Mr. Aristide from returning to Haiti under the terms of a United Nations accord.
Because the police and prosecutors continue to say that politics plays no role in the recent killings here, Haitian exiles say they fear that Haitian Government enforcers may continue to prey on them. But they continue to hope that the authorities will have a change of heart, and they say that in the meantime they will continue their political activities.
"The current investigation is very important, because the only way you can stop this trend is by showing that the police are taking it very seriously," said Mr. Garcia, the editor. "It's like the killings of the tourists last year: they need to show some muscle and say that they are not going to tolerate this any more."

HEADLINE: Motives of Quiet Congressman Who Is Making Much of Whitewater's Noise

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
In a city where bombast and pomposity are the rule, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa is quiet and modest.
In a Congress riven by partisanship, he has sided with Democrats over the years almost as often as he has lined up with his fellow Republicans. 
 So it seems out of character that Mr. Leach is now President Clinton's main antagonist in Congress on the Whitewater case. He not only has his name on front pages and on evening news programs these days but he also has attacked the President on "Donahue" and "A Current Affair."
It seems almost as if Madonna were cast to play Queen Victoria or Shaquille O'Neal had started shooting jump shots from behind the 3-point line.
But it seems out of character only to people who do not know Mr. Leach -- to those outside the Capitol, where he enjoys almost universal respect, and his Congressional district in eastern Iowa, where he has held a safe seat for the last 18 years.
Those who know him best say Jim Leach is doing exactly what they would have expected on the question that has guided his political life: public ethics.
 
Preferred Ethics to Dream Job
 Many of them disagree with him. None question his motives.
After all, this is a man who resigned from the Foreign Service in 1973 on the eve of his dream assignment in order to protest President Richard M. Nixon's dismissal of Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, in the Saturday Night Massacre.
This is a Congressman who sharply criticized a President of his own party, Ronald Reagan, over the Iran-contra affair and one who told his colleagues to their faces that they were responsible individually and collectively for the savings and loan mess because they had abandoned the national interest in favor of regional and industry concerns.
This is a politician who has never accepted a campaign contribution of more than $500 or taken a dime from political action committees or people who live outside Iowa.
He is fond of repeating an adaptation of Barry M. Goldwater's famous line about moderation and extremism. "Moderation in the pursuit of truth is no virtue," Mr. Leach says in his public speeches. "Vigilance in the defense of public ethics is no vice."
At the beginning of last year, Mr. Leach became the top-ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee, a position that gave him a small staff and a responsibility to be his party's spokesman on issues before the committee. By summer, he had the staff investigating the failure of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan owned by the Clintons' business partner in the Whitewater real-estate venture, James B. McDougal. The collapse of Guaranty cost the Government $60 million.
 
'I Feel So Strongly About This'

In an interview in his office last week, Mr. Leach explained his interest this way: "I am fulfilling my obligations as I see them under the Constitution. The Constitution gives Congress oversight accountability of the executive branch. And I will go further, because I feel so strongly about this I can't stand it. It's the responsibility of all parties out of power, all minority parties in all Western democracies, to hold accountable the executive branch of the governing party when there are breaches of public ethics or public law. Not to fulfill that responsibility is a dereliction of duty."
Mr. Leach, who speaks so softly that you have to strain to hear him even when he is next to you on the couch, insisted he had no interest whatsoever in harming President Clinton or his Presidency.
"On the grand scope of public scandals, this is a bump," he said, referring to Whitewater. "But it has mountainous implications for public ethics."
 
Seeking Full Disclosure
 He continued: "My argument is that this is a full-disclosure issue. I've tried to walk the line between public embarrassment, which I think is deserved, and either Presidency-toppling or Presidency-debilitating, which are not deserved.
"I thought initially it was a one-to-three-week issue, that you'd have a hearing and then put it behind us. Now the great challenge is how you bring the issue to resolution. I will be steadfast in seeking full disclosure. But once there is disclosure, I will do my best to put it behind."
Out of the mouth of almost any other politician that would sound self-righteous, and at the White House, Mr. Leach is seen as a man on the make, who wants to rise by stepping on the President's back.
But politicians from across the political band who know him well say Mr. Leach's explanation is the full story of why he is challenging Mr. Clinton.
 
Praise From an Opponent
 One longtime political opponent, Dave Nagle, a former Democratic Party chairman in Iowa who once served in Congress from a district adjacent to Mr. Leach's, said: "For Jim, this is completely in character. He has a reputation for impartiality, for listening to both sides, for integrity, for being reasonable. So when he takes on something, people have a tendency to listen. When he says it, it lends instant credibility to it. You're inclined to believe that he honestly believes, even if you think he's mistaken, that he's right."
Mr. Leach, who grew up in an affluent family in Davenport, said he entered politics almost by accident. By the eighth grade, he said, he knew he wanted to be in the Foreign Service, and he went to Princeton University and graduate school at Johns Hopkins with that in mind.
 
At College in 60's, He Studied
 He graduated from Princeton in 1964, the year of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, the beginning of a decade of monumental change on campuses from coast to coast. But Mr. Leach was a bookworm, a Russian studies major and a 147-pound wrestler, and he had little interest in popular culture or student politics.
By the fall of 1973, Mr. Leach was an experienced Foreign Service officer. Fluent in German and Russian, he had just received what he felt was "the best assignment possible," to be an aide to the United States Ambassador in Moscow. He was at home on a brief leave to try to handle some urgent problems in his family's petroleum products business when the Saturday Night Massacre occurred.
"That night," he said, "I sent a telegram to Henry Kissinger with my resignation. I really felt that what that firing was all about was the President putting himself above the law."
 
In a Democratic District
 Three months later, he said, the Republican Party in Davenport persuaded him to run in a Congressional race he had no chance of winning. No one else wanted the nomination. Indeed, he lost to a popular Democrat. But two years later, the national economy had turned sour, and Mr. Leach ran again and won. He has never been seriously challenged since, although his district tends to vote Democratic in other races.
This sounds too pat. The man had little interest in politics, who resigned on a matter of principle from a job he loved, who announced his candidacy for Congress three months later. Surely he must have had running for office in the back of his mind.
No, Mr. Leach said. He really did not. And politicians in Iowa who remember the times say everything happened just the way Mr. Leach recalls it today.
 
A Moderate Stripe
 In Washington, Mr. Leach sailed under the banner of Jacob K. Javits, Nelson A. Rockefeller and other liberal-to-moderate Republicans who were influential in the 1960's and 1970's. But Mr. Leach had come aboard too late. Ronald Reagan had become the party's general, and the right wing dominated his troops.
So Mr. Leach, part of a small minority within a minority, confined himself legislatively mainly to banking and foreign policy issues that do not tend to divide along party or ideological lines. His most noteworthy achievement in Congress up till now was to lead the fight to knock out of the savings and loan bailout legislation provisions that gave special benefits to Citicorp, Merrill Lynch and other large financial institutions.
Since taking on the Whitewater case, Mr. Leach's tone has sharpened.
He promised a "blockbuster" if he has the chance to question witnesses in public, without saying what it would entail. He gave a speech in Chicago this month in which he compared Bill Clinton to Michael Milken, the financial wizard who went to jail for fraud. Last week, he told reporters he had sent a confidential memorandum to the special prosecutor about the way bank regulators in Kansas City were being "gagged" by their superiors.
To the suggestion that this talk is rather intemperate for a man with a reputation for understatement, Mr. Leach acknowledged that his voice now has "a little more of a Republican Party clip to it than I'd evidenced before."
He spoke as if his new voice were a matter he had lain awake nights worrying about: "One of the really difficult roads to walk is that between reflecting individual conscience and that of being a member of a team. I always think the first outweighs the second. But the second is not unimportant. We govern through teams in America. It's important to be loyal to teams."

HEADLINE: School Board Is Criticized On Recycling

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
Nearly five years after enactment of the mandatory recycling law, New York City's public-school system has no formal recycling program, and for three and a half years has been in violation of that law. The Board of Education has yet to adopt regulations placing responsibility for meeting the law's requirements.
A wide range of city officials and environmentalists, from the City Councilman who wrote the 1989 recycling legislation to frustrated school administrators to Department of Sanitation specialists, have sharply criticized the Board of Education's failure. They have also expressed regret at what they call a lost opportunity to use the schools as the training ground for future generations for whom recycling would be essential. 
 Last week Amy Linden, the Board of Education official in charge of recycling, said a draft of institutional regulations was being circulated and likely would be adopted by Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines within the month. But she offered no reasons for the delay in producing the regulations or answers for why the city's public schools still lacked a comprehensive and functioning recycling program.
"I'm not going to make excuses," said Ms. Linden, the chief executive for school facilities at the Board of Education. "There was a long delay."
 
'A Significant Disgrace'
 "The Board of Education has been mocking one of the most important city laws adopted in its history," said Mark Izeman, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. He asserted that "absolutely nothing had changed" since the group's 1992 public report on recycling in the schools, which sharply criticized the board for its failure to recycle. "It's a significant disgrace," Mr. Izeman said.
The Board's effective violation of Local Law 19 has prompted a range of elected officials and environmentalist to call for punitive measures, like having the city, which picks up garbage free at the schools, charge the Board of Education for garbage removal. Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate, sent a letter to Mr. Cortines on Friday asking that the board's recycling regulations be adopted and released as soon as possible.
"It's inexcusable that the Board of Education's foot-dragging has gone on for five years," Mr. Green said. "We can't undo the board's malfeasance, only hope that other governmental institutions do everything possible to accelerate the recycling programs."
Sheldon S. Leffler, the City Councilman from Queens who wrote Local Law 19, which requires recycling, said, "There have been many gross violations of the law since it was enacted, but this one by the Board of Education is especially unacceptable because it was our thinking that the absolute best way to reach a diverse city was through its schools."
Everyone involved in the issue agrees that the delay has had measurable consequences. The city's 1992 solid waste management study, using data from the 1990 school year, estimated that more than 120,000 tons of waste was generated annually by the public schools, 3 percent of the city's nonresidential garbage. Of that, the audit concluded, roughly 33,000 tons could have been recycled.
While conceding that their information is more anecdotal than documented, officials at the Board of Education and the Department of Sanitation guess that perhaps 100 or so of the city's 1,069 public schools have recycling programs in place. But the officials admit that those programs are often only modest projects, and have been started only with the initiative of individual school administrators and teachers.
 
Wider Considerations
 The debate about recycling in schools takes place amid wider wrangling over recycling. The State Court of Appeals last month upheld a ruling that the city, which had failed to meet required levels of recycling, was effectively breaking the law. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose proposed budget calls for scaling back recycling pickups to every other week, has responded to the court decision by asking the City Council to consider reducing the recycling law's requirements.
"The administration is operating on two levels," said Mr. Leffler. "Publicly, it says it wants recycling. Behind the scenes, it is trying to turn it back."
Mr. Leffler and others maintain that the reduction of recycling pickup schedules to every other week would doom any hopes of starting an effective program in the city's schools.
"Given that storage is perhaps the largest obstacle for the schools to overcome, if Mayor Giuliani's budget proposal ever takes effect, it would seriously undermine the Board of Education's plans," Mr. Green said.
 
Not Insurmountable
 Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, said the Mayor remained committed to recycling, and he rejected the assertion that the Mayor's budget proposals would undermine any Board of Education recycling programs. The spokesman said the Mayor was convinced that the Department of Sanitation would be flexible in dealing with pickups at schools.
"There's no problem that isn't surmountable," Mr. Fromberg said.
According to critics of the Board of Education, as well as school officials, the reason a recycling program has not been instituted is not one of lack of money or other problems, but simply bureaucratic apathy. Concerns about the custodians' union and whether sufficient space exists in the schools to store recycled material safely have not been addressed because recycling has not begun.
"No one ever seemed to be in charge," said Tony Solomita, a Department of Sanitation recycling specialist who has worked with school officials. "No one was ever smart about it. I never got the sense anyone was even trying to work it out."
While citing delays resulting from the hiring of a new chancellor last summer and the asbestos crisis last fall, Ms. Linden said she did not dispute the Department of Sanitation's contention that recycling at the schools can be accomplished.
"I have never said that the implementation of the programs would be too complex, only that there were some basic questions to be addressed," she said. "And the custodians have not been the problem. The delay in drafting the regulations was a delay because there just happened to be a million other things to do."
But the circulation of the chancellor's regulations hardly pleases the board's critics, who have argued that the draft regulations, written in a seven-page document that basically says who is answerable to whom, are inadequate.
"They could have been written in an afternoon four years ago," said Susan Cohen, an economist and a member of the Manhattan Citizens Solid Waste Advisory Board. "There is nothing in the regulations that lays out how the schools will execute their recycling programs. The battles are still going to have to be fought at every single school."
 
Complaints on Draft Plan
 Those fights could be sizable and sustained without direction from the board, sanitation officials, the custodians and elected officials said. Complaints have already been lodged about the draft regulations from district superintendents and school principals. There is also widespread confusion about Fire Department and Health Department regulations that affect recycling. And an official with the custodians' union said Friday that the union had not yet received a copy of the regulations.
"I have been in schools where I've been told the Fire Department won't allow paper to be stored in certain rooms, or that the Board of Health won't allow bottles to be kept for certain lengths of time," Mr. Solomita said. "People's senses of what the rules are have taken on lives of their own.
"And so we have had people at the Board of Education telling people it's the principal who is in charge, principals telling people it's the custodians who are responsible, custodians saying it's the kids," Mr. Solomita said. "Now there are Board of Education regulations on paper talking about recycling committees being set up at schools. It looks nice on paper. Let's see if it works. Hey, all I know is that there aren't committees at schools for taking out the garbage."

HEADLINE: Massacre at Hebron Exposes Anti-American Mood in Israel

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 19

 BODY:
In some Israeli circles, a new dirty word has popped up in the last few weeks: Brooklyn.
Brooklyn produced Benjamin C. Goldstein, who as Baruch Goldstein of the Qiryat Arba settlement massacred at least 29 Palestinians in Hebron three weeks ago. And Brooklyn, of course, is part of the United States. That has been enough to touch a certain anti-American streak that lies just below the surface for many Israelis. 
 These are far from the best of times for American-born Jews who made aliya -- the complimentary Hebrew word for immigrating to Israel -- and who tend to be referred to here as "Anglo-Saxons," even if their families never got closer to the British Isles than Slovakia.
 
Vulnerable to Criticism
 If they wear yarmulkes and are on the political right -- a group filled with former New Yorkers and constituting a clear majority of the 2,000 to 3,000 Americans now immigrating here each year -- they sense they are now automatically vulnerable to criticism. And if they live in Judea and Samaria, the names of biblical origin widely used here for the West Bank, they feel it even more strongly, especially from the Government.
"We're all tagged as 'settlers,' and with that word alone we're already put two pegs below everybody else," said Bob Lang, originally of Nanuet, N.Y., who lives south of Bethlehem in the settlement of Efrat. Roughly one-third of the 5,000 residents of Efrat are from the United States.
"After the massacre, those of us who are Americans dropped down another peg," Mr. Lang said. "Now we're all seen as Baruch Goldsteins."
Even American-born Jews who are secular and lean politically leftward find this an uncomfortable period. Not that anyone has been physically attacked or subject to blatant discrimination. The situation is hardly that bad. And the United States is, at heart, an admired ally and Israel's main source of political solace, financial support and pop-culture guidance, from Big Macs to Madonna.
 
Marginal to the Israelis
 Still, Stuart Schoffman, a screenwriter and magazine columnist who attended the Yeshiva of Flatbush about a decade before Baruch Goldstein, found that "Israelis were too hasty to blame this on an American."
"It reminded me of how marginal we are to Israelis," Mr. Schoffman said, talking about an attitude that many Americans sense in secular native-born Israelis -- that anyone who gave up life in the United States cannot be playing with a full deck of cards.
"It's a common perception that if you come from America you have to be crazy," Mr. Schoffman said. "Over and over, you hear Israelis ask, 'Why did you come?' "
Anti-American, and specifically anti-Brooklyn, sentiment surfaced immediately after the massacre, and although it was aimed primarily at Americans on the religious and nationalist extremes, it was sufficiently scattershot to hit other targets as well.
The newspaper Maariv complained about American parents who "send their lunatic children to Israel."
"In Qiryat Arba," it said in a commentary, "the raw material is American, the money is American. We have to do the work."
Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban singled out Brooklyn, warning about "that gang" there, meaning people like Dr. Goldstein who are rooted in the Arab-loathing ideology of another Brooklyn product, Rabbi Meir Kahane.
 
Two Groups Are Banned
 Urging the Government to outlaw Kahane-spawned movements, an action taken last weekend against the Kach and Kahane Chai groups, Mr. Tsaban said, "If we don't declare them illegal, we will have no legal basis to prevent the immigration of their brethren from Brooklyn."
Yitzhak Rabin contemptuously rejected that militancy as "a foreign implant," and even though aides later insisted that the American-oriented Prime Minister was talking about views alien to Judaism, some Americans took it personally and found it a dissonant observation in a nation of immigrants.
Some ordinary Israelis, too, have taken up verbal cudgels, like a retired businessman in Tel Aviv who said a day after the massacre, "Most of the American Jews are extremists, and troublemakers, too."
In fact, Americans account for a tiny fraction of Israel's five million people, barely one percent. Olga Rachmilevitch, national executive director of the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel, estimates that since the creation of the state in 1948 not more than 80,000 North Americans immigrated to Israel and stayed.
 
From New York to West Bank
 But the Americans often have a disproportionate influence on the national political and social agenda -- from the left as well as the right -- because they bring an activism that many other Israelis lack.
On the right, American accents are unmistakable not only at the Kahane-inspired fringes but also among more moderate settlers in the territories.
According to some estimates, 15 percent of the roughly 130,000 settlers are originally from the United States, many of them people who went straight from New York to the West Bank and who have at best a tenuous connection to mainstream Israel. The average Israeli on Saturday is generally less interested in the weekly Bible reading than whether the Maccabi Haifa soccer team won yet again.
But while precise figures are hard to come by, American-Israelis are also prominent in disproportionate numbers in leftist or liberal groups like Peace Now, the New Israel Fund and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.
"Americans tend to feel that each person can make a difference, and so when they come here many gravitate to grass-roots movements akin to the ones they knew back home," said Galia Golan, a political scientist at Hebrew University who immigrated in 1966 and is a leader of Peace Now.
 
On a Different Plane
 Part of what separates the Americans from others is that, as a group, they did not come here in desperation. In that sense, they live on a different plane from the hundreds of thousands of Moroccans, Russians, Ethiopians, Romanians and others who simply wanted out, whether because of economic hardship or religious persecution.
Zeev Chafets, a Michigan-born writer and 15 years ago a spokesman for the Government of Menachem Begin, said: "People who move here are highly motivated ideologically. They want to feel that there's a deeper purpose, whether it's religious or Zionist. So it's not surprising that there's this activism among the Americans."
Yet the activism tends to be channeled into groups working to influence official policy, not make it.
Beyond a few notable exceptions -- including the late Prime Minister Golda Meir, born in Kiev but reared in Milwaukee, and former Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who grew up in the United States although born in Lithuania -- Americans have been almost invisible in the front ranks of Israeli politics, diplomacy, big business and that most important force of all, the army.
In part, Israelis say, it is because those institutions have "old boy networks" formed in the barracks and at school.
Nonetheless, Mr. Chafets worked in a high Government post, and says that "no one ever questioned the propriety or security implications." Gerald Steinberg, a San Francisco-born military expert at Bar-Ilan University, says his access to senior army ranks is "much greater" than he had expected.
Like most American arrivals over the last dozen years, Professor Steinberg is an observant Jew, and lives in Jerusalem. But he finds that secular Israelis tend to see his knitted yarmulke and immediately "categorize me as a right-wing settler type until it is proven otherwise."
"These are Americans whose life's dream is to live in the land of Abraham, not the state of Israel," Professor Steinberg said of the settlers. "They're not a large group, but they're visible. And they're alien to Israelis, and that makes us all look alien."

HEADLINE: Income-Tax Cut: Hopes and Fears

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAMILTON, N.J., March 19

 BODY:
Even when her campaign promise to cut taxes was so derided that it was costing her points in the opinion polls, Christine Todd Whitman stuck to her guns.
As Governor, she has begun to make good on that promise, cutting taxes by 5 percent during her first two months in office and, in her Tuesday budget message, asking to cut 10 percent more starting next January. 
 And up and down the state this week, New Jerseyans have been talking about Mrs. Whitman, talking about the tax cut and figuring out how much it will yield them -- probably little at first for most. They voice a mixture of optimism and skepticism, worrying about the impact of the state-aid cuts on their towns and schools.
"I knew she'd do it," said Martha Ceminowicz, the wife of a retired state worker who lives in this Trenton suburb. "A lot of people said she wouldn't, but she's a woman, and it's the women who know how to make the money last."
 
Cutting One, Raising Others
 In Cherry Hill, Marla Weinstein, 35, a homemaker, said: "It seems crazy that they're cutting taxes right now. I think that, I believe that our property taxes in every town will go up, and I don't know how that makes sense, to cut one tax and have other taxes raised."
Those are also the concerns of most New Jerseyans, according to a poll conducted by The Star-Ledger of Newark and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. It concluded that residents will gladly embrace income tax cuts so long as they do not result in higher property taxes. The poll was conducted in mid-February, as the first, 5 percent tax cut for 1994 was nearing enactment. The poll of 800 respondents had a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percent.
The poll found that 61 percent of respondents said the 30 percent income-tax cut that the Governor has promised over three years would help the state economy. But 72 percent said the cuts should not be made if they would force up property taxes.
Wall Street has also begun to mutter concerns. On Friday, Standard & Poor's Ratings Group issued a statement lamenting the Governor's reliance on one-time revenue sources to close a $2 billion budget gap and to pay for a $549 million tax cut.
 
Burdening the Next Century
 The bond-rating firm was particularly critical of the Governor's decision to change the financing of state retirement benefits, using a method that many believe will only put off into the next century an even greater financial burden on taxpayers.
"Of course, as the state keeps digging into one-shot revenue sources, the fiscal hole just gets deeper," said Hyman C. Grossman, Standard & Poor's managing director. The firm will issue its rating of New Jersey bonds sometime in June. (A budget must be adopted by July 1). By June, Whitman administration officials hope, an improving economy may have increased revenues enough to offset the one-shot budget deals.
Awareness of the 10 percent cut may be particularly intense because of the way Whitman officials orchestrated the publication of the Governor's first budget.
On Friday, March 11, Treasurer Brian W. Clymer held a news briefing on state income projections that included hints of another tax cut, but no details. "See me on Monday," Mr. Clymer told reporters who pressed for information.
 
Prime-Time Audience
 But the Monday briefing outlined only deficit closing measures, along with a few more figures suggesting another tax cut.
Finally on Tuesday, Governor Whitman made her budget speech in prime time, not in the afternoon, as was traditional. She clearly aimed over the heads of the Legislature, who shared the well of the Assembly chamber with her, to the television audience statewide.
In her speech, the Governor filled in the blanks: a 10 percent cut to couples earning less than $80,000, with smaller reductions for incomes over that level. To help pay for it, she would eliminate two state agencies, end 1,100 state jobs, close several National Guard armories and privatize New Jersey Network, the state-owned public television network that broadcast her speech.
The long buildup to the budget message allowed the Democratic minority in the Legislature to imbed a sub-theme about tax cuts in the public mind: that reducing the state budget in the name of lower income taxes would force cuts in state aid to schools and municipalities and so raise property taxes for everyone.
 
Wary About Property Taxes
 And that concern was widespread in conversations with New Jerseyans after the budget message.
"Let's say that the Governor is going to save me 5 percent a year," said Linda James, a Hackensack homeowner. "Well, that's all fine and good, but if my property taxes go up 8 or 9 percent a year, well, simple mathematics tell me I'm losing money, not saving." Ms. James added that her property taxes have recently increased to over $4,000.
"What do we get? A few bucks?" Paul Murray said from his driver's perch in a bread truck after making a stop at the Halo Farms dairy store in Trenton. "So, a few bucks, and our school taxes go up instead."
Residents of the state's struggling cities, meanwhile, worry that reduced state aid would fall particularly hard on the poor.
"I am appalled by the tax cut," said Mark Watson, a Camden paralegal as he waited for a bus at the Camden Transportation Center. "I don't understand how someone can do this in times of such trouble here."
In fact, Mrs. Whitman shifted about $38 million from wealthy school districts to urban districts under her spending plan.
 
Business People Love It
 If Mrs. Whitman has an ironclad constituency for her tax cut, it seems to be among business people.
"I don't care how much I'm going to get back -- that's not important," said Harry Wilson of Pennsauken, 37, the manager of a Cherry Hill Mall jewelry store.
"What is important is that people are starting to realize you can't just tax constantly," Mr. Wilson said. "Governor Whitman is finally doing something about the constant higher and higher taxes."

HEADLINE: Seeing Beyond the American Trees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Institutional Investments That Grow With Trees" (Feb. 20) dealt exclusively with United States timberlands, which because of concern over the spotted owl and similar matters have become significantly overvalued in some regions. However, 85 percent of the world's timber production comes from outside the United States, and two-thirds of that percentage comes from tropical forests. Such forests are rapidly disappearing because of conversion to agriculture. For numerous biological reasons, tropical forests do not regenerate as readily as woodlands in temperate zones do. A tropical forest that has been clear-cut is lost for all economic purposes. 
 Operating a rain forest for profit on a sustained yield basis is a serendipitous opportunity to maintain a critical part of the planet's ecosystem while simultaneously achieving higher returns with less risk than investing in United States timberlands. The risks are lower because of the diversity of the forest and the lower probability of fire. The expected returns are higher because of lower land prices and operating expenses, faster growth rates and higher finished-product prices.

Ship Contract Enlivens Piers

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
The old Brooklyn Navy Yard, the once-solid symbol of America's naval dominance put out of action by the decline of the shipbuilding industry, has attracted small, land-based companies over the last decade. But now a $9.4 million conversion contract is enlivening the yard's becalmed piers and docks.
Eastern Technical Enterprises, a company based in Norfolk, Va., with offices in the Navy Yard, won the contract to convert the Harkness, a naval oceanographic survey ship, into a nautical school for the Maine Maritime Academy. 
 The restoration project -- which includes a new deck house to accommodate 312 cadets, two marine sanitation devices and a machinery space for a new distiller -- is expected to last about a year and employ roughly 150 people, said Peter Beys, the president of Eastern Technical Enterprises.
While ship repairs have continued at the yard, this will be the largest project undertaken there in about a decade, said Thomas Montvel-Cohen, vice president of the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Company.
"This is a pretty large contract and it helps to maintain a ship repair work force that has existed in Brooklyn for over 200 years," Mr. Montvel-Cohen said.
In 1798, workers there nailed together the wooden frames of the Adams, the country's first home-built warship; in 1861, they constructed the Monitor, the United States Navy's first ironclad ship.
But the Navy Yard suffered a series of blows, most notably in the late 1960's, when much of the nation's shipbuilding industry migrated to the Gulf Coast states.
New York City bought the sprawling 260-acre yard in 1966, intending to turn it into an industrial park, and then set up as its manager a nonprofit agency, the Brooklyn Navy Yard Corporation.
It has managed to lure small businesses -- including a jewelry factory, a Haitian newspaper and All Ways Natural, a company that makes grooming products -- at a time when manufacturing jobs are leaving the city and loft spaces are continuing to beg for tenants.
But in 1986, Coastal Dry Dock, an anchor of the Navy Yard, went out of business, and uncharacteristic calm fell over the six docks and five piers of the once bustling yard.
Last week, the yard suffered another setback. City officials had applied for a Federal grant to establish a job corps center there to give disadvantaged youngsters basic job skills. But the yard was not among the nine sites across the country chosen to receive the grant.
Joan Bartolomeo, president of the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, said that a recent discovery of high levels of toxic chemicals in the soil of the southwest section of the shipyard was not likely to alter the yard's ability to attract businesses.
The discovery prompted a formal investigation by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which is expected to take a year, and may result in the yard's being placed on the Superfund list of toxic waste sites.
"I don't think it would make much of an impact," said Ms. Bartolomeo. "We're talking about an industrial area. People don't live there." GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

Key Food Departs But Jobs May Stay

 BODY:
After 38 years of selling groceries to the Upper West Side, Key Food has announced that it will close its store at Broadway and 91st Street in May. But in a kind of economic recycling, the drug store chain that plans to take its place, Duane Reade, has promised to hire as many of the supermarket's 80 employees as it can.
Richard Durso, the manager of Key Food, said the promise was part of the agreement to turn over the store's lease. 
 "It was time to move on," Mr. Durso said, "but I also did not want to leave my employees without jobs."
Bruce L. Weitz, chairman and chief executive officer of Duane Reade, said he could not say exactly how many employees would be hired.
"Nothing would make me happier than to hire all of them," he said. "We intend to hire as many as we can, not only for that location but for other Duane Reade stores in the city as well."

Poor Gain, Rich Gain a Lot

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
The Dickensian breach between Manhattan's richest and poorest areas widened in the last decade.
Both groups gained in average family income. Still, the differentials between the top 10 percent of the census tracts in Manhattan and the bottom 10 percent grew. The reason? The richer census tracts grew much richer. 
 According to a computer analysis of census data by Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, who directs the Program for Applied Research at Queens College, the ratio of income was 9 to 1 in 1980, when the poorest tracts reported average family income of $13,449 (in 1990 dollars) and the richest made $119,164 (also in 1990 dollars). By 1990, the figure for the 29 poorest tracts rose 22 percent to $16,420. But the average family income soared 72 percent among the richest, to $205,408. The ratio was 12.5 to 1.
Both the city's richest census tract and the poorest are in Manhattan, the richest bounded by Fifth and Park Avenues and by East 86th and 91st Streets on the Upper East Side, and the poorest bounded by Bradhurst Avenue and Frederick Douglass Boulevard and by West 145th and 150th Streets in West Harlem.
Average family income in the richest was $301,209 -- or about 50 times more than the $6,019 average in the poorest.
In the richest, 6 in 10 households consisted of married couples; in the poorest, 1 in 4. In the richest, 2 in 3 adults were employed or seeking work; in the poorest, where the median age is seven years younger, only 1 in 3 were. Fewer than 1 in 100 households were poor in the richest tract; three-quarters were living below the poverty level in the poorest tract.
There are several ways to measure income. The two census tracts were selected on the basis of average family income and because they are largely residential. Most of the poorest tract is encompassed by the Bradhurst Redevelopment Project, which is to renovate and build apartments for about 2,200 families. SAM ROBERTS

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN;
Restaurant Pact: Isolated Victory?

BYLINE: By JANE LII 

 BODY:
Although the union representing workers at the Silver Palace restaurant in Chinatown proclaimed victory last Sunday over the end of a bitter seven-month labor dispute, many in Chinatown say they doubt the settlement will have any impact on the working conditions in other restaurants there.
"It's a great political victory for the union in the sense they got very positive media coverage," said David Chen, executive director of Chinese-American Planning Council, a nonprofit social services agency in Chinatown. "But I think it's an isolated victory rather than a growing trend for Chinatown." 
 Traditionally, Chinatown restaurants have resisted attempts to unionize and mainstream unions have stayed away. Owners would rather close down than deal with unions. The latest such casualty, the East Village in Flushing, Queens, closed in January after some employees tried to unionize.
Even at the height of the Chinatown union movement in the 1980's, only about a dozen restaurants were unionized. Today, except for the Silver Palace, all have closed. (Efforts to organize garment shops are much more successful because of support from pro-union designers and contractors, Mr. Chen said.)
Working conditions remain poor in many Chinese restaurants, said Wing Lam, adviser to the striking workers and executive director of the Chinese Staff and Workers' Association, a Chinatown labor organization. He likened the workers' plight to slavery.
The unions' lack of success is attributed to cultural differences and the economy of Chinatown, where immigrants' desperation for jobs gives employers little incentive to improve working conditions.
To many owners and workers, a union is an unknown concept and is therefore shunned in favor of a more familiar, paternalistic management style. Competition is another factor.
"People come to Chinatown for cheap food," said a Chinatown banquet restaurant owner who did not want his name used. "You can get nine jumbo shrimps for less than $10. You have to pay $20 for the same thing elsewhere. I can only afford to give union benefits if I increased the price."
Until four years ago, before other banquet restaurants emerged, the Silver Palace enjoyed a near-monopoly on banquet business in Chinatown. To keep its competitive edge, the management demanded concessions from the independent union, Local 318 Restaurant Workers Union, when its contract expired in February 1993. It proposed dropping its contribution to the union's medical benefits, laying off workers at its discretion and having waiters share tips with maitre d's. It sought to reduce dim sum workers' pay from about $8.50 to $3 an hour, with a new share in tips. Negotiations broke down and the workers were locked out.
The workers drew support in Chinatown, but the Silver Palace also drew sympathy.
"The Silver Palace was within reason to ask for concessions," said Victor J. Papa, whose organization, the Lower East Side Catholic Area Conference, helped mediate the dispute. "They are paying $500,000 a year in union benefits no other Chinatown restaurants have to. Where is their fairness?"
The union claims victory in its three-year-contract because management will continue to contribute to medical benefits; the dim sum workers will remain on salary only and management must notify the union of layoffs and not use overtime to compensate for laid-off workers. On the downside, the pay of most dim sum workers will be cut by about 30 cents an hour and workers with three weeks vacation will get only two weeks in the first year. JANE LII

An Embarrassment on the Amex

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE American Stock Exchange requires listed companies to provide financial information to their shareholders. But for nine months, an insider at one Amex company sold his shares while the company kept its bad news secret.
That news, much of which came out last week, includes a default on loans, a two-year lag in filing tax returns, and a lawsuit that could put the company out of business. 
 The company in question is North American Recycling Systems, a small firm based in Fort Edward, N.Y. The company has been losing money at a rapid rate, selling assets to stay barely afloat. Its chairman and largest shareholder, Robert Barber, goes on trial tomorrow on charges of bribing a former supervisor in Washington County, N.Y., to get approval for a company plant. The supervisor, William Nikas, who is also a defendant, is now general counsel of North American.
The company's annual report for the fiscal year ended May 31, 1993, was due by the end of August, but was filed with the S.E.C. only last week. Before that, there had been no S.E.C. filings since last April.
During that period, the Amex seems to have done exactly nothing to protect shareholders in the company, although officials knew North American was missing S.E.C. filing deadlines. Amex officials last week refused to be interviewed, but did provide a written statement saying that the decision to allow the company to continue trading was made in light of the fact it had issued a few news releases during the long period when it was delinquent in its S.E.C. filings. Those press releases failed to mention numerous important facts, however, including the existence of a major lawsuit against the company that was filed 14 months ago.
In a brief interview last week, David Norris, the president of North American, said the Amex had not put any pressure on the firm to file its financial statements. He blamed the long delay on the company's former chief financial officer, and said two delinquent quarterly reports would be filed soon.
But while the Amex was doing nothing, John P. McGrain was quite busy. Mr. McGrain runs Conversion Industries, another Amex listing whose business is finding small companies and, in return for a cut of the equity, taking them public. That is how North American went public in 1992. Mr. McGrain is a director of North American and a member of its executive and audit committees, and, Mr. Norris said, was kept fully informed of the company's situation.
Mr. McGrain sold North American stock in the open market in July, October, November and December of 1993, and in January of this year. Reports of such sales by directors are due by the tenth day of the month following the sale, but Mr. McGrain did not get around to filing any of his reports until last month. Early this month, he advised the S.E.C. of his intent to sell still more shares. If those sales went through, as appears likely, he took in about $400,000 selling 73,728 shares, the bulk of his holdings, for an average price of about $5.38 per share. Conversion also was a seller of 5,000 shares at an average price of $4.38.
It is illegal for a director to sell stock in a company while in possession of material non-public information. How does Mr. McGrain justify his actions? We don't know, because he did not return repeated phone calls. Donald Clark, the No. 2 man at Conversion, dismissed the Conversion sales as being so small they would not be of "any concern to anybody," but he said he could not speak for Mr. McGrain. Late Friday, someone dumped 110,000 shares of stock at $5 a share, 75 cents below the market price at the time. Mr. Clark said the seller was not Conversion.
The legal problems besetting Mr. Barber, the company's chairman, and Mr. Nikas, the company's general counsel, stem from the period in the mid-1980's when Nr. Nikas was a supervisor of Washington County, a dairy-farming region with 55,000 residents north of Albany. He also served as chairman of the county's solid-waste committee.
In those roles, he led the negotiations with Mr. Barber for the construction of a trash-burning plant in the county, to be owned partly by North American. The county promised to cover losses if not enough trash came in, a promise that is costing it a lot of money.
The bribery and conspiracy charges against the two men claim that during the same period Mr. Nikas provided legal services to Mr. Barber and companies he controlled, and was promised an interest in other companies Mr. Barber was starting, without disclosing such conflects of interest.
In a news release last week, North American expressed confidence that the two men would be exonerated, and added that the company "is not affected and has no liability with regard to the pending litigation."
That is not the way E. Stewart Jones Jr. sees it. Mr. Jones, who is representing Mr. Nikas in the matter, says the criminal charges are part of an effort by Washington County to get out of its contract. "It has worked out economically badly for the county, and they are taking a financial hit," he said, adding that the county hopes that a conviction will lead to its victory in a civil racketeering suit filed in early 1993 against the two men, North American, and other defendants, seeking damages of more than $10 million.
North American now has a negative net worth of $3.9 million. One of the loans that is in default has been extended only through next month. Its auditor has questioned its ability to continue as a going concern. But its stock price has held up remarkably well, falling just 25 cents to $5.625 last week, giving it a total value of $30 million. Whether it will hold up after the annual report is more fully disseminated remains to be seen.
But what is clear is that the Amex gave its good name to the stock by continuing to trade it for months and months while complete and accurate finanacial information was available only to corporate insiders. And that allowed one of those insiders to get out while the getting was good.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 3, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Wall Street column on March 20, about trading in shares of North American Recycling Systems, misstated the date of certain disclosures by the company. It was in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 1993, not last month, that North American first disclosed a civil suit accusing it and other defendants of racketeering violations.

HEADLINE: Health Coverage Declining

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
FUELED by cuts in coverage among small businesses, the number of workers without health insurance on Long Island is steadily growing. So are business owners' worries.
Last year 11.5 percent of the 1.3 million workers in Nassau and Suffolk Counties had no health insurance, according to the State Health Department division of planning, policy and resource development. That is up from 11.2 percent in 1992 and 8.9 percent in 1990. 
 The increase was most dramatic for businesses with fewer than 25 employees. Of the more than 425,000 people who worked in those enterprises last year 20 percent were uninsured. That is, proportionally, up a third from 1992 and two-thirds from 1990.
Among the 1.7 million Long Islanders in the traditional working age of 18 to 64, 14.5 percent had no insurance last year, up from 13.3 percent in 1992 and 9.1 in 1990. "It's clearly a significant problem and will remain a significant problem," said Matthew Crosson, president of the Long Island Association.
"Health insurance is everybody's No. 1 biggest problem," said Kathy Adams, president of the Long Island chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners, a group with about 100 members on the Island.
The problems grew in the late 1980's, when costs soared and the economy soured. Many business owners began requiring employees to pay part of their premiums or started replacing permanent with uncovered temporary workers.
Although cost increases last year were half those of the late 1980's owners still regarded them as excessive and apparently continued to cut coverage as the number of uninsured workers continued to rise.
Insurers generally show little sympathy for the plight of business owners. "Those employers who do not provide health insurance are receiving an unearned largess," said the director of the New York office of the Health Insurance Association of America, Stephen Young. The association represents 275 companies. Uninsured workers, Mr. Young said, still receive treatment. To pay for that, he added, health centers charge extremely high rates for insured services, driving up premiums and placing a special burden on private insurers.
"You have a system where people are perceived of as having deep pockets," Mr. Young said.
Premiums, he said, have also increased, because of changes in state law requiring insurers to offer to cover everyone regardless of medical condition.
 
Higher Premiums in the Northeast
 Like the owners, he said, his association opposed mandatory regional alliances. But unlike the owners the trade group supports legislation requiring employers to pay most of the cost of health insurance. That would maintain an adequate flow of premiums and reduce increases in rates dramatically, Mr. Young said, adding that without changes that included employer mandates "it would be a very disillusioning experience for the American public."
In recent weeks Congressional committees and an army of interested parties in Washington have begun debating proposals for universal health insurance. The resulting legislation could be a problem for business owners, they say, if it requires them to buy insurance without adequately controlling costs.
Employers in the Northeast paid an average 10 percent more last year than in 1992 for premiums, or more than $4,000 an employee, according to a survey by Foster Higgins, a benefits-consultant in Manhattan.
"It's like madness," said Phyllis Hill Slater, who owns a paraprofessional engineering company, Hill Slater Inc., in Deer Park and advises the Long Island Association on minority affairs. "It's out of hand."
Ms. Slater's company, which her father founded 25 years ago, employs an average of 23 people, of whom six have insurance.
For years the company paid the full premium. But with huge increases in costs -- in one six-month period the premium rose 40 percent -- employees began paying part of the bill.
 
'They Are Brazen'
 In the last few years, Ms. Slater said, she has contracted with three or four insurers, none of whom offered assurances that they would not raise rates quickly.
All did.
"They are brazen," Ms. Slater said.
Costs have risen so much, Ms. Slater said, that some colleagues have stopped health insurance. "A lot of people are not even dealing with it. They're taking their chances and not even offering it."
She added that some engineers who had lost their jobs and were earning much less as consultants were forgoing insurance rather than pay high individual rates.
Some people pay more than $10,000 a year for insurance, according to Ms. Adams, a partner in the accounting firm of Adams & Jaskot in Commack. As an individual, she said, she pays $600 a month, or more than double the 1987 rate. "And the policies are not good," she added.
Often the first question prospective members ask Ms. Adams is whether her group offers health insurance. "Most small businesses can't afford to pay premiums for their employees," she said. "Part-time employees often have no coverage."
To combat the problem, the Long Island Association is forming a health-insurance purchasing cooperative through which businesses with fewer than 50 employees in Nassau or Suffolk Counties could buy coverage.
In forming the cooperative, which could serve 800,000 workers and their dependents, the business group hopes "to be ahead of the wave" of insurance legislation, Mr. Crosson said.
The cooperative could show that by creating a sufficiently large pool to increase purchasing power, small businesses could wrest control of the market from the insurance companies, said Stanley Altman, the health-finance adviser to the president of the State University at Stony Brook. "They are moving to fill a vacuum that exists now," Mr. Altman said.
"It's especially important because of the importance of small business to Long Island," said Manny London, director for the Center for Human Resources Management at Stony Brook.
 
Groupings Under State Rules
 The coop would negotiate with, perhaps, 15 insurers and providers offering community-rated policies, Mr. Crosson said. New state rules require that insurers charge all individuals or businesses with fewer than 50 employees rates based on a formula that groups Nassau and Suffolk with Westchester and the five counties of New York City.
By serving just Nassau and Suffolk, the cooperative would reduce costs, Mr. Crosson said.
Last year, he added, Long Islanders paid an additional $40 million in premiums because their rates were tied to the city, where medical costs are higher.
That figure could quadruple this year, he said, and the situation could worsen if proposals to include the Island with the city in a regional health alliance become law.
The coop would also reduce premiums if insurers pass on savings they achieve in marketing costs, Mr. Crosson added.
Mr. Altman said a committee that he is on has been meeting to establish bylaws for the coop.
The association hopes to begin operation by June 1, Mr. Crosson said, adding that initial reaction from small business owners had been positive.
"We'd definitely be interested," Ms. Adams said. "If it's cheaper than what they have people will look at it."
"I think it would make prices come down," Ms. Slater said. "I'm just so crazy with anything that's mandated."
 
What Decline Indicates
 EVEN as the number of Long Island workers without health insurance increased last year, the number of Islanders overall without such insurance declined.
The proportion of uninsured people in the general population of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which had increased to 11.5 percent in 1992 from 7.3 percent in 1990, dropped last year, to 10.8 percent, according to the State Health Department.
 The decline, department planners say, was less the good news of more insured people than an indicator of spreading poverty in an aging population.
More people, proportionally, have qualified for public insurance in Nassau and Suffolk in each of the last four years. The number receiving Medicaid and Medicare last year increased to 440,000, or 17.1 percent of the population. That is up from 374,000, or 13.7 percent in 1990.
More people also received private insurance last year after declines since 1990. The increase, planners said, was partly a result of increasing involvement by health maintenance organizations with poor or elderly patients, whom the H.M.O.'s have aggressively recruited.
Last year the proportion of uninsured New Yorkers increased, to 13.5 percent across the state. In that context, the decline in the number of Long Islanders without health insurance last year was a slight fluctuation, said Deborah Traynor, associate planner in the Health Department.
Between 1990 and last year, said Ms. Traynor, who is in charge of research on the uninsured, the number of Long Islanders without insurance increased 38 percent, to more than 276,000.
She added, "There is a definite increase over time." PHILLIP LUTZ

HEADLINE: Sun City Builder Mounting a South Carolina Venture

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE 

DATELINE: BLUFFTON, S.C.

 BODY:
THE Del Webb Corporation, builder of several large retirement communities in the West, has embarked on its first project in the East: a 5,100-acre, 8,000-detached-home development near this coastal Carolina community 12 miles west of Hilton Head Island.
The $110 million project is considered a major boost to this state's southeastern sector, known as Lowcountry, a region facing an uncertain future with the imminent closing of the Charleston Naval Base. Government leaders say the project is as vital an economic stimulus for that area as the $300 million BMW Manufacturing Corporation plant is for the northwestern industrial quadrant of the state. 
 It also enhances the image of South Carolina as a good place to retire, a major goal of the state's government.
"The Del Webb project gets the attention of lots of other people in that business and prospective retirees," said Patrick Mason, the executive director of the Center for Carolina Living, a private association working to advance the retirement industry here. "It causes a definite lowering of the fear barrier to go to the Deep South."
Already, Mr. Mason said, he knows of several retirement projects being planned for the rural communities near the so-called "Sun City East" site -- the project has yet to be formally named -- although they are much smaller, between 200 and 400 acres.
Del Webb, the Phoenix-based developer of five Sun City communities in arid regions in the Southwest, faces a new challenge in carving a city from a pine tree farm in the humid, subtropical South. The land will be developed in phases over the next 17 to 19 years. When the project is built out, a population of 17,000 people aged 55 or older is anticipated.
Groundbreaking for the first phase of 1,700 houses is scheduled for May, with first move-ins expected a year later. There are to be 15 floor plans for houses of 1,000 to 2,800 square feet, priced in the $90,000 to high-$200,000 range but averaging about $140,000.
The project is far less dense than other Del Webb developments, with about 1.5 units per acre compared with three per acre at the first Sun City, about 12 miles northwest of Phoenix. Begun in 1960, it was a new concept in retirement living, a full-scale recreation complex with 10 golf courses and 26,000 homes on 8,900 acres.
The late Del E. Webb, the company's founder and a former owner of the New York Yankees, gambled on the active retirement concept, which had bankers wondering whether they wanted to risk a 30-year mortgage on a 50-year-old. But by the end of the first year, Mr. Webb had sold 1,300 units, and the business was launched.
Mr. Webb died in 1974 and company officials began to sell many of the company's assets to resolve financial troubles and to concentrate on retirement communities. Since then, the corporation has built four more communities: a smaller complex also near Phoenix plus others in Tucson, Las Vegas and Palm Springs. A 1,200-acre development near Sacramento, Calif., is under way. A project outside of Austin, Tex., is also being considered.
Philip J. Dion, Del Webb's chairman, said the expansion was part of what the company calls "Webb Across America" that came about following an in-house study showing that about 90 percent of those surveyed wanted to retire within a short distance from the homes they had lived in while they worked.
As a result of the study, the corporation began looking for sites outside of the Southwest in 1989.
Said Leon Harper, a senior program specialist for the American Association of Retired Persons: "It is a harder sell to get people to give up their homes to go into retirement communities."
A 1986 AARP study showed 78 percent of those polled wanted to stay in their own homes after retirement. In 1993, in another study by the association, 85 percent said they did not want to move. That preference has caused a distinct shakeout among developers of retirement communities, with the weaker companies selling out to the stronger ones, Mr. Harper said.
"There is a market for the upscale older person, but it's not as large as people thought it would be," said Mr. Harper. "It's just not one that can encompass the whole country. Instead of running to Florida or Arizona, the new retirement havens are North Carolina and South Carolina and New Jersey."
But Mr. Harper said Del Webb is in a category of its own: He knows of no other company that launches projects on such a grand scale. In all, Del Webb's five existing projects will at build-out include nearly 68,000 homes. The original Sun City is so large it merits its own zip code.
The South Carolina coast is peppered with expensive retirement communities, said Mr. Mason of the Center for Carolina Living, with home prices averaging around $250,000.
"Del Webb is building Chevies and Buicks, not Rolls-Royces, which is what is mostly in place now in South Carolina," he said. "Others have planned for the high-end profile, with Pete Dye golf courses and palaces but the vast majority of people don't want to spend more than $175,000."
It is expected to take the company 9 to 12 months to build the golf course, recreation center, roads and model homes, Mr. Dion said. The company is trying to tie its marketing to the success of the large nearby boot-shaped Hilton Head Island, which has been carved into numerous upscale "plantations" for second-home owners and retirees.
Although Del Webb's land is more than 12 miles from the ocean, the company's 1993 annual report shows John H. Gleason, a Del Webb vice president, standing at the edge of the Atlantic as the sun rises behind him. Company officials regularly refer to the project as "Sun City-Hilton Head."
The land actually straddles a link now under construction from Interstate 95 near Hardeeville to Route 278, which runs southeast to Hilton Head. The project will be as close to historic Savannah, Ga., and stately Beaufort, S.C., as it is to Hilton Head.
ITS major water artery is what is called "The Great Swamp," which the company will try to develop as an amenity by erecting boardwalks for bird watchers, joggers and walkers.
The swamp, plus the trees, mostly loblolly pines, have posed a new challenge for Del Webb planners, who usually plan for tracts that are 100 percent developable. Thirty percent of the South Carolina property is wetlands.
Nevertheless, all the building permits have already been obtained, said Mr. Dion, the Del Webb chairman, and a temporary sales office has been established near the site in Bluffton. The homes will be built on the same theme as most South Carolina Lowcountry homes, with muted colors, clapboard exteriors, porches and steep roofs. Out west, most of the Sun City homes are of stucco and have tile roofs.
Mr. Mason said the state estimates that the net economic impact of Sun City would be $1.2 billion. A number of retail and other commercial ventures are already being planned for the area.
"This project requires no new schools," said Mr. Mason. "It's clean. It creates a community where there is a very low tax base now. It's as big as a Mercedes or a BMW plant coming to the area."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 10, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 20 about a planned retirement community in South Carolina referred incorrectly to the previous activity of the developer, the Del Webb Corporation. The South Carolina development is not Del Webb's first project in the East; the company built Sun City Center south of Tampa, Fla., in 1962 and sold it eight years later.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
Recession-Influenced Dining

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
WHEN Pollo Pazzo opens in Huntington Village in the spring and Route 66 follows a few months later in Merrick, they will mirror a now familiar pattern. Like the soon-to-open Caswell's in Montauk and Calaluna in Southampton, they are casual restaurants that plan to serve earthy substantial food and, above all, stress value.
Pollo Pazzo, or crazy chicken, an eat-in carry-out combination, will feature flattened boneless chicken marinated in rosemary, garlic and olive oil and grilled on an open fire. Route 66 is billing itself as a Texas steakhouse offering Southwestern-style beef and ribs. 
 Caswell's, an informal rotisserie restaurant and carry-out, and Calaluna, a Sardinian restaurant offering ethnic peasant fare, also conform to the recession-born trend.
Luxurious, pricey and ostentatious restaurants are out, as are nouveau and nouvelle. Good-size portions of simple satisfying food served with flair and imagination at easily affordable prices are in. Restaurateurs opening places are well aware of the preferences of the Island's frugal diners.
 
Uncomplicated Food a Lure
 The continuing downward pressure on prices has inspired a sucession of restaurant-markets, takeouts, delicatessens and bakery amalgams. They lure penny-wise diners with tasty uncomplicated food that depends on good ingredients, modest surroundings and reasonable prices.
Bairrada, a Portuguese storefront barbecue in Mineola, is part of the new wave. So is the new Major's in East Williston, where a 24-ounce steak costs $10.95.
Although high-quality midprice restaurants continue to open in Nassau and Suffolk, not since East Hampton Point opened nearly a year ago has a luxurious, big-deal spot ventured forth.
The 15-seat Pollo Pazzo at 366 New York Avenue, with its terra cotta floor, white tile walls and chickens' grilling in the window, is typical of the new breed. Its chicken is served with basil mashed potatoes or polenta.
Aside from grilled chicken, the scant menu offers spaghetti with tomato sauce or meat balls and lasagna. Gelato for dessert and six focaccia sandwiches, including grilled tuna, roast vegetables, veal and chicken breasts with arugula, are the only other possibilities.
 
Bicycle-Delivery Fleet
 All the dishes are available to be eaten in, taken out or delivered via a small fleet of red bicycles. The economical 900-square-foot Pollo Pazzo is being opened by Fabio Machado, who also owns the four Pomodoro restaurants of Long Island and Manhattan.
The 120-seat Route 66 at 33 West Sunrise Highway in Merrick is the latest venture of George Korten, a restaurateur who has been associated with slightly pricier operations like George Martin's in Rockville Centre and Mim's in Syosset. Mr. Korten says Route 66, which is scheduled to open in June, "will be a retro-Texas roadside cafe that recreates a 1940's or 50's roadhouse along Route 66."
Prime steaks, grilled meats, barbecue, regional Southwestern dishes and cutting-edge Mexican cuisine will be featured. Entrees will range from $12 to $23 and average around $14 or $15.
The rustic rough-and-ready decor will resemble Main Street America of another day, with its roadhouse-red booths, jukebox and wood paneling. It is being designed by James Bieber, who was architect for the Mesa Grill and Gotham Grill in Manhattan.
POTPOURRI Diners at 107 Forest Avenue in Locust Valley are contributing $200 a month to hungry people. Donations to the Food and Hunger Hot Line are made possible by a menu listing called the Hungry New Yorker. It enables customers to earmark $5 at lunch and $10 at dinner.
Most contributions are charged on credit cards. The restaurant absorbs the credit-card fee and sends the entire donation to the hot line. Andrea Buffa, a social worker who runs a shelter for the homeless in San Francisco and is a sister of John Buffa, the co-owner of the restaurant, suggested the project, the only one of its kind on Long Island.
Tom Shudel, the chef and the other owner at 107 Forest Avenue, will shuttle between Locust Valley and the Downtown Grill in Montauk in the warm weather. He will spend his weekends on the East End and weekdays in Nassau County, alternating with Noelle Iffhin, his sous chef.
Pomadoro, of Huntington and Port Washington, is opening a second restaurant in Manhattan, at 1424 Third Avenue, at 81st Street (212-794-1810). The commonly owned Trattoria Tulipano in Huntington, Stresa in Manhasset and Navona in Great Neck have hired two chefs from Italy. Carlo Gobbi from Lossa Maggiore Restaurant at the Milan Airport is the new executive chef at Tulipano. Ginni Bugivrolli of Hotel de la Poste in Cortina will see service at both Stresa and Navona. Stresa, like Navona, is now open daily.
Caffe Milano in Woodmere has been sold and will reopen in mid-April as Carmelinas. Antonio and Carmelina Zubo, who were formerly associated with Il Bagatto in Valley Stream, are the new owners of the restaurant at 1034 Broadway (569-7604). A four-week redecoration that includes carpeting, painting and an enlargement of the bar area is in progress. Carmelinas will continue to make use of the restaurant's wood-burning pizza oven.
WINE TASTINGS 107 Forest Avenue in Locust Valley (674-3441) is holding a four-course $65 California wine dinner at 7:15 P.M. tomorrow. Frog's Leap, Sonoma Cutrer, Caymus and Deloach wines will be poured, and dishes like bouillabaisse of salmon with shrimp, scallops and garlic toasts will be served.
San Marco Restaurant, 658 Motor Parkway, Hauppauge (273-0088), will hold a Winter's Gourmet Dinner accompanied by California wines from Franciscan Vineyards on Wednesday at 7 P.M. The five-course $49.95 meal includes a veal-and-chicken Calvados main course.
The fourth Windows on Long Island wine tasting will be at Brightwater's at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan on May 10 at 6 P.M. The two-hour event sponsored by the Long Island Wine Council attracts more than 1,000 people each year and features the wines of all 16 Long Island vineyards, as well as hors d'oeuvres from 15 to 20 leading restaurants. All participants receive a souvenir tasting glass and a program booklet. Tickets, priced at $45, will go on sale on March 31. They can be ordered by calling 475-5492 or (800) 464-L-I-W-C.
CHANGES Danford's Inn of Port Jefferson has been undergoing major changes since the Fisher Hotels Group took over its management. A completely new menu, a resumption of wine-tasting dinners and new murder-mystery weekends that include dinner are intended to spark the waterfront property, which encountered financial problems last year.
Andrew Seaman, the new food and beverage manager from the Tarrytown Conference Center, has wisely retained Stephen Meade as executive chef. His new menu lists just two holdovers, lobster ravioli and penne jambalaya.
The new entrees, priced from $17.95 to $23.95, include pork medallions served with port-wine sauce and grilled leeks and a seafood mixed grill with grilled salmon, seafood sausage and shrimp.
When the Basil Leaf in Locust Valley reopened in mid-November, it retained its name and telephone number (676-6252), but that is all. The original restaurant at the Plaza Shopping Center had closed, and its owner had departed when Dino Ferrari and Vito Patronelli moved in and began a two-month renovation.
Mr. Ferrari, who is in the Italian clothing business, and Mr. Patronelli an olive oil importer, changed the decor, chef, menu and style. What had been an eclectic casual Italian-American cafe has become a more sophisticated restaurant.
The new husband-and-wife cooking team, Mario and Tina Maggi from Milan, worked at Bice in Manhattan, Chicago and Tokyo, as well as Trattoria Tulipano in Huntington, before moving to Locust Valley.
Entrees at the new restaurant are in the $12.95-to-$22.95 range. Among the five or six nightly seafood specials, a lobster antipasto and crab cakes have proved especially popular.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Debate the Insurability of Bone-Marrow Transplants

BYLINE: By CHERYL P. WEINSTOCK

 BODY:
SPEAKING at a meeting of the American Bar Association in New York City, Kathy A. Cochran of the law firm of Wilson, Smith, Cochran & Dickerson in Seattle described why she thought there were no "evil forces at work" when often refuse to pay for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone-marrow transplants in breast-cancer cases.
"Skeptics argue that treatment for desperately ill women should not await the rigors of scientific scrutiny, as these women do not have the time to wait for science to prove the treatment. Much the same would have been said by women who received radical mastectomies at the hands of enthusiastic surgeons convinced that this was the 'only cure' for their breast cancer. Unfortunately science later proved this to be untrue in many cases."
Ms. Cochran said it was paradoxical that customers should criticize insurers for failing to reimburse a treatment that, some companies say, has not proved to be superior.
Another lawyer, L. Susan Slavin of Slavin & Steinberg, said that in most cases insurers cited contractual agreements that really did not limit the procedure, because it is merely an extension of high-dose chemotherapy, which is usually covered.
"It's just a matter of dollars and cents," Ms. Slavin said. "It's an expensive procedure, and every time they say no to it they save $150,000."
On Long Island, where the incidence of breast cancer is higher than the statewide average, the battle is frequently played out. Those women with advanced breast cancer who have been told by their physicians that they have no treatment options other than transplants and whose insurers have refused to pay for the procedure are being encouraged by advocacy groups to take further action.
Insurance companies are fighting back. Liz LoRusso, executive director of one local advocacy group, 1 in 9, said the cases of 11 women seeking reimbursements had gone to litigation and been settled in favor of the patients. Many other battles have been fought over the telephone and through the mail, she added.
"Two to three years ago there were no attorneys trained to help us fight," Ms. LoRusso said. "Now there are. Women with breast cancer are viewed as very weak. Well, we're the strongest people you'll ever find, because we're fighting for our lives. We'll leave no stone unturned."
Arlene Pokorny, 47, of Melville, was given a diagnosis of breast cancer in 1979 and is now fighting her third recurrence. At her physician's urging, she requested clearance from her insurance carrier to pay for transplants.
"I've never been denied anything," Ms. Pokorny said. "Now my life is hanging on a thread. I'm living in terror all the time that they'll say no."
She added that she had hired a lawyer "just in case I'll need one."
After weeks of legal proceedings her insurance company agreed to cover her transplant.
 
Role of Bar Associations
 The chief of psychiatry service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, Dr. Jimmie Holland, said: "I think this adds to the already high sense of vulnerability and uncertainty that women already feel about the disease. It's kind of a betrayal. Anxiety and depression are already felt by women with breast cancer. The need for this kind of fight just compounds it."
Ms. Slavin said she worried about "how many women out there who, when they know their insurance company won't pay for their treatment, just walk away from the fight."
To assist women who have been denied reimbursements for transplants or other procedures or who face other obstacles from their carriers the Nassau and Suffolk Bar Associations will soon distribute brochures to breast-cancer coalitions, doctors' offices, hospitals and clinics announcing their free law program, said Tom Maligno, executive director of the associations. "It's a chance to reach the clients who need us most and a unique opportunity for the health and legal professions to work together," he said.
What remains to be seen, however, is whether legal help will settle differences between carriers and clients. Many insurers say they are prepared to change their contracts and claims reviews to avoid being responsible for procedures like transplants.
Kathy Olson, a spokeswoman for Mutual of Omaha, which insures more than 10 million individual and group policyholders, said there was no way that Mutual could have anticipated the surge in technology. As a result, she said, Mutual will try to clarify its new policies to avoid disputes.
Insurers usually wait for a procedure to be accepted by medical experts before they extend coverage to it. "In the future," Ms. Olson said, "we'll use the percent-success rate of a treatment to measure the success of it, so that there's a clearer understanding of what is experimental."
The associate general counsel of the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Association of Chicago, Mary Ader, said: "We're working for the benefit of the subscribers. Our desire is to cure our patients. We don't want them languishing in hospitals. We want them to live, and live a healthy life."
 
'Sympathy and Concern'
 The associate director of the cancer-therapy-evaluation program at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Michael A. Friedman, said that he had "enormous sympathy and concern" for people who wanted to optimize their chances of living, but that he was not sure that the relentless pressure that patients and their doctors and lawyers put on insurers was in the patients' best interest.
"Look, this is not a story that lends itself to simple truths," he said. "In certain selected situations bone-marrow transplants can be very efficacious. But there are many unanswered questions."
Dr. Friedman cautions patients about being too optimistic about the possibilities of transplants and suggests that they wait for the results of four trials that are under way. The tests are intended to compare the benefits and risks of the procedure to conventional chemotherapy for treating localized breast cancer at high risk of recurrence and metastatic breast cancer.
"Patients should opt for a treatment that's indisputable, one that's ethically and scientifically correct," he said.
From the point of view of many physicians, the criticism of using transplants outside clinical trials for their patients is unfounded. The physician in charge of the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Program at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Dr. Michael Schuster, said:
"The problem is that treatments for all cancers might be viewed as experimental, in the sense that they're constantly evolving, constantly moving forward. The only way we can move forward is to introduce new treatments in the hope that we can cure a larger percentage of patients.
"If third-party payers slam the door on new treatments by using the 'E' word, then no progress will be made. We'd be using the same kind of medicine that we did five years ago."
Health-care economists say physicians are part of the problem in the equation that divides the insured from insurance companies. Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said:
"On the one hand, physicians tell you they were trained in school to fight for their patients and do their best. But they were not trained as guardians of the U.S. Treasury. If there's any hope that something will work, then they are morally obliged to do it.
"On the other hand, you can't run a health system on that algorithm. You have to allow nonphysicians further upstream to actually make the hard calls and not give away the Gross National Product."
Professor Reinhardt suggested that a dispassionate panel of experts intervene when a doctor proposes to treat a patient with a controversial therapy. Many insurance companies have begun to do that, and more say they will follow that route.
 
Use of Independent Panel
 The director of technology assessment and policy for Aetna Health Plans in Hartford, William McGivney, said that in the 20-month period that Aetna has used an independent panel to help it decide financing in more than 100 decisions, one case against it has gone to court.
"We've extended ourselves to meet the needs of our patients," Mr. McGivney said. "If we've got three experts who are saying no to a treatment then we're pretty sure it's not appropriate care for a patient."
Aetna, Prudential and Travelers subscribe to the Medical Care Ombudsman Program in Washington. The director of the program, Grace Powers Monaco, said it promised to provide fast authoritative reviews of treatments. The program will work with a patient and insurer to resolve any issues "in a sensitive and personal matter," she said.
"I think grown-ups have to be grow up about their medical care," Ms. Monaco, a lawyer, said. "They don't want to waste their money and resources on a procedure that can't really provide them with an increased amount of life. I think, unfortunately, we've made a big mistake in this country that we've not educated our children, young people and adults about how to evaluate their medical care options. If you see something like H.D.C./A.B.M.T. depicted in the media as a treatment for one thing you might not understand that it only works in a patient that looks, tastes and smells a certain way. It may not be for you."
 
Votes of Confidence
 Some lawyers say they feel confident about the future. Louis J. Castellano Jr., who successfully represented Joseph Scalamandre in a suit in Federal District Court in Uniondale, said the value in overturning a denial of coverage by Oxford Health Plans Inc. for a transplant for Mr. Scalamandre's wife was that "carriers now notice there was a case tried to conclusion, and the determination was made against the carrier."
That was just one more case that seems to add to "the majority rule in the United States that this treatment is not experimental in most jurisdictions," Mr. Castellano said.
Ms. Ader of Blue Cross-Blue Shield disagreed, saying: "The effect of judicial opinion, as defined by law, is that there's precedent only in jurisdictional issues. Such opinions have no value outside of that jurisdiction. The courts are not required to follow it elsewhere. It is not binding."
In one of the largest challenges to the denial of "investigational chemotherapy," Memorial Sloan-Kettering, in a complaint filed in State Supreme Court, maintains that Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield should be ordered to pay $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages for refusing to cover transplants for cancer patients.
Who will ultimately have the power to make health decisions is certainly going to be a "major issue for the women here,' said Patricia Spicer of Cancer Care in Woodbury, a clinical coordinator for breast-cancer services on Long Island. "This issue has already been coming up more often in our groups, because more doctors are recommending H.D.C./A.B.M.T. early on."

HEADLINE: We Still Have to Do Something About Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Maybe it was best that the balanced-budget amendment was voted down, but there is still a critical need to force the country to mend its profligate ways. I believe the structural deficits of the last decade are almost criminal. Everyone vaguely understands that our debts will be handed down to future generations for them to pay. In the strictest sense, this burden imposes taxation without representation on those generations. They will have no say in how the money is spent, yet they will be responsible for providing the funds. 
 It is a tired argument that says governmental deficits are a small percentage of the economy. More and more of each tax dollar is used to pay interest on the accumulating debt, leaving less and less for productive capital spending. And it is also spurious to claim, as some do, that the practices of the 1980's resulted in 20 million new jobs, since our annual deficits are sufficient to finance, directly or indirectly, 20 million low-paying jobs.
How can we address these deficits? By creating an amendment that allows deficit spending in bad times, but requires that we repay the debt in good times. This would allow Congress to overspend when necessary, but force the country to repay the debt whenever, for example, the economy exceeded a certain growth rate. Such predictability would allow rational planning by taxpayers and financial markets, since both would know that, as things improved, there would be a requirement to pay the bills (through temporarily reduced spending or increased taxes).
Nothing says we cannot experience what South American countries experienced when they took on excessive debt. We are not immune to hyperinflationary pressure. Neither is there any natural law that says the dollar must remain the world's prime currency.

HEADLINE: Gauging the Consequences of Spurning China

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration weighs whether to renew China's "most favored nation" status after the strained visit by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Beijing, legions of American business leaders and Washington lobbyists for industry and trade associations are describing the consequences of withdrawing the designation in near-apocalyptic terms.
But some economists and legislators, pointing to the United States' $22.7 billion trade deficit with China -- second only to its $59.32 billion deficit with Japan -- suggest that much of the oratory about damage to American exports and investment in China is overstated and that higher duties could go some distance toward trimming the trade deficit. 
 In fact, both sides, while summoning considerable data, have shaped their analyses to suit their arguments. Any clear-cut assessment remains elusive.
"Our exports were $9 billion last year to China," said Donald M. Anderson, the president of the United States-China Business Council, a group that promotes trade between the countries. "No one really knows how much they would be hit, but they would be hit because the Chinese would unquestionably retaliate."
Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade economist at Columbia University, does not agree. "All this number-crunching is purely hypothetical," he said. "Would the Chinese retaliate by saying, 'The U.S. wants to play hardball so we'll play hardball' ? That is a vague, general fear, in my view. If they start playing that game, we are a superpower and we have lots of leverage. We have a whole range of punishments and rewards at our command."
The threat of Chinese retaliation against American companies selling to China and what would be a surge in duties on Chinese products exported to this country have rattled industries with large stakes in China and worried trade experts about the broader relationship between the two countries should China's trade privileges be revoked.
By June, President Clinton must decide whether China has made "significant, overall progress" toward improving its human rights record, a condition of an executive order that the President issued last year on renewing China's trade status. Virtually every country with which the United States trades holds most favored status, which results in significantly lower duties on their exports to this country than would otherwise be the case.
The Boeing Company, one of the most influential American manufacturers -- and with orders from China for $3.9 billion in new airplanes -- has led the charge against any change in China's trade status. Last Tuesday, at a panel discussion in Washington sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, Lawrence W. Clarkson, Boeing's corporate vice president for planning and international development, attacked proposals to link renewal of most favored nation status to China's record on human rights.
"Boeing currently has orders for 64 planes for delivery to China with a value of $3.9 billion," Mr. Clarkson said. "These orders, plus an additional $2 billion to $3 billion in near-term potential orders, would be at great risk if M.F.N. was not renewed. During the next 15 years, China will need 800 airplanes worth $40 billion, making it the world's third-largest aviation market."
 
Offering a Bigger Context
 Like many executives who have urged renewal of China's trade privileges, Mr. Clarkson couched his argument in broader social and political terms as well. "We believe strongly that this U.S. trade is contributing to the rapid decentralization and transformation of China's economy, helping millions of Chinese to obtain greater freedom to choose their work, their employer and their place of residence," he said. "As in Taiwan and South Korea, the development of a vigorous middle class will bring the development of social and political freedom for all Chinese more than any other factor."
American industry leaders often say, as some business executives did to Secretary of State Christopher in Beijing on March 13, that 167,000 American jobs depend on trade with China. This figure comes from a Commerce Department estimate that every $1 billion in exports generates 19,000 jobs; thus, the roughly $9 billion in exports to China accounts for 167,000 jobs.
The calculation implies that most if not all of these jobs are in jeopardy if China responds to a cutoff of trade privileges by slashing imports from the United States. But, as economists like Mr. Bhagwati note, this inference is not warranted given the uncertainty of the Chinese response and the complexity and size of trade between the two countries.
Still, Lawrence Chimerine, the chief economist at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based economic and trade policy lobby organization, said cases like Boeing suggest that American manufacturers could lose large chunks of the China market. "I think Japan and Europe would get a lot of orders that we wouldn't get," he said.
 
A Wide Range of Trade
 In 1993, according to the Commerce Department, the United States exported $8.76 billion worth of goods to China, including airplanes, fertilizer, wheat and automobiles. China, during the same period, sold $31.53 billion in goods to this country, products ranging from toys and shoes, to combs and clocks.
Peter T. Mangione, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said that ending China's access to low duties would mean higher shoe prices for Americans because China accounted for one of every two pairs of shoes sold here. "Almost 90 percent of all shoes sold in America are imported," Mr. Mangione said. "And China is by far the largest supplier of imported shoes; it supplies 60 percent of all imported shoes."
Neal M. Soss, the chief economist at CS First Boston, has calculated the potential inflationary impact of revoking China's most favored status. If this trade privilege is denied, he said, the increase on duties on Chinese products imported into this country would fuel inflation by at least 0.15 percent annually. "The slippery slope of protectionism is the reason," he said.
But Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco who has led the campaign in Congress against renewing China's trade status, argues that the size of America's trade deficit with China suggests that China needs American markets.
"China's economic growth depends on preferential access to the United States markets," Ms. Pelosi said. "The deficit is growing. Compound that with cheap labor and you see that they are flooding our markets with products made by people making $24 a month."
Even some supporters of extending China's preferential trade status, however, are concerned about the chilly reception that Mr. Christopher received in Beijing. "Right now I'm a bit fed up," Mr. Anderson of the United States-China Business Council said. "The Chinese could help, and it would be in their interest to help."

HEADLINE: California Race May Be the Key To White House

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., March 18

 BODY:
The most important electoral battle of 1994, they say with metronomic regularity at the White House, is the contest for the governorship of California.
"From President Clinton's point of view," agreed Bob Mulholland of the California Democratic Party, "it's even more important than keeping control of the Senate. If we shoot ourselves in the foot and lose this race -- and we well may -- the Republicans could have 54 electoral votes in their hands." 
 That judgment, which is shared by many here, rests upon the conviction that Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, has a solid chance to defy the odds, win re-election this fall, and set himself up for a 1996 Presidential bid.
For all its recent economic travails and natural disasters, this vast state has the kind of raw political power few have wielded in the long history of the Republic. It is the first state ever with more than 50 House seats. It has grown so much faster in the last three decades than the big states of the East and Midwest that it can now deliver, by itself, one-fifth of the electoral votes needed for victory in a Presidential election.
Winning California "is like hitting a $15 million lottery," said Stuart Spencer, a veteran Republican strategist. "None of the rest is worth more than $2 or $3 million."
The Presidential calendar has just been changed in a way that gives the state even more political leverage. Instead of voting in June, when the race for party nominations is usually all but settled, Californians will now vote in a Presidential primary in March, when it is usually not. And the Republicans, who will presumably have the more interesting primary contest two years from now, intend to keep their winner-take-all rule, which guarantees the victor a huge block of delegates.
Governor Wilson has mounted an impressive comeback after a disastrous start marked by tax increases and fumbles on several important issues, including homosexual rights. His most likely challenger, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, has raised a $5 million war chest but has failed, so far, to project a clear picture of herself and her views.
This week, in a tacit acknowledgment of trouble, Ms. Brown dropped her campaign manager, Teresa Vilmain, and replaced her with Clint Reilly, who is experienced if abrasive.
"Kathleen's ahead a bit in the polls," said Willie L. Brown Jr., the canny and outspoken Democrat who has served for nearly 14 years as Speaker of the California Assembly. "But Pete is the clear favorite. Her campaign has been a mess, enough so that the White House ought to be worried. Wilson wins, he runs in the Presidential primary, and he's on the 1996 ticket, first or second spot. That makes California a whole lot harder for Bill Clinton to carry."
Even if Mr. Wilson decided not to run himself, Mr. Spencer suggested, "they will have to deal with Pete, because he'll have this big state behind him."
Not everyone thinks Mr. Wilson would automatically become so formidable a national force. A member of the California group that went to Washington with Ronald Reagan, speaking on condition of anonymity, predicted that Mr. Wilson would "encounter real credibility problems with the Republican right wing." In addition, the Governor said in announcing his candidacy this month that he had no interest in running for President. But few politicians believe that.
 
One State Becomes Soul of Body Politic
 Mr. Clinton has taken California more seriously as a political base than any other modern Democratic President, traveling here nine times since taking office, sending top aides when he could not come himself and funneling as much money into the state as possible, given the straitened condition of the Federal purse. He won the state in 1992 with only 46 percent of the vote, and the 21 percent that went to Ross Perot may well be up for grabs by the major parties in 1996.
Since World War II, no President who came from a state other than California has carried the state twice except Dwight D. Eisenhower, the all-conquering war hero. Mr. Clinton's task is complicated by the state's anxieties, born of floods, fires and earthquakes, riots and bank failures and military base closings. Californians have become Cassandras, fretting in the sunshine.
While other local industries are flourishing, including biotech, entertainment and computer software, and while reconstruction efforts have given the Los Angeles economy a temporary post-earthquake lift, California has been devastated by base closings and the shrinkage in military procurement. According to a study by the Southern California Edison Company, the state has lost 700 businesses in five years.
The total job loss has been variously estimated at 500,000 to 800,000, and some economists have suggested that 100,000 more may go before the state finally joins the national upturn in the final quarter of this year or the start of 1995. Unemployment stood at 8.7 percent in December while the national figure was 6.4 percent.
The Administration has pledged to spend $19.5 billion on shifting military plants to peacetime production over the next five years, and 20 percent or more of that is earmarked for California. Prohibitions on exporting some computers, computer chips and other high-tech goods made here have been lifted, and a sale of California-made warplanes to Saudi Arabia was approved.
Cabinet members are as thick on the ground as movie moguls in Los Angeles these days, led by Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena and Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, works the Central Valley, which is not unlike his own native Rio Grande Valley. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown flies in at least once a month.
What has helped the President most, politicians of both parties agree, has been his prompt assurances of help and his personal visit after the January earthquake. Statewide, according to the Field Poll, more than two-thirds of voters say Mr. Clinton responded well to that crisis, though 57 percent described his response to the state's overall problems as poor or only fair.
"Clinton is in far better shape here in 1994 than Bush was in 1992, even with all the base closings," said the pollster, Mervin Field. "People give him credit for trying."
Still, Tom Epstein, the White House official who spends his full time worrying about California, acknowledges, "We have only a limited capacity to fix things out there, and if the Southern California economy doesn't come back strong in the next two years, then all the good deeds in the world aren't very likely to save us."
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a first-term Democrat who is heavily favored in her re-election campaign this fall, argues that Mr. Clinton could have done much more. Specifically, she said the President should either defer the next round of base closings or exempt California from it, and improve the defense conversion program.
In the end, said a Democratic campaign consultant who knows the state well, "Clinton may stand or fall in California on whether he can reverse this insidious feeling that the land of dreams has become the land of unrelenting and insoluble problems."
So far at least, the Whitewater affair has cost Mr. Clinton little or nothing here. Kam Kuwata, Senator Feinstein's campaign manager, said, "People out here on the other side of the country don't really understand it." But, he warned, "they do understand words like 'cover-up' and 'subpoena,' so the White House had better stick to this new policy of openness."
 
Staking Out Stand On a Pair of Issues
 Despite praising Mr. Clinton for his help after the earthquake, Governor Wilson complained in an interview this week that the President "keeps saying that California is important, but the problems of our economy have been aggravated, not relieved, by his tax increase, his base closures, his defense cuts and so on."
Mr. Wilson's campaign for re-election is rooted in two issues -- crime and illegal immigration. Like most other California politicians, including Ms. Feinstein and Ms. Brown, Mr. Wilson argues that the Federal Government must help pay for the services the state provides illegal aliens. Such services, including health care and schooling, consume nearly 10 percent of California's $39 billion annual budget, the Governor said.
By all accounts, Mr. Wilson has won support for his position. But he has also suggested barring illegal aliens from some services, and that has proved far more controversial. Ms. Brown called it "heartless and unwise" to try to deny certain medical services and said that would only "fill the state with people with contagious diseases."
 
Name and Images Could Cut 2 Ways
 On crime, Mr. Wilson is clearly in his element. Earlier this month, he signed the "three strikes, you're out" bill, which imposes life sentences after a third serious crime. He wants to build a network of new prisons.
As Mr. Epstein of the White House concedes, "if he can turn this into a referendum on who's the meanest, baddest ex-Marine on the block, he wins, so we have to make Californians think more about jobs and health care and stuff like that."
Ms. Brown, widely expected to be the Democratic nominee for governor, opposes the death penalty but says she would enforce it if elected.
Nevertheless, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the Claremont Graduate School, "like her father, Pat, and her brother, Jerry, like Rose Bird, the Chief Justice who was voted out of office, she is hurt by the notion that she is soft on crime." The problem is worsened, Ms. Jeffe added, by voters' tendency to distrust female candidates on law and order.
"There's no doubt that California is fixated by crime at the moment," Ms. Jeffe said. "It ranks ahead of the economy in the polls of public concerns. The murder of Polly Klaas, the child who was abducted in Petaluma last year, took crime out of the inner city in this state and put it into the middle-class bedroom, where high-turnout, highly independent voters live. A big change."
Ms. Brown readily admits that she faces a close race. She said during a breakfast interview: "It's always tough to take out an incumbent governor. And look at the issues: Pete Wilson is on their hot-button wavelength."
She argued, however, that she could win because Mr. Wilson has raised taxes and presided over an unprecedented era of decline in California.
But Ms. Brown must first clear a primary hurdle. Her opponents, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and State Senator Tom Hayden, are well-known enough but underfinanced. The pollsters and the pundits alike expect her to prevail, though a few give Mr. Garamendi a shot.
There is something of her father's charm about Ms. Brown, and also something of her brother's flakiness. ("Leadership is a circle, not a straight line," she earnestly told an interviewer.) Her fate may depend on which parallel takes hold among the voters.
Despite a raft of position papers and a lead in the polls, she remains little known to the public, professional observers say. Bill Bradley, a Sacramento columnist, says her campaign is "still circling the parking lot." Ms. Jeffe says Ms. Brown is "just waking up to the fact that we elect our governors, we don't anoint them."
Mr. Wilson is a formidable campaigner. He was elected to the Senate in 1982 and 1988 and as governor in 1990 against tough opposition. But his negative ratings in the polls run close to 40 percent, a tough handicap.
Ms. Brown, who has served only one term as Treasurer and a partial term as a school board member, is unproven. She may suffer from that and from what Michael K. Deaver, the old Reagan hand, sees as a possible aversion to three women in the state's top three jobs -- Senator Feinstein and Senator Barbara Boxer being the others.
In the past, the Republicans pulled big votes out of the collar counties around the big cities, like Orange County, the one-time conservative bastion south of Los Angeles. But the big Asian and Mexican immigrations have changed the state's demographics.
"The Hispanics could make or break Wilson," said Mr. Spencer, the Republican strategist. "They may make or break the Republicans nationally. Whoever gets them in the next two cycles will have them for good, just the way F.D.R. got the blacks for the Democrats for good."

HEADLINE: Beijing Says It Could Live Well Even if U.S. Trade Was Cut Off

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 20

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this weekend that the importance of China's trade with the United States had been overstated, and that China was prepared to return to the cold war status of no trade relations with Washington if the dispute over China's human rights record could not be resolved.
"For 23 years before President Nixon opened the door of relations between China and the United States," he said in an interview, "there was no trade whatsoever between China and the United States. 
 "I think you lived quite well. And so did we."
 
Clinton Said to Be 'in a Web'
 Still combative a week after China's brusque welcome and harsh treatment of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mr. Qian said that President Clinton had "enmeshed himself in a web of his own spinning" over the June deadline he had set for China to make "overall significant progress" on human rights or else lose its favorable trade status with the United States.
"If a politician always sets such deadlines," Mr. Qian said, "then he will only have his own hands and feet bound."
Mr. Qian's tone, and that of other senior Chinese officials interviewed in recent days, raises questions of whether Beijing is reconsidering its pledge to "make an effort" to respond to Mr. Clinton's demands on human rights this year, as President Jiang Zemin said in January.
Mr. Qian said China still believed that "progress can be made" on its differences with Washington, provided that discussions took place "on the basis of equality" and mutual respect.
But Mr. Qian, other Chinese officials and Western diplomats were at a loss to describe how negotiations would proceed in the 10 weeks before the June 3 deadline.
Most analysts here are somewhat baffled over China's apparently sudden decision to confront Washington over its admonitions that time is running out before Mr. Christopher must recommend whether to renew or withdraw China's "most favored nation" trade status.
That status, which has been under contentious review in Washington each year since the military crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989, entitles China to export to the American market on a low-tariff basis like most other trading partners of the United States.
After Mr. Christopher's visit, analysts here saw two possibilities as the most likely explanation for Chinese behavior.
One is that China's leadership is seeking to demonstrate its strength internally by showing a determination to stand up to the United States. From such a position of strength, any concessions on human rights would be easier to sell to hard-liners at home.
The other possibility is that China's hard-liners have already persuaded President Jiang that he does not have to make any concessions to Washington on human rights, because a combination of political and economic pressures at home will force President Clinton to renew China's trade status in June even without evidence of significant progress on human rights.
 
The Whitewater Factor
 Some analysts have suggested that another factor is the Whitewater investigation. One senior Foreign Ministry official spent much of his time during a luncheon with an American journalist last week seeking to understand what potential the Whitewater matter held for weakening Mr. Clinton's presidency and his ability to conduct foreign policy.
In an interview on Saturday evening, Mr. Qian appeared to be softening his earlier criticisms of Mr. Christopher's mission. He said the meetings during the Secretary's four-day visit had "yielded some results" and had not been a waste of time because they afforded Mr. Christopher a chance to reacquaint himself with China after an absence of 10 years.
He said China understood that the United States, by setting conditions for human rights improvement, was seeking to move United States-China relations out of the shadow of the Tiananmen Square massacre to a new stage of cooperation.
"I believe the U.S. side wants to do that," Mr. Qian said, "and I hope that the U.S. side will be successful in doing that." But he offered no specific commitment that China would contribute further to the diplomatic bargain.
Restating what has become a boilerplate phrase for Chinese leaders, he said China was hoping for the best, but prepared for the worst.
Mr. Qian and other senior Chinese officials have begun to play down the consequences of losing trade privileges in the American market.
A senior economist and research director for China's State Council, the cabinet-level body under Prime Minister Li Peng, said in an interview last week that a loss of trade status in the United States would seriously affect only 10 percent of China's exports.
The research director, Sun Shang qing, said that all of the affected exports could be redirected to Asian markets this year, and that even with the disruption, China's economy would still meet its 9 percent growth target for the year.
Addressing the same point, Mr. Qian said: "The United States often says that in its trade with China, China runs a $20 billion surplus. However, such a conclusion is not all that correct."
Much of that trade originates with Hong Kong, Taiwanese and other foreign-financed enterprises, including American joint ventures, set up in China to export to the American market, he said. Thus economic damage from a cancellation of China's trade privileges would have an impact on Hong Kong, Taiwan and American investors in China.
 
U.S. Businesses' Stand Recalled
 "That is why when Secretary Christopher met with representatives of the big companies of the United States" during his visit to Beijing, "all of them voiced their strong opposition to the revoking" of China's trade status, the Foreign Minister said.
Some estimates have characterized the loss of China's most-favored-nation trade status in more severe terms for the Chinese. A World Bank study says that raising the average tariff on Chinese export goods by 5 to 10 times would reduce exports to the United States between 42 and 96 percent. The problem of redirecting these exports to other markets was not addressed by the study.
The United States exports about $9 billion a year in goods to China, and any retaliatory step by China could put that trade at risk, along with the 200,000 American jobs that are estimated to depend on it.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
CHRISTOPHER ON CHINA TRIP
 WASHINGTON, March 20 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that on his trip to Beijing he had sought to carry out Congressional policy toward China and that he had the "full concurrence" of President Clinton.
Mr. Christopher, appearing on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," denied Chinese assertions that Beijing had asked that he postpone his trip.
"There was never any request that I not come," he said. "It's just a bit of Chinese disinformation, apparently, to perhaps justify the rough treatment."

HEADLINE: Empty Shelves, Empty Minds;
Budget Problems Drain Libraries of Their Lifeblood: Books

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
At the Bloomingdale branch of the New York Public Library, a teen-ager asked for Richard Wright's "Black Boy," a toddler requested "The Little Engine That Could" and a businessman asked for any of several computer books. None of the books were available.
The Bloomingdale branch, like others in the city's library system, is suffering from too many empty spaces. In field after field and collection after collection, the branch, at 150 West 100th Street, finds it has a dearth of the books people most want. It is a condition that Paul LeClerc, president of the Public Library, worries will result in "sclerosis of the collections" as critical books go unacquired, unrepaired or unreplaced. 
 And the problem has been made more evident by the library's success in another area: longer hours of operation since a sixth day was added to the weekly schedule in September. Even as attendance at the Bloomingdale branch leaped 16 percent in the first quarter of full operation, circulation climbed just 7.9 percent.
 
'A Second Chance'
 Statistics only hint at the story. "It's heartbreaking to have students come in to do their homework and not be able to give them the materials," said Becky Koppelman, the children's librarian at the Bloomingdale branch. "And they're not always going to let you give them a second chance."
This oft-repeated situation, librarians say, is a direct result of a reduction by nearly half in the libraries' budget for materials -- mainly books -- over five years. At the same time, book costs have raced ahead of general inflation. Librarians say books are less well made and wear out faster; computers and new library technology divert money from books, and school libraries are suffering from their own shortage of funds.
"Many of the public-school libraries are really nonexistent," said Jean Paul Michaud, the Public Library's coordinator of information and reference services. "In many ways, public libraries have really become school libraries."
It is the same story all over the New York Public Library system, which serves Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. Funds for materials plunged from $7.4 million in 1989 to $5.3 million this year. And $3.9 million is the amount in the city's preliminary budget for next year. Annual spending has droppedto a proposed $1.26 per capita from $2.52.
 
'It's Beyond Crisis'
 Similar cuts have hit the separate library systems in Queens and Brooklyn. "It's beyond crisis," said Barbara Genco, chief new-book buyer for the Brooklyn Public Library. "It's an implosion."
Accordingly, libraries are pushing for a return to 1990 financing levels; officials of the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani have met with representatives of the three systems to explore methods of raising more money from the private sector, and the City Council held hearings this month on book funds.
"Libraries are an integral part of a good society," said Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for planning and community relations. "You build neighborhoods around libraries. The question is not whether you fund them. The question is how you fund them."
The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said, "You can be sure that every Council delegation from every borough feels very strongly about its libraries."
Typical is Councilwoman Kathryn Freed, who gave $2,500 to each of the two library branches in her lower Manhattan district to buy books. "It's nice we have them open six days a week, but what good are they if there are no books?" she asked.
The Bloomingdale branch is typical of the 205 branches in the city in that it must serve multiple needs and constituencies. It serves older readers with large-print books and serves children with sturdy picture books. Students from public, private and parochial schools use it. The branch offers books in Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese and Creole as well as English.
"It's really a microcosm of the city's population," said Telza Gardner, the branch's head librarian. "What they have in common is that they all expect to see some books."
But where once there were three shelves of sports books, there is now a half shelf and gaping open space. There were five dinosaur books on a recent day, compared with three dozen a few years ago. Best sellers, once staples, are now sought-after gems. Even dictionaries, which many library users do not have in their own homes, are in short supply.
"We're going to have to make some hard choices between popular reading and the needs for school materials," said Constance Cooke, director of the Queens Borough Public Library.
Library funds both for personnel and materials were cut back in the early years of the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins, who later fulfilled a promise to restore service, which had been cut back to two or three days a week at most branches. In 1992, he succeeded in having service returned to five days at most branches. A year later, most expanded to six.
The increased funds were earmarked for longer hours, meaning mainly more staff members, and not books. Increased hours prompted greater circulation as people flocked back. But then the effect of longer hours boomeranged, and circulation actually fell by more than 5 percent after a sixth day was added at most branches.
"The people who came more often began to find less," said Donald Kaplan, a spokesman for the Brooklyn Public Library. "They've read everything."
Ellen Loughran, a top official in the Brooklyn system, explained, "We have libraries that are open twice as much as they were last year, and they probably have 15 to 20 to 25 percent fewer books."
New York's experience is not singular. Nationally, "libraries have gone through a real period of drought in the past five years or so," said George Needham, executive director of the Public Library Association.
The effects may be irreversible. "When there's a huge gap for a number of years, many books will go out of print and will never be available in public libraries," Mr. Needham said. "You lose a generation."
Mr. Needham cited recent Federal tax-law interpretations that have caused publishers to drastically cut inventories that might have been used for replacement.
At the same time, Mr. Needham's association calculates that people keep demanding more and more books, even as their availability shrinks. Each year, he said, circulation grows by 6 to 7 percent, making overall public library circulation around 1.6 billion books.
This wide use, he said, makes libraries big winners in local ballot initiatives. He said nearly three-quarters are successful. Given this popularity, smaller libraries in more affluent areas are often very well financed.
According to the Public Library Association, the Middle County Library on Long Island received $13.85 per capita for materials, Boston libraries got $10.81 and Cleveland's $12.92 in 1992. In the same year, Queens libraries received $2.72, Brooklyn's $2.15 and the New York system's $2.01.
 
Loyalty Is an Issue
 Jerry Nichols, director of the Suffolk County Cooperative Library System, which claims to be the country's biggest, said local municipalities vote on library budgets in both Suffolk and Nassau counties. "Because of this, there's a great deal of loyalty to their institutions," he said.
And he said the resulting investment is critical to maintain a library's usefulness. "If there's no investment in libraries, people will stop using them," he said.
Despite the availability of such items as videos in many libraries, books continue to be the biggest draw. A recent Gallup poll conducted for the New York Public Library showed teen-agers preferred wider book availability to more hours by a 31 to 24 percent margin.
"That's one of the most reassuring pieces of news about that generation that you could hope for," Mr. LeClerc said. "There are so many false stereotypes out there about the non-reading habits of the American public."
Libraries are shaving expenses wherever they can, though often with a two-edged blade. Paperback books are less expensive, for example, but wear out more quickly. Books are still occasionally rebound, but the process costs as much as new books and the result can be unpopular with readers. Computer technology offers the prospect of centralized information, but the initial investment is often large.
At the Bloomingdale branch, where Dr. Seuss's "Cat in the Hat" is almost never available, the frustration for librarians is daily and large. "We want to connect books and people," Ms. Gardner said. "When we can't do that, it's a great disappointment."

HEADLINE: Polls Indicate Victory by Rightist in Salvador Election

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, March 20

 BODY:
El Salvador's conservative ruling party appeared tonight to be heading toward a strong victory in the first national elections since a peace accord two years ago ended a civil war, according to independent projections tonight.
With 26 percent of the votes counted, elections officials said Armando Calderon Sol, the presidential candidate of the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, had 50.7 percent, while the leftist coaliton candidate, Ruben Zamora, had nearly 28.6 percent. 
 One poll indicated that Mr. Calderon Sol would win with just over 50 of the vote. Over 50 percent is required to avoid a runoff election, and it remained uncertain whether a runoff would be required.
Highlighting the uncertainty, Mr. Zamora, the candidate of a coalition that includes the former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, said at a news conference, "Our projection clearly indicates that there will be a second round," and he predicted an ultimate victory for the left.
 
Charges of Fraud
 The suggestions of Mr. Calderon Sol's success were tempered by bitter assertions by Front leaders that the election was riddled with fraud. Signs multiplied that voter turnout was lower than expected, and the ex-rebels, taking part in elections for the first time, said 300,000 Salvadorans had been deprived of voting cards by what they said was a politicized electoral tribunal.
Moreover, the former guerrillas charged, more than 12 percent of the voters who got voting cards were turned back at the polls because their names did not appear on master rolls.
In a heated news conference shortly after polls closed, one of the former guerrilla leaders, Joaquin Villalobos, said the Government had disenfranchised large numbers of voters in areas of traditionally heavy support for the rebels. "It is incredible to see this after the peace process, after the campaign of the century," he said.
Mr. Zamora, in predicting the need for a runoff election, said, "Let the second round be a clean round."
 
Denial of Fraud
 Electoral officials rejected the charges. "The elections were clean," said Alvaro Cruz, the chief elections auditor. "There were no significant problems." His view was supported by international observers.
The bitterness generated challenges to the credibility of the results, and left El Salvador facing two potentially disturbing outcomes.
If Mr. Calderon Sol is declared the winner, his victory and the legitimacy of the elections is likely to face a harsh attack by the left. If a second round is required, tensions between the two camps could become dangerous.
 
A History of Violence
 El Salvador has seen more than its share of war. As many as 75,000 Salvadorans are thought to have died in the 12-year civil war, in which the United States spent as much as $6 billion to support conservative governments in their fight against the Front, a coalition of Marxist guerrillas.
The war ended two years ago when the United Nations brokered an accord between the two sides, who were both fatigued by the long war. The agreement called for a cease-fire, the disarming of the guerrillas and reforms of the Salvadoran security forces, including the training of a new civilian police force and the retirement of the most notorious army leaders. The accords also called for land reform and credits to help former combatants resettle.
Guerrilla leaders say many prescriptions have been only partly fulfilled.
The voting today was not always smooth, but independent monitors did not report any widespread fraud.
In Aguilares, 45 minutes north of the capital in a region that saw frequent fighting during the war, voting was delayed for two hours. Finally, frustrated voters waiting in lines that stretched several blocks angrily rushed the election headquarters, causing a brief panic before order was restored.
"This was very poorly coordinated," said Vincente Gutierrez, an official monitor for the Authentic Christian Movement, one of a number of small parties taking part in the elections. "Delays like this are not an unimportant detail. A lot of people could get discouraged."
"People are feeling cheated, especially if their party loses" said Issac Gonzales Ramirez, an election official in Santa Clara, where some party officials said that as many as 60 percent of those eligible voters were unable to vote. "There will be a lot of resentment. This could affect the credibility of the whole process."
But in most places the number of voters who complained to United Nations officials or to the 2,900 international monitors here fell far below the 60 percent cited by former rebels.
 
Monitors Seem Satisfied
 In the gritty merchant town of Mejicanos, on the outskirts of San Salvador, United Nations officials and international observers at several polling stations said they had seen few problems.
"One of the party representatives here was claiming that 30 percent of the voters were being turned away," said Osborne William McConathy, an American observer in Mejicanos. "At the tables I've been watching, though, only a couple of people have been denied. From my observation the system is working pretty good."
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, the head of the United Nations mission, saluted the elections for "their extraordinary normalcy, even if we have seen some irregularities." Mr. Ramirez estimated last week that about 74,000 Salvadorans had been left off voter rolls, principally for lack of birth certificates.
Even if that number is small in an electorate of over 2.4 million, the problems of people missing from voter lists and the difficulties others encountered in getting voter cards could haunt El Salvador.
After four decades of military-dominated governments and 12 years of civil war, El Salvador remains deeply divided between left and right, and a tradition of election fraud renders people all the more suspicious. Skepticism is particularly evident in small towns like Tecoluca, a voting center for a broad swath of the countryside.
"It just takes one or two votes to change things," said Juan Francisco Velasquez. He took a bus to Tecoluca from his village, La Pita, at 3 A.M. to be sure to reach the polls early, only to be told that his name was not on the voter list. "A lot of other people from where I live didn't bother to come, because they never got a card."
 
EL SALVADOR AT A GLANCE
 
ELECTION: El Salvador held its first elections yesterday following the end of its 12-year-long civil war two years ago. The presidential election pitted Armando Calderon Sol, candidate for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, against Ruben Zamora, whose leftist coalition is dominated by former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
 
BALLOT: In addition to voting for a president, Salvadorans are selecting a vice president, 84 members of the National Assembly, 262 municipal governments and 20 deputies to the Central American Parliament.
 
VOTING: About half the country's 5.5 million people are eligible to cast ballots. About 2,900 foreign observers are expected, including about 550 from the United States.
 
ISSUES: Both major candidates have promised to rebuild the country and to work to eliminate poverty and social injustice. But the campaign has centered on accusations of abuse by both sides during the war.
 
COUNTRY: About the size of Massachusetts and Central America's smallest, with annual per capita income of about $750. Economy is heavily agricultural. The population is 5.4 million. About 75,000 people died in the war.
 
HISTORY: El Salvador was ruled by Spain until 1821 and became independent in 1839. It's history has included frequent political violence and coups. In 1980, the country moved closer to civil war with the assassination of the Catholic Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero y Galdames, a supporter of human rights. Jose Napoleon Duarte became president in December 1980, and his Government received United States support as civil war spread, human rights abused were widely reported and hundreds of thousands of people fled. The right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance gained effective control in the 1988 election in which Alfredo Cristiani won the presidency. Peace was negotiated in 1992 with the help of the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Asia Pacific Alignment Is Off to an Upbeat Start

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONOLULU, March 20

 BODY:
The intriguing question raised by the first meeting of the finance ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is whether the world is seeing the birth of a new alignment that will eventually replace the Group of Seven as the globe's most influential economic-political club.
The 18 finance ministers ended their two days of talks here on Saturday night by announcing a series of studies on how to better manage the $1 trillion in capital expected to flow into the Asian and Pacific region in the next decade and by scheduling meetings to coordinate financial activities. 
 "We share a goal to keep up the growth in investment, and we think it is a goal that we can achieve," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the host. "We can do it best by strengthening our ties. Over and over I heard that from the finance ministers."
 
Bentsen Moves With Caution
 For now, though, Mr. Bentsen is proceeding cautiously. The Asians, led by China, Japan and Malaysia, are wary of being part of an American-dominated economic alliance that might force them to follow Washington's dictates on human rights or trade.
And while these countries increasingly need to coordinate their finances, they are widely divided on security issues -- most notably on North Korea, with no consensus on how to deal with the nuclear threat.
Nevertheless, American officials could not help commenting on the contrast between the Group of Seven jobs conference they played host to in Detroit on Monday and this weekend's session of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC.
In Detroit, the mood was somber and the discussion was about unemployment that was reaching critical proportions among the exclusively Atlantic members of the Group of Seven (Britain, France, Germany and Italy) but not in the Pacific ones (Japan, Canada and the United States).
At this meeting, with such economic powerhouses as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Chile present, the mood was upbeat.
As Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia remarked: "We couldn't have been invited to Detroit. Our problem is a labor shortage."
 
Looking to the Future
 American officials do not want to say it out loud, but the conclusion is obvious: the Group of Seven increasingly seems like a relic of the cold war. The Asia Pacific group reflects the transformation of its region into the economic center of the world. It is about the future.
Dressed mostly in blue blazers and casual slacks for a "class photo," framed by palm trees and a deep blue Pacific, the ministers had a jaunty air about them -- 18 men who control more than half of the world's economy.
It was clear from their final statement here that the financial integration already under way in the region was forcing these economies to coordinate more, despite their initial hesitations. They have $1 trillion a year in intra-regional trade alone, and economies now so intertwined that runaway inflation or unemployment in one major country can spill over into all the others.
Their communique endorsed plans to double the capital of the Asian Development Bank. It asked the International Monetary Fund to study cross-border private investments into and within the region, to better understand how money is being raised, and it called on the Asian Development Bank to arrange a symposium on the problems of financing roads, bridges and power-plant projects.
The ministers agreed to meet in Indonesia next year, and their heads of state have already scheduled a summit meeting for the Indonesian island of Bali this November.
 
Contrasts With Europe
 The Group of Seven began the same way in the mid-1970's. But turning the Asia Pacific group into a more permanent alliance will not be easy. The contrasts with Europe could not be more stark, said Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii. European regional integration took place under a single dominant power, the United States, in the face of an external threat, the Soviet Union. In Asia there is no dominant power and no external threat to drive the countries together.
In Europe, Mr. Oksenberg added, it was the governments that led the drive to regional cooperation. In Asia the private sector and the financiers are leading the way. Finally, he said, in Europe nationalism had become something of a dirty word, given its links with protectionism and the two World Wars. In Asia nationalism is still seen positively, linked with independence from colonial masters and healthy economic competition.
Maybe the biggest problem for the United States in trying to build a significant regional association is the tension in Washington's relations with Asia's two biggest powers -- Japan and China.
Still, despite these cross currents, there are strong incentives for greater cooperation. As David McLain, dean of the business school at the University of Hawaii, said, "The region is growing pell-mell, and there is the potential for instability" should efforts to strengthen financial institutions and improve coordination not come to fruition.

HEADLINE: Welfare Planners Struggle Over Final Sticking Points

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Mar. 20

 BODY:
Three days before presenting President Clinton with a plan to transform the welfare system, dozens of his aides gathered behind closed doors on Saturday for a frank, sometimes anguished, debate about race, class, sex and the impact of their decisions on the lives of millions of poor people.
Some officials likened their work to that of the civil rights pioneers, praising the emerging plan as a historic opportunity to fight poverty and reverse family breakdown. Others called some of its provisions misguided, hubristic or downright mean. 
 The three chairmen of the 32-member group drafting the plan barred reporters and asked that no one discuss what was said. But several officials provided accounts of the meeting, held across the street from the White House, arguing that the difficult issues should be placed in public view.
By turns earnest and sardonic, the unusual five-hour gathering captured the welfare issue in all its complexity. It reveals a plan being shaped by a mix of political promises, social science, grim Government finances and deeply held beliefs about family, work and personal morality.
 
A Million Mentors
 Contemplating a Presidential campaign against teen-age pregnancy, which would place a million mentors in the nation's poorest schools, some officials even referred to their own experiences with premarital sex.
"We can all admit we enjoyed the pleasures of premarital sex," one senior Administration official said, in stressing the need for birth control.
Both the powerful and the powerless have great stakes in the debate over welfare. President Clinton's pledge to "end welfare as we know it" was one of his most popular campaign themes, and it remains a cornerstone of his assertion that he is a New Democrat.
He has said the plan will expand training opportunities for the record five million households on the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. But after two years, he has said, adults who remain unemployed must join a work program.
Behind that broad theme, however, a host of complicated issues remain unresolved, and the meeting produced many sharp exchanges, several people present said.
They said Joycelyn Elders, the Surgeon General, warned that one money-saving option could backfire by increasing the number of children in foster care. Andrew M. Cuomo, an Assistant Housing Secretary, warned that the plan had the potential to drive families into homelessness.
 
Illustrating the Risks
 Gene Sperling, a White House economics adviser, said financing the plan by cutting programs for immigrants could produce "a political firestorm." Christopher Edley, a White House budget aide, said some aspects of the pregnancy prevention plan were based on fantasies, and he likened them to the the world of Mary Poppins.
While politicians have crusaded against welfare for decades, they have found it easier to denounce than to fix.
The Clinton Administration is the first in a generation to try such an ambitious solution. The planners' own sometimes heated criticism of one another illustrates the risks involved.
Among the most difficult issues is how to pay for the plan, which is expected to cost about $15 billion in the first five years. While the public often thinks work programs save money, in fact they are expensive, at least in the beginning. That is because the government will provide recipients with day care and subsidize their wages to encourage employers to hire them.
Some members of the task force were said to have objected strongly to the plan to raise the money by cutting programs for the needy. But David T. Ellwood, a co-chairman of the group, argued the Administration had little choice, given the difficulty of raising taxes.
Mr. Ellwood advocated a strategy that would remove about 250,000 children from the welfare rolls by changing the rules that govern households in which only a child receives aid, as when a grandmother takes in a child whose mother has a drug problem.
 
The Meaning of $200
 Such a change would save about $800 million a year by removing about 40 percent of the 650,000 households in the program. Mr. Ellwood and Mary Jo Bane, another co-chairwoman, said such families received about $200 a month. And they argued that many of them, with higher incomes than the average welfare family, had the ability to get by without it.
But a roomful of Federal officials, many earning six-figure salaries, then engaged in a heated debate about what $200 means to the disadvantaged. Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Elders, among others, were said to have warned that the cut could force children into homelessness and foster care. Mr. Sperling warned that the proposal could be perceived as "really mean."
In response, Mr. Ellwood said that every suggested cut had the potential to hurt someone and that such child-only families had more money than most.
The group referred the issue to the Cabinet, which is to meet alone on Monday and again with Mr. Clinton on Tuesday.
The group also disagreed over how many hours welfare recipients should work. Noting that most recipients are single mothers, some officials said they wanted to limit the work week to 20 hours so parents can tend to their children. Others, arguing the need to appear tough, said states should have the option of requiring 30-hour or even 40-hour work weeks.
Even the question of what constitutes success was up for grabs. Some officials stressed the need simply to cut welfare caseloads. Others said some people should be allowed to stay on the rolls as long as they were performing some work. Mr. Ellwood, who has a flair for the flamboyant phrase, said it was essential to convince Americans that welfare recipients were "getting off their duffs."
To reduce costs, the Clinton plan would be phased in slowly. At the end of the five years, only 130,000 of the five million families receiving aid would actually be enrolled in a work program.
Those present at the meeting said Ms. Bane urged her colleagues to discourage reporters from noting the small number of people in the work program, which could make it hard for Mr. Clinton to say he did in fact "end welfare as we know it."

HEADLINE: Plush Condos Do Not a Russian Venture Make

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 20

 BODY:
Isolated on a remote field of a vast Russian collective farm called Lenin's Legacy, lies a freakish sliver of the suburban American dream.
Behind high steel gates, rows of semidetached, pearl gray wooden town houses are artfully arranged along flagstone paths. Each of the 67 prefabricated units is equipped with plush wall-to-wall carpeting, a working fireplace, two-car garage, air-conditioning, microwave oven, washing machine, dryer and cable television. A few yards away, 40 more units are under construction. 
 It could be Potomac, Md., or New Canaan, Conn., but in fact, the condominium-style community known as Rosinka is just outside Moscow, 15 miles from the Kremlin.
And beneath its air of dreamy suburban perfection lies a complicated tale of folly and greed straight out of Gogol, with a dash of John Grisham's legal melodrama.
 
Partners Differ Vastly
 The partners in the joint venture -- a Westport, Conn., real estate development company, Senie Kerschner International Housing, and a former Soviet model collective farm that has fallen on hard times -- are locked in a bitter dispute over who owns the property. Each side accuses the other of deception, greed and theft.
Such conflicts are not rare in post-Communist Russia, where joint ventures between Western companies and their Russian partners are new and risky, and cultural collisions inevitable. This has especially been true lately; as the Russian economy worsens and the political situation becomes more unstable, most joint ventures are experiencing tension.
For example, Occidental Petroleum, which has a joint enterprise in Siberia, is tied up in a dispute with its Russian partner over ownership of the oil that is not earmarked for export -- 1.2 million tons in 1993. Because of that, Occidental has recalled all but 6 of its 48 Western experts from the site, and the joint venture, called Vanyoganneft, is not producing any oil for export.
But the battle over Rosinka has a special flavor. "This case is unusual for the degree of acrimony," said Marc J. Halsema, a lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson, which represents Senie Kerschner and more than 50 other Western companies with joint ventures in Russia. "It's a little unusual to see a joint venture deteriorate this badly."
The dispute is also unusual because the United States is the leading tenant at Rosinka, renting 40 units for embassy personnel and 9 for employees of the Agency for International Development, at a 5 percent discount on apartments that lease for $4,000 a month. (Executive town houses, with five bedrooms and saunas, go for $7,000, but even at those rents, the community is fully occupied.)
So far, officials at the United States Embassy have listened sympathetically to American complaints, but continue to pay rent to the Russians. Embassy spokesmen declined to comment on the case.
"There is a sense here that we don't have the full story from either side," an American diplomat said. "Neither side seems to have behaved according to Hoyle."
Oleg A. Zakharov, who manages Rosinka as the collective's farm's representative, says the Americans never provided the $2.1 million capital contribution they pledged to the project and instead, using sneaky American accounting ruses, funneled money lent to Rosinka back to their businesses. "They cannot be robbed of something they never owned," he said scornfully.
Nolan K. Kerschner denied such machinations, and retorted that the Russians took advantage of complex new Russian laws to re-register the joint venture as a Russian company, usurping the Americans' half share and investment, which they calculate at $3.5 million.
Mr. Kerschner, who has complained to the embassy, the State Department and Congress, is seeking arbitration in Sweden and a Congressional investigation. "Why should the U.S. send all this aid to Russia if they are going to treat American companies like this?" he asked.
The partnership collapsed as Rosinka appeared to be teetering on the brink of profit. Christopher Senie, the former managing director of Rosinka and the son of Alan Senie, thought that the United States Government was considering a plan last year to buy the units it was leasing, which could have brought Rosinka $10 million. The State Department has denied this.
Mr. Senie estimated that in five years, if other corporate tenants elected to buy, profits could reach $150 million. "What is being fought over is power and money and access to millions of dollars," he said.
 
Optimism and Vodka
 It all began in a haze of laughter, vodka toasts and vows of eternal friendship in April 5, 1990, when Mr. Kerschner and Alan Senie formed a joint venture with the collective farm, represented by Mr. Zakharov, a suave former K.G.B. officer who looks a little like James Mason.
Their dream was to build an $88 million development of 478 town houses to pamper Western executives in the kind of gilded ghettos that a Moscow magazine once described as "hygienically sealed hard-currency colonies."
The Americans promised to provide financing, building materials and know-how. The Russians would find the land and negotiate the bureaucratic maze.
Mr. Zakharov became the godfather of Christopher Senie's first child. "These people were my best friends in the world," he said. Two years later, Mr. Senie and his family fled Moscow, saying the Russians were trying to intimidate him by turning off his utilities. "They were trying to make my wife and children uncomfortable, to drive the American partner out," he said.
"Preposterous," Mr. Zakharov replied with a shrug.
 
Nonpayment of Salaries
 Each side has a different version of how the relationship soured, and a competing list of grievances. Mr. Zakharov said the Americans refused to pay the hard-currency salaries and bonuses they had agreed upon, including his own. That was supported by Richard D. Williams, the construction manager, who quit Senie Kerschner and stayed on at Rosinka, working for the Russians.
"They just didn't have the money to stay on for the long term," Mr. Williams said. "They were using so-called 'fees' out of here to prop up their business at home."
The relationship was irreparably damaged when Mr. Zakharov brought together a group of Russian businessmen, including himself and Viktor P. Malnev, general director of the farm, to buy some of its shares. The collective farm, under Mr. Malnev's leadership, agreed to sell, but the American partners refused.
Christopher Senie said Mr. Zakharov was trying to enrich himself and wrest control of the property. Mr. Zakharov said he was only trying to raise money for a farm community in desperate financial straits. The director, Mr. Malnev, declined to be interviewed, saying he was too busy trying to keep the collective farm afloat.
There were other battles, but both sides agree that the critical issue was the $2.1 million each says the other stole. The Americans, who say they spent $2.1 million in expenses just trying to put together a financing package, hired the Moscow office of the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand, which reported that the money could be accounted for. A Russian accounting firm drew the opposite conclusion.
"I'm not saying either side is at fault," said Donald E. Meske, president of Deluxe Homes of Pennsylvania, in Berwick, Pa., which built Rosinka's houses and guaranteed its first construction loan, $1.5 million from the First Eastern Bank in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
"I think both sides are at fault," Mr. Meske said, noting that he is still owed the $1.5 million. He said he expected Mr. Zakharov to repay it soon, in which case, he would enter into new deals with him.
The directors of Senie Kerschner say their last resort is in arbitration in Swedish courts, under the joint-venture agreement, but even there, each side says the other is stalling.
 
Back on the Collective Farm . . .
 Rosinka itself -- serene, well-tended and eerily quiet -- appears unruffled by the fight over its control. "It's a little bit like living in the twilight zone," Richard A. Conn said smilingly of the suburban patch grafted onto Russian soil. Mr. Conn, managing partner of Latham & Watkins's Moscow law office, said the Russian managers and maintenance workers "do a great job."
"We have no complaints," he said.
On the collective cattle farm that now owns Rosinka, the commotion over the joint venture is unnoticed. Lenin's statue still presides over the main entrance, faded Communist exhortations to produce are still posted on a giant red billboard, and very little meat or milk is being produced by the 400 workers who are housed, fed and employed there.
Though the farm is technically independent now and owned by the workers, five-year plans seem alive. None of the workers interviewed had any sense that they owned shares of their farm, or for that matter, a piece of the shining American hamlet on the hill.
"I've seen it on TV," a ruddy-faced welder named Nikolai remarked. "I've never gone to look at it," he added with a wry smile. "It would only upset me to see those rich houses."

HEADLINE: District of Columbia May Seek Federal Bailout

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The District of Columbia has such financial problems that it may be forced to borrow money from the Federal Government to pay its bills, a blow to efforts by the municipal government to win more independence from Congress, officials say.
"The situation is that they have really had unbalanced budgets for the last several years," said Philip M. Dearborn, a financial research director of the United States Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. "They've used up all their cash and are in a very difficult cash situation now." 
 The possibility of a Federal bailout was reported today in The Washington Post, which quoted officials as saying that borrowing from the Government was under consideration. "We are exploring our authority for borrowing from the Treasury," Ellen O'Conner, the District's chief financial officer, told the newspaper. She could not be reached for comment today.
Already, the District gets about one-fifth of its $3.4 billion budget from the Government; the rest is supposed to come from taxes and fees.
To avoid a bailout, which many politicians here would see as undermining the District's efforts to gain more control over its own affairs, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly has proposed postponing a required payment of $230 million to the city's pension fund this year. That would allow the District to end the year with $75 million, but it would also face challenges in the courts and in Congress and seemed unlikely to succeed.
Cutting spending enough to find the pension money is virtually impossible, officials say.
The District of Columbia, though governed by a Mayor and a 13-member City Council, is a unique entity whose political decisions, including its budget, can be vetoed by Congress. The District does not have the power that the states and some cities do to raise money, but it still must provide the kind of services that states do -- welfare, Medicaid, prisons and courts.
The District is also prohibited by Congress from taxing commuters to recoup the cost of public services used by suburban residents who work in the city. Moreover, half of the real estate in the District is exempt from taxation because it is used by the Government, embassies or nonprofit institutions.
The city has faced financial problems since it won limited political independence in 1974. During Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.'s 12 years in office, the city borrowed $150 million to $300 million a year from private lenders. Mayor Kelly eliminated that practice with a $336 million bond sale in 1991, at the end of her first year in office. That erased the city's accumulated deficit and put the District in its best financial condition since limited home rule began, experts say.
But over the last three years, the city's budget has been balanced only through a series of accounting maneuvers. City officials said the financial cushion from the bond sales was used to provide city services during the recent recession. Now the Mayor's Office projects that if nothing is done the city's annual deficit will increase to almost $800 million by the year 2000 from $225 million in 1996.
 
Council Chairman's Frustration
 John A. Wilson, the late chairman of the District of Columbia City Council, had voiced concern over the city's financial state after the Rivlin Commission reported four years ago that the city would become insolvent without major cuts in spending and substantial increases in revenue. Some associates attributed Mr. Wilson's suicide last year to his frustration with the city's failing fiscal health.
"To go back to the Treasury now -- and that's assuming the Treasury would honor their requests -- is a step away from home rule," said Mr. Dearborn, a longtime analyst of the city's finances who was once a financial adviser to Mr. Barry. He said if such a request was honored, "based on what has happened in Philadelphia, New York, and Cleveland, there would be some kind of oversight board, some kind of supervision."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Russia: A Tougher Tone and a Shifting Glance

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Stung by months of criticism that it has favored Russia unduly, the Clinton Administration has altered its policies, adopting a tougher tone toward Russia and focusing more than before on other former Soviet republics.
Although the Administration seems too proud to admit that any new approach was needed, there is an unmistakable change in tone toward a newly nationalist Russia and far more emphasis on bolstering the security and economies of the other republics. 
 The recent visits of the presidents of Ukraine, Georgia and Kazakhstan have demonstrated this new focus and appear, at least in part, to be a response to the many criticisms from Congress and foreign policy experts that the Administration has maintained a Russia-first policy.
"The Administration is reeling from the criticisms of its Russia policy," said Morton Abramowitz, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "I think we're seeing a certain amount of rethinking and repositioning."
Evidence of that can be seen in President Clinton's decision to double economic aid to Ukraine and Kazakhstan and his call for an international peacekeeping force to help end Georgia's civil war -- a move that is widely seen as an effort to check Russia's muscle-flexing beyond its borders.
 
Insuring Independence
 Administration officials say their stepped-up efforts to help the economies of Ukraine and other non-Russian republics are another way to insure their continued independence.
"We feel economic security is inextricably related to political and military security," Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said in an interview. "If these countries undergo a profound and protracted economic crisis, it will undermine their viability as states. Ukraine is a particularly vivid example of that."
Reluctant to give an inch to critics who have attacked their policy, Mr. Talbott and other Administration officials deny that the visits of the leaders betoken a change.
But at the same time, the Administration is proud to point out that it is spending more energy and money than before on the 14 non-Russian republics. Officials are also happy to note that while Russia received more than half the aid to the former Soviet Union over the last two years, next year more than half will go to other republics.
"They are changing their policy somewhat, but are reluctant to admit it," said Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Carter Administration security adviser who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Clinton for tilting toward Russia. "They are being more even-handed and are emphasizing much more than in the past that they're interested in what I call 'geopolitical pluralism,' meaning the preservation of the states other than Russia."
 
Showing New Toughness
 After the surprising surge of nationalist forces in Russia's elections in December, Moscow's foreign policy statements have grown more shrill, and in response Washington has shown a new toughness.
While there is plenty of talk about the need for Russian cooperation to bring peace in the Mideast and Bosnia, the Administration's warnings about Russia's nationalist ambitions are far more frequent and slightly firmer than before.
In a speech on Monday, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said the United States must help Russia consolidate its transition to democracy, but cautioned that "it is possible that Russia will emerge from the turbulence as an authoritarian, militaristic, imperialistic nation hostile to the West." Mr. Perry's recommendation -- one that should please those who say the Administration has pampered Russia -- was that Pentagon must keep up its defenses. Mr. Perry is traveling his week in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus.
When President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine visited two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton and other officials repeatedly emphasized that they support the "territorial integrity" of Ukraine at a time when Russian nationalists are clamoring that Crimea belongs to them and not Ukraine.
Perhaps because they do not want to offend their friend, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, or perhaps because they do not want to acknowledge that there may be a need for any mid-course corrections in policy, Administration officials are reluctant to discuss their approach in terms of a tougher stance.
Mr. Talbott said the Administration has always stressed maintaining the territorial integrity of the former republics. Nonetheless, many foreign policy experts say the Administration's frequent recent assertions of that view regarding Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltic republics signal such a change in the face of increased Russian nationalism.
"They're moving in the right direction, but I'm not going to start applauding the Administration yet," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, He has threatened to vote against new Russian aid because he says the Administration has improperly favored Moscow. "I'm still not convinced we've seen a real change in policy," he said.
The way Mr. Talbott explained it, the Administration has naturally paid more attention to Russia than to other republics because it is the biggest republic and because the others would be greatly affected if Russia's democratization and economic reforms fail.
He described the warmer relations with Ukraine and Kazakhstan as a response to their decisions to eliminate nuclear weapons and get serious about economic reforms.
"There is broad continuity in our policy," a senior Administration official said. "But as events change, our policy has evolved with them."

HEADLINE: Mail Order Shifts Its Pitch to Cable

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Direct mail is about to become even more direct.
Eight catalogue retailers are bypassing the post office and beaming their merchandise right into homes. Catalog 1, the new cable shopping channel developed by Time Warner and Spiegel that hits the airwaves in four test markets next Monday, features the wares of eight well-known retailers with sophisticated direct-mail operations. 
 The channel makes its debut at a time when consumer complaints about cluttered mailboxes are growing louder and angrier and when electronic retailing threatens to make catalogues obsolete.
But Catalog 1 is more than an "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" effort. From the way its business is structured to the goods it will try to sell and the pitch it will use to sell them, Catalog 1 is breaking the television shopping mold set by Home Shopping Network Inc. and QVC Network Inc.
Highbrow production techniques and scripts that read more like afternoon talk shows than sales spiels are aimed at enticing affluent shoppers who have thus far eschewed electronic retailing. Catalog 1 will feature merchandise from Spiegel and its Eddie Bauer outerwear subsidiary, as well as from Williams-Sonoma, Sharper Image, Neiman Marcus, the Nature Company, Crate and Barrel and the Bombay Company.
And unlike QVC and the Home Shopping Network, whose fees and other requirements make it almost impossible for a retailer to make a profit selling on their networks, the direct-mail companies participating in Catalog 1 are paying the channel about what it would cost them to produce and mail a catalogue.
"We're not trying to create just another shopping channel," said Rod Parker, the former Spiegel executive who is the manager of Catalog 1. "We're trying to create an entirely new channel of distribution for people who already have distribution through other channels, like retail stores and catalogues."
 
An Expensive Experiment
 But Catalog 1 and several other shopping channels being introduced this year must also prove that high-end electronic retailing is cost effective. Although the company will not discuss its finances, retail consultants believe Catalog 1's cost to produce a single program for its participants is probably between $300,000 and $500,000, about as much as for the highest quality "infomercials" -- lengthy television advertisements that appear to be programming.
"Because of the technology, it's going to be a lot more expensive than the average retail test, and companies are going to have to be in it for the long haul," said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Marketing, a consulting firm in New York. "That's the real question for me."
Being on the set of Catalog 1 incites the same sense of incredulity that Clara must have felt when she crept downstairs on Christmas Eve and found the Nutcracker dancing about her living room.
"It's a cross between '20/20,' the evening news, a talk show and the very best infomercials," said Richard Thalheimer, chairman and chief executive of Sharper Image. "It gives the merchandise a context that you can't provide in a catalogue."
Suddenly the candlesticks, plates, carpets and other tchotchkes that are so one-dimensional on the pages of Neiman Marcus's Horchow Collection catalogue of home furnishings come to life, seeming to have a place in the real world that they lack in the suspended fantasy of glossy photographs and grand descriptions.
 
Tips on Home Decorating
 Carol Helms, creative director of Metropolitan Home magazine, demonstrates how to mix and match chargers, plates and napkins from the Horchow Collection, chatting all the while about entertaining in the 90's. She talks about societal trends and how they relate to entertaining and decorating while demonstrating how to use items from the collection to achieve a contemporary look.
"Let's talk about the new informality, about gathering around a table with family or friends and about how the beautiful things from the Horchow Collection can help us do that," she says.
A segment on a snore control device sold by Sharper Image takes place at a sleep research laboratory, where a doctor who specializes in sleep disorders explains why people snore.
On Catalog 1, the line between selling and telling is much fuzzier than on QVC or the Home Shopping Network, where program hosts shamelessly hawk products, and where horns and whistles are used to keep viewers attentive. The risk in such low-key selling as Catalog 1's is that the potential shopper will have trouble distinguishing between entertainment and marketing.
But Mr. Parker cited a survey from Yankelovich Partners that found that women are more interested in information about the products they might buy than in a sales pitch. The appearance of an "800" number and a description of the merchandise will also help remind Catalog 1 viewers that they are listening to a sales pitch.
 
Ability to Recycle Programming
 Mr. Parker predicts that Catalog 1 will ultimately prove more profitable for its owners than QVC and the Home Shopping Network, which broadcast much of their sales spiel live.
"We have the ability to repeat, re-use, edit, literally recycle the existing product into an entirely different program if we want," he said. "That ability will allow us to amortize the production costs over time in a way that you can't with live broadcasts."
For example, the footage shot for Catalog 1 is also being used to develop a shopping channel for Time Warner's interactive cable system that is scheduled to begin its test run in Orlando, Fla., later this year.
While the jury will be out for some time on whether Catalog 1 can earn its keep, it has at least devised a cost structure for its catalogue partners that virtually guarantees them a return in the short term: the partners pay Catalog 1 between 20 percent and 30 percent of the sales they make on the channel.
 
Test to Reach 400,000 Homes
 "For the first time, retailers, whether they be Neiman Marcus or a traditional catalogue retailer like Spiegel, can get into this new business within an economic framework that allows them to make money," said R. Fulton MacDonald, president of International Business Development, a retail and marketing consulting firm.
Catalog 1's first test will reach about 400,000 homes in Nashua, N.H.; Columbus, Ohio; Rochester and suburban Milwaukee. The participants do not expect the initial test to have any significant short-term impact on their sales or profits, although some of them believe the programming may ultimately add as much as $50 million to their sales annually.
"There's no way anyone is going to make any money on this thing for a while," said B. D. Feiwus, president of Neiman Marcus Direct, which operates the Horchow Collection and the company's other catalogues. "That's not the purpose."
Instead, Mr. Feiwus and others say, the limited introduction will give them an opportunity to measure the potential impact on their businesses in a controlled manner and then plan accordingly with staff and inventory.
QVC and the Home Shopping Network charge participants between 40 percent and 50 percent of sales, which makes it almost impossible for a retailer or cataloguer to turn a profit. Those channels charge more because they process each order that comes in, handling everything from the operators who take calls from viewers to warehousing, sorting, packaging and shipping.
In contrast, Catalog 1 participants will handle their own orders through the same distribution systems they use to process catalogue orders.
 
Valuable Customer Information
 "The economics of Catalog 1 offer retailers something no one else in this business has yet offered them -- a way to make a profit," said Mr. Thalheimer, whose Sharper Image did an hourlong program on QVC earlier this year.
Because they will process their own orders, the catalogue operators will glean valuable information about their customers. "The information you gain from processing a transaction -- names, telephone numbers, addresses -- is what you need to build a relationship with a customer," Mr. Feiwus said. QVC and Home Shopping Network do not share that information with their vendors.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks to Sweeten Proposals for Tax Cutting

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 20

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo wants to sweeten his election-year package of tax-cut proposals by giving credits to companies that paid taxes on operating losses from 1990 through 1993, most of them large manufacturers and securities concerns.
The retroactive credits represent a new twist on a tax-reduction proposal made by Mr. Cuomo in January when he introduced his $33.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning on April 1. In his original plan, Mr. Cuomo called for giving companies credits on future operating losses. 
 The retroactive credits would cost the state about $150 million but could be phased in over several years, Cuomo aides say.
Securities concerns, which provide 144,000 jobs in New York State and are major campaign contributors to both major political parties, have been the most aggressive in lobbying for the retroactive credit. The industry suffered large operating losses in 1990 and 1991 and would receive between $30 million to $40 million of the credits, according to state and industry estimates.
 
'A Very Clear Signal'
 As with other aspects of the Governor's tax-cut package, Cuomo aides portray the retroactive tax credit as a way to encourage companies to stay or expand in the state, which has been racked by tens of thousands of layoffs in just the last year.
"It's a major issue for some of the biggest employers in the state," said Andrew J. Zambelli, Mr. Cuomo's secretary. "It sends a very clear signal that New York State is trying to be fair."
But the proposal also underscores the perception held by many that Mr. Cuomo feels vulnerable on economic issues. A recent poll by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie showed that taxes and jobs are among voters' main concerns. The same poll showed Mr. Cuomo's approval rating at 36 percent, near its all-time low.
The retroactive tax credit has been supported in somewhat different form by the Republican-led State Senate. However, it has received a cooler reception among Mr. Cuomo's fellow Democrats in the Assembly, where some lawmakers view it as an election-year giveaway to an industry that has been highly profitable in recent years. Many Assembly Democrats want to spend additional revenues in next year's budget on social services for the poor or tax cuts for the middle class.
 
Concerns About Cost
 Assembly Democratic leaders support expanding a Cuomo proposal to give low-income working families a tax credit. Mr. Cuomo has agreed to discuss the expansion, but his staff has expressed concerns about the cost.
In conversations with Mr. Cuomo and security industry officials, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has said he wants assurances that financial concerns that benefit from the retroactive credits will keep their jobs in New York State.
"We are now being pressured by Jersey City and Greenwich, Conn., which are seeking our downtown jobs," said Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. "I think it is important to know that if we do these things, they have an effect on the economy, on the job picture here."
Last week Mr. Silver received what he considered such assurances from Robert Denham, the chairman of Salomon Inc., which has 4,000 employees in New York State.
"We told the Speaker that what we expect of the state is a fair business environment, and as long as there is a fair business environment, it is our desire to remain here," said Saul Rosen, a managing director at Salomon.
Mr. Cuomo's tax-cut proposals, which are subject to Legislative approval, include reducing the state corporate surcharge, giving tax credits to poor working parents and phasing out the state tax on hotel rooms that cost over $100 a night. When fully put into effect over the next several years, the cuts would cost the state more than $800 million in revenues.
With only two weeks left before the current fiscal year ends, budget talks are stalled on a wide range of issues, and some negotiators now think it inevitable that the state will have a late budget for the 10th consecutive year.
Mr. Cuomo's newest tax-cut proposal would affect the state's 5 percent minimum tax, which is assessed on companies that have accumulated enough tax credits to reduce their state corporate taxes to little or nothing.
New York does not currently allow companies to use past operating losses as a deduction when filing minimum taxes. Mr. Cuomo's proposal would give those companies a credit, which could be used to reduce future taxes, for minimum taxes paid on operating losses. And it would make the credits retroactive to taxes paid since 1990.
 
'An Inequitable Tax'
 Lobbyists for the securities industry argue that the Federal Government and most other states already provide such credits, and they suggest some companies might sue the state if it does not change its law. They also contend that the state could pay for the credits using a "windfall" from new tax laws that increase state revenues from securities concerns by between $150 million and $250 million a year starting this year.
"The state has an inequitable tax that is about to get more so," said Jeffrey M. Schaefer, senior vice president of the Securities Industry Association, a trade organization representing 140 New York State-based securities concerns.
In other aspects of the budget talks, Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders remain deadlocked over a Medicaid takeover plan, welfare cuts, school aid and criminal-justice issues.
 
Local Medicaid Costs
 Under a Cuomo proposal, the state would assume local Medicaid costs gradually over the next eight years in exchange for receiving a portion of local taxes. But this has encountered resistance from both Senate Republicans, who want to slash Medicaid services, and some Assembly Democrats, who say the proposal will have little benefit for upstate cities.
With little time left, some negotiators now say it is likely that, at most, only a partial takeover of local costs can be achieved.
Mr. Cuomo and the leaders do seem to be moving closer on how to cut Medicaid costs. Both the Senate and the Assembly had said Mr. Cuomo's proposal to reduce costs by $185 million was too onerous for poor people and hospitals. Mr. Cuomo has now agreed to reduce the cuts, starting by restoring about $17 million for transportation services.
But in an indication of how slow talks are progressing, Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders remain unable to agree on how much money the state will have to spend next year, which is usually the starting point for serious budget discussions.

HEADLINE: Lawyers in New York Defend Their Right to Mislead

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., March 19

 BODY:
Ten months after Armand P. D'Amato was convicted of fraud in a scheme to influence his brother, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York legal establishment has taken up his cause, saying he was convicted of something many lawyers do and should be allowed to do: filing misleading bills.
While the case drew much attention with revelations that an official at the Unisys Corporation had paid Mr. D'Amato to win access to the Senator, as a legal matter the crime was not influence-peddling but mail fraud. Mr. D'Amato was convicted and sentenced to five months in prison because his law firm sent bills to Unisys for consulting work that Mr. D'Amato never did. 
 Now, as Mr. D'Amato pursues his appeal, his case has become something of a cause celebre in legal circles. Five bar association groups, along with the prominent New York lawyer Arthur Liman, have filed a brief on Mr. D'Amato's behalf, and he has also found an ally in the New York Civil Liberties Union.
The bar groups maintain that billing practices like Mr. D'Amato's are commonly employed and are protected by the confidential relationship between a lawyer and client. They say lawyers have the right to obfuscate or even misstate their charges if a client asks them to.
But others are surprised and angry about Mr. D'Amato's newfound support. Richard Uviller, a former prosecutor and professor at Columbia University Law School who teaches criminal law and ethics, said, "I frankly am ashamed of the bar associations and Arthur Liman for arguing that deception should not be liable for criminal prosecution."
A bill is "a lawyer's statement of what he did," the professor said. "A lawyer is not required to lie, even at the request of a client. A bill that states that services were rendered for something not rendered is a deceptive statement."
But in briefs filed in January, Mr. D'Amato's lawyers for the appeal, John L. Warden and Robert J. Giuffra Jr., the five bar groups and the Civil Liberties Union said that such billing practices were not unusual and that using them as a basis for convicting Mr. D'Amato could have serious repercussions.
"We're clearly concerned with an overcriminalization of the law," Mr. Liman said. "If the management of a corporation asks that a bill be described in general terms rather than specifically, can that be treated as a fraud on shareholders, especially when the management of the corporation knew what the services were, that they were of lawful purposes, and asked that the description be opaque?"
This case, Mr. Liman added, is part of a "tendency to use criminal law where the issues are ethical, not criminal."
And a brief by the Civil Liberties Union called for a reversal of Mr. D'Amato's conviction, because there is "no evidence that the Federal mail fraud statute was ever intended to reach this far." Based on previous decisions, the brief argues, the law should not be applied to minor corporate transactions, like Mr. D'Amato's deal with Unisys, that do not cause a substantial economic loss for shareholders and that do not conceal illegal activity, like bribery or kickbacks. The Government disagrees with this interpretation.
 
Free on Bail
 Mr. D'Amato, 49, formerly a partner in a thriving law firm in Mineola, is free on $10,000 bail pending his appeal. He was convicted on May 7 of seven counts of mail fraud involving $32,500 he was paid by Unisys for several reports that he did not write.
At his trial, the Federal Government argued that Mr. D'Amato was hired by a rogue Unisys employee to provide access to his brother. They said he defrauded the company by taking part in a billing scheme to conceal the true reason the company hired him.
The Senator has said he was unaware of his brother's arrangement with Unisys.
At the trial, both sides agreed that Armand D'Amato's lobbying of his brother was not illegal. Indeed, at a sentencing hearing in October, Stephen P. Scaring, Mr. D'Amato's trial lawyer, argued that Mr. D'Amato had provided "true value" to the company, describing him as a man who could "reach out to Senator D'Amato not like everyone else can," who could contact the Senator "by picking up the telephone," and who could "get a letter written maybe that wouldn't have been written otherwise."
 
Simply Following Orders
 As Mr. Scaring told it, Mr. D'Amato was simply following the billing orders of the executive who hired him and had provided other valuable services that the bills did not mention.
But the Government contended that Unisys was defrauded because top Unisys officials would not have agreed to pay Mr. D'Amato for such ethically questionable services.
The two sides disagree over whether Mr. D'Amato's contacts at Unisys were acting without proper authorization, and if so, whether Mr. D'Amato knew it.
A major piece of evidence was a purchase order that Mr. D'Amato told his law partner, Jeffrey Forchelli, to sign in February 1988. The order was for reports on Congressional proceedings that Mr. D'Amato never wrote. He admitted in court that Unisys employees had written the reports, none longer than five sentences, and given copies of them to him to place in his files.
The prosecution argued that this arrangement was so unusual that Mr. D'Amato must have realized something strange was going on.
But the bar groups, in their brief, gave examples of similar situations in which they said lawyers, at their clients' request, might properly send bills that are vague or misleading in their description of services.
For instance, the groups said, a law firm working for a corporation planning a major acquisition might slip the charges into bills for other services so that others in the company would not learn of the potential purchase. Similarly, a law firm might conduct a confidential investigation of a company employee accused of wrongdoing and then roll it into bills for other services to protect the employee's reputation.
And a law firm, again at a client's request, might also bill for complex litigation under a different corporate budget line if the company had reached the internal budget limit for the litigation and the company still wished to pay the firm promptly.
In each of these instances, under the Government's theory of the D'Amato case, the outside lawyers would be "chargeable with mail fraud" even though the company was not harmed, the brief says. "It would criminalize a broad range of conduct that until now no one would have reasonably considered to be illegal," the brief concludes.
The brief noted that even Judge Jacob Mishler, who presided over the case in Federal District Court in Uniondale and upheld the verdict, conceded at Mr. D'Amato's sentencing hearing that "maybe one out of 100 would say no" to the deal that Mr. D'Amato entered into.
Besides the State Bar Association and Mr. Liman, the other groups signing the brief were the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the New York State Trial Lawyers Association and the New York Criminal Bar Association.
In a separate brief, the Civil Liberties Union argued that the way the Government used the mail-fraud law against Mr. D'Amato violated the constitutional right to due process. "The mail-fraud statue would reach so much day-to-day corporate activity as to render the statute entirely open-ended and susceptible of invocation whenever and wherever law-enforcement officials seek its deployment," the brief states.
Arthur Eisenberg of the New York Civil Liberties Union explained, "It violates our civil right to know what is and what is not prohibited, and the statue is so open-ended that it gives unfettered discretion to prosecutors."
The case has not yet been scheduled for oral arguments before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, though lawyers said they expected it to come before the court in the next few months.
 
'Rogue Employees'
 While the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District declined to discuss the issue, its brief rejected the claims of the lawyers' groups, insisting, "Nothing in this case threatens to criminalize any form of legitimate conduct by attorneys." It maintained that Mr. D'Amato's situation was different because he was not dealing with an authorized representative of the company, but with "rogue employees."
Professor Uviller said it was unfortunate that the bar groups saw this appeal as important to the profession. "I am appalled at the ease with which lawyers lie," he said. "I don't want to share the popular myth about lawyers, but I find that the authority of the profession is undermined by this cavalier attitude toward their own honor and their own obligation to be scrupulous about the truth."

HEADLINE: North Korea Bars A-Plant Survey; Threatens to Quit Nuclear Treaty;
Japan Seeks Chinese Help

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 20

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan pressed Chinese leaders today to exercise greater influence on North Korea so it would give up any nuclear ambitions, saying he was "gravely concerned" about the looming crisis.
"More than any other country, China has the deepest relations with North Korea," Mr. Hosokawa said at a news conference today after talks with President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng. "Therefore China could work to move North Korea in a positive direction instead of a negative one." 
 But there were conflicting reports about the Chinese response. Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, briefing reporters on two hours of talks between Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Li, said the Chinese Prime Minister had pledged to "persuade North Korea" to accept full inspection of its nuclear sites.
The official New China News Agency, however, reported that Mr. Li had "stressed that the issue should be solved through dialogue and negotiation," which has been China's longstanding position.
Asked if Japan would support possible sanctions, Mr. Hosokawa said his Government would respond "in a responsible way."
The Japanese leader's diplomatic initiative toward North Korea today followed an effort by his aides in November at a meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders in Seattle. Despite low-key and private entreaties to the Chinese leadership at the time, Japanese diplomats said later, they were rebuffed with explanations that Beijing exerts little influence on North Korea.
With Japanese and South Korean officials still hoping that China will do more, there have been indications that Chinese military leaders have stepped up their contacts with their North Korean colleagues. So far, though, all such efforts have been rejected by the North Korean leadership in Pyongyang, prompting Mr. Hosokawa to declare today that "I am gravely concerned about the situation."

HEADLINE: Force Won't Solve Turkey's Kurdish Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Turkish antiterrorism police detained six Kurdish members of parliament after the Turkish parliament voted to lift their immunity March 2. The state security court wants to charge the lawmakers with supporting the Kurdish separatists of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K. The action could ruin elections scheduled for March 27, especially as Ankara has brought respected observers in to monitor the election, as requested by the European Parliament. More violence and instability are expected in Turkey, which already suffers from a 10-year war and crumpled economy. 
 From the early 1920's to 1990, Turkish administrations banned the very word Kurd from public discourse. There were bans on Kurdish language, music, clothes and, of course, political organizations and publications focusing on Kurdish issues. The situation changed positively under President Turgut Ozal in 1990.
Recently, however, President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller have denied the existence of a Kurdish issue in Turkey. They consider it a "terrorist" problem. Therefore, they handed it to generals to "solve." The Turkish military believes it can solve the problem with force. Human rights are violated today more than ever, as reported by Turkish Human Rights. More than 12,000 people have been killed. About 850 villages have been demolished or evacuated. In December, Prime Minister Ciller stated that military operations in the Kurdish region have cost more than $30 billion.
To overcome difficulties caused by its clashes with the P.K.K., Turkey turned to the United States. The Clinton Administration agreed to go beyond military aid and offer economic and political aid. When the House Foreign Affairs Committee raised concern about Turkey's human rights record, State Department officials commented they use private channels to advise on and discuss the issue with Ankara. United States policy toward Turkey has been governed by the Administration's belief that Turkey plays a key role in regional stability from the Balkans to Central Asia.
Events of the last year contradict that belief. Tensions exist between Turkey and such neighbors as Armenia, Iran and Syria because Turkey accused them of supporting the P.K.K. American and European tourists were taken hostage by the P.K.K. Mobil Oil Turk, the third largest producer in Turkey, stopped operations following a P.K.K. attack in September 1992. Many observers predict the situation will be worse this year.
Politicians in Ankara need to be reminded that there is no military solution to the Kurdish issue or to any similar ethnic problem. Turkish interests can be achieved by developing democracy to serve Kurdish interests, too.

Film and Television

 BODY:
New York City's feature film industry recovered strongly last year after a poor 1992. Total shooting days, a barometer of the industry's health, rose 65 percent, and feature film starts statewide jumped to 53 from 43. The surge followed a economic recovery in film and television production and the resolution of a labor dispute that led Hollywood studios to boycott the city for seven months in 1990-1991. Last year seven productions started shooting in New Jersey, while Connecticut had none for the third year in a row. Television production in New York City has grown steadily in recent years, but production of commercials has continued to fall off, a trend begun in the late 1980's.

HEADLINE: Look What the GATT Dragged In

BYLINE: By Jean Anne Casey and Colleen Hobbs; Jean Anne Casey is a farmer. Colleen Hobbs is a writer.

DATELINE: HENNESSEY, Okla.

 BODY:
This rural town of 1,800 people is now home to the largest hog-breeding company in the world, the British-owned Pig Improvement Company. For urbanites who think that hogs smell like frying bacon and associate pigs with Wilbur in "Charlotte's Web," here's some news: Pork is political, and pigs are an environmental hazard.
Many European companies, hampered from expanding at home by tough pollution laws, are taking advantage of America's less stringent standards. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will dramatically increase the amount of pork the U.S. can export to Europe -- 624,000 metric tons in 1999, up from less than 100,000 tons in 1991. This will make the U.S. the center of global pork production, and companies are rushing to raise hogs in new places. One Danish company even plans to raise 600,000 hogs in Alaska. 
 The problem with huge hog farms is the manure they produce. The Environmental Protection Agency rates animal wastes among the nation's top 10 sources of pollution. Leon Chesnin, a retired University of Nebraska waste-management specialist, estimates that the waste generated by 10,000 pigs equals that produced by a city of 17,000 people. If the Pig Improvement Company brings 100,000 hogs to Hennessey, as it plans, the result will be the sewage equivalent of 170,000 people.
"These operations are not family farms," says Barbara Grabner of Prairie Fire Rural Action, a support group for family farms. "They are large corporate ventures that attempt to influence state legislatures to eliminate environmental, corporate farming and zoning laws." The result, she says, is "environmental classism" that exploits the residents of sparsely populated areas.
Corporate hog farms collect feces and urine into small ponds lined with plastic sheeting, called lagoons, and the wastes are later used as fertilizer. In practice, this system allows nitrates to leach into the water table and enter the drinking supply. Nitrate contamination can result in circulation problems, and in extreme cases has caused a condition called blue baby syndrome that can be fatal to infants. Pig waste also gives off airborne ammonia, which can cause respiratory ailments.
How bad can the contamination get? Bob Bergland, the Secretary of Agriculture under Jimmy Carter, said this month that the super-concentrated pig industry in North Carolina was in danger of "collapse" because in some counties the "ground is saturated with hog manure."
Because of the oil industry's decline, Oklahoma has been aggressive in courting hog raisers, allocating $8 million to advertise that the state is livestock-friendly. In the name of this lucrative friendliness, Oklahoma is willing to compromise its rural residents' quality of life and health. Last year, the state legislature severely limited landowners' rights to file nuisance suits against these livestock operations. The state is apparently banking on the fact that protests are much more difficult to mount with a scattered, rural population.
The state's system for regulating the livestock industry is a joke. Officials at every state and Federal agency charged with protecting the air and water agree that the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture is in charge of regulating feedyards and their application of animal waste. This department, however, has created a brilliant catch-22: a 1991 rule repealed any regulations pertaining to such operations and no replacement rules have been adopted.
The huge livestock companies say that they are just honest farmers and that standard E.P.A. regulations keep them from making much of a profit. Don't believe it. These are nothing less than factories, and their proliferation is an indication of their profitability. Like any other manufacturing industry, state and Federal regulators should institute and enforce strict controls on emissions.
The Pig Improvement Company has introduced the micropolitics of pork to Hennessey, polarizing the town. Some defend the company as an economic savior; others protest, with equal passion, the odor and pollution they fear will make their homes unlivable. The conflict between economics and quality of life is the 1990's version of a range war, where nitrate tests and sewage studies have replaced wire-cutters and six-shooters. So if you plan to visit the world's largest hog-breeding operation, follow the advice they gave in the Old West; keep your head down, and be sure to drink upstream from the herd.

Parallel Time
Growing Up in Black and White
By Brent Staples
274 pages. Pantheon Books. $23.
Debates about black males in our nation have increased in proportion to black men's rising social misery, indexed in withering numbers that barely detail the impact on their lives of informal drug economies, escalating unemployment and stunning rates of homicide. The plight of most black males has become so bad that some social commentators have come to refer forebodingly to black males as an "endangered species." Trapped between statistics and stereotypes, however, the gritty textures and uncomfortable truths of black male life are too often smoothed over to fit easily into pat explanations of either their prosperity or failure. 
 Brent Staples's poignant memoir offers a glimpse behind and beyond the recitation of black male decline. The world in which Mr. Staples was shaped, a world where working-class black people brought value and dignity to their labor and lives, is vividly realized. Mr. Staples, who writes editorials on politics and culture for The New York Times, is a writer of edifying eloquence whose hunger for memory -- for the dirt and light of everyday experience as it is transformed by forces both natural and contrived -- is fed by the discipline of an obsessive will to observe.
He turns time and again in his memoir to the wombs that gave him life, from the community of black women in Chester, Pa., who gathered around his mother and granted him status as an "honorary woman," to the black male circles in which he ran, populated by brothers and cousins, schoolmates and neighborhood boys. Mr. Staples, who was born in the early 50's in the belly of an eastern industrial city, recalls the virtues of the work then available for black men, writing, for instance, of their employment in the shipyards that dominated the area, or, as his father did, driving trucks.
He returns years later to Chester after a decidedly unsettled childhood (the family moved constantly because of evictions), and to Roanoke, Va., where his family, sans father, had sought out earlier roots. There he confronts the postindustrial collapse of the job market, its harmful effects on black males no more powerfully illustrated than in the life and death of his own brother Blake, a drug dealer killed by a vengeful rival.
Blake's life and death provide the narrative bookends of Mr. Staples's remembrances, a mournful reminder that, increasingly, black male life is archetypally embodied in its violent, premature end. With painful, pitiless honesty, Mr. Staples writes of his refusal to attend his younger brother's funeral, and how his repeated, failed attempts to rescue his brother from the inevitable consequences of his drug dealing exacted a costly moral toll. "I mourned Blake and buried him months before he died," he writes. "I would not suffer his death a second time."
At first blush, this seems a callous, cruel act of bad faith, the ritual sundering of family ties by the "successful brother" from a past too painful and embarrassing to bear. But as Mr. Staples's narrative makes clear, events take on a second life when memory and wisdom mingle to give meaning and purpose to the past. His decision to forgo his brother's funeral became part of a lifelong attempt to turn painful isolation into fruitful solitude.
Escape, sometimes thwarted, sometimes painfully realized, is a common motif of these memoirs. When Mr. Staples writes of attending a college near his home in Chester -- the only one of the family's nine children to do so -- as a result of a chance meeting with one of its black professors, he underlines just how tenuously his escape was connected to circumstance, how luck often allows talent to shine.
A less successful attempt at escape -- from the frozen regions of racial stereotyping -- is symbolized in his strange, patently quixotic stalking of the novelist Saul Bellow after Mr. Staples became a doctoral student in psychology at the University of Chicago. Mr. Staples jogged by Mr. Bellow's apartment and tried to force a chance sidewalk meeting because he wanted to be Mr. Bellow, to "steal the essence of him, to absorb it right into my bones." But Mr. Staples came away only with the harsh caricatures of black male life that he found in Mr. Bellow's fiction; he could not escape meaning far less to his idol than what Mr. Bellow meant to him.
Mr. Staples's frustrated quest expresses more than it intends; it speaks to the attempt of black people to secure somehow the approval of a culture that deadens itself to the variety and complexity, the sheer ingenuity, of black life. But there is sometimes a little too much of the fascination with the exotic in Mr. Staples that blinds him to the virtues of what is closer to home. It started early, too. He records that his friendships with black kids in the neighborhood were "largely disappointing" and that "The kids were just like me; there was nothing exotic about them . . . The Polish and Ukrainian boys were alluringly exotic."
But with "Parallel Lives," Mr. Staples has surpassed the need for imitation, revealing a resolutely distinct voice as he negotiates the treacherous shoals of racial identity in American culture. One need not agree with all of his conclusions about how those racial identities are shaped -- much less how they should be politically employed -- to appreciate this moving book. With its army of metaphors marching across the map of the unruly but rewarding terrain where personal experience reflects and refines national identity, "Parallel Lives" reminds us that the best personal writing is born of the courage to confront oneself.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Tells Blacks His Budget Won't Cut Into the Gains They Have Made

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani told a predominantly black group of business owners yesterday that although his budget-closing plans would be painful, the pain would not fall disproportionately on black New Yorkers.
Speaking at a luncheon of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, the Mayor noted that it was unlikely that many in the audience were among his supporters and he sought to ease fears that his administration's budget plans would be more severe on black New Yorkers 
 "I understand people's disappointment," he said. "But the reality is that I don't want anyone in the city of New York to feel that anyone has taken a step backward, because they have not. People in Harlem, people in the African-American community,made advances over the last three to four years. I don't want to see them diminished."
Although Mr. Giuliani was politely received by the more than 150 people attending the luncheon, leaders of the Harlem business group said that extending the invitation to the Mayor had been a contentious issue for the 1,600-member organization.
Following the luncheon, at the Faculty House at Columbia University, Lloyd A. Williams, president and chief executive of the organization, said that complaints had come from politicians, business owners and religious leaders who are members.
Specifically, Mr. Williams said that some members had complained that Mr. Giuliani had appointed no black deputy mayors and said that they were offended by Mr. Giuliani's dismantling of one portion of the city's women- and minority-business affirmative action plan.
But Mr. Williams said that Mr. Giuliani and his senior aides had been responsive to the Harlem group's requests and inquiries.
In addressing the audience, Mr. Giuliani largely repeated his standard economic message: that the city must reduce the size of the government and lower the tax burden, which he said would attract and retain business.
Mr. Giuliani also expressed support for the designation of Harlem as an urban empowerment zone, a Federal program under which 10 cities nationwide will be selected to receive $100 million each over two years for job training, drug treatment and social services.
While Mr. Giuliani said that Harlem "makes a good case" for being such a zone, he added that it might be best to parcel that money to more than one community in the city. The administration has also been considering requests from the South Bronx and from the Satmar Hasidic Jews of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He said Federal housing officials had indicated they would not oppose an arrangement to divide the money.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Market Bouncing Back

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Tuesday, March 22

 BODY:
Stock prices were staging a recovery here early today after tumbling in the previous two trading sessions amid concerns about rising interest rates.
At midday, the Hang Seng Index of 33 leading stocks was up 230.97 points, or more than 2.6 percent, to 8,898.00. The index is trying to bounce back from a two-day plunge of more than 9 percent. At the end of trading Monday, it had fallen 28.7 percent since the Federal Reserve pushed up short-term American rates on Feb. 4. 
 Analysts said that Hong Kong traders continued to be worried by widespread expectations that the Federal Reserve would push short-term American interest rates higher after today's meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee.
 
Hong Kong Dollar Pegged to U.S.
 American rate increases often lead to higher interest rates in Hong Kong, because the territory's currency is pegged to the United States dollar.
"There is great concern that we will see a further increase in U.S. interest rates," said Andrew Hall, research director at Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities.
Analysts attributed the selloffs on Friday and Monday mainly to heavy redemptions in mutual funds that invest in Hong Kong stocks, as investors shifted some money into bond funds.
They also said some American investors were cashing out of Hong Kong funds. "U.S. investors want to bring the money back home and keep it closer to where they are," said Mark Konyn, associate director at Indosuez Asia Investment Services.
But there were also mutual fund redemptions in Europe and Japan, David Bulbeck, assistant director at Schroders Securities in Hong Kong, said. Many fund investors are not used to the Hong Kong market's volatility, he added, and sold shares because they were unnerved by the market's recent fall.
"The concern is exaggerated," Mr. Hall said. Other analysts agreed that higher interest rates would not hurt the Hong Kong stock market as much as some investors perceive, despite numerous holdings in interest-sensitive real estate.
The Hang Seng Index more than doubled to 11,888.4 on Dec. 31 last year from 5,437 on Jan. 4, but many investors doubt that the Hong Kong market will be able to repeat that performance this year.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Restrictions on Abortion Take Effect

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 21

 BODY:
The waiting room at Planned Parenthood's abortion clinic here was crowded as usual with somber young women and a few male companions. But today was different. The 14 women were the first group that the clinic was serving under the state's new abortion law, which took effect on Sunday after nearly six years of litigation.
The clinic's staff clearly resented having to comply with the regulations: a lecture on abortion by a doctor; a 24-hour waiting period, and, for women under the age of 18, the consent of a parent or a judge. 
 But women seeking abortions in the Planned Parenthood center and other Philadelphia abortion clinics did not express strong feelings about the law in interviews today. Complaints were few and slight -- "It's a bit inconvenient having to come into the city twice," said a 26-year-old homemaker from nearby Upper Darby -- and a few said the law had some value.
The law requires a woman seeking an abortion to listen to a doctor's 10-minute lecture on the procedure and then wait 24 hours before having it. The procedure itself can take as little as five minutes. If a woman under 18 cannot or does not want to obtain a parent's consent, she can ask a Family Court judge to declare her sufficiently mature to make the decision. The clinic must also provide on request an illustrated booklet about fetal development.
A few women said the law had some value. "It gives me more time to think, to make sure this is what I want to do," said Monica Fisher, an 18-year-old college freshman, who had come to the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center for Women in Philadelphia.
Ms. Fisher said she had come to the clinic for the 10-minute lecture and to schedule her abortion for this week. "This is probably the hardest thing I'm going to ever have to do," she said.
Connie D. Ringgold, a 38-year-old city worker, found the law less onerous than expected. "When I heard it was harder for women to get abortions, I felt it's not right," she said after the lecture in the Blackwell Center. "But the 24-hour waiting period does give you time to think. You can make sure this is what you really want."
But several women at the Philadelphia Women's Center, another clinic, said the law served no useful purpose. "If you are here, you've already decided," said a 24-year-old unemployed woman who would not give her name.
 
Conflicting Views
 Kathy Coll, president of the Delaware County Pro-Life Federation, said the law's provisions were reasonable, and she pointed to public opinion polls showing widespread support for it among Pennsylvanians. "A child can't even take a school trip without a parent's consent, but you used to be able to perform an abortion on that same child without the parents' knowing," Ms. Coll said. "It's just an outrage that the law took six years to go into effect."
Abortion-rights advocates say the law, which survived challenges all the way to the United States Supreme Court, increases costs for clinics and their patients and creates great hardship for some women, especially for those who do not have easy access to a clinic and for teen-agers from troubled families who must navigate the legal system to obtain an abortion.
Abortion clinics in neighboring states like New York and New Jersey reported no surge in patients today, but they said they expected to see a rise as more women decided they did not want to deal with the new restrictions.
Joan S. Coombs, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Southeast Pennsylvania, said today: "The more we have dealt with the refinements of implementing this law, the more we have been struck by how clear it is that the goal of this law is to interfere with access to abortion. Period."
This morning Dr. Cathy K. Dratman, medical director of Planned Parenthood's clinic here, gave the brief lecture on abortion to the women in the waiting room. She apologized for having to enforce the law and suggested that the women use their votes to change it. "All of you who are old enough to vote need to find out where your elected leaders stand," she said.
Dr. Dratman then read a 1,200-word statement, which described the abortion procedure and its risks, the availability of information about alternatives to abortion, and miscellaneous facts, like a father's responsibility for paying child support if a woman decided to continue her pregnancy. When Dr. Dratman finished, there were no questions.
 
Redundant Lecture
 Dr. Dratman said the required lecture was redundant at her clinic because its counselors had customarily provided this information and more to patients individually before an abortion was performed.
The homemaker from Upper Darby confirmed that, saying the clinic's counselors had already discussed these issues in detail with her when she visited the clinic last week for counseling and laboratory tests. "Some people seem to think that Planned Parenthood herds women in here and brainwashes us to want abortions," she said. "There is a lot of emotion and a lot of thinking behind my being here. It's not a decision I made in one night or one that I'll change in one night."

HEADLINE: Russia Is Holding Up Seed Bought by U.S. For Armenia Relief

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia, March 21

 BODY:
More than a thousand tons of wheat seed purchased by the United States for this beleaguered country, where there are lines for rationed bread, are being held up by Russia, which is demanding payment of a 30 percent export duty, according to relief organizations and American diplomats here.
Under an agreement signed by the United States and Russia two years ago, no duties are to be imposed on the import or export of relief assistance. 
 Describing the matter as "extremely sensitive," the American Embassy here declined to comment other than to confirm the basic facts as provided by relief agencies.
The wheat seeds, purchased from Russia, have been in the warehouse ready to be loaded on planes since early February, and a desperate moment has arrived for this country of 3 million people, which did not receive wheat seeds that Congress mandated for last winter's planting.
"If the seed doesn't arrive within a day or two, it will be another disaster for this country," said Stuart Willcuts, the regional director in the Caucuses for Save the Children - U.S., which administers American-supplied relief.
Many Armenians these days are eating little more than bread because of extreme shortages of food and high prices for the little available.
Traditionally, about 70 percent of Armenia's wheat, as well as other agricultural products, was imported from Russia, primarily through Azerbaijan. But for more than two years, Azerbaijan has imposed a strict economic blockade of Armenia because of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan.
Last fall, as part of an $18 million relief package for Armenia, Congress designated $3 million for wheat seed. It was to have been used for winter wheat, but the United States Agency for International Development was unable to arrange the purchase before the beginning of the winter planting.

HEADLINE: Somalia's Faction Leaders Agree to Form an Interim Government

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, March 21

 BODY:
Somali faction leaders agreed today on the formation of an interim government and said they would sign a "declaration of national reconciliation" on Tuesday, a United Nations spokesman said.
The spokesman for the United Nations operation in Somalia, George Bennett, said the agreement was reached after several days of talks in Nairobi between leaders of all 15 Somali factions. The meetings were mediated by the United Nations special representative to Somalia, Lansana Kouyate. 
 Mr. Bennett would not give any details of the accord before a public signing ceremony on Tuesday. But the "declaration of national reconciliation" does not spell out the details of distribution of power in a new Somali government, leaving them for the leaders to work out later.
Mr. Bennett said that at the Tuesday ceremony the Somali leaders were also scheduled to announce the site of a conference that would convene in the next few months to determine how power would be distributed and other details.
 
Majority Rule or Consensus
 Still being discussed, United Nations officials said, are issues such as whether a new government should operate by majority rule or by consensus. The leader of the strongest faction, Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, does not want majority rule because his faction, although militarily powerful, is relatively small.
If a new government is established, it would be the country's first since Mohammed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. The groups that toppled Mr. Siad Barre then fell to fighting among themselves, wrecking the economy and the agricultural countryside and contributing to a famine in 1992. An American-led international military operation to feed the hungry and restore order began in December 1992.
"Ambassador Kouyate considers it a major step forward and is very pleased that Somali faction leaders have put their differences behind them and have agreed on a new political strategy for Somalia," Mr. Bennett said. "I'm cautiously hopeful."
 
Last U.S. Troops Leaving
 The public reconciliation between warring Somali factions comes four days before the last American troops are to leave Somalia. United States and United Nations officials say the accord shows that the Somalis are aware that their country cannot go on functioning without some form of an interim administration and that they risk the loss of foreign aid.
The foreign officials are also concerned that large-scale violence might erupt if the vacuum left by the American departure is not filled by a political solution. Already, widespread banditry and looting is increasing throughout southern Somalia. On Sunday, two Italian television journalists were shot and killed as they were driving in the northern sector of Mogadishu, the capital.
Despite deteriorating security, there has been political progress. In the last week there has been a marked change not only in the often bitter relations between the United Nations and General Aidid's faction but also among Somali factions themselves.
An earlier peace initiative broke down in December when General Aidid and his chief rival, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, refused to meet and when General Aidid refused to deal directly with the United Nations, particularly with its special representative, Jonathan Howe, a retired American admiral.
 
Admiral Is Replaced
 Admiral Howe was reassigned in February and was replaced by his deputy, Mr. Kouyate, and since then the Somali general has been taking a more conciliatory stance toward the United Nations.
Then last Thursday in Mr. Kouyate's hotel suite, General Aidid and Mr. Ali Mahdi met face to face for the first time in a year, and talked for three hours.
"It was very, very constructive talks," said Osman Ato, one of General Aidid's chief advisers. "All I can say is that they talked about some form of future government."
The weekend meeting brought together in Nairobi more than 50 Somali leaders. All the major political players were present, including Col. Omar Jess and Gen. Mohammed Hersi Morgan, two rivals who as recently as last month were fighting over control of the southern port city of Kismayu.
"We are no longer warlords but peacelords," General Morgan said.

HEADLINE: Gore Sees Privatization Of Global Data Links

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, March 21

 BODY:
Discussing a favorite theme, Vice President Al Gore told a United Nations telecommunications conference here today that a "planetary information network" should be created to promote economic growth, foster democracy and "link the people of the world."
"It will be a means by which families and friends will transcend the barriers of time and distance," he said. "It will make possible a global information marketplace, where consumers can buy and sell products." 
 The Vice President's proposal sounded somewhat like an international version of the national information infrastructure he proposed for the United States in January.
He offered no American funds or detailed blueprint today and said that the network should be created by private industry.
 
Not Just Privatization
 But his remarks were interpreted as a signal to the representatives of 132 countries gathered here, including business executives, that the United States wanted developing countries to open their telecommunications industries entirely to private enterprise and competition. "Privatization is not enough," Mr. Gore said. "Competition is needed as well."
Argentina, Chile, Peru and some other Latin American countries have sold Government-controlled telephone companies, radio and television stations and other communications systems, bringing vast new capital into the country as well as modern management techniques and technology. But such arrangements often give effective monopolies to the private buyers, raising prices for consumers and threatening to impede the introduction of leading-edge technologies over the longer term.
"Today, there are many more technology options," the Vice President said, "and it is not only possible but desirable to have different companies running competing but interconnected networks."
The potential for the growth of telecommunications is enormous. The 24 richest countries, with 15 percent of the world's population, now have 70 percent of the telephone lines.
Mr. Gore is the highest-ranking member of the Clinton Administration to have come come to South America, on a tour that includes Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil.
In Argentina, entrance into the trade zone created by the North American Free Trade Agreement is a big issue for the Government of President Carlos Saul Menem. The Government believes that such trade advantages could greatly extend the country's three-year economic boom. In addition, there is intense competition with Chile, playing on historical tensions, over which will be first to join the trade pact created by the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Washington has said that until Argentina passes a law that protects intellectual-property rights, it will not become a member of the trade pact.
Mr. Menem has tried for more than two years, under American diplomatic pressure, to get the Argentine Congress to pass a law that would force the nation's pharmaceutical companies to pay royalties when they use American patents. So far, the companies have lobbied effectively against such a law. A joint statement today said, "Vice President Gore welcomed President Menem's personal commitment to passage of legislation improving patent legislation."
Mr. Gore met twice with Mr. Menem, and in addition to the North American trade pact, discussed drug-trafficking and subsidized sales of American grain to Brazil. Argentina, like the United States, exports grain, but does not subsidize grain prices.

HEADLINE: First Fidelity To Buy Bank In Baltimore

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., March 21

 BODY:
First Fidelity Bancorp said today that it had agreed to acquire Baltimore Bancorp for $346 million in cash to expand its 630-office system along the Eastern Seaboard.
"Our view of the geography for First Fidelity, certainly within the immediate time frame, is a franchise that might reach from Boston to Baltimore," First Fidelity's chairman, Tony Terracciano, told analysts during a telephone conference call.
 
Seaport Business Sought
 Mr. Terracciano said he wanted to expand, serving all Eastern Seaboard ports, to accommodate increased business from middle-market companies doing business with Europe. "It positions us in a new market which is experiencing economic growth and which is contiguous to our Philadelphia-area and southern New Jersey operations," he said. 
 The acquisition of Baltimore Bancorp's 42 branches will increase First Fidelity's network to almost 700 branches spanning Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.
To get around the Southeast Regional Banking Pact, which affects states from Florida to Maryland, Baltimore Bancorp will change its charter and become a savings bank shortly before the acquisition. The plan, which has been approved by Maryland's Attorney General and bank supervisor, is subject to final approval by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision.
 
Price Is $20.75 a Share
 First Fidelity plans to pay $20.75 a share in cash for each share of Baltimore Bancorp, which rose yesterday by $1.25 a share, to $19.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. First Fidelity's shares fell 25 cents on the Big Board, to $45.25.
Baltimore Bancorp disclosed in January that it was in acquisition talks and hired Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. of Baltimore for advice. The $20.75-a-share offer is in line with analysts' expectations of $20 to $22 a share and is more than double the stock's book value of $9.73 on Dec. 31, 1993. Its assets are $2.2 billion.
"The sale price represents a significant return to our shareholders over the average market price of our stock over the last few years," Baltimore Bancorp's chairman, Edwin F. Hale Sr., said.
First Fidelity plans to cut 300 of Baltimore Bancorp's 1,125 jobs.

HEADLINE: Clinton Target: Teen-Age Pregnancy

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
President Clinton's assistants have drafted a plan that urges him to lead "nothing less than a national mobilization" against teen-age pregnancy and promote some of the values that have historically been seized by Republicans, including sexual abstinence.
The plan is intriguing less for its specific recommendations, which are still being debated, than for its thematic thrust. It would use a Democratic bully pulpit to emphasize the importance of work, family and personal responsibility -- the same themes that Republicans have often used in contending that the Democratic Party lacks mainstream values. 
 The plan calls teen-age pregnancy "a bedrock issue of character and personal responsibility." It says the spiraling number of births among unwed mothers is the driving force behind many of the nation's problems, including poverty, crime, drugs and educational failure.
"I think that what is important here is a Democratic President saying it," said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who contends that the Democrats have been unfairly accused in the past of neglecting such values."
 
'Dramatic' Events Urged
 The draft has not been circulated in public, and Ms. Shalala agreed to comment on it only after a reporter obtained a copy. "This is, frankly, breathtaking," she said.
The plan calls for Mr. Clinton to conduct several "dramatic Presidential events," while creating a new, non-governmental agency to raise and dispense grants, and sending one million mentors to work in the nation's 1,000 poorest schools.
While the plan echoes themes sounded by the Republicans, officials point to what they call subtle but important differences.
In promoting personal responsibility, for instance, it also emphasizes the need for "enhanced opportunity." And while it talks about helping adolescents to "say no to demands for premature sexuality," it also envisions "family planning" services.
The Democratic embrace of the values agenda comes after a Presidential campaign in which Republicans had less success with it than usual. The Republican Party heavily stressed family values at its national convention in Houston in August 1992, but it was done in a fashion that critics inside and outside the party called harsh and divisive.
 
Uncertainty Over Money
 The paper was developed by a 32-member group drafting the President's welfare plan, and was debated in a closed meeting on Saturday. People who attended said there was general agreement on the overall theme but uncertainty over the amount of money and the actual policies needed.
Several people present at the meeting said Christopher Edley, a White House budget aide, argued that without a significant financial commitment the plan would fail. And Gene Sperling, a White House economics aide, was said to have noted that there are political risks in a public discussion of sexuality and birth control.
"There was a concern that these sets of issues would be misconstrued on the Hill and used for partisan gains," said one person who attended.
Another official urged colleagues to be candid about their own experiences with premarital sex in calling for the availability of birth control. Several people present quoted the official as saying, "We can all admit we enjoyed the pleasures of premarital sex."
 
Praise and Criticism
 The plan drew a mixed reaction today when it was described to Douglas Besharov, a social policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization that promotes conservative views.
"This is a terrific message and you applaud Democrats for saying it," Mr. Besharov said. "It stresses that the way to not get poor is to finish school; get a job, any job, and don't have a baby until you get married. This used to be considered a conservative view."
But he questioned some of the provisions. For instance, Mr. Besharov said mentoring programs, which pair part-time counselors with troubled youths, remain unproven.
He argued that distributing birth control through school-based clinics could backfire and encourage early sexuality. And he maintained that the test of the Administration's commitment would reside partly in the amount of money it is willing to provide.
"The solutions are at best naive, and at worst dissembling," he said, contending that the plan's talk of school-based community centers was an euphemism for distributing birth control.
 
Local Officials Have Option
 Secretary Shalala said the decision over whether to offer birth control in schools would be left to local officials. "The President has been very clear on that," she added.
Out-of-wedlock births are an expensive and growing problem. In 1990, unwed mothers accounted for 28 percent of the nation's births, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Two-thirds of the black children born that year had unmarried mothers.
The plan says that almost 80 percent of the unmarried women who had a child before finishing high school are living in poverty. By contrast, the poverty rate is only 8 percent for those who finish high school, marry and have a baby after the age of 20.
"Make up your mind you're not going to have a baby until you are old enough to take care of it, until you're married," the plan quotes the President as saying in a visit to a junior high school last month.
"Is it right or wrong, if you're a boy, to get some girl pregnant and then forget about it?" Mr. Clinton continued. "I think it's wrong."
 
'Putting Children First'
 The strategy envisions several similar talks by the President, organized around the idea of "Putting Children First." It calls for him to make critical remarks about the role of the news media, especially television, "in sending young people damaging messages about sexual conduct, impulse control and violence."
In the 1992 Presidential campaign Dan Quayle, who was then Vice President, was ridiculed when he made similar remarks, singling out the television show "Murphy Brown" for special criticism.
The new private agency would raise money for "challenge grants" that would go to communities with innovative strategies for curbing teen-age pregnancy. The plan emphasizes partnerships with a variety of community groups, including the police, churches, businesses and colleges or universities.

HEADLINE: Political Chaos in Zaire Disrupts Efforts to Control AIDS Epidemic

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
While many African countries denied the existence of an AIDS problem for much of the last decade, Zaire was different. It had a vigorous prevention campaign, the continent's best-trained scientists and best-equipped laboratories outside South Africa, and a steady flow of money from abroad to help fight the epidemic.
These days, Zaire's fortunes have never seemed bleaker. Recent surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that the epidemic is accelerating at a startling rate. Some hospitals report that close to 80 percent of their patients are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
 Scientists and doctors fear that if current trend continues, Zaire's infection rate may soon exceed those of Uganda, Rwanda and other East African countries hardest hit by the virus, sowing death, disease, sorrow and fear among tens of millions.
 
Political Chaos and Loss of Aid
 The sharp reversal in this Central African country's efforts to fight the epidemic was brought on by two events: Zaire's descent into chaos as President Mobutu Sese Seko, the longtime autocratic ruler, has tried to hold on to power in the face of popular discontent, and the subsequent withdrawal of virtually all economic aid by Western donors. AIDS prevention programs and research have collapsed, and medical workers lack even the money to test blood.
"Zaire is facing a tremendous tragedy," said Dr. Helene Gayle, AIDS coordinator for the United States Agency for International Development in Washington.
Dr. Eugene Nzilambi, director of a research program known as Project SIDA, for the acronym in French for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said: "I hate to think what will happen if things continue this way. We're back to where we started a decade ago in terms of education and prevention."
He added, "The only thing for sure is that the worst is yet to come."
Like many African nations where infection rates soared in the early 1980's, Zaire first reacted by denying the severity of the epidemic.
It was not until 1987 that the first case of AIDS was officially reported among Zaire's population of about 35 million. Then, Government officials here quietly made it known that they were receptive to foreign scientists and public health specialists who wanted to study what many viewed as the epicenter of a worldwide scourge.
In 1984, Project SIDA, the continent's largest AIDS research program, was started in Kinshasa at Mama Yemo Hospital, which is named after President Mobutu's mother. It is not entirely clear why Zaire's leaders, who have often displayed a suspicion of Western scientists, journalists and even teachers, allowed the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the National Institutes of Health, Project SIDA's main sponsors, to carry out intense and painstaking research on tens of thousands of Zairians.
Some say it was because many in Zaire's social and political elite were themselves falling victim to the disease, at rates conspicuously disproportionate to their numbers, and thus had a personal stake in encouraging research. It has become common, in fact, for Zairians to speculate about who among President Mobutu's closest aides are afflicted with the disease.
 
The Poor Die Sooner
 "Rich people here suffer more from the disease than poor people do, because when the first opportune sickness hits poor people, a chest cold or whatever, then they die because they cannot afford the treatment," said John Loftin, an American who has lived in Zaire for 22 years and now heads a condom distribution program. "However, someone with some money is able to go to the hospital, and it goes on, and on and on."
The initial results from Project SIDA were striking. Its studies played a key role in proving that H.I.V. could be spread through heterosexual intercourse, the main mode of transmission in Africa. These and other projects enhanced Zaire's reputation among scientists as a place likely to yield vital clues for fighting the disease.
As evidence grew about how AIDS spreads, the research projects had another salutary effect: in a country where talk about AIDS had been taboo, local officials were prodded to start one of the frankest and most widespread education campaigns on the continent.
Zaire's national committee on AIDS, for example, in cooperation with Psi, a nonprofit American company, began an extensive condom marketing and distribution campaign. Hardly a day would pass without Zairians hearing about the virus in offices, bars, churches or classrooms.
 
Infection Rate Stabilized
 No one knows precisely what effect the research here had on Zaire's population, but though Kinshasa had been hit hard by AIDS, by the late 1980's the rate of infection appeared to have stabilized at 7 or 8 percent of adults.
By contrast, surveys done about the same time in Kampala, the capital of neighboring Uganda, and Kigali, Rwanda, showed infection rates of about 30 percent among adults.
But Zaire's emerging network of research, prevention campaigns and grass-roots social service organizations began to unravel in September 1991, after disgruntled soldiers seeking back pay went on a rampage, pillaging homes and shops and setting off violence that left dozens dead.
Rioting broke out again in February 1993 when soldiers discovered that newly minted currency used to pay them was impossible to spend. Soldiers seized control of the Parliament building and held several hundred lawmakers hostage, demanding that they order local merchants to accept the new bank notes.
 
Research Project Closed
 Hundreds of people, including the French Ambassador, were killed. Since then, Zaire's economic collapse has been staggering, as many of the foreigners who held vital technical and managerial positions have fled.
One result was the abrupt closing of Project SIDA. After the September 1991 rioting, the project's nine foreign scientists -- six Americans, two Belgians and a Frenchman -- were all evacuated. A local staff of about 200 doctors, nurses and technicians was left to guard against looters, but research effectively ended.
"We are completely bankrupt; there's no money at all,' said Dr. Nzilambi, a Zairian educated at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, who now heads the project. And while the Government does provide some money to keep the operation from shutting its doors entirely, it is meager even by local standards, Dr. Nzilambi said. For example, he cited his own Government salary, which now amounts to about $5 a month.
Diplomats, relief officials and human rights campaigners say the country's growing chaos has taken what little stability there was for beleaguered individual Zairians.
 
Indifference and Complacency
 "It's hard to focus on the AIDS epidemic when you have an empty stomach, no job and often no place to sleep," said Atondoko Negefa, president of the Zaire Association for the Defense of Human Rights. From a public health perspective, doctors and public health specialists say, many Zairians have become dangerously indifferent to the dangers posed by AIDS and complacent about taking steps to avoid infection.
In particular, many Zairians, out of ignorance or denial, continue to have unprotected sex with multiple partners. The number of garishly dressed young prostitutes along Boulevard June 30, the city's main thoroughfare, has visibly risen in the last six months, reflecting a growing number of customers.
A 22-year-old prostitute said: "I've got two children to feed, and I know I have something that men want to pay for, so why not. It doesn't hurt anybody."
And although condoms are relatively cheap and readily available in most pharmacies, young sexually active Zairians seem increasingly reluctant to use them. "If a girl looks clean, why use a condom?" a 24-year-old university student said. "No man wants to make love while wearing a raincoat."
John Grinling, director of Amo-Zaire, an organization that provides help to families affected by AIDS, said, "It's taken as a kind of insult if a man is asked to wear a condom, because it suggests there's something wrong with him, that he's infected."
 
U.S. Withdraws Aid
 In the early 1990's the United States Agency for International Development employed nearly 70 Americans and several hundred Zairians on various projects. It has since cut back its program here to a lone American, whose job is mainly to sell off the agency's assets and dismiss its Zairian employees.
In another jolt to Zaire's growing need for assistance, last January the World Bank, citing the country's debt arrears, closed all of its projects and transferred its officials elsewhere -- the stiffest action it has ever taken against a member country.
One of the consequences of the withdrawal of aid has been a sharp reduction in the size and scope of the Psi condom distribution program, which was financed primarily by the Agency for International Development.
Four years ago it employed about 80 people full time, but with the loss of funds it is now down to three administrators, three night guards and a driver. One graphic indication of the slackening in the use of condoms is the vast inventory -- more than 23 million, Mr. Loftin says -- now decaying in warehouses here.
 
Condoms Go Begging
 Although the condoms cost less than a penny each, Mr. Loftin says demand for them is now so low that he "can barely give them away." On a broader scale, because of poor testing and weak medical management, health authorities here say the distribution of blood tainted by the virus that causes AIDS has become increasingly common, although the extent of the practice is unknown.
"We just don't have the money to screen blood for the virus," said a doctor at General Makala Hospital, one of Kinshasa's largest public institutions. Since the closing of Project SIDA, the prevalence of H.I.V. infection here has not been well documented.
But the consensus among medical workers is that infection is rampant.
Last year Christine Lusamba, a nurse at the Kingasani Hospital and nutritional center here, said 50 to 60 percent of the patients admitted had tested positive for H.I.V. So far this year, she said, the infection rate is running at 80 percent.
Not far away at Mama Yemo Hospital, Zaire's largest, half to two-thirds of the beds in the internal medicine ward are now occupied by AIDS patients.
Nearly 40 beds are crammed into two large rooms, one for men, the other for women. The patients are surrounded by relatives who sleep on straw mats and try to pull together the money to buy drugs prescribed for their loved ones.
On a recent Saturday afternoon, not a single doctor was on duty. "There's no money in caring for AIDS patients," said one of a handful of weary and dispirited nurses.

Rates Jump as Bond Traders Expect a Fed Increase Soon

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Short-term interest rates jumped to their highest level in nearly 21 months yesterday as investors and dealers sold Treasury securities on expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise its interest-rate target this week.
Traders and investors are focusing on when and how large the next interest-rate increase by the Fed will be. The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the central bank, meets today for the first time since short-term interest rates were raised on Feb. 4. 
 The longer the Fed waits to raise short-term rates, the more investors grow concerned that the central bank is not being aggressive enough in combating inflation. This fear has already played a major role in pushing short-term interest rates higher and pushing long-term rates near 7 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction yesterday, the average rate of a three-month bill was 3.61 percent, up from 3.57 percent last week. The average rate for a six-month bill was 3.90 percent, up from 3.85 percent.
The rate on a three-month bill is now more than a percentage point higher than its low of 2.58 percent on Oct. 1, 1992, and the highest since it was 3.62 percent on June 26, 1992.
Long-term rates also rose yesterday. The yield of the 30-year bond climbed to 6.95 percent, from 6.90 percent on Friday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 21/32 , to 918/32 . The yield on intermediate-term securities also gained, with the yield on the seven-year note rising to 6.17 percent from 6.11 percent.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading specialist at CS First Boston, said the Fed's job now was to raise short-term interest rates and stabilize the market. "Raising interest rates is easy, bringing stability to the market will be more difficult," he said. Some analysts and traders said a half-point increase in the Fed's short-term interest-rate target would lend some stability to the government securities market and show investors and dealers how serious the Fed was about fighting inflation in the future.
The Fed uses the Federal funds rate, which is now 3.25, as its short-term interest rate benchmark. The Federal funds rate is interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed raised the rate from 3 percent on Feb. 4, its first increase in five years. But many traders have argued that the February increase was too small.
Mr. Alexy said the market would not be satisfied with another quarter of a percentage point increase in the Federal funds rate. But he said traders and investors might be placated if such an increase was accompanied by a half a percentage point rise in the Fed's discount rate, which is now 3 percent. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges banks for loans. An increase in the discount rate would be seen as another signal of the Fed's toughness, especially because it would lead to an increase in banks' prime rates.
"The problem the market has with a gradual approach to raising rates is that it will get one tightening and still be expecting more," Mr. Alexy said. "How can you expect investors to buy securities if they think rates will be going up again soon. Rising interest rates will cause the securities to lose value."
Mr. Alexy said the timing of any move by the Fed was another concern for the market because dealers worry about the impact of higher rates ahead of the Treasury's sale of $28 billion in new two- and five-year notes today and tomorrow. A poor auction could leave many dealers holding more Treasury securities than they would like.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.13 percent, up from 5.09 percent on Friday, while the five-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.05 percent, up from 6 percent last week.
Analysts said the widespread speculation that the Fed would increase short-term rates had grown more feverish since Friday's meeting between President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed. Although the White House denied that interest rates or today's policy committee meeting were discussed, many analysts believe that the credibility of the Fed is on the line and that it will have to tighten credit just to prove that Mr. Greenspan was not pressured by the Administration.
Most economists polled by the Reuters news service expect the Fed to tighten with a 25-basis-point increase in the Federal funds rate today. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The Treasury, meanwhile, yesterday reported a budget deficit of $41.6 billion in February, which was smaller than the $44 billion deficit that had been expected. Last month, the Treasury reported a $15.6 billion surplus.
The following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall on Anxiety Over Interest Rates

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Stock traders did not have to reach for their third cup of coffee yesterday. The pre-dawn news of a sharp drop in the Hong Kong market was eye-opening enough. But if today is anything like yesterday, many sleepless traders may be carrying thermoses of coffee with them.
If the Federal Reserve Board does not deliver today the interest-rate increase that traders and investors seem to be demanding, to stem an inflation that does not yet exist, then traders will swoon, and stocks may plunge. Traders will spend the next few days or weeks trying to outmaneuver the expectations that a rate increase is still around the corner. 
 If the Fed does deliver an interest-rate increase, then traders will respond with the Wall Street equivalent of a Gallic shrug. They may even go back to paying attention to something tangible, like earnings for the first quarter, which will soon end. In that case, stock prices may rally.
Then again, stock prices may just drift. "I'm not going to do anything special when the Fed raises rates, unless it's a big number," like half a percentage point, said Ronald K. Stribley, senior portfolio manager for the Glenmede Trust Company of Philadelphia. Glenmede has $1.1 billion under management, about 90 percent of which is in stocks. "If it's a big number, I'd be less aggressive in buying stocks," he said.
 
Plunge in Hong Kong
 In trading yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 30.80 points, to 3,864.85. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.52 points, to 468.54. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which has outperformed both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 recently, fell 6.63 points, to 797.30, after setting two records last week.
An overseas omen stirred the waters early yesterday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped more than 5 percent, nearly the equivalent of a 200-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. The Hang Seng plummeted merely in anticipation that the Fed would raise interest rates today, which could send Hong Kong investors flocking to dollar-denominated securities.
The Dow's decline yesterday was attributed in part to selling in stocks that were bought after the quarterly expiration of options and futures on Friday. But the magnitude and speed of the Dow's fall was clearly a result of continuing anxiety about interest rates and inflation.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.44 points, to 259.91, on a trading volume of 247.4 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks, 1,580 to 627. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 2.19 points, to 470.77.
Based on the industry groups that make up the S.& P. 500, oil companies like Chevron, telephone companies like Ameritech, chemical companies like Du Pont and electrical equipment makers like Emerson Electric were hurt the most. Many of these stocks are sensitive to cycles in the economy.

HEADLINE: Lazard Finds Brawny Ally for Derivatives

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The growing derivatives business requires brains, to concoct complex financial transactions, and brawn, to have the financial strength to stand by what are generally private contracts between two parties that can extend as long as 10 years.
So when Lazard Freres, the brainy 98-pound weakling of investment banks, decided to start trading derivatives, it needed a muscular financial partner. And today it plans to announce a joint derivatives venture with one of the world's burliest banks, Credit Agricole of France, the 11th largest in the world. 
 Lazard, which is actually three interlocking partnerships in New York, London and Paris, is minimally capitalized; Credit Agricole, with about $300 billion in assets, carries a double-A credit rating. A high credit rating is essential to attract derivatives customers.
Derivatives are really a broad category of transactions whose value is based on -- or derived from -- the movement of stocks, interest rates, currencies or commodities. Common examples include options that protect investors from declines in the stock market, or swaps that let corporations lock in fixed interest rates on their borrowing.
While some standardized contracts are traded on exchanges, many banks and brokerage firms have turned customized derivatives into a high-volume business. Lazard, however, intends to specialize in doing only a handful of complex transactions for large companies.
"We had from time to time started working on problems where these products would have been useful, but we had to farm out the derivative portion," said Michel David-Weill, senior partner of the three Lazard firms. The new venture will allow Lazard to create these products itself and capture what can be very high profit margins.
"Our aim is not to trade or take positions, "Mr. David-Weill said. "Ten or 12 times a year we will solve sophisticated and intricate problems for everybody's benefit." The average transaction is expected to be nearly $1 billion.
Credit Agricole, which already has a more generic derivatives trading operation, is looking for new customers.
"The partnership with Lazard will bring to Credit Agricole new special relationships with multinational companies and experience in structured finance," said Lucien Douroux, the chief executive of Credit Agricole, which is the central organization of more than 3,000 rural banking cooperatives in France. The bank has by far the largest share of the domestic French banking market, but it has been less active in international finance.
Derivatives are becoming increasingly common in corporate finance. In its bid for Paramount, for example, Viacom offered a form of derivatives called "contingent value rights," securities that offered Paramount shareholders some compensation if Viacom's stock declined. Lazard was Paramount's adviser.
One type of deal Lazard might do, executives said yesterday, would be a swap that allowed one company to borrow money from a bank to buy another company, with interest payments on the loan set to rise and fall with the profits of the acquired company. In other words, if the acquisition makes money, the acquirer pays more interest.
 
Some Derivative Examples
 In this case, the acquiring company would pay a portion of its target's profits to the Lazard-Credit Agricole venture, which in effect, would pay the bank's regular interest rate.
"A bank would be much readier to lend to you if it knew that if you got into trouble, your interest rate would be lowered," said Edouard M. Stern, the Lazard partner based in Paris who will be the chief executive of the new derivatives venture.
Another example would be the plight of a company that has taken a 5 percent stake in another company for strategic reasons, but is afraid that the value of its holdings is about to decline. Lazard and Credit Agricole might concoct what is called an equity swap, in which they would pay the company money that would compensate it for any losses on the stock position; in return the company would have to pay them if the stock went up. This transaction would allow the company in effect to sell the stock, but still keep its voting rights.
Bankers Trust, which is one of the leading derivatives trading companies, is also attempting to offer derivatives instruments to large corporations, but it does not have the high-level investment banking practice that Lazard does.
 
Based in London
 The new firm will be called Credit Agricole-Lazard Financial Products and will be organized as a commercial bank, based in London. Three-quarters of the capital will be contributed by the bank and one quarter by the three Lazard Houses: Lazard Freres & Company in New York, Lazard Brothers in London and Lazard Freres & Cie. in Paris.
While the potential loss from the operation to Lazard is limited to its capital contribution, which was not disclosed yesterday, Credit Agricole will stand behind all of the derivatives transactions. As a result, one of its chief contributions to the venture will be financial executives who will monitor risk.
Lazard had offers to form similar partnerships with other banks, but chose Credit Agricole because of longstanding personal relationships, Mr. Stern said. Mr. Stern, the chief executive, is a former banker as well as Mr. David-Weill's son-in-law.
The head of trading and product development for the new venture will be Philippe Magistretti, who was the head of the French derivatives operation for the American International Group, the large insurance company that is also a leading derivatives dealer.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Drops as Traders Await Fed Move on Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar dropped against most currencies yesterday, as many traders stayed on the sidelines or sold dollars because of uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would decide today to raise interest rates.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.89 Japanese yen, down from 106.16 yen on Friday. It also slipped to 1.6895 German marks from 1.6960 marks. 
 There were widespread expectations in the financial markets that the Federal Reserve would vote to push up interest rates when its policy-making body meets today. But some currency traders were concerned about possible surprises.
"People would rather be light on dollars, and not take too much risk," said Belal Khan, a senior dealer at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. in New York.
Normally, higher interest rates would help the dollar, since they would result in an increase in the return on dollar deposits, making the currency more popular.
 
Rate Increase Discounted
 But Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said the market had already priced the dollar as though there had been a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate that the Fed can control. Therefore, he said, only a bigger increase would help the dollar.
The Fed last month engineered a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.
The dollar was helped against the yen briefly on news that the United States would deploy Patriot anti-missile batteries in South Korea, as tensions increased with North Korea. The dollar is often seen as a haven in times of international conflict.
But "suddenly everyone realized the dollar wasn't going any higher," and they sold it, said Paul Alley, an associate at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, in New York.
Gold prices fell in New York after rising in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $1.30, to $386.30 an ounce.
The British pound also slipped, falling in New York to $1.4895, from $1.4910 on Friday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.4310 Swiss francs, down from 1.4420; 5.7623 French francs, down from 5.7830; 1,669 Italian lire, down from 1,675, and $1.3693 (Canadian), down from $1.3698.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Private labels, once dull, no-frills staples, are now being promoted with the fanfare of name brands.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
PRIVATE label is going public.
Private-label products are the pantry staples usually sold under the names of the supermarkets and other stores offering them to shoppers as lower-priced alternatives to nationally advertised name brands. Traditionally, they have been shelf sleepers, clad in prosaic packages, bearing soporific names and promoted only in ad circulars and along the aisles in which they slumbered. 
 In the last five years, value-conscious consumers, willing to forgo glitzy imagery in exchange for tangible savings, have become increasingly willing to try labels not bearing brand names. A report issued last week by the Private Label Manufacturers Association, a trade organization, showed that market share of store brands reached a record 19.7 percent last year, compared with 16.4 percent as recently as 1989, while dollar share climbed to 14.9 percent, compared with 11.6 percent in 1989.
As a result, private-label products are getting wake-up calls in the form of slick packaging, catchy names, broadcast ad campaigns, promotional programs -- even in-store sampling. In other words, retailers are enthusiastically mimicking the sales tactics that manufacturers of packaged goods have pursued for decades.
Indicative of these significant changes is an ambitious effort by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company to consolidate the various store brands sold at the chains it owns, including A.& P., Waldbaum's, Farmer Jack, Kohl's and Food Emporium, under the jingoistic banner of America's Choice. The line is planned to grow to more than 1,400 products in a year from 450.
"Our private-label strategy now is to go out and support them with more advertising and marketing approaches," said Michael J. Rourke, senior vice president of communications and corporate affairs at A.& P. in Montvale, N.J. "It's something quite different," he said, "almost a national-brand approach to support the introduction of a new product line."
America's Choice is the subject of a $2.7 million television and radio campaign by Sillery Mayer Skurnik Advertising that runs through next month in markets including Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans and New York. The softly selling commercials, virtually indistinguishable from image-building ads for name brands, carry the theme "Real value, real savings. That's America's Choice."
And America's Choice will even sponsor an hourlong syndicated comedy-variety special, celebrating its parent's 135th anniversary, on more than 60 TV stations in April.
"The philosophy behind the campaign is that America's Choice is a brand, not a private label," Barry Hogan, vice president of operations at Sillery Mayer in Stamford, Conn., said yesterday. "By building it as a brand, you get long-term identity, not something that will go away."
Mr. Hogan's reference was to a vexatious problem that retailers must confront in selling private-label products: their popularity has historically waxed with hard times and waned with good times. In the inflation-plagued, recession-racked period of the late 1970's and early 1980's, private labels prospered, only to slump during the boom years of the 1980's.
To counterattack, retailers like A.& P., the American Stores Company (Jewel, Star supermarkets) and Safeway Inc. are starting to stress the quality of their private-label lines as much as their prices, if not more so.
"Improving private-label programs, turning them into brands, is a real attempt to extend their value," said Brian Sharoff, president at the private label association in New York. "The idea is to turn them into traffic builders, just as much as any brand."
That, however, is risky because it rests on a daunting premise.
"Once retailers raise their standards for private label and create new brands, they must compete, and will be judged, like other brands," said Bruce Meyers, executive vice president and director of strategy and business development at BBDO New York, an agency that represents brands like Campbell, Gillette and Pepsi-Cola.
"That means all the things consumers expect from a national brand must be present, whereas with private label, the only thing it has going for it is a very low price," he said. "That's good for national brands, because it means they can fight private label on their own turf."
Mr. Rourke at A.& P. acknowledged that in some instances, America's Choice and Master Choice, a so-called premium private-label line, might not be America's choice.
"There are certain categories where the national brands own the taste," he said, citing ketchup. "To most people's tastes, Heinz is ketchup."
"And when we introduced a Master Choice ice cream," he added, laughing, "we thought we had a great product -- and we did; people loved it in taste tests.
"But there is a strong brand loyalty to Ben & Jerry's and other premium ice-cream brands, and we weren't able to crack that. We've taken the products off the market and are reassessing them."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Hits 6-Week High As OPEC Prepares to Meet

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices climbed to a six-week high yesterday ahead of an OPEC meeting on Friday.
Some traders were also concerned about dwindling American crude stocks, and a number of short-sellers bought back futures contracts to cover their positions. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for April delivery rose 49 cents, to $15.37 a barrel, the highest settlement price for near-term deliveries since Feb. 4.
Heating oil and gasoline futures also jumped sharply. April heating oil rose 0.62 cent, to 45.09 cents a gallon, and April unleaded gasoline rallied 0.70 cent, to 46.62 cents a gallon.
Crude oil trading was dominated by speculation about what changes, if any, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will make in its production quota when the oil ministers of the 13 member nations gather in Geneva Friday for a quarterly meeting.
Most analysts expect OPEC to make no change in its official output ceiling of 24.5 million barrels a day, because Saudi Arabia and other big producers seem more concerned with maintaining market share than with cutting production to push up prices. Demand for crude remains relatively slack because of economic weakness in Europe and Japan.
But OPEC is unpredictable. "There's still the small possibility of a cutback," said Andrew Lebow, an analyst at E.D.& F. Man International Futures Inc. in New York. He said the jump in crude prices yesterday reflected the market's attempt to assess the probability that OPEC will reduce production rather than roll over the current quota into the second quarter.
A rollover would not necessarily mean lower prices in the months ahead, said Bob Baker of Prudential Securities Inc. "I think the world's got a fairly tight supply environment out there," he said. "This fairly tight market is giving us strength."
Supplies are tightening in Europe because of maintenance work that has shut down an important offshore drilling platform in the North Sea. A growing economy in the United States has also helped to tighten supplies.
Weekly inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, showed that American crude stocks in the mid-continent area were more than 14 million barrels below the level of a year ago, Mr. Lebow said.
He also noted that the biggest move was in the April contract, which expires today. Futures contracts tend to become more volatile as expiration approaches.
On other commodity markets, copper futures sank amid profit taking. Copper for May delivery fell 1.5 cents, to 90.7 cents a pound on the Commodity Exchange. The market reached an 11-month high last week in a rally driven by higher demand linked to the improving economy.

HEADLINE: Uncovered Short Sales Increase on 2 Exchanges

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Apparently emboldened by recent weakness in stock prices, speculators pushed up the number of shares sold short and not yet covered in the most recent reporting period, two stock exchanges reported yesterday.
The New York Stock Exchange said its total short position increased 3.4 percent during the monthlong period ended March 8, to a record 1.37 billion shares. The increase was the second largest in the last six months, and seemed to reflect rising confidence among bears that the long-awaited, often-predicted market correction was beginning. 
 At the American Stock Exchange, the short position rose 3.7 percent, to a record 108.8 million shares. It was the largest rise in four months.
 
Affected by Interest Rates
 Steadily rising interest rates in the last two months have injected an element of volatility into the stock market that has been lacking in recent years, raising hopes among short-sellers of a big price drop.
After the Federal Reserve Board tightened monetary policy on Feb. 4, "some things started happening in a hurry," said Harry Strunk, an investment consultant based in Palm Beach, Fla. "That got some people interested. It's a choppy market, and these shorts are hoping they see light at the end of the tunnel."
The three largest short positions -- in RJR Nabisco, Walt Disney and Chrysler -- all rose as short-sellers increased their bets.
While there are a number of reasons to sell shares short, including merger arbitrage, the most common impulse is to bet that the price of a stock will decline.
Short-sellers borrow a stock and sell it, hoping to profit if the price declines, enabling them to buy it back for less. The overall level of short sales is often seen as a sign of just how bearish traders are, and is sometimes used as a contrary indicator.
Despite the recent market volatility, the fact that short positions rose again last month came as a surprise to some who follow such activity.
"I would have anticipated that the number would have been stable to down," said Steve Kibbey, a vice president at Centurion Capital in La Jolla, Calif.
"The fact that merger deals are popping up and more mutual funds are taking short positions could be a reason why positions are up," he said. "But I don't find anybody who is making much money except those who are shorting the bond market."

Winners and losers as Japan expands cellular phones.

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHILE it has garnered all the headlines, the new trade agreement that improves access for Motorola is not the biggest development in Japan's cellular telephone market. Come April 1, regulatory changes will unleash a new burst of competition, spurring growth for the heretofore sluggish industry and providing new opportunities and new pitfalls for investors.
Consumers will be able to buy portable phones for the first time, instead of having to lease them from the phone company at inflated rates. Consumer electronics manufacturers will flood into the market, driving down the price of handsets. 
 Also starting in April, two new service providers will be allowed to operate in the Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka areas, bringing the number of competitors in those major cities to four. The two new service providers will offer digital service, which can carry more conversations on a given allotment of frequencies than the older analog technology that is now the mainstream.
One point overlooked in the dispute over the access of Motorola to the Japanese market is how relatively underdeveloped the cellular phone market is.
Japan was the first country to have cellular service and Japanese manufacturers are major worldwide suppliers of portable telephones. But like the cobbler's children who went without shoes, only about 1.5 percent of the population here uses cellular phones, compared with about 5 percent in the United States and Hong Kong and 6 to 8 percent in Scandinavia.
Analysts say a major reason for the slow growth has been lack of competition and high subscription fees. But while the new competition and lower prices expected after April 1 will spur growth, the path ahead for investors will still be tricky.
Most analysts say that it is difficult now to predict a winner among the many companies that will be making and selling cellular phones. Some say that all the companies will be hurt by a price war. And Japanese companies that manufacture in their high-cost country will have trouble competing with Motorola and Nokia, a company from Finland.
One supplier that could be a big loser is the Matsushita Communication Industrial Company, 56 percent owned by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Japan's largest consumer electronics manufacturer. Matsushita Communication has been the main supplier of portable phones to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, the largest cellular service provider.
"MCI has had a cozy time the last few years reaping monopoly profits from the closed domestic handset market," Jeffrey Camp, an analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities, wrote in a recent report in which he recommends selling the stock.
Phua Lee Kerk, analyst at Baring Securities, said it was wiser to invest in component suppliers, which will benefit from the increased demand for portable phones no matter which phone manufacturer triumphs.
He recommends Murata Manufacturing, a leading manufacturer of ceramic filters, and Toyo Communication Equipment, a manufacturer of crystal oscillators.
Among service providers, many analysts like the DDI Corporation, which provides cellular service in areas outside the heavily populated Tokyo-Nagoya corridor. It will now be moving into the Tokyo-Nagoya region because it owns a stake in one of the two new companies that will be allowed to provide service there.
Some analysts caution that cellular phone use will take off more slowly than some in the industry anticipate. Even though phones can be purchased, they will still cost more than $800, high by world standards. And the economy is still weak.
Makio Inui of Kleinwort Benson Securities recommends investing in companies that make base stations, antennas and other parts for cellular phone service. That equipment has to be installed before demand for phone service materializes.
One likely winner, he said, is Japan Radio, which provides base stations for N.T.T. Another is Denki Kogyo, which makes antennas. It often installs Motorola base stations, the number of which will increase under the recent trade agreement.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Agency Asks Giuliani to Include Police in Cutbacks

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
The chairman of the State Municipal Assistance Corporation yesterday called on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to include police officers, firefighters and teachers in his budget cuts as a way of proving to other municipal unions that the sacrifices he expects of them will be shared by all.
In an interview, Eugene J. Keilin, who recently took over from Felix G. Rohatyn as head of the agency set up to help the city recover from its fiscal crisis of the 1970's, said the Mayor was wrong to declare "sanctuaries" in his effort to improve productivity and eliminate 15,000 city jobs over the next year and a half. 
 Although Mr. Keilin has no formal role in the budget process, his agency controls a $200 million surplus that Mr. Giuliani is seeking to finance a package of severance payments for up to 7,600 employees. As a result, he said, it was his agency's responsibility to help determine how the money was used.
In his preliminary budget, Mayor Giuliani specifically excluded from cutbacks uniformed officers and civilians in the Police Department, firefighters and classroom teachers. He argued that they should be protected against reductions and any real concessions in benefits because to do so would harm the essential services they provide. Instead, the Mayor proposed sharp cuts in the number of sanitation workers, social-welfare providers and corrections personnel. He has also proposed cutting thousands of administrative jobs in the schools and city-owned hospitals.
But Mr. Keilin said: "In the Mayor's plan, there are targets and there are sanctuaries. I think a sense of rough justice requires that there be no sanctuaries."
Mr. Keilin did not specifically contend that the numbef police officers, firefighters and teachers should be significantly cut. But he suggestxd that they should not be permitted to avoid cutbacks entirely and should be asked to go along with benefit concessions and changes in work rules aimed at improving the performance of the city's vast bureaucracy. The police, firefighters and teachers represent more than half of the city's total work force of 216,000.
 
Seeking Union Cooperation
 In pragmatic terms, Mr. Keilin said, the city's fiscal problems can best be overcome only if Mr. Giuliani enlists the cooperation of the unions that are being called upon to accept sacrifices by their members. By exempting half of the city work force from major concessions, he said, the Mayor is making it harder to achieve the leaner and more effective city government he wants. He also said he fears that unions will oppose redeployment of workers from one agency to another unless the budget requires sacrifice from all.
"I've already said that directly to the Mayor," Mr. Keilin said.
Though the Mayor has not responded directly to Mr. Keilin's recommendations, he has in recent weeks vigorously rejected calls for cuts in the Police and Fire Departments, at one point saying it would be "crazy" to retreat from his campaign pledge to improve public safety.
Mr. Keilin's recommendations come amid a growing clamor from others outside the Mayor's office, including some City Council members close to the municipal unions, to spread the budget cuts more evenly.
"I think the Mayor's biggest mistake is his contention that staff reductions automatically mean reductions in services," said Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. "On the contrary, in many cases leaner organizations might actually be able to improve the services provided."
But Mr. Keilin's comments carry much greater weight because the M.A.C. is in a position to impose conditions on use of the $200 million Mr. Giuliani wants for the severance package. Ideally the buyouts would be used as an alternative to layoffs by inducing many to quit voluntarily.
"We think the severance program, as a concept, is an appropriate use of the surplus," Mr. Keilin said. "But there are a lot of details to be filled in, and it is up to the board of M.A.C. to determine the appropriate circumstances for the use of that money."
But Abraham Lackman, the Mayor's budget director, said Mr. Keilin did not understand the extent to which the budget plan already requires all city workers to pay for part of their health insurance. It also seeks productivity gains by calling on the city police, the transit police and the housing police to accept a merger.
"Everyone is being called upon for some sacrifices," Mr. Lackman said. He also said state law forbids the city to achieve budget savings in any way that reduces officers on patrol or squeezes extra work out of the police. "The Mayor has indicated his three priorities are public safety, economic development and education. We are not prepared to do anything that might undermine those priorities."
New York State established the Municipal Assistance Corporation in 1975 to help to market debt for the city after it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. When the city's financial health improved in the mid-1980's, the M.A.C.'s direct role in its fiscal affairs diminished. But Mr. Rohatyn, its chairman for 18 years, was frequently an outspoken critic of the city's budget and labor practices. By negotiating the terms under which the M.A.C. provided cash from its surplus funds, Mr. Rohatyn was sometimes able to persuade the city's politicians and unions to change their ways.
Mr. Keilin was the agency's executive director during much of the 1970's fiscal crisis and a longtime board member of the state agency.
 
Supporters in Campaign
 Asking the police, firefighters and teachers to join in accepting sacrifices to ease the budget gap would raise delicate political challenges for the Mayor. Police and fire unions supported Mr. Giuliani in the campaign, while the teachers remained neutral. Most of the city's labor movement backed David N. Dinkins.
Through a spokesman, Phil Caruso, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said Mr. Keilin's suggestion was "a knee-jerk reaction on the part of a new fiscal watchdog who is totally uneducated and uninformed."
Separately, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said yesterday that the Mayor's budget plan contained several uncertainties. He issued a report that identified as much as $1.4 billion of the Mayor's proposed $2.3 billion in budget savings that require action "by some organization other than city government, such as the State Legislature or the municipal unions."
The report also stated that the police and other uniformed agencies could rely further on civilians for office work.

HEADLINE: Job Extinction Evolving Into a Fact of Life in U.S.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The economy is growing and American companies are prospering, but announcements of job cuts this year are more numerous than ever. While there are no good measures of how much "fat" still remains in corporate America, the pressures are such that cuts seem likely to continue for months, or even years.
This is an unusual moment. Although many American companies have become as efficient and modern as those in Japan and Germany, several forces have arisen that continue to push them to shed workers. Advances in technology are allowing companies to produce much more with fewer employees. With price increases hard to get, companies increasingly maintain profits by slicing labor costs. And job shedding has become fashionable -- the mark of a good manager. A whole industry of consultants has arisen to preach it.
 
No End in Sight
 "It is going to be a permanent condition, that companies are constantly reorganizing and reshaping themselves," said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist and consultant, referring to the job cutbacks that have become a regular event among prosperous as well as hard-pressed companies. 
 For a while last year, a dip in the number of announced job cutbacks raised hopes that the trend might be tapering off, that corporate America had finally eliminated most of its fat. But that turned out to be illusory.
In January, the announcements of staff cutbacks surged again, to 108,946, a record for a single month, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago consulting firm that tallies job cuts. While there was a dip in February, the total of 143,564 for the first two months exceeded the record January-February level of last year. And the tally for this month already exceeds that for March of last year.
 
Rotating Impact
 The ebb and flow is a reflection of how the job-shedding process works -- affecting one industry (aerospace was hit hard last year) and then moving to another (telecommunications has been affected most recently).
For the aerospace industry, the common impetus was continuing military cutbacks as well as reductions in orders from the troubled commercial airlines. For telecommunications companies, the pressure has been sharper competition for market share that has resulted in significant discounting; labor cuts have helped the companies maintain profits.
But even as one industry finishes, another seems always to be there to take its turn. "A.T.& T. and the other phone companies can't lay off people indefinitely," said Paul Ostermann of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But when the phone companies stop, then the banks start in and then the retailers do it. The staff cuts migrate from industry to industry, and that is why the layoff announcements feel to the public like they are going on indefinitely."
The endless modernization has given corporate America the capacity to produce substantially more than people can buy. Consumers would have to increase their spending sharply to absorb all that the nation's industries can now produce, and such spending would require an economy much stronger than it is likely to be in 1994 or 1995, economists say. Only in those circumstances might there be an easing in the layoffs and cutbacks.
The sharp drop in the inflation rate since the 1980's is also driving the process. A decade ago, most companies could raise prices to cover rising labor costs. Now, in this inflation-conscious era, many companies cannot raise prices so easily, so they are quicker to cut labor costs to try to maintain profitability. The fear is that if they do not, then competitors will, here and abroad, and gain room to under-price them.
"It is not that foreigners are stealing our jobs, it is that we are all facing one another's competition, and we are doing so in a panic," said William Baumol, a Princeton University economist and expert on labor efficiency.
 
Not Just Blue-Collar Jobs
 During the last era of job shedding, in the 1980's, Rust Belt factories, mostly in the Midwest, were closed or modernized, so the same quantities of cars, steel, appliances, machinery and many other products could be made with a fraction of the old work force. American factories, in effect, became as efficient as those in Japan and Europe.
Now the process is sweeping well beyond factories, into almost every sector of the economy, into the ranks of white-collar workers as well as those on the assembly lines. Sears, Roebuck; BankAmerica; A.T.& T., and Aetna have joined General Electric, Xerox, Procter & Gamble and other manufacturers in shedding jobs.
"We are finally finding many new ways to use computers, and they are replacing people in many industries," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and consultant.
Economists predict that the number of job cuts announced this year could well exceed the 615,000 announced cuts last year as tallied by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Each year in this decade, the total has been higher than in the previous year.
Adding to the numbers is the pressure companies feel to keep paring. A.T.&. T., for example, has been shrinking its staff since it was broken up more than a decade ago, bringing stiff competition to an industry that had been an A.T.& T. monopoly. Last month it announced 15,000 new job cuts, bringing its total announced layoffs since early 1993 to more than 33,000.
Its latest job cuts involve many managerial people in the long-distance operation -- what the company describes as a one-time attempt to reduce the bureaucracy. But in the manufacturing division, which makes phones and switching equipment, the layoffs are ongoing.
"Manufacturing employment is primarily governed by technology, and new technology requires half the number of people in product assembly every six years," said Laurence C. Siefert, A.T.& T.'s vice president for manufacturing. A.T.& T.'s factory jobs in the United States, as a result, have fallen by 50,000 since the breakup, and they are likely to keep falling unless sales of A.T.& T. equipment more than double.
 
Excess Production
 That is because a worker in an A.T.& T. factory who assembled, say, 100 phones in an hour in 1992, increased that output to 110 phones last year. To offset this gain in productivity and keep employment steady, sales would have to rise by the extra 10 phones, or 10 percent. That has not happened. A.T.& T.'s equipment sales are rising 5 percent a year -- respectable, but not enough.
A.T.& T.'s productivity gains have been running at 10 percent a year since the mid-1980's, Mr. Siefert said. The company once used 126 parts in each of its phones; now they are based on a single computer chip, which itself has become too microscopic to be made by humans. "We have gone beyond that," Mr. Siefert said.
While a handful of companies find orders growing fast enough to require additional workers, the hurdle to be cleared before hiring begins -- particularly in manufacturing -- seems to be an annual sales increase of at least 10 percent.
 
Historical Parallel
 "What is happening in manufacturing today is precisely what happened in agriculture earlier in this century," Mr. Baumol said. With tractors, combines and other machinery replacing horses and people, food production shot up on American farms, while millions of Americans moved off the land to urban areas. Similarly, nearly three million people have been pushed out of manufacturing and mining since 1980, and they continue to migrate.
Until about 1950, the migration was from the farms to the new "job multiplier" industries, as Paul Kennedy, the Yale historian, calls them: railroads, automobiles, highway construction, aircraft manufacturing and airlines. Now, the migration is to retailing, health care, restaurants, finance, security and other jobs in the service sector.
These are the job-multiplier industries in late 20th-century America and they have, in fact, created enough jobs during the last decade or so to more than offset the job cutbacks. Last year, despite the cutbacks, two million people were added to the nation's total employment. Noting such figures, some economists describe the layoffs and downsizing not as job cutbacks, but as job "dislocation" -- the dislocation being the time it takes a worker laid off from A.T.& T., for example, to find a new job, quite likely at lower pay.
But the service sector in this decade might turn out to be far less of a job generator than it has been until now, for there, too, technology and "re-engineering" are enabling companies to cut employment.
Few companies illustrate this process more vividly than Sears, Roebuck, where 50,000 jobs eliminated from the merchandising division last year reduced the division's employment by 14 percent. And the cutbacks came while Sears was having a good year, with sales revenue rising at an annual rate of more than 10 percent.
"We are asking a fundamental question: Are our workers adding value?" said Anthony Rucci, executive vice president of merchandising for Sears. "When you wade into this area of what can we do to add value, a whole world opens up."
Many of the cutbacks were suggested by the employees, and Mr. Rucci noted the example of the clerk who spent an hour at a copying machine every morning making 20 copies of a thick daily sales report for 20 managers.
"The clerk noticed that the managers usually read only the report's summary," Mr. Rucci said, "and he thought, 'What if I copied only the summary, and then if the managers asked for additional information, I could copy those pages.' And that is what he does now."
 
Possible Drawback
 Do people lose their jobs if they suggest ways to eliminate their tasks? "That is a very complex question, a dynamic one," Mr. Rucci said, noting that while 50,000 jobs were eliminated last year, only 30,000 people left the company through layoffs, attrition and early retirement -- the rest being transferred to other Sears operations.
"The bulk of the cutbacks were in administration and we are now down to where we think we want to be," Mr. Rucci said. "We might even add salespeople on the floor at our stores, if revenue continues to show double-digit increases. But one thing I can tell you: There is a very strong commitment to get rid of needless staff work, tasks that don't add value, and that will continue."

HEADLINE: U.S. Goes to U.N. to Increase The Pressure on North Korea

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The United States started to build support today at the United Nations for tougher measures against North Korea, including economic sanctions. It also moved toward strengthening its military position on the Korean peninsula by ordering the dispatch of Patriot anti-missile interceptors.
The Administration's actions are the latest moves in the growing confrontation between the United States and North Korea over the Koreans' refusal to allow full inspection of its nuclear program. 
 But to reassure South Korea, which has been nervous about accepting the Patriot missiles, President Clinton has sent a letter to President Kim Young Sam saying Washington would consider a North Korean attack on South Korea to be an attack on the United States, American officials said.
"The message was that we have been working on this together and that we must resist North Korea's efforts to try to drive us apart," a senior Administration official said.
The United States action at the United Nations came after the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency passed a measure demanding that North Korea permit inspectors to complete their work and referring the matter to the Security Council.
Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, met today with delegates of the other four permanent members of the Security Council to discuss a draft resolution urging North Korea to comply with the energy agency's demands.
 
Counting Council Votes
 The draft refers indirectly to the possibility of sanctions and mentions further action by the Security Council if the North Koreans do not relent, a senior Western diplomat said.
While Britain and Russia are supportive, and France, which is heading the Council this month, is urging a tough line, China's response is a big question mark. As a permanent member, China has a veto in the Council and its cooperation will be needed if a firm warning is to be issued and sanctions are to be imposed.
China abstained when the 35-member board of the energy agency approved its resolution. But when Ms. Albright discussed the draft today, the Chinese representative said he had no instructions from Beijing.
United States officials said the Council would not vote on the measure until Hans Blix, the director general of the energy agency, briefed Council members on Thursday.
A United States official said the reference in the draft resolution was, "in diplomatic parlance, a warning that economic sanctions could follow if North Korea fails to comply."
"We are pursuing a deliberate strategy of gradual escalation or pressure in order to obtain international support to turn the North Koreans around," he added.
Washington's decision to lay the groundwork for possible economic sanctions has led to a new round of saber-rattling by the North Koreans, who say they will regard sanctions as an act of war.
Thus, Washington is sending Patriots as a precaution. President Clinton, in announcing the decision as he arrived in Florida for a meeting on health care, said, "We have agreed that it is in our national interest and in the interest of the security of the people of South Korea and the security of our armed forces there to send Patriot missiles at this time, and we are going to do that."
 
Renewing Military Exercises
 A Pentagon spokesman said the missiles would be sent by sea, taking about 30 days to reach South Korea. Washington could have flown the Patriots out but appears to be trying to avoid a sense of crisis. The spokesman said up to six Patriot batteries and 800 soldiers would be sent.
United States and South Korean officials also plan to reschedule their joint military exercise for this year, though the timing has yet to be determined. The exercise was suspended as a goodwill gesture to North Korea.
The Patriot missiles, which would protect South Korean ports and airfields from any Scud missile attacks by North Korea, were requested in December by Gen. Gary E. Luck, the United States commander in South Korea. The Administration decided to send the missiles in January but the delivery was delayed because the South Koreans were concerned about the effect on its talks with North Korea.
Despite the North's blunt comments, there were no unusual North Korean troop movements or other signs that an attack might be imminent. But because most of the North's striking power is stationed close to its border with the south, it could launch an attack on very short notice.
Military officials say it is important to send the Patriots soon because transporting them is such a time-consuming process. If the Patriots were sent by plane, they would use up space needed for other critical supplies and reinforcements, General Luck told Congress this month.
While Washington is hoping North Korea will allow further inspections, the North has responded with a fusillade of angry language.
At a meeting on Saturday between North and South Korean officials negotiating an exchange of envoys, the North Korean representative not only predicted the fall of Seoul but leveled a personal threat against his South Korean counterpart, according to an account circulating within the Administration. Then the North Korean walked out.
Earlier today, the North Koreans threatened to withdraw completely from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if Washington carried out military exercises and backed sanctions.
"This perfidious act of the United States is creating a grave situation on the Korean peninsula that may bring the Korean nation back to confrontation and war," the Foreign Ministry said.
Some Administration officials, inured to North Korean threats, said it was possible that the North might yet agree to more inspections. North Korea presented a compromise proposal to the atomic energy agency over the weekend, but the agency said it represented a retreat from what the North has previously agreed to.
While Asian countries have been urging Washington to go slow, the Administration has been hit by criticism from Republican lawmakers who say Mr. Clinton is not being firm enough on national security issues. Trying to strike a balance, the Administration is pursuing gradual measures.
The first step would be the United Nations warning that Washington has proposed. Sanctions would follow. One initial sanction could be to end money transfers from Japan to North Korea. One of the toughest measures would be to cut off oil shipments, but this will not be pursued right away.
By taking a gradual approach, the Administration argues that it is leaving time for North Korea to change its stance and for China to decide not to wield its veto.
Further fueling the debate is the uncertainty over what effect sanctions may have on the reclusive North Korean Government.
An intelligence analysis of the North's nuclear program last year argued that sanctions would be unlikely to sway the Government, which might choose, for example, simply to subject its citizens to new level of privation. The assessment also warned that sanctions might prompt an attack by the North Koreans.

Albright Is Optimistic
 UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, said today that China was unlikely to block a resolution threatening North Korea with sanctions.
"It is very evident the Chinese are as interested as any of us in a denuclearized peninsula," she said after her talks with Britain, France and Russia, the other three members of the Security Council.

HEADLINE: Becoming a Land of the Smoke-Free, Ban by Ban

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Once, in a country proud of its rugged individualism, frontier spirit and wild-blue-yonder toughness, smokers were in the ascendant. They moved through clouds of blue from the movies to the malls. They flicked embers at total strangers in hazy, jazz-filled bars. They exhaled a mix of nicotine, carbon monoxide and invisible carcinogens in cozy corners at their jobs. They puffed with impunity from coast to coast.
Now: quarantine. 
 Smoking regulations have tightened across America since they were first imposed in the early 1960's. Today, from a city like Davis, Calif., which allows smoking almost nowhere except in the privacy of one's home, to a company like Rodale Press in Emmaus, Pa., which forbids smoking in its network of offices -- and even keeps separate closets for smokers -- smoking is increasingly becoming a very private act.
Legislation being considered in Congress this week could take the nation one step further, uniformly banning smoking in all public buildings used by 10 or more people a week.
Until such legislation passes, smokers, many angry and resentful at being treated like pariahs, face a morass of laws backed up by weak enforcement but strong peer pressure.
Last week, when New York City lawmakers proposed sweeping restrictions on smoking, potentially banning the practice in virtually all public places except for designated, specially ventilated rooms, the city joined a nationwide movement toward snuffing out cigarettes in public.
As long ago as 1964, when Los Angeles banned smoking on its public buses, smokers started finding their freedom to light up constricted in favor of the health and inhalation habits of the nonaddicted. Since then, in a haphazard application of new health codes and public safety measures, smoking has been banned in many hospitals, restaurants, workplaces and all domestic airline flights.
In California, almost 300 local ordinances now restrict smoking in some form. Of those, about 100 ban smoking altogether in offices or restaurants or both. Partial bans in other communities have relegated smokers to special rooms or left them to huddle and puff in stairwells or outside their buildings' entrances. Many rules call for voluntary compliance. Some carry fines of $50 to $500.
In Davis, outside Sacramento, it has been illegal to light a cigarette in an outdoor cafe, a bar or any restaurant since February 1993. As a result, the city is virtually smoke-free. Even the most dedicated smokers cannot light up outdoors without first stepping 20 paces from their offices' entrance to protect the innocent.
Mayor Lois Wolk says, "We don't have smoking police and we won't have smoking police," but one smoker who lit up at an outdoor cafe was hit with a $50 fine after a citizen complained. Other than that single case, said Mayor Wolk, the ordinance has been both cheered and widely accepted. It is, she says, a grass-roots thing.
This September, Washington will become the first state in the country with a general smoking ban in public and private offices. "Second-hand smoke is killing workers," explained Mark O. Brown, who ordered the ban as the director of the Department of Labor and Industries. "I don't want the body count to get higher on my watch."
The labor department is counting on voluntary compliance. But based on an employee's call or written complaint, the department will send inspectors to a workplace, and if a pattern of violations is found, the department can impose fines of several hundred to several thousand dollars. Employers can appeal the fines to Superior Court.
While labor officials are prepared to punish errant smoking in Washington, enforcement elsewhere varies, falling to the police in some places, to the fire department in others and simply to the consciences of smokers in others.
In most cases, transgressions are handled through peer pressure and the occasional loud complaint. Often, the formal complaint procedure is so cumbersome it is ignored.
In Chicago, a Clean Indoor Air Ordinance would expand a ban to any public space. But a citizen must send a detailed letter of complaint to the Chicago Department of Health, and department officials concede that enforcement is both hard, and hardly a priority.
In some cases, a merchant might ignore a ban to accommodate clients who smoke. After restaurateurs and patrons complained, Beverly Hills, Calif., rolled back a 1986 ban on restaurant smoking; now a restaurant must be 60 percent smoke-free.
But if a powerful Congressman from California has his way, there will soon be a nationwide restriction on smoking, with a system of enforcement.
On Tuesday, the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment begins hearings on the Smoke-Free Environment Act, which is intended to bring national order out of this haze of conflicting regulations. Endorsed by a disparate group of backers that includes Carol M. Browner, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Medical Association and the National Council on Chain Restaurants, it proposes to ban smoking inside virtually every building in the country, except homes, that is regularly entered by 10 or more people a week.
Smoking within those buildings would be permitted only in rooms specially built to accommodate the habit and its fumes. The measure, sponsored by the subcommittee chairman, Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, is expected to be ferociously opposed by the tobacco industry.
Under the bill, the Federal courts can impose fines of up to $5,000 a day on the building's owner if a pattern of violations is shown to have occurred with the owner's consent. A citizen can begin such court action only after giving the owner a written complaint and 60 days to comply with smoking laws. No fines can be imposed for isolated violations, and the complainant is not entitled to damages. The bill would take effect a year after passage.
Well in advance of national legislation, smoking bans have moved to encompass everything from school grounds to coat closets.
At Rodale Press, a publisher of health and athletic magazines that accepts neither cigarette nor alcohol advertising, smokers and nonsmokers are given separate closets. There, smoking has been prohibited at the company's 13 buildings for about 20 years, and most smokers leave the grounds to light up. A reward system with prizes like sweatsuits or sweatshirts gives extra points to employees who do not smoke and live in nonsmoking households.
"Smokers come here and I think they recognize they are going to be in the minority," said Patrick S. Taylor, a company spokesman. "When you get world-class athletes running at lunch, championship bicyclists riding bikes, people walking all the time, a cafeteria full of nutritional food, I think you get the message through osmosis."
Some companies and school districts have taken a more punitive approach. In Washington State, smoking on school grounds was banned in 1990, and in Seattle, the punishment for a student caught smoking twice on school grounds is a day's suspension.
 
Bans in Tobacco Country
 Not surprisingly, smoking restrictions have been slowest to arrive in the South, where tobacco is grown, an above-average share of residents smoke and the tobacco lobby is entrenched and mighty. But the bans are on the way.
The tobacco lobby showed its power in Georgia last year when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would have deprived local governments of the ability to pass antismoking ordinances. That bill was killed by Lieut. Gov. Pierre Howard.
But a similar effort in North Carolina backfired. When the Legislature there passed a law overriding local ordinances on smoking, more than 50 local governments took advantage of loopholes to preserve their right to have smoking restrictions.
In Atlanta, where smoking was banned in most public places last April, lighting up is not allowed in most areas of the Hartsfield International Airport. But last year, Philip Morris Companies announced a plan to build smoking lounges there.
In Kentucky, the fight continues. "We are at the very end of this parade," said J. C. Compton, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky chapter of the American Cancer Society. A bill pending in the state Senate would require all buildings with smoking bans to provide a smoking area. But that bill, Ms. Compton said, has been heavily amended in favor of nonsmokers. "Even though Kentucky is thought of as a tobacco state and tobacco continues to be important to our economy, there are legislators who will stand up and do the right thing," she said.
Smokers do not always agree that the "right thing" as perceived by Ms. Compton is the right thing for them. The Post Office, for example, forbids workers to smoke anywhere on postal property.
"We greatly resent the plan," said Rose Clark, an information clerk in East Lansing, Mich. "But we are allowed to stand outside behind the building, slime that we are, and indulge our habit."

Chart: "Cracking Down on Smokers"
 There has been a rapid succession of new restrictions across the nation on smoking. Here are some of them:
 
The workplace
 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE: On March 7, the Pentagon said it would ban smoking in all indoor spaces on military bases around the workl, except in restaurants, recreational areas, barracks and other housing. The ban takes effect on April 8.
 
RESTAURANTS: On March 15, the Jack in the Box said it would ban smoking byh employees and customers, effective on April 15. The McDonald's Corporation had earlier imposed such a ban in its restaurants, and the Taco Bell Corporation has recently done the same.
 
Cities, states
 
ASPEN, COLO.: In j1987, the city banned smoking in all restaurants, the first of dozens of cities nationwide to enact such a prohibition.
 
CALIFORNIA: San Francisco, San Jose and other cities have banned smoking in nearly all indoor spaces, extending the prohibition to offices, factories, restaurants, stores and other public places; housing is exempt. In Davis, it has been illegal to light a cigarette in an outdoor cafe, a bar, a restaurant or a public park since February 1993.
 
MARYLAND: On March 8, the state's Department of LIcensing and Regulation said it would ban smoking in enclosed public places, like malls, restaurants, bars and stores, and in all indoor public and private workplaces, except in specially designated smoking rooms.
 
VERMONT: The state imposed a ban last year on smoking in all enclosed public spaces, including government buildings, malls and bank lobbies.
 
WASHINGTON STATE: On March 14, the state's Department of Labor and Industries announced a smoking ban in all public and private offices, except in specially ventilated smoking rooms. It takes effect on Sept. 1.

HEADLINE: Pollution Of Water Tied to Oil In Ecuador

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
AFTER three decades of oil exploration and production in Ecuador's Amazon region, sections of the rain forest are now so contaminated that Indians and colonists living there are exposed to high risks of cancer, a new water sample study indicates.
"Drinking water, bathing and fishing water and produced water samples contained levels of toxic oil constituents many times greater than" the safety guidelines set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the study concluded. The report was released yesterday in Washington by the Center for Economic and Social Rights, a New York-based health and human rights group. 
 Painting a picture of water pollution in the Amazon region rivaled only by that produced by gold mining operations in Brazil, the report said the fault lay with the Texaco Petroleum Company and Petroecuador, the nation's state oil company. From 1972, the year commercial oil production started in Ecuador's Amazon, until 1992, the two companies were responsible for 88 percent of oil production in the region.
"Residents of the Oriente are exposed to levels of oil-related contaminants significantly exceeding internationally recognized safety limits," the report concluded, referring to Ecuador's Amazon. "Dermatoses and other skin problems apparently related to oil contamination were observed in residents near oil facilities."
 
Water Samples Are Collected
 In April 1993, the center sent a team of Harvard-trained scientists to Ecuador's Amazon, where they collected 33 drinking and bathing water samples from inhabited areas surrounding Petroecuador production sites. The samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a toxic element of crude oil. Calculating that 28 nanograms per liter of water corresponds to a lifetime cancer risk of one in 100,000, the United States environmental agency recommends that the level of these hydrocarbons in ambient water be reduced to zero.
But the Ecuador drinking water samples were found to have concentrations ranging from 33 nanograms per liter to 2,793 nanograms per liter. Samples of fishing and bathing water found concentrations ranging from 40 nanograms per liter to 1,486 nanograms per liter. Samples taken of water leaking out of waste water pits ranged from 46,500 to 405,634 nanograms per liter.
"Those exposed to the oil had a higher occurrence of abortion, elevated rates of fungal infection, dermatitis, headache and nausea," the report said, summarizing a separate study of 1,465 Amazon residents by a local health group, the Ecuadorean Union of Popular Health Promoters.
Primary pollution sources are unlined waste pits, earthen tanks filled with a toxic stew from the oil production and separation process -- contaminated water, muds and oil. Today, most international environmental regulations require drillers to reinject these toxic byproducts deep underground, a practice that was little used when Texaco first started drilling in Ecuador's Amazon in the mid-1960's.
In 1990, Texaco ceded operations of its wells to Petroecuador, the majority partner in a production consortium. "Petroecuador continues to employ the environmentally dangerous equipment and practices inherited from Texaco, including the discharge of toxic wastes directly into the environment," the study charged.
 
Texaco Blames Government
 Texaco officials said that the company was not responsible for water pollution conditions four years after it stopped operating in the region. Citing a lack of specific environmental legislation in Ecuador until 1990, they said they did not violate any laws before turning operations over to Petroecuador. They also said Ecuador's Government was to blame for encouraging Andean peasants to settle near oil wells, using oil company roads.
"Our operations in Ecuador only occupied 6,400 acres out of 32 million acres in Ecuador's Amazon," J. Michael Trevino, a Texaco spokesman, said in a telephone interview. "We haven't seen any evidence of a link between the consortium's production and an increase in levels of cancer."
Texaco officials have said they would contribute to a proposed $13.5 million Oriente cleanup fund. Petroecuador, for its part, attributes the pollution to Texaco, saying that Texaco operated the fields for 18 years.
In a welter of lawsuits surrounding the Texaco legacy in Ecuador, lawyers who say they represent 30,000 Amazon Indians tribes filed a class-action suit last November in a New York Federal court for $1 billion in cleanup costs and damages; the authors of yesterday's report have filed affidavits supporting the Indians' cause. A few weeks later, Texaco filed five suits in Ecuadorean courts demanding that the Government pay a total of $570 million for breach of contracts.
A factor hampering environmental enforcement in Ecuador's Amazon is the impoverished nation's desperate need for oil revenue. Determined to increase production, Ecuador has withdrawn from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and has embarked on an investment plan to increase national production by one-third by 1997.

HEADLINE: Everglades: Paradise Not Quite Lost

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla.

 BODY:
AT first glance, the Everglades gives no obvious hint that even though it remains one of the world's superlative ecosystems it is sorely in need of restoration. But such an effort is now getting under way, and none anywhere is more ambitious.
Along Shark River Slough, a main channel in the heart of the great marsh, cloud shadows race across a carpet of eye-high, wheat-colored sawgrass that flashes shades of lemon, lime and pink as it runs to the horizon. Emerald tree islands break the flat expanse here and there. Closer in, surrounded by clumps of algae that float among the sawgrass stems and form the base of the marsh's food pyramid, alligators lie in water less than a foot deep. One carries her baby on her back. Bullfrogs croak. Turtles mate. A deer delicately browses. Wading birds like egrets, ibises, herons and wood storks hunt, preen and squawk. 
 The scene's vitality is profoundly misleading, however. Where tourists can now see perhaps a score of wading birds at once during the winter-spring breeding season, there were thousands not so long ago. As recently as the 1970's, it took a full minute for a flock to fly overhead, said Steve Bing, a park ranger. Today, biologists say, the number of wading birds breeding in the glades has plummeted by 90 percent from natural levels.
That is bad news for the ecosystem at large, since the reproduction of wading birds, at the apex of the food pyramid, is a direct barometer of the system's general health. Their decline is a sign that fish and other aquatic organisms have also declined seriously, and 33 species of Everglades animals are listed by the Government as endangered or threatened.
The responsibility for this must be laid on man. People have reduced the Everglades by half, to about 2,000 square miles, over the last century, and have diverted too much water from what remains for their own purposes.
Now some of the same Federal and state agencies that oversaw the decline of the Everglades are combining efforts to re-establish, as far as possible, the natural flows and rhythms of its water -- its hydrology. The hope is that restoring the hydrology will create conditions in which Everglades life can rebound to a healthy level, albeit within a smaller arena.
The job will require rearranging and partly undoing one of the biggest and most intricate public works in American history: the vast network of canals and levees that altered the natural hydrology almost beyond recognition in an effort to drain land for South Florida's cities and farms, supply them with water and protect them from floods.
In one early step, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to breach levees and install new culverts north of Shark River Slough (pronounced slew) this spring and summer in an experimental attempt to direct more water back into the slough, historically the primary conduit into moisture-deficient Everglades National Park.
Restoring the Everglades is viewed as an exercise in ecological trial and error that will take many years. No one knows enough about the ecosystem's nuances to be sure exactly how it will respond to efforts to re-plumb it, and adjustments will have to be made as the enterprise proceeds. Moreover, even an undisturbed ecosystem is continually changing. For one thing, legions of plants imported from other parts of the world are invading the Everglades, and bringing them under control will test the restorationists' ingenuity and resolution.
"It's always going to be a moving target," says Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who last year organized an 11-agency Federal task force to work with Florida officials in producing an Everglades restoration strategy. But the eventual payoff could be enormous, he said, calling the project "the ultimate test of ecosystem restoration."
Mr. Babbitt has made the protection, recovery and restoration of whole ecosystems the centerpiece of his conservation policy. Working from an analysis of the problem by scientists advising the new task force, the Corps of Engineers is devising an Everglades-wide re-plumbing plan, to be completed by the end of this year.
The scientists' analysis drew heavily on a new book, "Everglades: The Ecosystem and Its Restoration," edited by Steven M. Davis of the South Florida Water Management District and John C. Ogden of Everglades National Park. A second book, "The Everglades Handbook: Understanding the Ecosystem," by Dr. Thomas E. Lodge, an independent ecologist, also contributes to an expanding body of knowledge about Everglades ecology. Both are published by St. Lucie Press in Delray Beach, Fla.
What shape the Everglades ultimately takes will depend as much on economics and politics as on science. A bitter and still-unsettled legal battle over controlling the runoff of fertilizer from farm fields has until now monopolized the public spotlight on Everglades restoration. The more sweeping and fundamental replumbing effort carries the seeds of more extensive conflict.
"First, we took care of the drinking water needs," said Carol Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, of human priorities during most of this century. "Then agricultural production would expand, and whatever water was left over went to the natural system."
A native of South Florida, Ms. Browner has been involved in Everglades restoration as an official at both the Federal and state levels. Contention is sure to arise as restorationists try to redress the imbalance she pinpoints. But proponents of the restoration insist that apart from the Everglades' intrinsic value, their role in recharging the state's aquifers and attracting tourists makes them an indispensable economic asset.
A century ago, the Everglades consisted of a vast subtropical marsh extending more than 100 miles, from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Scientists believe that except in periods of drought, most of the marsh was continually flooded. The merest of north-south slopes in the essentially flat terrain allowed a broad sheet of water, seldom more than three feet deep, to flow from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay, where it helped support the bay's own rich estuarine ecosystem. The journey of a single drop might take a full year.
 
'Soup of Organic Production'
 The marsh functioned as a gigantic collector of solar energy, which was then converted into nutritional energy by plants and stored ultimately in the bodies of aquatic animals. Dr. Crawford S. Holling, an ecologist at the University of Florida who contributed to the Davis-Ogden book, calls the historic marsh a "soup of organic production" consisting of algae, aquatic insects, snails, crayfish, turtles and a wide variety of other organisms.
Because of the landscape's flatness, small changes in elevation produced a striking variety of mini-habitats, which were home to an equally great variety of plant and animal combinations. Holly, sweet bay, red bay, wax myrtle, cocoplum, cabbage palmetto and willow sprouted from mid-marsh knolls of peat called bayheads. "Air plants," non-parasitic plants like orchids that take their nourishment directly from the air, grew on many of them.
In places where the water was deep enough for shallow ponds to develop, water lilies replaced sawgrass. Here and there, alligators gouged out and maintained deeper holes that became refuges for great numbers of other creatures in times of drought or, in some places, in the dry season.
Beginning in October or November, as the wet season ended, what ecologists call an annual "drydown" began. Water levels fell, exposing some of the land. Fish and other aquatic life concentrated in smaller areas, often in what Dr. Holling describes as "little depressions and potholes determined by centimeters of topograpy."
This concentration of food produced a bonanza for wading birds. As the drydown proceeded, feeding hotspots would continually disappear in some places and appear in others, but the ecosystem's great size meant that the birds could always find a foraging area. The steady availability of food concentrations, scientists believe, was what enabled the birds to catch enough to feed their young.
 
Diverting the Water
 Now, this elegant ecological pattern has been shattered. The drainage and conversion to human use of roughly half the Everglades has drastically reduced the production of aquatic life. Levees dammed Lake Okeechobee, blocking the year-round sheet flow, and divided the glades into a series of big pools. A maze of canals diverted water into municipal supplies and farm fields and into the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for flood control.
The net result is that wet-season water levels are lower in most of the Everglades, and wide stretches are no longer under water during most of the year. With the over-all ecosystem producing perhaps half as much aquatic life as before, and large expanses dry, the ability of the marsh to sustain wading birds and their young during the critical winter nesting period has been greatly reduced. One result, for instance, is that the ungainly wood stork, the only stork that breeds in North America, has nested in the park only twice in the last 20 years and is in danger of extinction.
It has also become more difficult to recharge the aquifers on which South Floridians depend for their water supply. Intensive drainage and agriculture have caused widespread and continuing soil loss. Government scientists say that the runoff of phosphorus from fertilized farms is spurring an overabundance of plants like cattails that threaten in some places to overwhelm the delicate and diverse Everglades plant community.
Scientists consider the cornerstone of Everglades restoration to be the re-establishment of historic patterns of water distribution. "We need a much wetter wet season to get production back up and a more natural dry season," Mr. Ogden said.
One indispensable element in any restoration plan, scientists say, is to recapture the vast amounts of water that are now drained into the Atlantic and the Gulf. "Otherwise there's not enough water," said Mr. Davis, Mr. Ogden's co-author. "It's as simple as that."
How closely the natural ideal of uninterrupted north-to-south sheet flow should be approached may emerge as a major point of debate. Mr. Davis and others believe that if water were now allowed to flow the length of South Florida unimpeded, the northern reaches of the Everglades would become too dry.
What remains of the Everglades is divided into four compartments separated by levees: Everglades National Park on the south and three Water Conservation Areas adjacent to it in the north, the northernmost of which contains the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Since water drains southward, the northern part of each water conservation area is drier than the southern part, and the fear is that if all the restraining levees were knocked out, the same thing would be true for the system at large, even if more water were re-directed into it.
While it is "extremely important" to flood the marsh according to natural patterns, Mr. Davis said, "I don't know if you need sheet flow to do that."
One alternative is to open links here and there between the compartments so that water can be moved between them in a controlled manner to maintain natural water levels and flooding periods. A particularly attractive option might be to create wide "flow ways" between elements of the system.
The Corps of Engineers is presumably grappling with questions like this as it works on its proposal to replumb the marshes, a task it apparently relishes. "There's not a better job in the world," said Col. Terrence C. Salt, the officer in charge, who is known to his friends and colleagues as Rock.
What are the long-term prospects?
Thanks to the contiguous park and water conservation areas, all of them government-owned, huge pieces of the historic system, however dried out, are preserved and protected, and with them many representatives of most of its innumerable plant and animal species. That is more than many other restoration projects start with.
But whether the compartmentalization of the Everglades and the use of its water for multiple purposes can be effectively altered "is really unknown," said Dr. Lodge, the "Handbook" author. And even if the historic water-flow patterns can be established, he said, it remains to be seen how large a rebound in wildlife populations will follow. "It's highly probable we can improve the situation," he said. "But whether it will be a dramatic improvement is the unknown factor."

GRAPHIC: Photos: Man-made dams and levees have caused water levels to fall for many years in the Everglades. The number of wading birds has dropped by 90 percent. Alligators often bask or hunt in water less than a foot deep. (Susan Greenwood for The New York Times) (pg. B8)
 
Daigram: "124 years of assault"
 Originally, the Everglades was a subtropical marsh reaching more than 100 miles, most of it wet all year; a broad sheet of shallow water flowed slowly from north to south. A vast network of canals and levees drained land for cities and farms, supplied them with water and protected them from floods. The sheet flow was blocked, leaving pools that support only a fraction of the original 'soup of organic production.'
A food chain leading up to wading birds Floating yellowish-green masses called periphyton, formed mostly of algae, are the basis of the food chain. Periphyton also removes calcium from hard water and converts it to marl, in which sawgrass roots. Dead sawgrass become peat, which supports tree islands.
 "Marsh Diversity"
 Small differences in water depth help create many different kinds of environment withing the Evergaldes.
 
"A first step in restoration"
 Restorationists hope that breaching two levees and installing culverts will direct more water into Shark River Slough, main conduit to Everglades National Park.

HEADLINE: Beware the Hawks on Korea

 BODY:
North Korea can still avoid a confrontation with the international community by keeping the promise it made earlier this month and allowing inspectors back into its nuclear sites to complete their work. Otherwise it may soon face economic sanctions for its noncompliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
Pyongyang's obstinacy may leave President Clinton no choice but to press for limited economic sanctions through the United Nations. But in doing so he needs to hold open the door to diplomatic dialogue, which is the only way out of his, and North Korea's, nuclear predicament. 
 Mr. Clinton should be in no hurry to heed the advice of Congressional hawks, who see economic strangulation and military posturing as the only way to bring North Korea around. If he pushes too soon for overly tight sanctions, he may end up confronting his Asian allies instead of North Korea. And if he does not carefully calibrate his military moves, he may stumble into war.
The International Atomic Energy Agency sent the right message yesterday. It told North Korea to let its inspectors do their job. And it informed the U.N. Security Council that Pyongyang had failed to live up to treaty obligations, triggering consideration of unspecified economic sanctions. Even China, which has counseled patience, abstained -- a sign of the North's deepening isolation.
Hawks see tight sanctions as a way of causing North Korea's economic collapse. But America's allies, South Korea and Japan, have reason to fear the consequences of collapse -- having to cope with a flood of refugees and, for a rapidly developing South, having to support an economic basket case in the North. They also fear that an embittered Kim Il Sung could order his million-man army south.
Given these fears, the allies are likely to stop short of voting for truly tight sanctions that could strangle the North by cutting off its supply of oil. And China, even if it does not veto sanctions, might hesitate to carry them out. That's why any effort to impose tight sanctions immediately may prove fruitless.
Unfortunately, a limited embargo may have little more than symbolic impact on an already autarkic North. That is a chance the U.N. should take while gradually increasing pressure on North Korea. But no matter how tight the sanctions, they will leave the North free to produce plutonium for bomb-making. That will infuriate hawks, who already are rashly calling for military action.
Some limited military moves makes sense. South Korea has now accepted deployment of Patriot anti-missile batteries, which afford air bases and ports some protection against North Korean missile attacks should the North react forcibly to economic sanctions. But South Korea and the U.S. have no need to rush ahead with joint military exercises. And more aggressive military moves will be mostly bluff. There is no attack that could surgically excise the North's nuclear program without risking all-out war on the Korean Peninsula. Indeed, no one knows how to target bombs that cannot be found. But Mr. Clinton, not the hawks, will be held responsible if their glib advice misfires.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
No More Mr. Hangdog

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Step back one clear minute and we discover this about Clinton foreign policy:
On two of the most important issues in the world the U.S. is acting with coolness and courage, the only country providing leadership or sense of direction. 
 One is the issue wrapped up in the dispute with North Korea: nuclear proliferation, the creation of nuclear military power in nations given to blackmail or terrorism.
The other is the essence of the quarrel with Beijing. Should Western capital and purchasing power be used only to strengthen a Communist Government built on police power, or can they also be used to lessen Communist repression, however slightly?
By and large, Americans are healthily conscious of their faults, and those of their Government. But when we become so immersed in national doubt and self-criticism that we seem unaware of the honorable handling of two critical problems then hangdog becomes a way of life, which is not one bit healthy.
On China, the Clinton foreign policy team is trying to persuade Beijing to give the Chinese people and the captive Tibetans minimal human rights. That would not much change the basis of Communist rule: repression.
But it would help Chinese and Tibetans some. And it would allow President Clinton to extend low-tariff privileges when the decision mandated by Congress comes in May.
Sour Irony Department: Secretary of State Warren Christopher goes to Beijing to tell the Communists that they are not doing enough to justify a Presidential decision to maintain the low tariffs. The Chinese are nasty to him and America before he opens his mouth, and after. So, back home, the Washington knives come out -- not for Beijing but for Mr. Christopher, for doing his job.
And, speaking of mugging, somebody should tell Treasury officials to stop stabbing the human rights policy. I nominate the President. "Shut up" would be a fine way for him to start the conversation.
Outside government, a massive campaign against linking tariff privileges to a bit of human rights progress is being carried out by Americans in the China trade.
Right now business with China means we buy, they sell -- a $20 billion U.S. deficit. We hear about jobs created by exports to China but not losses to American labor and businesses from imported goods made by dollar-a-day Chinese workers.
Americans in the China trade never talk about unpleasant political realities, so let's. The Government and Communist Party own much of Chinese industry. They keep wages low so that more money goes to the controlling partners -- the army, the police, the Politburo ruling clans -- courtesy of the American consumer and American worker.
About North Korea, the Clinton team did two things that its predecessor did not accomplish: first, face the danger of Pyongyang's nuclear empowerment; second, do something. The Administration, President down, acted without bravado or hot talk. This is too dicey an issue for that.
When North Korea tore up its nuclear treaty commitments, by refusing to allow full inspection, Washington first tried to coax the North into compliance. The U.S. offered economic and political goodies.
Maybe Washington was too gentle, but I do not see it that way. For any political, military or economic action, Mr. Clinton needed the support of South Korea and Japan. Anybody who does not sympathize with Japanese or South Korean tensions should go sit in a rice field and practice waiting for an incoming missile.
Wisely, Washington left the war talk to the North Koreans. Now that the U.S. has moved to the U.N. to increase pressure on Pyongyang, the North Koreans get piercingly shrill. Is this a bluff or are they so puffed up with themselves that again they will start a Korean war?
From Washington the world has learned that the danger of proliferation is real and upon us -- and that the decision for sanctions, war or compliance with treaty is in the hands of the North Korean dictatorship.
On China and North Korea, from the Administration so far has come neither enticement, entrapment, hysteria nor surrender, but a decent respect for nuclear safety and democratic idealism, at a time when both are being tested.
May that remain the course.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Plays Down 'Ideas' Survey, Finding Some Are Divisive

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Urging them to show that they belonged to "a party of ideas," Republicans last fall surveyed more than 800,000 of their most active supporters on major issues. But now that nearly 134,000 responses are in, they are not entirely comfortable with the ideas they are receiving.
To their surprise, the Republicans found that some party loyalists' opinions were not what they had expected, especially on abortion, an issue on which the respondents were deeply split. 
 The results set off a debate within the Republican Party over whether making the figures public would only widen the divisions on abortion and infuriate conservative members. That has left Republican officials trying to play down the survey's results.
The Republicans have yet to promote the survey's findings in the press, as they did when the survey was mailed out last September. Instead, they made public an analysis in the Republican house organ, Rising Tide, that omits most of the specific figures on the abortion issue.
 
Split Is Put at 48%-43%
 The only figure it cited was that 48 percent were "pro life" -- as the survey was worded -- although party officials later acknowledged that 43 percent said they favored abortion rights. The magazine merely said that there were "some interesting findings" and that "Republicans are not monolithic on the issue."
"I was told there was some controversy," said Jan van Lohuizen, president of Voter Consumer Research, a Republican polling company in Bethesda, Md., that conducted the survey.
Describing reaction within the Republican Party, he said: "People were reacting negatively to some of the questions. There were some concerns about why did we ask those questions. And it wasn't just about abortion."
Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, disputed whether there was a controversy and said he was not taken aback by the findings.
"I did not find the numbers surprising," said Mr. Barbour, who has said that he personally opposes abortion but that it should not be a threshold issue for the party. "Republicans are more pro-life than the country as a whole, but not monolithic."
 
Not-So-Surprising Findings
 Mr. Barbour said the not-so-surprising findings that Republicans support small government and individual responsibility were "far more important than any one question or any one issue."
Indeed, the 159-question survey ranged from abortion to the economy to foreign affairs, and was mailed to the households of Republican elected officials, party officials, donors and party workers.
But the unscientific survey was surprising to other party officials. They said they had believed that most hard-core partisans were against abortion, despite polls showing that a large segment of Republican voters do not oppose abortion.
"It was not a stereotypical result," Mr. van Lohuizen said of the Republican findings on abortion.
The results could give ammunition to Republicans who advocate abortion rights and who want to delete the anti-abortion plank from the Republican platform in 1996. But it could also invigorate proponents of the plank.
 
At Odds With Platform
 "The parties have to provide some leadership," said Patrick M. McSweeney, the chairman of the Virginia Republican Party, who is opposed to abortion. "I don't think the survey is something I would have done. The survey will probably only energize the pro-life community."
Still, a large segment of the responses were at odds with the Republican platform, which advocates a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion in virtually all circumstances, including cases of rape or incest.
The article said 58 percent "gave what would be considered a pro-life response to the question about circumstances under which abortion would be allowed." That figure was based on the 7 percent who said abortion should be illegal under all circumstances, the 14 percent who said abortion should be allowed only when the mother's life is endangered, and the 37 percent who said it should be allowed only in rape or incest cases or when the mother's life is endangered.
Another 38 percent said abortion should be allowed at various stages of pregnancy, for any reason.
 
A 'Pat Robertson Repellent'
 Roger Craver, a Democratic direct mail consultant for several abortion rights groups, said the results would make good fodder for Republicans who advocate abortion rights. "They can use it as a sort of Pat Robertson repellent," he said, "to keep the right-wing stuff out of the party."
Despite the differences, abortion was ranked at the bottom when respondents were asked to list 12 issues in order of importance. The top issues were taxes, crime, quality of education, economic growth and welfare reform.
On health care, party loyalists were overwhelmingly opposed to replacing the current system with one in which the Federal Government would be the sole payer of costs. But they were divided over other proposed changes in health care. Sixty-three percent said they would oppose requiring the Federal Government or state governments to provide health insurance for people who cannot buy their own.
 
Opposition to Immigration
 The respondents took a hard line on other issues. Nearly 80 percent said too many people were immigrating to the United States and placing too great a strain on government; 16 percent said immigrants help the economy.
Mr. van Lohuizen said that in devising the survey, he was careful to make it ideologically neutral. He said the effort was more like a census than a poll, since so many people responded.
"It's not a scientific survey," he said, but added, "We did everything we could to keep the wording as clean and as objective as possible."

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE MOVES ONCE AGAIN TO RAISE KEY RATE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Federal eserve officials voted today to nudge short-term interest rates higher for the second time in less than seven weeks.
The move set off a steep fall in long-term interest rates as the central bank appeared to succeed in convincing investors that it is committed to heading off inflation. 
 Officials of the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of announcing their decision immediately, as they did, for the first time ever, on Feb. 4. Until then, the Federal Reserve had let traders and investors guess its intentions from the direction of short-term interest rates, which the Federal Reserve influences by buying and selling government securities. A Federal Reserve spokesman said the new policy of making announcements would continue for the time being.
 
Small Move Foreseen
 The Federal Reserve, in its announcement at 2:20 P.M. today, did not say how much it intended to increase rates. But the interest rate for large overnight loans between banks rose a quarter of a percentage point this afternoon, to 3.5 percent, as traders anticipated that the Federal Reserve would intervene on Wednesday to insure that this was the new rate.
While it may seem odd for higher short-term rates to produce lower long-term rates, economic theory predicts exactly this result. Long-term rates, which the Federal Reserve does not control, are determined largely by investors' expectations of inflation. If investors expect high inflation to erode the value of money that they lend for many years, they then demand higher long-term interest rates.
 
Some Immediate Response

 Higher short-term rates tend to brake economic growth, and indirectly slow inflation. As companies and individuals find it more expensive to borrow money, they cut spending, which means that they do not bid up the price of scarce labor and materials as quickly, holding down inflation.
How quickly today's move will affect the rates that consumers pay for mortgages and car loans will depend on how financial markets react in the coming days. The initial reaction brought the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.84 percent, from 6.95 percent on Monday -- the biggest one-day drop in two and a half months. [Page D14.]
Economists said that if long-term rates stay down or fall farther, mortgage rates, which have risen sharply in recent weeks, might fall soon.
Clinton Administration officials expressed no objections to today's rate action. "The Administration has a favorable and optimistic view on the economy right now and nothing that happens today altered that view," said Gene Sperling, a senior official of the National Economic Council.
The White House has shown little concern about increases in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve in part because of an acute awareness that such increases now might actually help the President's re-election prospects in 1996, Administration officials say privately.
By slowing the pace of the economic recovery and holding down long-term interest rates that influence the level of investment, increases in short-term rates may improve the odds that the economy will still be strong in 1996.
 
Adheres to a Forecast
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, declined to discuss what the Federal Reserve move today might mean for the Administration politically. But she did say the action was consistent with her agency's forecast of steady annual economic growth of 2.6 or 2.7 percent through 1998.
"Our goal is to stay with moderate growth and low inflation over the medium term," she said in an interview tonight.
President Clinton has said repeatedly in recent weeks that interest rates should not continue to rise, but has not specified whether his comments were about long or short rates.
The White House's reticence on monetary policy appeared to fade last week, when the President called Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to a meeting that both sides described as routine. Administration officials said this week that interest rates were discussed briefly, but that the Administration did not try to tell Mr. Greenspan what to do.
Such reticence is less in evidence in the House of Representatives, where many members face tough re-election campaigns in November, a time when increases in short-term rates now may be affecting the economy. At a recent hearing, some members of the House Banking Committee complained to Mr. Greenspan about the rate increase on Feb. 4.
 
A Politician's Protest

 
 Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a freshman Democrat from upstate New York, who faces a tough re-election race, expressed dismay tonight at the Federal Reserve action. "This is going to hurt the economy; it's going to be bad for jobs; it's a bad idea," he said.
Rising interest rates, and the expectation of further rises, have been poison for stock markets around the world in recent weeks. Higher yields for notes and bonds make stocks a less appealing alternative investment.
The stock market was little changed today, with most broad measures of the market rising slightly while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.30 points to close at 3,862.55. By contrast, the Dow plunged 96.24 points after the Feb. 4 move by the Federal Reserve, closing then at 3,871.42.
The Federal Reserve's moves today and last month were not so much a response to actual signs of inflation as they were attempts to convince the markets that the Fed would stifle any rise in prices that could accompany an economic recovery.
Neal Soss, an economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York, said that long-term interest rates fell today in part because investors were relieved to see an end to weeks of speculating about when the next rate increase would come. Investors were also happy that the Fed seemed to be setting a precedent for announcing such decisions, he said. "That kind of certainty is very valuable to financial markets," he said.
Federal Reserve officials and economists had expected the Feb. 4 increase in short-term rates to hold down long-term rates. But mortgage and bond interest rates have climbed steadily in recent weeks.
Some economists link these increases to the Federal Reserve's last move, while others cite unrelated issues like the currency-trading losses of big international funds that also invest in bonds.
The Federal Reserve's announcement today repeated the language it used on Feb. 4: "Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions."
The overnight bank lending rate had stood at 3 percent for 17 months before the move on Feb. 4.
Federal Reserve officials said then that the central bank was not trying to set a precedent by announcing its action, a point Mr. Greenspan repeated during recent Congressional testimony. But today's announcement did not include such a disclaimer. The Federal Reserve has been under pressure from Congressional Democrats to become more open.
Joseph Coyne, the Federal Reserve's spokesman, said the central bank had made a preliminary decision to disclose changes in overnight rates for the time being. A decision on whether to make that a permanent procedure will not be made until May at the earliest, he said.
Banks with excess deposits at the Federal Reserve trade them every day to banks that need extra money, charging them an overnight rate. The Federal Reserve controls this rate. It sells Government securities to banks when it wants to drain them of excess deposits and push short-term rates up, and buys securities when it wants to reduce short-term rates.
The Federal Reserve was clearly struggling this morning to hold down the overnight interest rate, Wall Street economists said. Early today that rate rose to 3.5 percent in anticipation of this afternoon's decision, but Federal Reserve officials then intervened, adding money to the banking system and driving the rate back down to nearly 3.25 percent.

HEADLINE: Former Gulf and Western Building To Be a Luxury Apartment Tower

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The former Gulf and Western Building -- which has stood for 24 years like an oversized, silver-and-black gatepost at the southwest corner of Central Park -- would be emptied of office tenants, stripped to its steel skeleton and turned into an extravagant apartment tower under plans announced yesterday.
From 200 to 300 apartments would be created in the upper part of the 44-story skyscraper, with the lower floors serving perhaps as a hotel or as offices, said Donald J. Trump, a member of the redevelopment team. The plaza, notable for the yawning circular pit that leads to the Columbus Circle subway station, would also be rebuilt. 
 The project is expected to be completed in 1997 and to cost from $200 million to $250 million.
 
Move by April '95
 Paramount Communications, the corporate successor to Gulf and Western, now has its headquarters in the building but is expected to move out by April 1995 and join its new corporate parent, Viacom, whose headquarters are at 1515 Broadway, between 44th and 45th Streets.
Because the former Gulf and Western Building is far larger than anything that could be built on the site under current zoning rules, it makes more economic sense to strip and reconstruct it than it would to raze the tower and start over.
As unusual as it is to turn an office tower into an apartment house, the redevelopment team decided there were more prospective purchasers for high-priced condominiums overlooking Central Park and Lincoln Center than there were potential commercial tenants for an obsolete building with relatively small floors.
 
$1,000 a Square Foot
 "This site is a premier residential site -- one of the best in the world," said Mr. Trump, who would be part of the team, together with the Galbreath Company, a third-generation development concern, and the General Electric Investments Corporation, advisers to the G.E. Pension Trust, which owns the building.
Mr. Trump said apartments might sell for an average of $1,000 a square foot. That could yield a million-dollar price tag for a large one-bedroom.
Involving Mr. Trump was part of the strategy to market the apartments, said Peter Ricker, president and chief executive of the Galbreath Company. "He has been successful with high-rise condos like no one else has," Mr. Ricker. "He has a good sense of what the market wants."
But the building, which was once crowned by huge, ruby-red "G+W" logos, will not carry the Trump name. Instead, it will be rechristened 1 Central Park West.
 
'A Brand New Building'
 Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Ricker said the reconstruction could proceed without a new land use review or zoning approval.
Three of America's best known architects -- Philip Johnson, Frank Gehry and Robert A. M. Stern -- are in the running to design the project, Mr. Trump said.
"We're going to leave just the steel," he said. "It's going to be a brand new building."
The building will be so new, in fact, that its floors will probably not even be numbered as they are now.
Office buildings typically have higher ceilings than postwar apartment buildings. The old Gulf and Western Building, Mr. Trump said, is 585 feet tall, making its uppermost floor equivalent in altitude to the 60th floor of a standard apartment building.
"Depending on how you view it," he said, "you could look at it as 60 stories."
Never known for understating his case, Mr. Trump said, "We think the residential market -- especially in my buildings -- is really going to be very strong." He said the recently built Trump Palace, at Third Avenue and 69th Street, "will be sold out in the next four weeks."
The decision to reconstruct the building would seem to cement the reputation of the Lincoln Center area as a hot spot for development. An enormous new mixed-use building called Lincoln Square is nearing completion on Broadway, between 67th and 68th Streets. The developers of that project, Millennium Partners, are also planning new buildings on two nearby blocks.
Immediately north of the former Gulf and Western Building, a new structure is being designed for the site of the Mayflower Hotel, on Central Park West and an adjacent vacant lot on Broadway.
Eventually, the site of the New York Coliseum on Columbus Circle is to be redeveloped, although how and by whom is the subject of negotiations among city officials, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman.
"We watched as the West Side started to rise in prominence," said Mr. Ricker, of the Galbreath Company. "It showed us that this was a good idea."
For years, the Gulf and Western Building has been bedeviled by a reputation for swaying noticeably in the wind. Mr. Trump said the steel frame would be reinforced during the reconstruction so that the frame was "totally rigid."
One of the building's liabilities as an office tower is the relatively small size of each floor, about 10,000 square feet. But Mr. Trump said that was a "beautiful" size to accommodate apartments.
Mr. Trump said the project would force the closing of the subterranean Loews Columbus Circle movie theater, which is underneath the office tower. "I wouldn't want to be in that theater during construction," he said.

HEADLINE: CABINET EXPRESSES FEARS ABOUT PLAN TO ALTER WELFARE

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
After working for nearly a year, President Clinton's aides presented him today with an ambitious plan to overhaul the welfare system, but the Cabinet has expressed reservations about the way the plan would be financed, arguing that the strategy could hurt the needy.
The mid-level officials drafting the plan have been trying to pay for a $15 billion package of training and work programs by cutting other programs for the disadvantaged. 
 But Cabinet members hesitated at that strategy during a two-hour meeting on Monday, people familiar with the session said. The Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, then agreed to consider possible tax increases to avoid some, though not all, contemplated cuts in food programs and aid to indigent immigrants.
 
Meeting With Clinton
 Cabinet members also discussed strategies for saving money by scaling back the draft welfare proposal. They said they might provide a smaller expansion of child care to poor working families and conduct smaller welfare experiments than originally proposed.
No decisions were made at Monday's meeting, and the Cabinet reconvened today with President Clinton present. While the plan has been on the drafting table for almost a year, this appears to be the first major meeting to confront Mr. Clinton with the painful financing decisions.
An official familiar with today's Cabinet meeting said that it was an informational session that was cut short and that Mr. Clinton had not decided how to pay for the plan.
 
No Savings at First
 The search for money is central to Mr. Clinton's pledge "to end welfare as we know it," a popular message during the 1992 campaign and a possible key to his political future.
Mr. Clinton has promised to give Congress a bill this spring to expand training opportunities for welfare recipients, then require those still unemployed after two years to join a work program.
While putting welfare recipients to work sounds like a savings measure, it is much more expensive, at least in the short run, than simply mailing a check. The cost rises because the Government would subsidize the recipients' wages, as well as providing them with education, training and child care.
The hunt for financing has been a source of anguish for the 32 members of the task force drafting the bill, including one co-chairman, David T. Ellwood, and his deputy, Wendell E. Primus. They are prominent advocates for the needy, who have spent the last decade fighting cuts similar to the ones they are now proposing.
They find themselves in this position because budget laws require any new spending to be offset with cuts or taxes, and until recently they have said that they expected Mr. Clinton and the Cabinet would reject any tax increases. "The financing has been really problematic," said an official involved in the process. "There are no good choices."
 
Surprise at Meeting
 The Cabinet meeting was a surprise, and perhaps a source of secret satisfaction, for task force members who object to the cuts.
The secretaries of some domestic agencies were joined by the President's senior political advisers, including George Stephanopoulos and David R. Gergen. The group seemed to agree, according to people familiar with the meeting, that a strategy of cuts alone appeared unfair and would not find support among Congressional Democrats.
According to people familiar with meeting, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros were among those concerned about the cuts.
Some proposed cuts remain very much on the table, including a plan to cap the emergency assistance provisions of the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The program gives emergency payments to needy families, including those in danger of becoming homeless. Task force members argue that states are abusing the program by billing the Federal Government for services they once provided.
But the Cabinet showed little enthusiasm for a plan to save $800 million a year by changing eligibility rules and removing 250,000 children from the welfare rolls. And it was particularly concerned about a proposal to deny cash payments to needy immigrants who are not citizens.
Some policy experts have argued that immigrants are abusing the welfare program, called Supplemental Security Income, by encouraging relatives to immigrate and seek Government aid. But a plan to cut the benefits seems likely to cause a revolt among House Democrats, particularly members of the Hispanic caucus.
A likelier Administration proposal would be to force the immigrants to wait five years before receiving aid.
 
Republicans May Bolt
 The move toward raising taxes also has risks. Republicans have threatened to bolt from any proposal that raises taxes, even minor ones.
The House Republicans have put forward a welfare bill that would spend $20 billion over five years, but pay for it entirely with cuts, especially in programs for immigrants.
Tax measures that have received some consideration include several that involve gambling. One possible proposal would place a new excise tax on some gambling establishments, although state lotteries and Indian reservations would probably be exempt.
A second proposal seeks to improve tax enforcement, by increasing the withholding rate on certain gambling winnings. Mr. Bentsen is now seeking to flesh out the list of tax options.
 
Considering Some Trims
 The Cabinet considered three ways of scaling back the $15 billion the draft proposals would cost over five years.
One option is to reduce, or sever, a plan to spend $5 billion on child care for the working poor in an effort to keep such families from coming onto welfare rolls. The Cabinet talked about putting the provision forward later in a separate bill.
The group also talked about reducing several welfare experiments, including a test program to increase training for absent fathers, so they could afford greater child support payments.
The group may also scale back an experiment that would spend $550 million over five years, by having the Government make child support payments if absent fathers failed to do so.
Mr. Ellwood has argued passionately for the proposal, saying it has great potential for alleviating poverty among children. One parent, he has said, should not be forced to do the financial work of two.
But the plan's critics, including some inside the Administration, have argued that the cash payments are simply welfare by another name. They have said the Government help could make absent fathers less willing to make payments themselves.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Interest Rates Tumble After Fed Acts Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates plunged sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve broke precedent for the second time in two months and announced its intention to raise short-term interest rates.
In a short statement released in the afternoon, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the Federal Open Market Committee -- the central bank's policy-setting arm -- had "decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions." He added, "This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term interest rates." 
 Within minutes of the statement, bond prices rose a half-point on the long end, with rates on shorter-maturity bills dropping sharply. The 30-year bond's yield -- which moves in the opposite direction of its price -- fell as low as 6.83 percent and by late in the day the price was up 110/32 , to 92 18/32 , for a yield of 6.84 percent. The drop of 11 basis points was the largest one-day yield decline in two and a half months. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Rally in Short-Term Bills
 Short-term bills also rallied strongly, with the rate on three- and six-month bills down 11 basis points as well, to 3.50 percent and 3.79 percent, respectively.
The closely followed 10-year note also rallied, dropping its yield to 6.42 percent, from 6.55 percent on Monday.
Traders and dealers said they preferred this type of announcement by the Fed to the central bank's previous policy of not saying anything. Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities, was delighted by the idea of the Fed announcing the slight tightening, and hoped the central bank would continue to use that approach. "It removes all uncertainty about what its intentions are, leaving nothing for speculation," he said. "And you can see by the market's reaction that it is showing its approval."
Assuming that the move would push the Federal funds rate to 3.50 percent, Mr. Fine said: "It will stay at 3.50 percent for a month or two, then you can expect it to hit 3.75 percent and the 4 percent. And we are going to 4 percent by July or August.
"The main reason the Fed wants positive real short-term interest rates is to forestall any speculative inventory build up resulting from higher inflationary expectations." In other words, the Fed is trying to prevent any near-term overheating of the economy because of increasing demand for goods and services to avoid future price increases.
As Fed governors convened yesterday for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, most economists, 22 out of 30 polled by Reuters, were betting on a tightening of 25 basis points. But some said they would not rule out a 50-basis-point rise given the strength in short-term rates.
But unlike the Feb. 4 rise in short-term interest rates, when prices fell across the yield curve, yesterday's announcement of another credit tightening caused bond prices to rally higher instead.
Gerald A. Guild, senior manager of fixed income at Advest Inc., said the Feb. 4 decline in the bond market was the result of an overreaction by investors not satisfied by the rate rise. The market had expected something more aggressive from the Fed, he said, to show that it was serious about fighting inflation. The selloff has continued for the most part despite soft inflation news, causing many bond traders to suspect that the bond market has been oversold for some time now.
"The market could hold today's gains if people come to conclude that inflation will remain under control," Mr. Guild said.
Analysts at MMS International said the short end of the market rallied strongly since the threat of a half-point rise in rates had already been priced in ahead of time.
Traders said there was some nervousness in the short end ahead of yesterday's $17 billion two-year-note auction. The announcement helped the auction, which produced a high yield of 5.15 percent. But by late in the day the yield on a two-year note in the when-issued market was down to 5 percent.
Today the Treasury will be selling $11 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday, they were being offered at a price to yield 5.91 percent.
With the market poised for news coming out of the Fed meeting, morning data from the Commerce Department showing the United States merchandise trade gap had widened significantly in January to $9.85 billion had little impact on trading. Economists had forecast a $9 billion deficit in January.
The following are the results of the Treasury's two-year note auction:

HEADLINE: Christopher Says U.S. Stays Firm on Korea, but Pledges Diplomacy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today that the United States would defend South Korea against any aggression, but that Washington would pursue diplomatic moves before seeking sanctions against North Korea over its refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear plants.
Mr. Christopher and other officials spent much of the day seeking support in the United Nations for a resolution that will criticize North Korea and point indirectly to economic sanctions. 
 The Administration strained to win China's support because Beijing can veto any Security Council resolution. Chinese officials said they wanted all efforts at negotiation exhausted before economic sanctions were used.
Prime Minister Li Peng warned today in Beijing that increased pressure could aggravate the situation. "If pressure is applied on this issue, that can only complicate the situation on the Korean peninsula, and it will add to the tension there," he said.
It was a day in which all sides talked tough, and South Korea put its forces on defensive alert. But the United States sought to assure the Chinese and North Koreans that it would first seek a diplomatic resolution.
"We've made it clear to North Korea that it must become a responsible member of the international community, or that community will have no choice but to pursue other options," Mr. Christopher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The Secretary added: "Our commitment to South Korea's security remains firm. We're prepared to take all necessary steps to insure that the North does not misread our determination to deter agreession."
 
Military Is Ready
 Appearing on the NBC News program "Today," Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs, said, "I would hope and expect that China would join an overwhelming international consensus" in pushing North Korea to allow full nuclear inspections.
Pentagon officals reported today that there was military activity in North Korea, but that it might be routine military exercises. Dennis Boxx, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Administration was watching the situation "very carefully."
North Korea reacted strongly to developments over the last few days, particularly the Administration's decision to send Patriot antimissile batteries to South Korea. In broadcasts monitored abroad, North Korea radio called the move "a provocative step to lead the situation to extremes by further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula."
"The order by Clinton to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea is a grave threat to us," the broadcast added.
The Pentagon spokesman said that even if North Korea allowed complete nuclear inspections, Washington would send the Patriots. "We have no intention to turn them around," Mr. Boxx said. "The plan right now is these missiles will be put in place."
Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said the United States would protect the 37,000 American soldiers stationed in South Korea and remained committed to fulfilling its treaty obligations there.
South Korea's President, Kim Young San, is to begin a long-planned trip on Thursday to Japan and China, where he will discuss the crisis.
After having been criticized for taking too soft an approach to North Korea, the Clinton Administration won some backing in Congress today.
Gary L. Ackerman, a New York Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said: "I'm fully aboard. The Administration is using a steady, even-handed approach to a very difficult situation."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Anger From the North
 TOKYO, Monday, March 23 (Special to The New York Times) -- In its latest oratorical barrage, North Korea called Kim Young Sam, the South's President, a traitor for asking the United States to provide Patriot missiles, and declared that "traitors to the nation must be removed and liquidated within the nation as early as possible."
"Our people and the people's army will severely punish the traitors attempting to stifle fellow countrymen in conspiracy with outside forces," the Korean Central News Agency said today, "and will resolutely defend our socialist motherland and the security of the nation."

HEADLINE: Mysterious Black Hole in Chicago Is Gobbling Up Everybody's Mail

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 22

 BODY:
This city has had a lot of practice coping with hardships, man-made and otherwise, from crooked politicians to wicked winter winds. But there are some things that can push even Chicagoans too far, and the United States Postal Service has done it with mail: mail delivered weeks late, decades late; mail that is burnt to a crisp in a vacant lot and never delivered at all.
In Postal Service surveys, more than one-third of Chicago households have reported problems with their mail, an inexcusably high number, says Marvin Runyon, the Postmaster General. Along Mr. Runyon's national postal route, the city ranks dead last in customer satisfaction. A local alderman even says he will hold hearings next month to assess the mail system's effect on Chicago's economy. 
 The problems here have become so bad and tempers so sharp and short that Mr. Runyon came to Chicago on Monday for a day and a long night of meetings with elected officials, Postal Service employees and residents. He ended with a crowded town meeting that turned into two hours of jeers and complaints and a call to bring back the Pony Express.
Mr. Runyon left promising that a better day was coming. But when, he could not say. He noted only that a team of postal investigators from across the country would begin sorting out the mess sometime this week.
 
City of Horror Stories
 Both Senators from Illinois accompanied Mr. Runyon for part of his trip through what some call the Post Office From Hell. "There are a lot of good, hard-working postal employees here," said the state's junior Senator, Carol Moseley-Braun, a Democrat. "But these horror stories indicate there are not enough."
It was a surreal adventure, including a prominent local atheist who said he was happy with his postal service and an unhappy biker who apparently thought he was God.
"When I passed out brains," the biker told Mr. Runyon, "you thought I said trains and you missed yours."
Then a man asked the Postmaster for a job, saying he was tired of living on Social Security and food stamps. But then he had not received his food stamps from last month, the man said. They were lost in the mail.
Why the system is so troubled in Chicago is unclear. But postal employees and their supporters said many of the buildings are old; the equipment is outdated and the neighborhood post offices are understaffed.
 
Too Many Temporary Workers
 They contend that there are too many temporary employees, who do not stay long enough to learn the job or the names of the people on their routes. When employees speak out about what is wrong on the job, they are often punished, said a woman who has worked for the Post Office here for 17 years.
By every measure, many said, employee morale here and around the country is low. "And they're taking their anger out on us," a teacher at the town meeting told Mr. Runyon.
Post office officials say they know that their image needs quick repair, since unhappy customers today might be gone-elsewhere customers tomorrow. The post office, like utilities and phone companies, is worried about faster moving, less regulated private companies skimming off the more profitable pieces of its business.
Mr. Runyon came to Chicago to save face and the bottom line.
About 500 people turned out for the forum. As Mr. Runyon began to speak, he was quickly awash in catcalls.
"You can count on us to keep you in touch," he said. The hissing from the audience sounded like a nasty wind off Lake Michigan.
One woman drove 100 miles from a small town in Indiana to complain about her mail service. Bertha Gimbel, the clerk for a Chicago suburb, did not have to travel so far but was just as unhappy. She said water bills sent on Feb. 4 did not arrive until March 17, more than two weeks after they were due. One Chicagoan, John Burns, topped that one: He said he had not received any mail since last July.
Earlier in the day, as Mr. Runyon toured a neighborhood post office on the city's North Side, the lobby filled with the displeased, including John Steele and Bo Clausen. Mr. Steele said he had missed his nephew's wedding because the invitation, mailed two months before the ceremony, arrived a week after it was over. The letter had to travel less than 20 miles. "Her family was wondering, 'Where's your uncle?' " Mr. Steele said.
 
Follow That Cab!
 Mr. Clausen said that for two Saturdays in a row no mail came to his home. Then last Saturday he looked out his window and saw the letter carrier walking onto the block, carrying a bag loaded with letters. The next thing he saw was the carrier climbing into a cab and driving off into the sunset without delivering the mail.
They did not get a chance to speak with Mr. Runyon, but Eugene Telser did. Mr. Telser said he wanted to tell him about his letter carrier.
"This system is so lousy, but we have a very good letter carrier who is fighting it," Mr. Telser said. "I asked Mr. Runyon what could be done to reward him."
Mr. Runyon told Mr. Telser to write him a letter about the carrier, and to drop it in the mail.

HEADLINE: Prices Plummet, Life Turns Normal And Sarajevans Rush to Sell Goods

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, March 22

 BODY:
Panic selling of everything from canned fish to coffee is sweeping Sarajevo's street markets in expectation that scarcities will be eased with Wednesday's scheduled opening of the first overland routes into the city in almost two years.
When prices peaked in late January, 22 months after Sarajevo was placed under siege by Serbian nationalist forces, gasoline was selling for about $60 a gallon, and was rarely available at any price. Ground meat was $27 a pound; coffee, $40. 
 Prices began easing after a cease-fire went into effect around Sarajevo last month. But the price bubble burst over the weekend, pricked by Friday's signing of a federation agreement between Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government and Croats that opened central Bosnia's road access to the outside world through Croatia, and by the agreement last week between the Government and the Serbs to open Sarajevo's first secure overland access to central Bosnia.
In another signal that Bosnia is inching back to normal, United Nations officials formally opened an airport in the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla today after almost 18 months of pleas by local officials.
 
Everything in the Car
 If Wednesday's road-openings go forward as United Nations officials here plan, Sarajevans will be able to drive to and from Butmir, a southwestern suburb which has an open road to Croatia. Commercial traffic is prohibited, but there is little doubt that motorists will be carrying into the city everything they can jam into their trunks.
Anticipating the surge in supplies, gasoline has dropped to $30 a gallon, coffee to $18 a pound and ground meat to $15 a pound.
"Meat prices are falling because there is already more meat coming in and more will come when the road opens," said Mensur Mrso, a 34-year-old butcher at the Sarajevo's central market. "Prices are falling because of Clinton, because he forced them to sign the federation agreement in Washington."
Hamo Zdralovic, an economics graduate and former Bosnian Government worker, sold packs of York cigarettes for about $2.50 Monday morning and $2 that afternoon. "Prices fall by about half every day as more goods arrive," he said.
 
Market Stalls Full
 "There was a serious scarcity of goods, and the prices were ghastly," he said. "It was a raw struggle for survival. Now, I don't care how much money I lose so long as prices fall and people can live. But I'm lucky I didn't invest much in these cigarettes."
Sarajevo's price collapse has brought small-time "commodity dealers" scrambling to the markets trying to get what they can for the goods they have. Market stalls, empty just a few weeks ago, are now stacked with onions, lettuce, fertilizer for home gardens, new athletic shoes, candy bars and other easy-to-carry items.
 
Still Military Tensions
 Even the price of candles has dropped by about a third, to about $3 for a thick, six-inch candle, because the city now has a constant supply of electricity.
Military tensions have not vanished, however. A United Nations military spokesman here said a standoff continued in the hills northwest of the city, where over the weekend Canadian peacekeepers discovered Serbian weapons inside the "exclusion zone" imposed around Sarajevo by NATO last month.
But the spokesman, Maj. Simon MacDowall, said that the Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, had pledged cooperation and that the only dispute was whether the weapons were in fact inside the zone. Major MacDowall said that a United Nations-Serbian team was pinpointing the locations of the weapons today.
 
Gambles Over Diesel Fuel
 But in the city, a 29-year-old Bosnian soldier who gave his name as Almir was more worried about his gambles on the Sarajevo oil and coffee markets, where pessimism about peace had paid off for two years.
"I bought 200 liters of diesel just before the price started falling," he said, adding that the fuel originated with the Ukrainian peacekeepers attached to the United Nations military force here.
In the last week the price of diesel fuel has fallen from about $55 to $10 a gallon, he said.
"I also bought 15 kilos of coffee at $60 each," he said. "Now I can't get more than $25 a kilo for it."
"I'm not going to commit suicide," he said. "I'm just happy to be getting out of this war alive, and I'm sure I'll find some way to manage."
The opening of the Tuzla airport came this morning when a United Nations military cargo jet touched down here carrying United Nations officials and a load of medicine and other supplies. But Kris Janowski, Sarajevo spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that no start-up date for regular aid flights has been set.
"There are still problems between the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Government, and we have to hold off until they agree," he said.
Refugee-relief officials still say cargo flights into the airport would help their effort to supply some 350,000 aid-dependent people in the Tuzla region, they acknowledge that the recent reopening of overland routes from Croatia and Serbia has virtually erased the airport's potential importance to the campaign.
 
An Appeal From 1992
 "By the time it opens the airport may be superfluous, even for medical evacuations, because there is so little fighting in the Tuzla area," a United Nations official said. "The political momentum is such, however, that we had to go ahead with opening the airport."
Officials of Tuzla's local government have appealed to the United Nations to open the airport since the fall of 1992. But the Serbs, who are within artillery range of the airport, threatened to shell it, arguing that the airport would be used by the Bosnian Government to smuggle arms.
United Nations officials balked, fearing retaliation by the Serbs and insisting that the area was best supplied by ground convoys.
In February, Serbian leaders tentatively agreed to the airport's reopening when Russia pledged to send military observers, but they have not yet arrived.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Croats and Serbs Meet
 ZAGREB, Croatia, March 22 (Special to The New York Times) -- Croatian representatives began meetings here today with breakaway Serbian nationalists who control a third of the country. The meetings, under joint Russian, American and European aegis, were the first between the two sides in two years.
While the goal of the talks is relatively limited -- consolidation of an existing cease-fire -- it represents another step in the rapidly unfolding American and Russian efforts in recent weeks to find a way to end the brutal three-way war in the former Yugoslavia. With the signing of articles of confederation between Croatia and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, the pressure is now on the Serbs, still at odds with both parties.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Turkey May Send Peacekeepers
 UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Reuters) -- Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended today that Turkey, deeply resented by Serbs because of its Ottoman Empire past, be allowed to send troops to join United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Balkans, his spokesman said.
The President of the Security Council, Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, said he expected the proposal to be accepted.
Turkey has offered 1,000 soldiers that it hopes will go to central Bosnia to monitor the agreement between Croats and Muslims. Both parties have accepted Ankara's offer, but Serbs oppose the idea because of the Ottoman Empire's long occupation of the Balkans until early this century.
Under U.N. rules, neighboring countries or those which have historically been involved in a troubled area are normally barred from providing troops.

HEADLINE: Change Threatens a Legendary Street Bazaar

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 22

 BODY:
On Sunday mornings, a magical, seedy circus of possibilities rises from the broken streets west of the Loop, a ragtag market thick with the smell of grilled onions, the crackle of blues from cheap speakers and hagglers hunting for dried peppers or toilet seats.
For 120 years, the Maxwell Street Market has been the mall of the dispossessed, from the Jewish pushcart peddlers selling fruit at the turn of the century to the black vendors of gospel tapes and toggle bolts, the Hispanic tortilla makers and Korean gym-shoe salesmen who all inherited the market from the Jews. 
 It is a place that draws 20,000 customers even in bad weather and has as much as $20 million in sales a year by some estimates, although no one really knows. It is where Mary Torbert, a retired nurse from the suburbs, comes every Sunday for sweet potatoes and Gloria Torres, a data entry clerk, comes for bananas and tomatillos. Charlie Ford, a tax collector from Mechanicsburg, Ill., drove three hours last Sunday to get a $80 vacuum cleaner for $30.
"This is the greatest market of chance in the world," said Judge Hightower, a blind man who barks the menu of Jim's Original World Famous Hotdog Stand from his chair out front. "You can come down here with nothing and go back with who knows what."
 
Change Is Knocking
 But in the last several decades, as suburban malls flourished, as rival retailers across the city started opening on Sundays and Maxwell Street lost its lock on the Day of Rest, as the original Jewish delicatessen and clothing store owners retired to Florida, as homeless people started selling stolen hubcabs and X-rated videos and as even drugs and prostitution could be found amid the power tools, the market has lost its innocence.
Now Maxwell Street is facing extinction. The city, which owns the land, wants to move the market to make way for softball fields and science laboratories for the University of Illinois at Chicago. The new location would be several blocks east, on the other side of the Dan Ryan Expressway. The city also wants to raise vending fees to $25 a day from $25 a year and limit the number of vendors by prohibiting felons from getting licenses.
"It's the first step toward death," said David Whiteis, a writer and regular at Maxwell Street. "It's like watching a beloved relative who is no longer himself. I would rather see it die and rest in peace than see it yuppified and trendified."
Many city officials and the well-to-do people who live near the university consider the market a faded relic and an eyesore.
All along, it has been said that if you couldn't find what you were looking for at Maxwell Street, you didn't need it. The market has always been the place for bargains.
But now, critics say, some prices are low because vagrants get their merchandise from alleys or trash cans and other vendors steal theirs from the neighborhood. Once, even the altar chairs and candlesticks from Holy Family Roman Catholic Church turned up on Maxwell Street.
"They come and steal off our porches," said Rose Tavolino, a nearby resident. "They take our lawn chairs and mops and brooms and sell them for a buck or two."
There have been times when the market's neighbors have had to buy back their own possessions. "If something is stolen in our neighborhood, whether hubcaps or radios or barbecue grills, chances are you can find it on Maxwell Street the next Sunday," said Joe Pucci, a spokesman for Concerned Citizens of the West Loop.
Mr. Pucci blames the market's customers in part. "If people didn't buy what they know in their hearts is stolen merchandise, the vendors wouldn't be stealing it," he said.
 
City Council Action
 Today, the city drew closer to its goal of moving the market as the City Council's zoning committee approved the university's expansion plans for the 10-block Maxwell Street market area. The plan is scheduled to go before the full Council on Wednesday.
Supporters of the market and vendors who have helped put children and grandchildren through school with their earnings are protesting the move. "It's just like going to the grocery store," said Louis Clinton, who sells wrenches and toggle bolts. "If you're used to going to Aisle B to get your coffee and they move it, you're confused. People don't want to go wandering and looking."
 
Circus of Humanity
 On Sundays after Mass at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, the pockmarked streets south of Roosevelt Road are impassable for all the people picking over old refrigerators and used eyeglasses, drill bits and bottles of Downy fabric softener from 800 or so vendors, their wares set out on blankets or door frames, their rusted fruit stand scales rocking in the breeze.
Children breakdance for spare change. In warm weather, blues bands play under what habitues call the blues tree. Sometimes a homeless man named Tucker will dance for quarters after he has had a pint of wine.
"It's like an amusement park without paying to get in," said Nate Duncan, who has owned a kosher delicatessen at the market for the past 22 years.
The market is so packed it is sometimes difficult to walk. Brooms and rakes and ladders stick out above the crowd as people head home with their awkward but happy finds.
"Some days there are crowds on the level of Calcutta there," said Steven Balkin, an associate professor of economics at Roosevelt University. "This is an indigenous market. Without Maxwell Street, we will have a flood of street people begging and hustling and peddling."
Aside from the crowds, advocates argue that the market should stay where it is because this was the historic point of entry for the city's immigrants. "For more than 100 years this has been the Ellis Island of the Midwest," said Merlyn McFarland, a seller of used clothes.
But since many of the former jewelry stores and delicatessens closed and were boarded up or bought out by the university, entire lots have been razed. The city does not pick up trash like it used to, and the streets are littered with broken beer bottles and discarded tires.
"What's historic there? What's left?" asked Alderman Ted Mazola, in whose ward, the First, the market sits. "Where we're expanding, there is vacant land. There's nothing to save. Right now it's chaos; it's anarchy. It's not a place to bring your kids. This is a seedy part of life we don't want to continue or condone."
 
Making the Argument for Fees
 The death knell for the market, advocates say, will be the increase in vendor fees because the vendors are people hustling on the edges of society. "There's no guarantee you'll make $25," Mr. Hightower, the blind man, said.
The city has said the fees would help pay for better sanitation and police protection and would therefore help the vendors make more money. "There is no such thing as a free ride. said Jim Williams, the Mayor's press secretary. "It takes an investment to do business. Maxwell Street is no different."
But Larry Callahan, a retired printer and market regular, says it is. He was among the angry group of supporters who showed up at the zoning hearing today to ask for reconsideration.
"Maxwell Street belongs to the world," Mr. Callahan said. "It deserves a better death. God willing, we'll save it."

Reaching for greater size and economic power in the rapidly changing managed health care market, Travelers Inc. and Met Life said yesterday that they were exploring "possible alliances among their health care operations."
By joining forces, the two New York-based companies would get closer to the big leagues of managed care, although they would still be well behind the largest national health insurers, Kaiser Permanente, Prudential, Cigna and Aetna. 
 In a brief written statement following a number of reports that the two companies were discussing merging their health care businesses, Met Life, a unit of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Travelers said the talks were "exploratory." They added that "it would be premature to speculate on the outcome, if any."
 
980,000 H.M.O. Members
 If the two combine, the new company would have about 980,000 members in health maintenance organizations and 4 million more in other types of managed care groups, including discount networks for physicians and hospitals.
As the cost of traditional health insurance has soared, millions of people have switched to the cheaper managed care plans, and companies have been scrambling to attract new members. The combined company would have branches around the country, and that geographical reach would make it more attractive to large national employers.
 
Analysts See Benefits
 Analysts said an alliance would benefit both sides, but Michael W. Blumstein at Morgan Stanley in New York said an agreement was "not imminent," although it would fit into Travelers' "strategy of looking at alliances and joint ventures to bolster their competitive position."
Stephen D. Brink, a health care actuary in Milwaukee with Milliman & Robertson, a national health care consulting firm, said that forging a combination was attractive because the alternative, creating a national network of health service providers from scratch, would be "extremely difficult and very expensive."
"Size matters," Kevin Morley, who heads research on corporate debt at CS First Boston in New York, said.
At the end of December, Travelers said it had 678,000 members in H.M.O.'s and 1.2 million in "preferred provider" discount networks. Met Life said it had 300,000 H.M.O. members, 1.7 million preferred provider members, and 1.1 million in other managed care plans that allow members to choose doctors not in the network.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Try a Conciliatory Tack With China

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
In an effort to deal with the looming crisis over its China policy, the White House has begun a campaign to mend rifts within the Administration and to find ways to persuade China to improve its human rights performance through conciliation rather than confrontation, senior Administration officials said today.
In a closed meeting of senior national security and economic advisers at the White House today, the Administration took stock of its strategy in light of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's trip to Beijing, and decided unanimously to continue the current policy that links progress on human rights to renewal of China's low-tariff trade status when it comes up for renewal in June, the officials said. 
 Mr. Christopher tried to reassert control over the policy, presenting an overview of what progress the Chinese had already made and what they still had to do, and insisting that his colleagues in other agencies present a united front in backing the overall policy, senior officials said.
 
'Open Revolt' on Policy
 "This is partly about who is going to be in charge of the China policy," said one senior State Department official. "The Secretary is trying to keep the Commerce and Treasury Departments from trying to make a run over taking over the policy. He wants to make sure State Department keeps a very strong control over the China relationship, that it's not tenable to have the economic agencies in open revolt against the policy."
"Right now, we're in a box. And the question is, what's the Houdini strategy?"
In effect, what the Administration is trying to do is reinterpret the Secretary of State's visit to Beijing not as a confrontational exercise, but a visit in which some progress was made by China toward fulfilling the human rights conditions set down by President Clinton's executive order of June 1993 for renewal of its beneficial trade status.
As a first step toward that strategy, the National Security Council sent a private, three-page memo of "talking points" to all Cabinet secretaries on Monday instructing them on how to publicly present Mr. Christopher's recent visit to Beijing as a success.
Although the Chinese reaction to Mr. Christopher's message "was and continues to be generally negative," there were "positive steps as well," according to a copy of the memo. It added, "contrary to the impression of some reporting, the Chinese took some constructive steps on this front during Secretary Christopher's visit."
 
U.S. Conditions 'Reasonable'
 If officials are asked whether there is dissension within the United States Government over the policy linking trade and human rights, the response should be that the policy has not changed, and that the American conditions for renewing China's preferential trade status are "reasonable, consistent and clear."
Press reporting about that trip, some of which was fueled by confrontational statements made by both Mr. Christopher and his aides, left the impression that China was totally resisting all American attempts to persuade it to improve its human rights performance. And the absence of a ringing endorsement by President Clinton of the policy in general and Mr. Christopher in particular emboldened those in the Administration opposed to the linkage of trade and human rights to strongly -- and anonymously -- criticize it.
Some Administration officials now concede that overheated declarations were made during Mr. Christopher's visit and that the tough talk on both sides resulted in an overwhelmingly negative message that obscured the actual progress made by the Chinese. These officials also admit that perhaps senior Administration officials should not have laid out specific goals they expected the Chinese to meet, because such a move created certain expectations that were not met.

HEADLINE: Dead-End Deal: Why a Merger Collapsed -- A special report.;
A Cultural Clash Defeated Bell Atlantic and T.C.I.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
They went their separate ways on a sleeting, wintry afternoon last month, walking out of the 44th-floor conference room of a midtown Manhattan office tower, after a final two-hour meeting that went nowhere.
It was the end of a sobering journey that began last summer in exhilaration and finished in frustration for Raymond W. Smith and John C. Malone, who tried to forge one of the biggest corporate mergers in history. 
 But the proposed $33 billion combination of the Bell Atlantic Corporation and Tele-Communications Inc., which had once seemed so right, proved a bad match.
"This deal isn't going to make it, so let's shoot it," Mr. Malone recalls telling Mr. Smith.
How could two of the savviest, most powerful men in the communications industry have so misjudged each other's company as a suitable match?
In the weeks since the deal collapsed, both executives, in separate, lengthy interviews, took pains to avoid direct recriminations. Chalk it up to a dream born in the heady days of last summer -- when hype over "convergence," "interactive multimedia" and "paradigm shifts" had an entire industry spinning fevered visions of the future. But over the winter, the dream faded as Mr. Malone, the president and chief executive of T.C.I., and Mr. Smith, the chairman of Bell Atlantic, realized that their business philosophies clashed.
Mr. Malone, who grew up in a rough-and-tumble industry that views growth as a company's principal mission, disdains traditional corporate goals like reporting earnings and paying dividends as distractions that siphon off money that might otherwise be plowed back into building or acquiring new properties. This ethos was at odds with the by-the-ledger-book traditions revered by Bell Atlantic.
"Ray," Mr. Malone said of Mr. Smith, "was always dealing with a financial mind-set within his company that focused on near-term reported earnings instead of creating wealth in the long term -- the old phone company mentality."
But what Mr. Malone saw as prudishness, Mr. Smith viewed as financial prudence. The Bell Atlantic chairman was unwilling to stake too much of his shareholders' money on the uncertain high-tech dreams of Mr. Malone. As the two companies got to know each other, Bell Atlantic also recognized some unsettling differences between their cultures.
"There were difficulties with the T.C.I. system, its reputation for service in some places compared with the way we do things, and the level of animosity in some communities," Mr. Smith said. "Those were seen by our people with a certain horror."
But even though the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. deal is dead, the forces that fueled it and the issues it raised remain. Private industry, everyone agrees, will have to build what the Clinton Administration has called the information highway -- a marriage of television, communications and computer technology that experts say will someday bring everything from movies to libraries to home screens at the tap of a button.
 
Problems for Others
 And the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. merger was an ambitious attempt by private enterprise to hasten its arrival. But the story of the deal's collapse, based on interviews with Mr. Smith, Mr. Malone, executives and advisers, shows the kinds of challenges that any business partners will need to overcome if they are to blend hybrid technologies -- and disparate industries -- into a home-entertainment and information revolution.
On Feb. 23, when the deal finally fell apart, the reason given for scuttling the merger was a complex price dispute: how many of its own new shares of stock Bell Atlantic would pay for T.C.I.
The price when a company is being sold, of course, is merely the arithmetic that reflects assumptions about that company's assets, strategy and expectations for the future. Absent common assumptions, there was no deal.
"At the end, there were two strong-willed people with very different views of the value of T.C.I.," said Mr. Smith of Bell Atlantic.
On that issue, at least, the other strong-willed person agreed. "There was a basic difference in philosophy," Mr. Malone of T.C.I. said. "When we had to kill the deal, what the people in our shop felt was mostly relief."
 
Getting Acquainted
2 'Antagonists,' Attracted
 Mr. Smith, 56 years old, and Mr. Malone, 53, seemed headed in the same direction long before they got together last June at T.C.I.'s headquarters in Englewood, Colo.
Early in their careers, although at different periods, both had been engineers at A.T.& T.'s Bell Laboratories. But Mr. Smith had stayed in the telephone industry. Mr. Malone, restless under the bureaucracy of the old Bell System, fled. He eventually wound up heading the largest cable television empire in America.
In the years and then the months leading up to last summer, the phone and cable industries were preparing to invade each other's bailiwicks, as regulations were gradually easing to let phone companies get into the video business and cable companies into phone service. The two industries, though "natural antagonists," in Mr. Smith's phrase, also have complementary strengths to use in building the information highway.
 
Regulatory Diplomats
 The phone companies are seasoned regulatory diplomats; they possess the switching technology needed for two-way interactive networks, and they generate huge quantities of cash.
The cable companies, especially T.C.I., bring national reach, high-capacity cables able to handle voice and video, and programming expertise.
After overtures from Bell Atlantic last summer, and meetings between the two sides, the merger was annnounced at a New York news conference on Oct. 13. The agreement put a tentative price on the T.C.I. cable systems and related programming interests at nearly $23 billion, and called for Bell Atlantic to assume about $10 billion of T.C.I.'s debt.
Yet soon afterward, both sides began to realize how difficult, time-consuming and complicated the merger would actually be.
 
Corporate Tire Kickers
 Bell Atlantic and T.C.I. dispatched inspection teams -- corporate tire kickers -- to each other's empires less than a week after the deal was announced last fall. For each side, the results were revealing.
T.C.I. is the nation's largest cable-systems operator with 10.4 million subscribers nationwide. But only a modest percentage of its franchises are modern, high-channel-capacity systems in major metropolitan centers, passing at least 100,000 homes. In contrast, Time Warner, Cablevision and Cox, for example, each have sizable metropolitan holdings.
The difference reflects T.C.I.'s history as largely a collection of smaller, rural systems. But it also means that the investment costs will be considerable for anyone meaning to upgrade the T.C.I. operations for the high-capacity, 500-channel future. After the deal was scuttled, Mr. Smith said, "T.C.I. is not the premier property in the industry."
On the T.C.I. side, there were gnawing doubts about whether Bell Atlantic, which serves a six-state region from New Jersey to Virginia, including Washington, would really abandon its phone-company traditions and become a growth company.
Although Bell Atlantic is known as the most adventurous of the seven regional Baby Bells created by the antitrust breakup of A.T.&.T in 1984, the scrappy, entrepreneurial types at T.C.I. viewed it as a high-cost, slow-moving bureaucracy.
A joke that made the rounds in the T.C.I. camp spoke volumes about how the cable people viewed the companies' culture gap: What's gray with a blue-and-gold stripe and sleeps six? A Bell Atlantic repair truck.
 
Unionized Workers
 Bell Atlantic's 73,600-member work force is largely unionized, while T.C.I.'s 22,000 employees are mainly nonunion. Bell Atlantic's per-worker benefits costs, according to one T.C.I. adviser, were estimated an nearly four times the level at T.C.I.
But the biggest obstacle to the merger was the companies' disparate financial cultures. Bell Atlantic, in the tradition of telephone utilities, reports hefty earnings -- $1.4 billion last year on revenues of $13 billion -- and it pays generous dividends to its shareholders.
T.C.I., the cable powerhouse, operates by an entirely different financial logic. Although its cash flow -- income before interest payments, depreciation and other charges -- was $1.86 billion last year on revenues of $4.15 billion -- because it borrows heavily to finance aggressive growth and investment, it reports almost no net income, after paying interest on loans, and it pays no dividends. Its shareholders are seeking a stake in a fast-growing pile of assets and betting on the future.
Mr. Malone speaks of reported profits, the traditional yardstick of corporate performance, with disdain. "If you start to show reported earnings," he said, "you've probably stopped growing."
 
Growing Apart
A Financial Gap Too Wide to Span
 Despite the uncertainties -- compounded by a steady decline in both companies' stock prices -- the two executives were cheered after they met on Jan. 27., at the Marriott Hotel near the airport in Portland, Me., not far from Boothbay, where Mr. Malone has a vacation home. Each man had one adviser present.
The two sides, the executives and advisers say, went over thorny issues that had cropped up repeatedly during the merger talks. To allay any Bell Atlantic qualms about his post-merger plans, for example, Mr. Malone was willing to agree not to enter into any venture that might compete with the combined company for at least five years. He said that this proviso "was no big deal."
But pricing, as always, was a big deal. And on this, both sides say, real progress was made in Portland.
 
F.C.C. as Rate Cutter
 Mr. Smith gave Mr. Malone an update on the Federal Communications Commission, which was expected to issue new rules on another round of cable television rate cuts. According to one person at the meeting, Mr. Smith said that Bell Atlantic's people monitoring the agency in Washington had assured him that no drastic cuts were expected -- certainly nothing that would scuttle the merger plan.
And so the two men roughed out what Mr. Malone later called a "robust structure" for the deal -- a set number of Bell Atlantic shares to be paid for T.C.I. Neither side will spell out what that exchange ratio was to have been, citing confidentiality agreements. The two executives left the meeting confident enough to agree that their lawyers could draw up the paperwork for the definitive agreement.
"By the end of January," Mr. Malone recalled, "both Ray and I thought we had a solution."
The details of the "robust structure" had progressed far enough over the next two weeks that, by Feb. 11, Mr. Malone and Mr. Smith agreed to meet again soon to wrap things up.
But the picture had clouded considerably by the time they met on the afternoon of Wednesday, Feb. 23, at the Manhattan offices of Bell Atlantic's legal adviser, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The day before, the F.C.C. had decided to roll back the rates that American consumers pay on basic cable television service by 7 percent. Moreover, any future price increases would be limited to 2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation.
Thus, it was a wary group of seven who gathered in the 44th-floor conference room: for Bell Atlantic, Mr. Smith and two aides, and for T.C.I., Mr. Malone and three aides.
 
Reduction in Cash Flow
 Mr. Malone, briefing Mr. Smith on the impact of the F.C.C. action, said it would reduce the cash generated from T.C.I.'s cable system subscribers -- $1.86 billion in 1993 -- by roughly $144 million a year.
This was a problem, Mr. Malone acknowledged, but mainly a short-term one. T.C.I., he predicted, would be able to recoup revenues with new pay-per-view services and other offerings not subject to the rate strictures. The F.C.C. action, in his view, should not alter the pricing formula. After all, he argued, this was a merger for long-term gains.
But Mr. Smith saw the F.C.C.'s action as altering the whole equation. The Bell Atlantic model for valuing T.C.I. was to multiply its cash flow by 11.75 times, a formula similar to that applied to most cable-systems purchases. So, by Mr. Smith's reckoning, the T.C.I. price should now be cut by about $1.7 billion. "If T.C.I. was willing to make up much of the $1.7 billion difference," Mr. Smith later said, "we could have still gone ahead."
 
Diluting Earnings
 But if Bell Atlantic went ahead on the terms favored by Mr. Malone, the combined company's reported earnings would be watered down for an additional two to three years -- beyond the three or four years expected when the merger was announced. And Bell Atlantic, Mr. Smith said, would be paying a full 14 times T.C.I.'s cash flow.
Mr. Smith stands by his decision to demand better terms. "The week after we broke off the deal wasn't pleasant," he recalled, "after all the excitement we had stirred up and all the work we had done. But it would have been a horrendous week if I had to justify paying 14 times cash flow to the Bell Atlantic shareholders."
On the T.C.I. side, the unbridgeable price gap is regarded as further evidence of the different corporate cultures. "We were taking a long-term perspective,." Mr. Malone said.
But in the end, Mr. Malone was selling more of the future than Mr. Smith was willing to buy. "It looked like a tremendous deal in October," Mr. Smith recalled, "but it didn't look that way anymore."

Chart: "The Arc of a Corporate Love Affair"
 
JUNE 16, 1993: Bell Atlantic's chairman, Raymond W. Smith, calls on T.C.I.'s chief executive, John Malone, at his office in Englewood, Colo. Mr. Smith advances the idea of a "strategic partnership" or even a merger.
 
JULY 12: Mr. Malone and T.C.I.'s founder and chairman, Bob Magness, dine with Mr. Smith andother Bell Atlantic executives at a T.C.I. apartment in Manhattan. They later agree to pursue a merger.
 
OCT. 13: The merger plan is announced. Bell Atlantic agrees to acquire T.C.I.'s cable systems and related interests in programming for nearly $23 billion in stock, and assume about $10 billionof T.C.I.'s debt. Mr. Smith will be chief executive of the combined company, with Mr. Malone overseeing strategy, programming and technology.
 
JAN. 27, 1994: After a series of abortive agreements, Mr. Smith and Mr. Malone meet at ahotel near the Portland, Me., airport. They devise a rough framework for how many shares of Bell Atlantic stock will be paid for each T.C.I. share. Mr. Smith notes that the Federal Communications Commission is about to order cuts in cable rates but reportedlysays no deep cuts are expected.
 
FEB. 11: The two companies agree to complete the paperwork for a definitive agreement, and to meet within two weeks to wrap things up.
 
FEB. 22: The F.C.C. decidees to cut basic cable television rates by 7 percent and to limit future increases to 2 percentage points less than the rate ofinflation. T.C.I. executives expect the cut to reduce the flow of cash the company generates from its cable system subscribers by roughly $144 million a year. Its 1993 cash flow was $1.86 billion.
 
FEB. 23: In a meeting at a Manhattan law firm, Mr. Malone acknowledges to Mr. Smith that the F.C.C.'s rate-cutting action and its effect on T.C.I.'s cashflow represent a problem, but only a short-term one that does not warrant changing the terms of the merger deal again. But by Mr. Smith's reckoning, the price Bell Atlantic is to pay for T.C.I. should drop by about $1.7 billion. With neither side willing to renegotiate the prenuptial agreement, the wedding is off.

HEADLINE: Export Fall Broadens Trade Gap

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
A record plunge in exports vastly widened the nation's overall trade deficit in January even as the imbalance with Japan narrowed, Government figures showed today.
For the first time, the monthly tabulation counts services, an area that includes such things as tourism in which the United States has traditionally racked up surpluses that have significantly offset deficits in goods. 
 The inclusion of services did little to limit the enlargement of the deficit. Services, a steadier component than goods, according to monthly figures provided for the last two years, produced a $4.7 billion surplus in January, compared with $4.6 billion in December.
For January, combined imports of goods and services exceeded exports by $6.3 billion, up from $4.1 billion in December when computed on the same basis and adjusted for normal seasonal variation.
 
Weather Blamed
 While the enlargement was substantial -- and greater than generally expected -- analysts said that they were not alarmed because the trade figures, which are notoriously erratic, had also been affected by bad weather in various parts of the country, which held down both production and the transportation of goods to export markets.
"These numbers are volatile," Michael P. Niemira, a specialist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, cautioned. "I wouldn't read too much into the size of the decline in exports."
He and others noted that shipments of commercial aircraft alone tumbled by $462 million after a December surge, an almost inevitable sort of correction in a category of high-priced items where deliveries tend to be made in bunches.
Analysts said they could not tell how much of the export drop reflected bad weather, statistical aberration or continued languishing of the economies of American trading partners.
But they were heartened by separate, more recent indicators pointing to continued robust growth in the economy and the fact that exported goods ran nearly 2 percent higher in December and January combined than they had in October and November.
"The worsening may be more statistical than real," said Robert G. Dederick, a former Commerce Department official who is now chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Imports, meanwhile, eased $600 million, the Commerce Department's report showed. Half this reduction was in crude oil, reflecting both lesser volumes and lower prices.
Over all, a deficit in goods totaling $11 billion was partly offset by a surplus in services of $4.7 billion. For services alone, previously published only on a quarterly basis, exports were $15.7 billion and imports were $11 billion.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown observed that $2 billion of the services surplus came from tourism, transportation and related activity; $1.3 billion was in royalties and fees from such intellectual property as trademarks and patents, and $1.7 billion came from finance, engineering, design, legal, accounting and similar work.
Such earnings, he said, "belie any image of the service sector as a low-productivity source of low-wage jobs."
 
Ploy Assertion Denied
 At a briefing, department officials brushed off suggestions that the inclusion of services was a ploy to minimize the size of the monthly reported trade deficit. They said the process had been under way for 18 months and that the change was endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences as well as by service industries and the nation's trade negotiators.
Private economists generally concurred, backing the idea as sound -- though not as revealing as they might have hoped -- even if given some political impetus.
One feature they would like is a breakdown of services by country or other geographic area, which statisticians say is not yet feasible. Nor are services presented in constant dollars to adjust for price changes.
Today's report showed that the nation's goods deficit with Japan narrowed to $4.6 billion in January from $5.3 billion in December, with no adjustment for recurring seasonal factors. This was the smallest deficit since June.
The United States, which ran a $59.3 billion deficit with Japan last year, is waiting to hear what Japan proposes to revive negotiations about American demands for specific goals to gauge pledges of increased access to Japanese markets. Those talks collapsed in February.
 
Other Changes Made
 In addition to adding services, the new presentation shifts the emphasis for import and export values to a balance-of-payments basis. This produces somewhat higher levels than the previously featured set of figures, which relied on Customs Service documentation of physical movements across national boundaries. Goods can change ownership without being moved.
If no accounting change had been made, January would have shown a deficit in merchandise trade of $9.8 billion, up from a $7.4 billion deficit in December that had been the smallest in a year.
While services figure importantly in American trade -- the surplus rising steadily since 1986 -- the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company found little evidence of an American "structural advantage" in this area.
"Trends in overall services trade mirror trends in goods trade," it stated. "There is no noticeable trend toward a greater U.S. concentration of earnings from services."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Narrowly Mixed In Confusion on Fed Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished narrowly mixed against other major currencies yesterday after whipsawing during the day on conflicting impressions of whether the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates.
Traders said the dollar initially fell after the Fed added reserves to the money market through two-day repurchase agreements. While such an operation is routine, investors mistakenly took it as a sign that the Fed had decided against pushing up short-term interest rates, as the markets had expected. 
 But later, the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, announced that it was slightly raising short-term rates. The Federal funds rate, a rate for overnight loans between banks, rose to 3.5 percent from 3.25 percent.
 
A Way to Increase Return
 Investors then bought the dollar, increasing its value. Higher interest rates usually buoy currencies, since they translate into higher returns on dollar-denominated deposits.
But the interest rate increase was less than traders had expected. "People had pretty much discounted a 25-basis-point hike," said Win Thin, an economist at MCM Currencywatch.
The Fed first pushed up the Federal funds rate to 3.25 percent from 3 percent on Feb. 4.
Traders said the dollar's volatility reflected confusion over which way the currency might next go. The dollar has been weak despite the American economic recovery and Russian political turmoil. The dollar is often seen as a haven in times of ferment.
"None of these factors seems to have given the dollar any support," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Paine Webber Inc.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.05 Japanese yen, up slightly from 105.89 yen on Monday. But it slipped to 1.6885 German marks, down from 1.6895 marks.
The British pound slipped to $1.4875 from $1.4895. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Monday, were: 1.4300 Swiss francs, down from 1.4310; 5.7648 French francs, up from 5.7623; 1,668 Italian lire, down from 1,669, and $1.3669 (Canadian), down from $1.3693.

HEADLINE: Academic Disciplines Increasingly Entwine, Recasting Scholarship

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Human DNA can best be understood if studied as "a work of literature." That, at least, is the contention of Robert Pollack, a professor of biological sciences at Columbia University who has just unveiled the theory in his book "Signs of Life."
Scholars and scientists will recognize Professor Pollack's thesis as an example of one of the hottest trends in current academic life: interdisciplinary studies. At campuses across the country, biology is merging with physics and chemistry, anthropology is borrowing from literary theory and feminist studies, economics is mixing with cognitive psychology and bio spheric studies, and political science is absorbing mathematics, molecular biology and environmental studies. 
 "The boundaries between disciplines are becoming blurred," said Sheldon Hackney, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. "We've reached the point in the study of American history where you can't tell the difference between what the sociologists, the political scientists and the historians are doing."
 
A Basic Transformation
 Of course, interdisciplinary studies are not new. In the 1930's, for example, undergraduates at Yale University could major in an interdisciplinary program called "History, the Arts and Letters." But in the past, scholars would leap academic borders to borrow a skill to solve a specific problem and then retreat. Today, they interact with such intensity that their disciplines themselves frequently become transformed.
In current interdisciplinary studies, explained Colin Lucas, dean of the graduate division of social sciences at the University of Chicago, "you don't just acquire a technique, but new forms appear within your discipline, modifying the discipline itself."
Educational administrators say that young faculty members and students are propelling the trend, which may also transform the university, abolishing outmoded disciplines, creating new ones and developing ways to attack problems from one more than one direction rather than compartmentalizing knowledge.
"We're beginning to recognize that God did not create the universe according to the departmental structure of our research universities," said John A. Armstrong, former director of research at I.B.M. and a visiting lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The sciences have proved an especially fertile field for interdisciplinary studies. "Following the discovery of the structure of DNA, chemistry and physics have gradually become drawn into the field of biology," Professor Pollack said. "Such old disciplines as zoology and botany are fading, replaced by studies like structural biology, which marries physics, chemistry and biology, and cognitive biology, which seeks to understand behavior at the biological level."
In his study of DNA, Professor Pollack said, he is trying to marry the humanities and biology.
 
Opponents Speak Out
 Some professors look upon the trend with dismay. Harvey Mansfield, a professor of political philosophy at Harvard, said interdisciplinary studies "allow professors who don't want to pursue a normal and presumably difficult path to make a success of their unstudied opinions." Professor Mansfield was the only Harvard faculty member to vote against the university's adoption of the women's studies major in 1986.
In the past, interdisciplinary studies were sometimes ridiculed as dilettantism, along the line of "if you can't do anything, try everything." But today what some call "collective engagement" has attracted many of the best brains in academia. For example, one of the most popular new courses at Harvard, "Thinking About Thinking," is jointly taught by the lawyer Alan Dershowitz; the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and the philosopher Robert Nozick.
"By juxtaposing our different disciplines," Professor Dershowitz said, "we're forcing students out of their mind-set and making them think about things from a wholly different perspective."
While the trend cannot be measured precisely, Professor Murray Krieger, the founding director of the University of California Humanities Research Institute, said its scope was reflected in the proliferation of advertisements for scholars with multiple specialties, like "19th-century English teacher with additional capacity in feminist theory," and in catalogue offerings like "Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry."
The growth of interest can also be measured by student demand. Over the last decade, registration in interdisciplinary courses at Yale rose 40 percent and interdisciplinary majors 31 percent, said Charles H. Long, the university's deputy provost.
 
Explaining Popularity
 The reason for such growth is simple, said Nannerl O. Keohane, the president of Duke University: teleconferencing and electronic mail have accelerated communication, knowledge is spilling over traditional boundaries and new investigative tools have suggested the possibility of asking new questions.
Sanford Levinson, a professor at the Law School of the University of Texas who has participated in projects relating law to literature and music, said the desire to combine disciplines stemmed from a loss of faith in the traditional disciplines, an event that he said occurred in the 1960's.
"Literary scholars now recognize that there is no such thing as the rock-hard meaning of language," Professor Levinson said, "and legal scholars see that there is no particular way of thinking like a lawyer, and so they both look around for other takes and interesting juxtapositions."
Another explanation for the trend, intellectual restlessness, came from James Winn, director of the Institute for the Humanities at the University of Michigan, an interdisciplinary think tank.
"Many scholars have come to believe that the narrow approaches to a subject have been pretty much played out," Professor Winn said, "and so they have begun to look elsewhere. If the English scholar looks to anthropology, say, he can come up with a striking new set of questions to address."
 
Industry Plays a Role
 Interdisciplinary work in the sciences is frequently stimulated by the patronage of private industry. At Stanford University, more than a dozen industrial affiliates sponsor the Center for the Study of Language and Information, which combines philosophy, computer science, psychology and linguistics in an effort to develop computers that can understand speech.
The sponsors -- many in the computer software business -- donate $50,000 a year, and while they cannot prescribe research, they attend meetings, receive papers and have ready access to the center's work.
But the continued surge of interdisciplinary studies is not without a major obstacle: the departmental structure of American colleges and universities. Departments determine raises, promotions and tenure, and many are notoriously unsympathetic toward faculty members who work outside their disciplines.
Donald McCloskey, a professor of economics and history at the University of Iowa, has written several books arguing that economic writing has much in common with fiction. But because of such academic trespassing, his professional colleagues say, he has not been invited to teach at a top-tier university.
"The system rewards you for becoming boring," Professor Winn of Michigan said. "If a specialist in the Victorian novel writes a book on film, even a brilliant book, his colleagues will say he's 'all over the place' and not doing his job."
 
Success in Teamwork
 Yet interdisciplinary studies continue to gather force. Sometimes the work is done by a varied team of specialists. At Duke, for example, specialists in such diverse disciplines as archeology, art history, nuclear chemistry, linguistics, theoretical mathematics, ethnography and literary criticism joined to study ancient Maya pottery. The variety of techniques and backgrounds they took to the project led to their discovery that the artifacts were not just funerary offerings, as has long been supposed, but contained political messages as well.
"Top-quality research in the future in fields like archeology and history will be strongly interdisciplinary," Dorie Reents-Budet, curator of pre-Columbian art at the Duke Museum who organized the pottery project, said, "simply because no one person can be expert in all the specialties involved."
Groups of scholars, as well as individual ones, are designing interdisciplinary programs and courses. For instance, the newly formed International Center for Humanistic Discourses at the University of California at Irvine will meet next month to find ways to include Far Eastern culture in comparative literature. One of the earliest interdisciplinary majors, comparative literature gained acceptance in the 1950's, but today, because it is usually restricted to European languages, it is considered by some scholars as in drastic need of overhaul.
 
Looking at the Future
 Some scholars expect interdisciplinary studies to continue to grow. Current economic pressures might accelerate the trend, said Stanley Katz, president of the American Council of Learned Societies, by forcing the clustering of departments like anthropology, psychology and sociology. "It could be seen as a more efficient use of human resources," Professor Katz said.
Others prefer to retain the current departmental structure.
"Interdisciplinary work depends on having the disciplines," said Professor Arjun Appadurai, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago who is studying what he calls post national global allegiances. "It's like managing a portfolio of stocks. You don't want to become fossilized, and you don't want to be overtaken by fashions. You have to strike a balance."
Still others believe that the interdisciplinary studies movement is merely a transitional stage toward a radically different university.
Interdisciplinary study is only "a temporary effort to get at a greater interconnectedness," said Ralph Cohen, a professor of English at the University of Virginia and director of the Commonwealth Center for Literary and Cultural Change.
"Ultimately, the whole structure of the university must be changed," he said, "but that's a job for the next century."

HEADLINE: Struggling With the Fed's Fallout

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
If inflation is under control -- and by most accounts it seems to be -- why did the Federal Reserve raise short-term interest rates yesterday?
One reason may be that the Fed sees inflationary pressures that normal mortals do not. But another reason is that the monetary authorities needed to send a calming message to investors, who had pushed long-term interest rates up to almost 7 percent. 
 One of those investors in Alliance Capital Management, which invests more than $60 billion in bonds for corporations and for individuals who put money in its top-ranked mutual funds. A look at the company and what it has been doing for the last few weeks shows, in microcosm, how such investors are coping with the current uncertainty about interest rates, and how hard it will be for the Fed to calm the bond market. This is because, it turns out, a lot more than inflation influences interest rates.
When their computer terminals flashed the news -- "Greenspan Says Fed Acts to Raise Interest Rates" -- it did not come as a surprise to the portfolio managers at Alliance, who spent a quiet morning sitting around the firm's sleek gray trading desk watching computer screens flickering headlines and prices. Normally, Alliance's managers, who do their own trading, do not worry much about day-to-day Fed activities. But yesterday, they were "looking for a clue, paying more attention than normal, by a lot," Wayne Lyski, who runs Alliance's huge United States bond portfolios, said.
But while Mr. Lyski had his expectations, and his portfolio strategy, confirmed, he is not sure whether the Fed's self-declared "slight" tightening will be enough to calm the market and send the message the Fed intended: that the Fed will do what it must to keep inflation low, the bond markets calm and long-term interest rates down.
"I don't know," he allowed. Like most market participants, he assumed that "slight" translates into an increase of a quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points, to 3.5 percent in the Fed's short-term interest rate target. "There is an element of uncertainty introduced by the fact that it was 25 basis points, versus 50 basis points," he said, because the market would now worry that there was another increase coming in a month or so. "It may have been better for the market if the increase had been 50 basis points," he added, "but there has to be economic support for what they do, and that would have been stretching it."
That is because evidence of inflation, the archenemy of the bond market, is still hard to come by. A few indexes do hint at it, Mr. Lyski noted, but many others, from the price of gold to February's Consumer and Producer Price Indexes, are signaling good news. If consumers want to buy something, they can almost certainly find it on sale. In our everyday lives, he said, "We don't have a sense of impending inflation."
And yet, interest rates keep rising. Despite a slight decrease yesterday, intermediate and long-term rates have climbed almost a full percentage point this year, prompting complaints from President Clinton, who said recently that "there's no inflation in the economy."
 
 
More Than Inflation
 But inflation is not all that influences interest rates, even at a firm like Alliance that prides itself on paying close attention to fundamental economic trends. Trading strategies based only on bets on the changing relationship between long- and short-term interest rates -- not on their direction -- prompt buying and selling. Losses in one market -- like those suffered in Europe and Asia in February by big institutional investors, including George Soros -- may prompt investors to sell in the United States bond market to raise money to cover their losses. Academic theories, investor psychology, tax rates and the often arcane science of interpreting what goes on at the Federal Reserve also are in play. And everyone you ask emphasizes a different thing.
In other words, it can be a long way from economic theory to interest rate reality.
At Alliance, the theory begins with Lawrence L. Kreicher, a scholarly, soft-voiced economist and senior vice president. His job is to try to figure out where interest rates will be six months from now; every quarter he prepares an interest-rate forecast, which he and his staff update every week.
Admittedly, he said, "the actual inflation numbers look pretty good, but inflation is a sneaky, insidious kind of variable." By the time inflation is obvious, he said, it is too late for the Fed to control it.
 
 
Too Much Caution Seen
 If anything, he argues, the Fed is moving too slowly, too gradually. "I remain concerned that this Fed will err on the side of caution," he said. Bond investors are not so patient; even if the chance of inflation heating up is only one in five, the market will act, he explained. "The bond market has assumed the role of disciplinarian, and will squelch any tendencies that would produce greater inflation."
But why, if the Fed is acting to stem inflation far down the pike, has the bond market reacted so badly? This is where psychology comes in, said Selig L. Sechzer, the young Alliance economist who spends many mornings on the trading floor explaining the economic data that comes pouring in. Investor sentiment suddenly shifted, he said, from a bull market outlook to a bear market outlook, "where the best you could hope for is some sideways movement." He added, "It's been a while since many bond managers had to operate in a rising interest rate market; there are many young bond managers who have never seen one."
Mr. Lyski has. He recalls vividly that before 1987, "money supply was the big deal." "It was all anybody cared about," he added. "Even if you knew which way the economy was going, it didn't help you." Since then, he said, the economy has been all important, and he clings to economic fundamentals to keep from being swept away in the hysteria that often hits markets.
But he also looks at things that might strike the average person as technical, such as how much money is flowing into mutual funds and the differences between short-term and long-term interest rates. When these interest rates are plotted on a chart, they form what's called a yield curve; the bigger the difference between the shortest and longest rates, the steeper the curve. When the yield curve is very steep, that implies that interest rates will go up, because it indicates that people are worried about holding long-term debt, Mr. Lyski said. "As the yield curve flattens," he added, "it decreases the risk that rates will rise."
 
 
Reacting to the Curve
 Two weeks ago, when the yield curve was very steep, Mr. Lyski decided it was likely to get flatter, that the spread between short-term and long-term rates would narrow. So in the mornings, as he sat at the trading desk, he began selling bonds with intermediate maturities, and buying short-term and long-term debt. His purchases included the bonds that move most sharply as long-term interest rates change -- zero-coupon Treasury bonds -- and corporate notes with rates that float along with short-term indexes.
The strategy -- lots of bonds at the short and long ends and very little in between -- is called a barbell, or, "when it doesn't work, it's called a dumbbell," Mr. Lyski joked. To avoid that nasty fate, he moves gradually, watching the market to see if other mangers are doing the same thing, watching price changes to see if the strategy is paying off. Because the yield curve is getting a bit flatter, he said yesterday, he has continued to implement the barbell approach, and is now about three-quarters completed.
At one end of the trading room, Robert Sinche directs a small army of young men in white shirts who manage Alliance's many international bond funds. His markets have been moving even more sharply than those in the United States. "Everyone is making this out to be an inflation scare, but I'm not sure it's not a little simpler than that," he said. The culprit in the international bond markets was "the weight of the money," he added.
 
 
'Fads and Flows'
 By this he means that investors were pouring so much money into bonds, in America as well as in Europe and emerging markets, that they drove prices up -- and yields down -- to absurd levels. A small shift in interest rates and currencies, and the process reversed, pushing rates up to what an investor might have predicted last year, Mr. Sinche said. "The market moves on fads and flows; you do have to pay attention to it," he said.
And you can take advantage of it. Mr. Sinche said that in the last few weeks, when investors with losses had to sell Italian and Australian bonds -- driving the prices down sharply -- he bought. Once the prices rebounded, he sold. For the longer term, his portfolio is now heavily weighted toward European bonds maturing in three to seven years, he said yesterday. He thinks these bonds, which were hit hard as speculators dumped them, will rally.
In a quiet moment, Paul De Noon, a young Government bond portfolio manager who works with Mr. Lyski, said that in a way it did not matter whether he saw any inflation in the economy or not. What matters is what the Federal Reserve sees, and what the market thinks the Federal Reserve sees. "This is their game, played by their rules, and they brought the ball," he said. "If you disregard policy makers, you may be right in the very long term, but in the very short term you'll suffer a lot of pain."

HEADLINE: Ragnar Naess, Economist, 93, And Counselor

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Ragnar Dekke Naess, an economist and investment counselor to individuals and institutions, died on March 15 at his retirement home in Essex, Conn. He was 93 and had moved there from Manhattan in 1989.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said. 
 For nearly 30 years, Mr. Naess was an owner and a senior partner in the firm of Naess & Thomas, a Manhattan-based investment advisory company. The firm started originally as Naess & Cummings in 1939.
Born in Oslo into a prosperous family, he was educated in Norway until he came to the United States at the age of 19. He graduated in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1923 and earned an M.B.A. at the Harvard Business School three years later.
He started his career as an assistant economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, a job involving business forecasting and monetary problems. His interest in the stock market led him to develop economic data and charts with which to appraise business outlook, corporate earnings and stock prices.
Moving into the private securities business, he found his career derailed by the economic turmoil of the time. But as a researcher for the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation, his bearish forecasts proved to be correct and he was put in charge of the research department of the parent firm, Goldman Sachs & Company.
He was right once more when his measurements indicated that the economy and the market would bottom out in 1932. He turned bearish again early in 1937. Later that year he was named economist and a vice president at Tri-Continental Corporation, a large investment fund, with the princely salary of $35,000.
Two years later he formed his own partnership. The firm was acquired by Schroders Ltd., a London merchant bank, in 1969 and became Schroder Naess & Thomas. He retired as its chairman in 1971 but remained a consultant for several more years. Schroders changed the name to Schroder Capital Management Company in 1983.
He was a sailing enthusiast and skier, competing into his early 80's.
Mr. Naess is survived by his wife of 63 years, Margaret Dixon Naess; two sons, Ragnar D., of Brooklyn and Robert E. of Cavendish, Vt.; a brother, Arne, and a sister, Kristine Naess, both of Oslo, and two grandsons.

'Crazy Eddie' Sentencing Is Weighed

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 22

 BODY:
A Federal judge heard evidence today about what sentence to give Eddie Antar, the founder of the Crazy Eddie electronics chain, for his role in a stock fraud that cost investors millions of dollars.
Mr. Antar's lawyer argued that the sentence and restitution sought by the Government were too severe. He also said that Mr. Antar was willing to plead guilty to criminal charges and settle a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The lawyer, John J. Barry, also disclosed that Mr. Antar was willing to return $52 million to the United States, complying with a court order that he had defied since fleeing the country in February 1990.
 
One Brother Also Convicted
 Testimony is to continue on Wednesday, when Judge Nicholas H. Politan said he would sentence Mr. Antar, 46, and his brother, Mitchell, 38, who were convicted eight months ago of defrauding stockholders in their chain.
A third brother, Allen, 44, was acquitted. He attended today's hearing, as did more than a dozen members of the Antar family.
Eddie Antar wore blue prison garb, handcuffs and shackles in court today. He has been jailed since his arrest in Israel in June 1992.
Crazy Eddie became the biggest electronics retailer in the New York area in the 1980's. It was known for loud commercials in which a frenzied announcer boasted of prices that were "INSAAAAAAAANE."
Eddie Antar was convicted of illegally pocketing $75 million by selling his stock when he knew that its price was artificially inflated through bogus inventory and sales figures.
 
Stiff Sentence Sought
 Federal prosecutors are asking Judge Politan for a 25-year sentence for Mr. Antar, four to five times the range of 55 to 71 months calculated by Federal probation officials.
In papers filed with the court, Mr. Barry said that when Mr. Antar offered to plead guilty before the trial he was facing a term of seven and a half years. That proposed deal was scrapped by the Government when Allen Antar refused to plead guilty, he wrote.
The Government will not comment on plea negotiations.
Mr. Barry noted that Mr. Antar waived extradition after his arrest in Israel. "Since Mr. Antar's return to the United States, he has sought continuously to obtain a fair and impartial hearing as to the correct amount of illegal profits he should be required to repatriate," Mr. Barry wrote. "He has been rebuffed at every turn."
A witness called by the Government, William C. Dale, an economist with the S.E.C., said today that investors in Crazy Eddie stock and bonds lost at least $120.3 million while the Antars had control of the company.
That figure rises to $286 million, Mr. Dale said, by including investors who bought stock before it peaked and by factoring in the losses after new management took over.
Mr. Barry said he would call an expert witness on Wednesday to testify that investor losses totaled less than $36 million.
At its peak in June 1986, Crazy Eddie stock traded at about $80 a share, giving the company a worth of $620 million. Two years later, amid disclosures of financial problems, the stock was at $1 a share.
Mr. Antar's offer to pay the $52 million, which stems from a related civil case brought by the S.E.C., must be viewed in light of his conduct over the last four years, the United States Attorney, Michael Chertoff, said.
He suggested that Mr. Antar sign papers to begin the process of returning the money before Judge Politan moves to end the contempt case against him. Mr. Barry said he would have to discuss that proposal with Mr. Antar.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Silver Climbs to 4-Year High As Traders Bet on Inflation

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Silver prices surged to their highest levels in more than four years yesterday as some traders bet that the Federal Reserve would fail in its latest effort to keep inflation under control. Other precious metals also gained.
Silver rose 17.3 cents, to $5.596 an ounce, at the Commodity Exchange in New York, the highest price for the active silver futures contract since November 1989. 
 The Fed made its second credit-tightening move in the last two months yesterday, saying it will push up short-term interest rates slightly.
Bernard Savaiko, a Paine Webber analyst, said the precious metals market was "calling the Fed's bluff," expressing its opinion that a small interest rate increase would not be enough to restrain inflation.
Concerns about escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula and about strikes and political unrest in South Africa gave underlying support to precious metals.
Several traders, however, contended that the price gain was technically motivated, with silver attracting new buyers as it moved above certain price points.
"Silver broke through $5.50, then gold hit $388," a dealer said, noting that these prices were buy signals for many traders.
On the Comex, the active April gold contract gained $3.40, to $389.70 an ounce, a two-month high. And April platinum rose $2.90, to $405.90 an ounce, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Speculation in silver has surged in the last year as a number of countries, especially India, have increased their purchases. But there have been signs that demand has been slowing since silver moved above $5 an ounce in December.
On other commodity markets, speculative buying fueled a rally in coffee prices, which jumped to 15-month highs. Low domestic stocks and fears that coffee producers will crimp supplies lent support. Coffee for May delivery rose 1.15 cents, to 82.90 cents a pound, at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract on crude oil, which expired at the close of trading, fell 17 cents to end at $15.20 a barrel. May crude declined 7 cents, to $15.16 a barrel; April unleaded gasoline was up 0.25 cent, to 46.87 cents a gallon; April heating oil edged up 0.11 cent, to 45.20 cents a gallon, and April natural gas rose 5.2 cents, to $2.107 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Wheat prices sank to four-month lows at the Chicago Board of Trade, burdened by a lack of export demand and a long-range weather forecast calling for drought-relieving rains in the Great Plains.
May wheat fell 7 cents, to $3.2975 a bushel; May corn declined 3 cents, to $2.8275; May oats dropped 2.5 cents, to $1.3125, and May soybeans lost 2.75 cents, to $6.86 a bushel.
The wheat market was affected by the absence of China and Russia from the American wheat market and also by the United States' recent decision to reject Egypt's bid for subsidized wheat, analysts said.

The Riddles Of Race, Circa '68

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
A cacophony of sirens, raised voices and gunshots pervades "The Day the Bronx Died," Michael Henry Brown's cleanly delineated anatomy of racial and class tensions in an integrated neighborhood in the late 1960's; there are vicious shouted epithets and piercing cries for mercy.
But the play's most affecting moment is a quiet one. Three teen-age boys of disparate social backgrounds have just witnessed a murder. And the bold adult postures they have been trying to maintain, in emulation of both baseball heroes and James Bond villains, have slipped off like oversize jackets. Their silence and their hunched, embryonic postures are resonant with fear and a sense of futility. Adolescent fantasies have dissolved in the face of the realization that their world is indeed a dangerous one in which death, as another character puts it, "comes fast and natural." 
 The sharp sense of fears beyond rationalization may account for much of the great emotional pull the work seems to exert on its audiences at the American Jewish Theater. "The Day the Bronx Died," directed with spare economy by Gordon Edelstein, is by no means a particularly well-written play. It is bracingly complex in its sociology, presenting the different layers of antagonism that exist within, as well as between, different races. But as a coming-of-age tale, it gives off the pained sincerity of a young adult novel. Its language can have an inauthentically stilted ring: "Death had established an unwanted intimacy with me," says one character. And there is a nakedly diagrammatic quality to its development.
Still, the play has an inescapable poignancy, which is underscored by the fact that the problems it presents have only escalated since the time in which it is set. Its suggestion that there may be no "safe place" in urban America is guaranteed to strike responsive chords.
Structurally, the work borrows, in very conventional ways, from the old-fashioned memory play. As it begins, Mickey (Leon Addison Brown), a prosperous black man who lives in an affluent Manhattan building where his mother "once toiled as a domestic," is in a hospital, waiting to see if his son is going to live. The 13-year-old boy has been attacked on a subway. Mickey's mind "flashes back" to 1968, the year he was 13 and the year of the Bronx riots that followed the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
"I straddled two worlds," Mickey tells us, as actors representing his past fill the blank stage. The young Mickey (Akili Prince), who lives with his recently widowed mother (Brenda Denmark) in a house in an integrated middle-class section of the Bronx, is torn between allegiances to Billy Kornblum (Neal Huff), a clean-cut Jewish boy, and Alexander (Luis A. Laporte Jr.), a tough, street-smart black kid.
Alexander is gradually drawn into a network of young thugs ruled over by the sadistic Prince (Kelly Neal). And Mickey is presented with diametrically opposed options for self-preservation: Alexander urges him to join Prince's gang; his homily-spouting mother wants him to confine himself to more culturally uplifting pursuits, represented by piano lessons, James Baldwin books and Little League baseball games with his "nice Jewish friends."
These worlds are destined to collide, of course, leaving a path of betrayal, death and disenchantment. Mr. Brown is at his best in exploring the gradations and mythologies of prejudice: the contempt of Mickey's mother for the people in the projects, "where women just stay in bed making babies all day"; Alexander's insistence that Jews don't believe in Christmas because they're too cheap to buy presents, and the revelation that Billy's seemingly humanitarian father (Herbert Rubens) has his own core of bigotry.
The performances are generally lucid and strongly centered, if short on shading. As Daniel, a young piano prodigy believed to be homosexual, Ntare Mwine renders with touching dignity the mannerisms that have made him an outcast. In one of the play's most disturbing scenes, Daniel is brutally raped by Prince and a henchman. "I'm not the enemy," Daniel cries out. Mr. Brown suggests that the point is irrelevant. In the urban battleground he portrays, the line between ally and enemy is harrowingly nebulous.

HEADLINE: Clinton Arts Dinner Whetted Appetites Still Unsatisfied

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
On Oct. 7 last year, before an enthusiastic crowd of 600 on the White House lawn, President Clinton presented 12 people with the National Medal for the Arts, commenting on how the work of each recipient had touched his life.
That night the recipients, who included William Styron, Robert Rauschenberg, Arthur Miller, Paul Taylor and Billy Wilder, were honored at a formal dinner and at a concert that was so spirited it brought forth comparisons to the legendary evening in 1961 when President John F. Kennedy and his wife had Pablo Casals perform in the East Room. Coming just after the smooth and rapid confirmation of the actress Jane Alexander as the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, that October day seemed to many people in the arts to be all but the dawn of a second golden age. 
 Now, nearly half a year later, the mood among people in the arts is mixed and strangely cautious, and there is a feeling among many of them that the high expectations for the Clinton Administration in the arts have yet to be realized. Oct. 7 notwithstanding, movie stars and Hollywood executives have been more conspicuous at the White House than practitioners of high culture. Unlike previous Presidencies, Mr. Clinton's has no White House official specifically charged with coordinating arts policy; Melanne Verveer, Hillary Rodham Clinton's deputy chief of staff, has emerged as the prime arts operative, but she has many other duties. The likelihood of the arts getting major attention in a White House preoccupied both with major policy initiatives like the Clinton health plan and with the Whitewater inquiry is small indeed.
At a time when so much political pressure points to budget cutting, the Administration has proposed no new money for the arts endowment despite the fact that, as Ms. Alexander pointed out in a recent interview, inflation combined with minimal increases means that it has lost 46 percent of its purchasing power since 1979. The current budget is $170.2 million, and the White House has requested the same amount for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
By comparison with the many Federal agencies where budget cuts are the rule, this is soft treatment. But it is hardly the kind of encouragement arts advocates had expected from this Administration. The overall budget for the National Endowment for the Arts has not changed noticeably in 12 years, and the total amount the endowment has to support all arts programs remains smaller than the tiny sliver of the Defense Department budget that supports military bands, which is $189.1 million. (Money for bands is down $2 million in the budget the President has proposed for next year, but even with this cut military bands would still get $17 million more than the arts endowment.)
"I know that the President has to talk about saving money, but this record is atrocious," said Harvey Lichtenstein, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "Another $25 million or $50 million would be an extraordinary shot in the arm, and it would make Clinton a hero."
The President is anything but a hero to arts organizations as they find money every bit as tight as it was in the last Administration. Some are responding to the squeeze in innovative ways. The Baltimore Museum of Art just offered cabdrivers a free box lunch to encourage them to direct tourists the museum's way, and a Boston performance art group called Mobius promised that anyone contributing at least $10 would get a call from a member of the group to tell the contributor a joke. But the day-to-day life of many arts groups is fraught with black humor about survival.
 
The Record So Far: Mostly Intangibles
 So far, the President's main accomplishment in the arts has not been in tangible areas of policy or money but in intangibles: in creating an aura of support, a sense that after the culturally bleak Reagan and Bush years, the arts are viewed with sympathy by the White House. While the long delay in appointing Ms. Alexander to head the endowment (she was not named until July 1993) caused considerable grumbling about where the arts stood on the totem pole of Clinton appointments, few people quarreled with the choice once it was made. Ms. Alexander brought to the job the independent stature of a well-known figure in the arts, and more than a little of her luster has rubbed off on the endowment, an agency whose standing with the public was badly bruised by the obscenity debates.
Ms. Alexander has been tireless in politicking with Congress, even inviting Senator Jesse Helms, the endowment's most visible critic, to a February meeting of the National Council on the Arts, the endowment's board of overseers. (He accepted but did not make it, saying he was kept away by last-minute legislative pressures.)
"There has been a visible uplift since she came in," said Representative Sidney R. Yates, an Illinois Democrat and the House's senior arts advocate. "We were almost totally on the defensive before, but she has captivated many of the members of Congress. She is a breath of fresh air."
Ms. Alexander's networking goes beyond Capitol Hill; she has traveled the country, meeting with local arts groups, state legislatures, mayors and artists themselves, trying to make the case that the money the endowment offers, however modest, stimulates other sources of support, raises spirits and helps communities. Her role as a kind of upscale Johnny Appleseed of the arts has, for the moment at least, effectively transcended the arguments about obscenity that all but paralyzed the arts agency during most of the Bush years.
Ms. Alexander's ability to relegate those issues to the sidelines is probably her clearest accomplishment. She is an ideal figure to speak for the arts, since she is an artist herself. Yet she is not so huge a star as to have her celebrity overshadow the substance of her arguments. Neither a Barbra Streisand nor a bureaucrat, she has managed to draw more good notices than any endowment head since the agency's first chairwoman, Nancy Hanks.
"If we can maintain an advocacy role, which hasn't happened in 12 years, then people will begin to understand the value of the arts," Ms. Alexander said in a conversation in her sprawling office in the renovated Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. "They will see what the arts can do to revitalize towns, to help children, to help us maintain our competitive edge in business. People say that artists should make money on their own. I say tell that to a choreographer who makes $5,000 or $6,000 a year, whose work has no commercial potential but which enriches lives."
 
Leaving the Arts To Jane Alexander
 Ms. Alexander's message has not gone much beyond the notion that the arts are a good thing. If she were a preacher, she would be of the God-loves-you variety, not the fire-and-brimstone school. Her vision of culture is of a force to lift the spirit, and many people in the arts question whether she or the Administration she serves is prepared to fight tougher battles on behalf of the arts.
"Who really believes that Bill Clinton would rise above politics if Mapplethorpe came to Washington on his watch?" said Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic. "Remember how they built Salman Rushdie up, then cut him down. Clinton is just lucky that he was elected President after Jesse Helms retired as an art critic."
Ms. Alexander's staff, understandably, thinks otherwise. "She doesn't shy away from difficult issues," said Alexander D. Crary, a Capitol Hill veteran who oversaw arts policy for Senator Claiborne Pell for years and is now the arts endowment's chief of staff. "She's got a wonderful, natural ability to be persuasive and she holds to her convictions."
And the White House, for the moment, seems satisfied: so much so that it has more or less left arts policy in the hands of Ms. Alexander and Mr. Crary.
"The White House thinks Jane Alexander is doing just fine," said one Administration official. "She is doing exactly what they want her to. She is out there working her tail off, and there is a real perception of change in the Government's attitude toward the arts. If the right does try to pull something, then all that Jane has been doing is insurance in the bank."
Ms. Alexander's most ambitious program so far is a conference called Art 21 that she is arranging next month in Chicago. Intended to explore issues like the artist and society, arts education and expanding resources for the arts, the conference will feature, among other speakers, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry G. Cisneros. Neither President Clinton nor his wife, whose presence endowment officials had been hoping for, will be on the program.
Arts groups have been generally supportive of Ms. Alexander, though they haven't hesitated to gripe about how issues like health care and requirements on lobbying disclosure can affect arts institutions.
"It's like the issue of nonprofit postal rates: they're not specifically targeting the arts, but the arts get caught," said Judith Golub, the executive director of the American Arts Alliance, an umbrella organization for service groups like the American Symphony Orchestra League and Opera America. "We're small businesses and individual artists, and where do we fit into the health care debate? Jane Alexander is a great ambassador for the arts, but we still feel that the White House is not fully sympathetic to these other concerns that we have."
An Administration official, conceding that service organizations have been "the one area where I hear gripes," attributed complaints less to policy differences than to "jealousy that something's happening in the arts and they're not controlling it."
 
The Popular Arts Are Clinton's Area
 How about the President? His decision not to make time in his schedule for the endowment's conference in April, Ms. Alexander's biggest show yet, seems to underscore that he prefers to make supportive comments about the arts but not to get heavily involved himself.
"The Clintons take the right position on the big issues for art," said a New York museum director who insisted that his name not be used. "But their tendency is still to think about culture always in terms of the most popular forms of art. They see it as a populist part of their political life."
It's no secret that the President's favorite cultural activity seems to be showing movies at the White House, and his most frequent cultural guests have been from the worlds of Hollywood and pop music. The Clintons are more believers in high art than they are consumers of it themselves; they do not frequent the Presidential box at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and have not been seen much at events that might be called high culture.
"I'm unhappy that he has yet to come to the opera," said Martin Feinstein, the Washington Opera director, who recalled that President Jimmy Carter not only went to Kennedy Center events but also requested the texts of plays or opera librettos in advance to prepare.
Yet this Administration has managed, more than any since the Kennedy era, to project an aura of approval for high art, despite the absence of any real initiatives. At the Oct. 7 celebration the President's interests in literature and music were apparent, and his off-the-cuff remarks had an enthusiasm no speechwriter could create. His sense of engagement was intense with the evening's full range of performers, from Leontyne Price and Robert Merrill, who sang spontaneously during dinner in the State Dining Room, to the poet laureate, Rita Dove, who read from her work, to the young classical musicians who performed in the East Room.
The program that night ended with a few remarks from Isaac Stern, who had helped organize the concert portion. He saluted the President, then closed with a gentle warning that "the joyousness that we shared in the dining room, the sense of identification with the power of creativity" not be taken for granted, and that the arts needed tangible support as well as celebration.
"What I was saying that night is that the arts have to be a continuing effort, a fight for the minds and the freedom of our children, and not just a social adornment," Mr. Stern said recently. "I have a feeling that while it is not the No. 1 priority for the White House, they know this and are prepared to back it."
 
On Decency And the Courts
 Arts advocates are dismayed by the Clinton Administration's decision to allow the Justice Department to pursue an appeal of a court decision overturning the so-called decency provision, which requires the National Endowment for the Arts to take standards of decency into account when awarding its grants.
The provision was passed by Congress in 1989 in response to complaints by the far right that the work of certain artists supported by the endowment, like Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes and Tim Miller, was obscene. It was deemed unconstitutional and vague in 1992 by Federal District Court in California. The appeal was filed in Pasadena in June 1993 in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
"Why are they doing this when they could have just left it alone?" said Martin Feinstein, the director of the Washington Opera. "Appealing this decision makes no sense whatsoever." He said that letting the lower court decision stand would have sent a signal of clear support for freedom of expression, while appealing it seemed to many people in the arts to be a capitulation to the concerns of the far right.
Privately, Administration officials concede that the appeal, which was made in the early days of Mr. Clinton's presidency, slipped through the Justice Department without being noticed in the White House, and they say they had no intention of sending a message of sympathy to the opponents of the endowment. The vehemence of the original appeal, they say, was muted by a more moderate second brief that more accurately reflects the Administration's views and reaffirms freedom of expression. Nonetheless, the appeal itself was allowed to stand.

A Final Thought On Upsets

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY

 BODY:
MY first exposure to a so-called upset came in March 1963. The national championship game between Cincinnati and Loyola was blacked out in Chicago so we listened to the game on radio.
Cincinnati was the two-time defending national champion, but the Bearcats were about to be ambushed. Chicagoans already knew that but the rest of the country didn't. 
 The Ramblers won, 60-58, in overtime. The game was shown later on tape, and the scene I will always remember is George Wilson, the Bearcat star, cupping his hands on either side of his head in disbelief as the buzzer sounded.
I saw my first major "upset" in 1966 when Texas Western defeated Kentucky. We had never heard of Texas Western but had heard plenty about Kentucky's legendary coach, the baron, Adolph Rupp. And we had heard all about his all-white team, affectionately known as Rupp's runts, which included Pat Riley, now the Knicks' coach. The national allure translated into favored status for the Wildcats.
All five of Texas Western's starters were black; I'd never seen that before. In one scramble under the basket, a Texas Western player scooped up the ball and dunked in one motion: Kentucky had never seen that before. By the time the game was over, with Texas Western a 72-65 winner, I felt like I'd been misled all along.
Kentucky? This was no upset. Texas Western was faster, quicker, more skilled. But, until the game, Texas Western was also invisible.
Nearly 30 years later, we're still using outdated yardsticks, thanks largely to television, to gauge who should win a basketball game.
After Arkansas defeated Georgetown on Sunday, Nolan Richardson stood by the Razorbacks' bus. Someone asked him about the upset losses suffered by Kentucky, North Carolina and U.C.L.A. These were not upsets, he said.
"People are still thinking of college teams in terms of names and past reputations," he said. "All that has changed. The talent out there is better than ever, and everybody's getting some of it. I've even seen some N.A.I.A. teams that I won't schedule because they're so good."
Comforting words. But they won't help Dean Smith (North Carolina), Rick Pitino (Kentucky), John Calipari (Massachusetts) and Jim Harrick (U.C.L.A.) answer critics who want to know "What happened?"
How could North Carolina, the defending champion with all that talent, lose to Boston College? How could Kentucky lose to Marquette? Massachusetts to Maryland? U.C.L.A. to Tulsa?
The questions are based on perception and name recognition, not on the reality of talent: Boston College was quicker than North Carolina and more experienced; Marquette had a bigger, tougher front line than Kentucky. Maryland was simply better than Massachusetts. Tulsa was a better-shooting team than U.C.L.A. had ever imagined.
We're looking for dynasties in college basketball and they don't exist. The economy may be shrinking, but the pool of talent is more fertile than ever. Nearly every town is producing outstanding players and the players are finding their way to schools as diverse as Liberty University, the College of Charleston, North Carolina A&T and Pennsylvania.
The level of basketball fluency is amazing. Coaches from the Biddy level on up have done an extraordinary job in the last 20 years of priming young players for each higher level of competition.
The end result has been the swarm of so-called upsets in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Coaches are facing the reality that the level of vulnerability for favored teams is higher than ever.
The only team that stands alone is Arkansas, the deepest and most talented team left in the tournament. The Razorbacks can play small or large, fast or moderate, and their defense is hellacious.
Experts are predicting an Arkansas-Michigan final, but there's a distinct possibility that the Fab Four may not make it past Maryland.
After Michigan's narrow victory over Texas last Saturday, Juwan Howard, Michigan's talented center, conceded that he was beginning to feel the pressure of mounting expectations. His Michigan team has played in two national championship games and lost twice.
Howard recalled how two years ago Michigan was a team of upstarts on the rise; now they were being called underachievers.
"It'll be a little disappointing," he said, "if we don't win the national championship for a third time."
Howard paused for a moment, then smiled.
"We don't want to be known as the Buffalo Bills of college basketball," he said.

HEADLINE: In America;
Pretty Words On Haiti

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT; Anna Quindlen is on vacation.

 BODY:
With most people, and especially with politicians, it is more instructive to watch the things they do than listen to what they say. And so it is with President Clinton and the extreme split between his high-toned rhetoric and his Administration's shameful behavior regarding Haiti.
Mr. Clinton has been unwavering in his spoken support for the restoration of democracy in Haiti and the return to power of its ousted President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In a radio address to the Haitian people in January 1993 Mr. Clinton, then President-elect, said: "Several years ago, I saw personally the beauty of your land. I felt the warmth of your people and ever since then I have wanted you to have freedom and democracy and economic opportunity." 
 As a Presidential candidate, Mr. Clinton repeatedly attacked the Bush Administration's Haitian refugee policy, saying at one point, "I am appalled by the decision of the Bush Administration to pick up fleeing Haitians on the high seas and forcibly return them to Haiti before considering their claim to political asylum."
Mr. Clinton is a master of the correct thing to say in any given situation. But all you need is a glimpse of the net thrown around Haiti by the Coast Guard to capture -- and return -- fleeing refugees to realize that the President's actions can be something else again.
This lesson has been hammered repeatedly into the head of Father Aristide. The treatment he has received from his "friends" in the United States seems very peculiar when you consider that he and the democracy that he represents are the clear victims in this saga, and that the murderous thugs who ousted him in a coup in September 1991 are villains devoid of any redeeming value.
The Clinton Administration has tried to impose on Father Aristide a series of proposed "settlements" that, if carried out, would have meant at best that he would return to Haiti as President in name only, unable to govern effectively, and at worst that he would be placed in imminent danger of being murdered.
The latest of these is a ludicrous plan, dreamed up by the State Department, that would virtually assure the coup leaders amnesty and a strong voice in the formation of a new government, and doesn't even bother to set a target date for Father Aristide's return.
Mr. Aristide has quite sensibly rejected such proposals. For that he has been labeled intransigent and treated increasingly shabbily by the Administration. No matter that he upheld his end of last year's Governors Island accord, and that the coup leaders treated the accord the way a scofflaw treats a parking ticket. Mr. Aristide may have won a free and fair election in Haiti, but to the political sophisticates in the upper echelons of the Government in Washington he is a boor and a nuisance.
The Administration, in conjunction with the United Nations, has also imposed an embargo on Haiti that has substantially increased the suffering of the Haitian people and is so riddled with loopholes it has not come close to bringing the junta to its knees. And a commercial embargo imposed by the United States was carefully crafted to exclude assembly plants, which are used by companies outside Haiti to assemble goods in Haiti (with cheap Haitian labor) for export elsewhere. United States trade with Haiti increased in 1993.
Meanwhile, the atrocities committed by the police and the military against the Haitian population continue. Thousands of civilians have been killed, tens of thousands are in hiding. Human rights organizations report that the Haitian police -- and armed civilians allied with them -- are raping women with impunity as part of their countrywide campaign of terror.
Eventually even the prettiest of words can lose their meaning in the cold light of reality. While President Clinton says nice things about them, the Haitians are being destroyed.
On Sunday I wrote that former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams had been convicted of perjury in connection with the Iran-contra scandal. That was an error. Mr. Abrams pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of illegally withholding information from Congressional committees, a violation of the contempt of Congress law.

HEADLINE: Why Junk the Old Car if You Can Recycle It?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The problem of secondary hazardous waste, which is produced after the life of a product, has been ignored by the Environmental Protection Agency and Congress. Secondary hazardous waste is responsible for the clutter of our public parks, the oil found in our drinking water and the thousands of tire dumps all over the United States. 
 There is a solution. Congress should enact legislation that requires manufacturers of all products that produce secondary hazardous waste to track, receive and dispose of all such products after their lifetime. This suggestion may at first glance appear to be overburdensome for manufacturers, but in actuality this suggestion promotes economic growth and stability for them.
The best example of the economic effectiveness of secondary hazardous waste legislation comes from Germany. Like the United States, Germany has found retired automobiles an increasingly difficult environmental problem. German roadsides and fields do not have enough space to hold the two million automobiles that are retired annually.
To deal with this problem, the German Parliament is expected to pass mandatory legislation that will require that all automobiles manufactured in Germany are 100 percent recyclable.
This type of legislation might be expected to meet horrified outcries about excess burden from the automotive giants of Germany. But just the opposite is occurring.
The major manufacturers of BMW's, Mercedes-Benzes and Volkswagens have embraced these plans by initiating research and development programs that have devised 70 percent recyclable automobiles. These companies realize that there is considerable loss of money and energy when an automobile is allowed to rot in a field. Instead, an automobile can be recycled and placed into other automobiles, which brings overhead down because less raw material is consumed in manufacturing.
If similar action were to be taken in the United States, manufacturers would have to devise products that were either reusable or simply disposable. The technology is certainly there. If the most complicated secondary hazardous waste, such as paint, can be reused, this type of legislation is feasible.
For example, Seattle has put into effect Seattle Beige, a program that recycles and reuses leftover paint from households to create new paint. The paint retails for about $5 a gallon and will create $1 million to $3 million in revenue for Seattle annually.
Examples such as this prove that creative and technological advances are available. Congress should act quickly to help protect our environment.

HEADLINE: Time to Stretch Hands Across the Pacific

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Both "The Failure of Our Success" (Op-Ed, March 14) by George F. Kennan and Anthony Lewis's column the same day point to the need for the United States to reflect on its failures and successes, and develop foreign policies in response to the emerging political and economic geographies of Asia, Australia and a transformed Europe. Mr. Lewis finds a new sense of selfhood and acceptance of diversity in Australian public life and suggests that a new basis is needed for Australian-American relations. 
 As a teacher in the University of California since 1984, (with a past divided between campuses in New Zealand, Germany and Britain), I think our educational system and general culture are doing a good job in promoting contacts with the new Europe but are failing to wake up to the new Asia-Pacific cultural -- not just economic -- environments.
Europe is easier, because our educational system, as Jefferson imagined it, was borrowed from France, Britain and, later, Germany, and the tourist flow keeps contacts strong. A more urgent challenge -- one that faces the United States more than the expanded European community -- is to create new cultural bridges and learning partnerships with the many Asia-Pacific nations.
Last year I spent two months visiting universities, museums and public art galleries in Australia and New Zealand, under the University of California education abroad program. Both countries are working to improve educational opportunities for indigenous and minority populations. So are we. But they are also expanding the cross-cultural flow of teachers, students, artists, architects, writers and film makers around Asia and the Pacific. They realize that cooperation in foreign and economic policy requires more personal contacts between cultural producers.
Most of the young people I talked to also welcomed the notion of an Australian republic: they see it as a logical expression of a sense of independent identity as a member of an Asia-Pacific, rather than a remote Anglo-European, community.
We too need to increase the cross-cultural flow among schools, universities and museums. We must teach the global present, as well as the national past, to be effective players in the coming century. Pacific cultural studies could provide a forum for exchanges between settler and indigenous groups.

HEADLINE: Inquiry to Cover Loan Accusation Against Clinton

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
After securing a guilty plea from an Arkansas businessman involving the operation of his federally backed lending company, the special prosecutor investigating the Whitewater real estate venture said he would now vigorously pursue the man's accusations that Bill Clinton had pressured him to make a questionable bank loan to Mr. Clinton's partner in the deal.
"This will allow us a full investigation of everything he knows," the special prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske Jr., told Judge Stephen M. Reasoner of Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark. 
 The guilty plea allows the businessman, David L. Hale, who was also a former municipal court judge in Little Rock, to avoid a trial that was scheduled to begin on Monday. Mr. Hale will then be able to present his accusations about Mr. Clinton to the Whitewater grand jury sitting there.
Mr. Hale has maintained that Mr. Clinton, while Governor in 1986, pressured him to lend money to politically connected friends, including Susan B. McDougal, a partner in the failed Whitewater venture. Mr. Clinton has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing and angrily denied Mr. Hale's accusations.
"At this point, so much depends on Mr. Hale's cooperation," Mr. Fiske said.
The grand jury in Little Rock is just one of two that Mr. Fisk is using to investigate accusations that Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, may have improperly benefited from their association with James B. McDougal, owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association. Mr. McDougal, as well as his wife, Susan, was a partner with the Clintons in the Whitewater Development Company.
Mr. Hale, the former owner of Capital Savings Management, pleaded guilty to bank and mail fraud for defrauding the Small Business Administration. He also admitted falsifying information on a February 1986 application to obtain Federal funds to lend to economically disadvantaged businesses. The charges were not related to Whitewater.
An aide to Mr. Fiske said today that the prosecutor believed Mr. Hale had extensive knowledge about the Whitewater deal.
 
More Inquiries
 The guilty plea in Little Rock came as the examination of Whitewater and the failure of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan proceeded in these two directions:
*The House of Representatives voted 408 to 15 to have leaders of both parties set an appropriate timetable for hearings on Whitewater.
*The other grand jury sitting in Washington heard from Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, appeared before a grand jury sitting in Washington.
Mr. Altman, who told the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 24 that he held a procedural meeting with White House officials on Feb. 2 to discuss the actions of the Resolution Trust Corporation on Madison, said in a letter to the committee that he had also had several additional telephone calls and personal conversations about whether he should recuse himself from the case.
 
Letter to the Banking Panel
 In the letter dated March 21, Mr. Altman said he had discussed the possibility of recusal with Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff, and Bernard W. Nussbaum, the White House counsel who was forced to resign after the first meeting became public.
Mr. Altman would not discuss his grand jury testimony today but said in an interview that the discussions with the White House officials were not significant.
"I've said from the outset that I had one substantive contact and that remains my view," he said. "No one at the White House ever asked me not to recuse myself."
Mr. Altman did not formally recuse himself until Feb. 25, one day after he told the Banking Committee that he had met with the White House representatives.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, rejected Mr. Altman's defense today. "This is the fourth time that Altman has changed his story about contacts with the White House about the Madison-Whitewater affair," Mr. D'Amato said. "In just four weeks, the number of contacts between Altman and the White House has grown four times. How many more letters will it take before we get the whole story?"
 
Warning to Congress
 Both Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, and Representative Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader, warned against allowing the Whitewater inquiry to overwhelm the chamber.
Mr. Altman's latest disclosures about his contacts with White House officials came as he prepared to testify before the grand jury.
Officials said Mr. Altman was trying to reconcile his earlier recollections with accounts provided to the grand jury and to Congress by other subpoenaed officials.
The White House spokesman John Podesta would not discuss the conversations Mr. Altman had with other officials.
"I'm not going to characterize conversations while the grand jury is going on and people are taking testimony," Mr. Podesta said. "It would be inappropriate. We're in a tough spot on that."
But the evidence of repeated contacts with White House officials who had direct, daily contact with the Clintons has again raised the same question of undue influence that brought about Mr. Nussbaum's resignation.
"I generally attend meetings in the White House three or more times a day, and am on the telephone with White House staff even more often," he said in his letter. "It is difficult to recall every brief encounter."
Mr. Altman said that on one occasion, he "literally bumped into Mr. Nussbaum in a White House corridor."
Mr. Altman has been acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is investigating the business practices of Madison Guaranty. He is scheduled to step down from that post at the end of the month.
In the House, Democratic opposition to Whitewater hearings fragmented as lawmakers in both parties stopped arguing and voted overwhelmingly to negotiate the time and agenda for a formal inquiry.
 
Hearing Expected in 2 Months
 It appeared that some hearing would be held within about two months, probably by the House Banking Committee and well after Mr. Fiske is expected to have concluded the Washington portion of his investigation.
In a resolution that expresses the lawmakers' sentiments but lacks any legal clout, the House ordered leaders to arrange hearings on all matters involving Madison Guaranty, the Whitewater Development Company and Capital Management Services Inc.
The resolution's language was identical to a Senate resolution approved last week.

HEADLINE: 3 Companies in Landmark Accord On Lawsuits Over Breast Implants

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
In the largest settlement ever negotiated in a class-action lawsuit, officials of three companies gave final approval yesterday to an agreement to pay $3.7 billion over 30 years to women claiming they were injured by silicone breast implants.
In the highly complex settlement, the companies, the Dow Corning Corporation, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and the Baxter Healthcare Corporation, will pay women specific amounts for injuries. 
 "We finally did it," said Gary E. Anderson, Dow Corning's executive vice president.
 
Judge's Approval Needed
 The agreement is still subject to approval by the companies' boards of directors and by Judge Sam C. Pointer of Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala. Even if he approves it, the settlement can crumble if too few women sign up. But if it goes through it will clear the courts of many of the 12,000 cases involving more than 25,000 women who had implants and say they were injured.
The manufacturers say there is no scientific evidence that the implants are harmful, and they are agreeing to the settlement to put the expensive litigation behind them. Dow Corning agreed to pay $2.018 billion, Bristol-Myers Squibb $1.154 billion and Baxter Healthcare $555 million.
An estimated one million to two million women had silicone breast implants in the last 25 years. Some women and doctors say the devices caused a variety of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, like lupus, and connective tissue disorders, like scleroderma, a progressive hardening and thickening of the skin and internal organs.
Although the amount of money that the three companies agreed to pay sounds enormous, part of it will be paid by insurance companies and part in future dollars whose value will have been eroded by inflation.
John Churchfield, chief financial officer of Dow Corning, said insurance would pay about $1.2 billion of Dow Corning's $2.018 billion contribution. He said the value of the insurance payment in current dollars is $600 million and the value of the balance to be paid by Dow Corning in current dollars is $640 million.
Geoffrey Miller, a law professor at the University of Chicago who studies large class-action lawsuits, said the agreement was virtually unprecedented because of its size and complexity. "It's going to be a model for future class-action litigation," he said.
Mr. Anderson said the settlement was at least twice as large as the largest previous class-action agreement, which involved workers with asbestos.
The breast-implant agreement provides that set amounts will be paid to women with specific medical conditions, with no requirement that they show that their implants caused the disorders. But the fees can be reduced if too many women sign up. If that happens, the women are allowed to drop out of the class-action agreement.
The companies can also opt out if too few women sign up. "We can't pay both the immense costs of litigation and the settlement," said T. Michael Jackson, a spokesman for Dow Corning, whose ownership is divided equally between the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Inc.
But Ralph Knowles, a co-chairman of the plaintiffs' negotiating committee, said that if the companies backed out the settlement would probably collapse. "If any defendant walks away, we the plaintiff's settlement committee, can say, 'This is so significant that we are cratering the deal,' " Mr. Knowles said.
John McGoldrick, the chief negotiator for Bristol Meyers-Squibb, said that all or nearly all of the company's contribution would be paid by insurance.
 
Two Years of Negotiations
 The agreement culminates two years of negotiations between lawyers for women who had implants and the companies that made them. In that time, Mr. Knowles said, the lawyers gathered more than three million documents and more than 100 videotaped depositions.
Stanley Chesley, the other co-chairman of the plaintiffs' negotiating committee, said, "The plaintiffs are an army of lawyers completely armed with phenomenal documents and depositions and materials necessary to be successful in a courtroom." And, he added, that preparation for lawsuits "was an effective deterrent" to the companies, nudging them toward a settlement.
Mr. Anderson of Dow Corning, disagreed. "I certainly won't deny that they have an army of litigators out there," he said. "But we feel we have developed a strong defense." He said Dow has won 7 of its last 11 cases.
In September, Dow Corning announced that the companies and the lawyers for the women had reached an agreement in principle to settle the class-action lawsuit for $4.75 billion, but it took six months of further negotiation for the parties to come to a final agreement on a document spelling out the payments, terms and conditions of the agreement. In the meantime, some of the smaller companies dropped out or are still negotiating.
Some say that $3.7 billion is not enough.
"It can't possibly be enough," said Alan Morrison, a lawyer with Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington. He said that even the original $4.75 billion is not enough because the payouts are so expensive and so many women have been injured.
Sal Liccardo, a lawyer in San Jose, Calif., who represents women with breast implants, said that even if there was enough money in the fund, the amounts that women with severe injuries would receive are inadequate.
One of his clients, he said, is 43 years old and "in constant pain and in constant need of medical care." It will take more than $3 million to care for her for the rest of her life, he added.
Mr. Liccardo also said that women "with good cases" tend to get more by suing than they would get in the settlement. A woman in Texas who had lupus, for example was recently awarded $6 million, he said.
LeRoy Hersh, a member of the plaintiffs' negotiating committee, said that while some women might want to take their chances in a courtroom, others have no choice but to join the class action if they want any compensation. These include women whose implants were made by companies that have gone bankrupt and women who do not know who made their implants.
In addition, Mr. Hersh said, there is a huge advantage to joining the settlement: women do not have to prove that their injuries were caused by the implants.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Ease Rights Goals With Beijing

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, in an effort to resolve the crisis in relations with China, has been quietly signaling Beijing that if it met Washington's minimum human rights demands, the United States would consider ending the annual threat of trade sanctions to change Chinese behavior.
Administration officials said today that there was already a consensus within President Clinton's economic team, which is now spreading to the White House and even parts of the State Department, that the annual rite of threatening China with a withdrawal of its beneficial trade status if it does not meet certain human rights conditions is outmoded and should be replaced. 
 That sentiment, which has been conveyed to China by the Administration, also seems to be taking hold on Capitol Hill, from which the pressure to link human rights and trade originally came.
 
Threat of Trade Sanctions
 The United States has for years used the threat of trade sanctions to promote free immigration and human rights in Communist countries, from the former Soviet Union to China. Any move by the Administration and Congress now away from that approach would be a major policy shift, one that reflects the increasing importance of trade to the American economy.
"I think that today, the Congressional mainstream would still want to maintain some linkage between trade and human rights, but the drift is toward delinkage," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "It is impossible to improve the relationship if you have to go through this fight every year."
He added that there is "a very strong possibility that the Administration will recommend, and the Congress will adopt, the use of other tools" besides trade sanctions to promote American human rights concerns provided that China meets President Clinton's basic human rights demands laid out in an executive order last June.
Administration officials are increasingly arguing that the current policy is outmoded because, as the President has told aides and lawmakers in recent days, the last thing Mr. Clinton wants to do is withdraw China's trade benefits, which would costs thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars in contracts. So in some ways the policy rests on an empty threat.
It is also outmoded, other officials argue, because trade is now such an important instrument for opening up Chinese society, for promoting the rule of law and the freedom of movement there, and for encouraging the Chinese authorities to allow citizens to own everything from their own satellite dishes to foreign newspapers, that revoking it would be self-destructive for both sides.
Finally, American policy toward China is only effective if there is a united front, and that united front has broken down as more Americans do business in China and refuse to see their economic interests imperiled by making them a weapon for pressing human rights concerns.
Administration officials say that in dropping the threat of trade sanctions, they would continue to press China in other ways -- from diplomatic censure to holding up World Bank loans.
 
Conditions for China
 Last May the President signed an order, which many in the Administration now regret, stipulating the precise steps that China must take to win renewal of its trade benefits, which allow it to send its imports to the United States at the lowest available tariff.
The President has told lawmakers and aides that while he would do all that he could to avoid having to withdraw trade benefits from Beijing, he feels politically, morally and legally bound to fulfill the basic terms of that executive order.
One senior official said, "We have told the Chinese, 'Get us over the executive order, and we will consider all kinds of alternatives.' "
The Administration's intent, officials say, is both to offer an inducement for China to cooperate, but at the same time to signal hard-liners in the Chinese leadership that they cannot get by with just doing nothing.
Administration officials said that they believed last May that they had to adopt the executive order because Mr. Clinton, during the campaign, had strongly criticized President Bush for "coddling" China and he did not want to appear to be going back on another campaign promise. They also did it out of a fear that Congressional Democrats might otherwise have forced an even more stringent approach on them through legislation.
The order calls for China to begin putting into effect an agreement made two months ago to end its practice of using prison labor to make products exported to the United States, and to fully comply with American demands to allow a list of Chinese dissidents and their families to leave the country.
 
Visit to Prison
 The Chinese have told the United States they are prepared to deal with most of the immigration cases and have already allowed one visit by a team of American inspectors to a suspected prison labor camp. The Administration feels that China is thus at least getting close to satisfying its demands on these points.
In addition, the President's order calls for "overall significant progress" in China's handling of and accounting for political prisoners, relations with Tibet, and the jamming of foreign radio programs. The Administration has always been prepared to interpret that progress loosely, but officials say that Beijing, while it has been inching in the right direction, has not yet given them even the bare minimum they need to convince Congress on these points.
Therefore, the Administration's China policy between now and June is to redouble efforts to persuade Beijing to take the last few steps. This is going to be done primarily through quiet diplomatic channels, and not high-profile visits -- in light of the confrontation that erupted during Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent tour.
 
Views of Economic Official
 There has been much wrangling over the Administration's China policy in recent days. At a White House meeting on Monday, members of the Clinton economic team -- particularly Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen -- said they wanted to see more frequent meetings by all the principal policy makers on China to insure that the views of the economic officials of the Administration were being fully taken into account.
The economic aides said they were not troubled by Mr. Christopher pressing the human rights issue, but said that on his recent visit to China he or some of his aides seemed to be doing it in a confrontational manner that was encouraging Beijing to dig in its heels.
Secretary Christopher, backed by the President's National Security Adviser, Anthony Lake, asked that Mr. Clinton issue a public statement reaffirming his commitment to the executive order and the general approach to China being carried out by the Secretary of State.

Administration Takes Fed's Action in Stride

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials refrained from criticizing the Federal Reserve today, even as big commercial banks began raising their prime lending rates slightly late this afternoon to follow the central bank's decision on Tuesday to nudge up short-term interest rates.
Gene Sperling, a senior official on the President's National Economic Council, said tonight of the prime rate increase, "This was a predictable consequence of yesterday's Fed action, and it is not inconsistent with our view that economic growth is strong and inflation is under control." 
 Joan Logue-Kinder, the chief Treasury Department spokeswoman , said: "I don't think you're going to find us in an adversarial position with the Fed over this. You know that when the Fed raises rates that the banks are eventually going to raise rates."
 
Hope for a Closer Connection
 While jogging this morning, before a number of big banks raised their prime rates to 6 1/4 percent from 6 percent, President Clinton expressed satisfaction that the Fed's action on Tuesday had pushed down long-term interest rates by easing concerns about possible inflation. He pointed to the contrast with the Fed's previous increase in overnight rates on Feb. 4, which set off an increase in long-term rates.
"We'll just have to hope that there's a more -- that there's a closer connection between the two actions this time than there was last time," the President said.
Higher short-term interest rates slow the economy and discourage bank lending to commodities speculators, holding down inflation. Expectations of future inflation are the main influence on the movement of long-term interest rates, because investors are reluctant to lend money for long periods of time if they think they will be repaid in devalued dollars.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.84 percent from 6.95 percent on Tuesday, after the Fed acted, although it edged back up today to 6.89 percent.
In general, both short- and long-term interest rates seemed to be a low priority for senior Administration officials today, who had already moved on to other issues like trade relations with China. "We haven't talked about it today," one official said.
Compared with previous Administrations, this Administration has placed an unusual emphasis on long-term interest rates. This emphasis partly reflects economic theory, in that long-term rates strongly influence investment levels. But the emphasis also reflects political self-interest, to the extent that long-term rates may influence the economy's health and the President's re-election prospects in 1996.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and other senior Administration officials were quick to cite a steep decline in long-term rates last summer as evidence that the President's budget package had been welcomed by financial markets. They have been much less outspoken as long-term interest rates have retraced much of that decline this winter.
To some extent, the Administration's silence reflects a sense that little can be done to change the Fed's mind. The Treasury Department's proposal for the consolidation of bank regulatory agencies, taking away much of the Fed's role in bank supervision, has been temporarily stalled as Congressional banking committees focused on President Clinton's links to a failed Arkansas savings and loan in the Whitewater affair.
 
 
'What Are We Doing to Do?'
 Proposals to force the Fed to disclose more information more quickly are also languishing in Congress. And public White House criticisms of the Fed has tended to undermine the financial markets' confidence in the central bank's independence and push up the long-term interest rates that are most important to the Administration.
Administration officials acknowledge their limited influence. "What are we going to do, rescind it?" one official asked today.
Many members of Congress remain unhappy with the Fed's move on Tuesday. "The Federal Reserve is clearly in need of a reality check," said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee. "Don't they know that the average rate of inflation is the lowest since the 1960's?"

HEADLINE: 2 Years, 10 Murders and 1 Question

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 22

 BODY:
In a kinder world, 10 black women would not have been strangled to death over the last two years in this shiny Piedmont boom town. In a simpler world, there would be a clear lesson about race and police neglect in the belated recognition that one man may have been behind it all.
But in the real world, more than a week after an arrest in the worst killing spree in Charlotte's history, nothing is quite so clear. 
 Despite allegations that it was only the race of the victims that allowed their killer to remain at large for so long, most black officials and community leaders here deny those assertions and say that trying to put a simple overlay of race on the killing spree does more harm than good.
Whether that says more about Charlotte or about the lessons of race beyond the civil rights era is hard to say.
 
No 'Outraged Reaction'
 "The easy way to look at this is, it's racial," said Harvey Gantt, a Democrat who became Charlotte's first black Mayor in 1983 and ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate against Jesse Helms in 1990. "But I don't see any evidence that would suggest that. I talk to people, both black and white, and I don't see the outraged reaction."
Charlotte, with one leg in its Piedmont past and the other in its status as one of the nation's most prosperous cities, was turned upside down last week after a 28-year-old fast-food worker, Henry Louis Wallace, was arrested and charged with strangling 10 black women over the last two years. Mr. Wallace, who is black, has been charged with an 11th murder in South Carolina, and other investigations are pending.
Much of the city's reaction to the slayings -- the horror that they happened, the defense of the police -- reflects the split personality of a place that likes to think it has both the small-town virtues of its past and the big-time aspirations of the present.
Charlotte is an intensely image-conscious city that has always prided itself on its reputation for racial amity, and what stung as much as the killings were allegations that only the victims' race kept the police from realizing sooner that a serial killer was at work.
 
'They Deserved More Attention'
 The argument was made most forcefully by Kelly Alexander, executive director of the North Carolina chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Dee Sumpter, whose 20-year-old daughter, Shawna Hawk, was found strangled in a bathtub on Feb. 19, 1993. The police say she was Mr. Wallace's second victim.
"All the victims were African-American women," Mrs. Sumpter said. "When you look at the races of all the individuals, one can only draw the conclusion that race played a part in how the investigation was handled. They may have been black. They may not have been rich. But they deserved more attention than it seems the Charlotte P.D. gave them."
The Acting Police Chief, Jack Boger, who has strenuously defended the Charlotte Police Department, has acknowledged that the killing of whites, particularly affluent whites, gets a lot more attention in the news media and the community as a whole -- here and elsewhere -- than the killings of less affluent blacks.
But he contends that because the crimes occurred over a long period of time in different parts of the city, and because the earliest slayings seemed to have little in common, there was nothing to alert the police to the possibility of a serial killer until four slayings this month suggested a pattern. At that point an arrest was made within three days, he said.
Statistics indicate that crimes against blacks and whites are cleared at comparable rates.
"I have reviewed the work in this case step by step from 22 months until now," said Don Steger, the Assistant City Manager who oversees the police, "and I cannot see any place where I would have to say to the chief of detectives, 'You flubbed it.' "
He added: "You had a killer who was very particular about covering his tracks. As a black man, I can say there is no evidence to support the notion that any kind of bias was seen in this case."
Alphonso Slaughter, whose daughter, Debra Ann, is believed to have been Mr. Wallace's next to last victim, agreed. "Once they were able to connect this guy to the crimes, they had 50 officers knocking on every door," Mr. Slaughter said. "I fault the overall system that makes it hard sometimes to arrest these people, but I don't fault the police."
 
Black Legislators Criticized
 In this regard, he sounds much like Mayor Richard Vinroot, a Republican who is white, and who complained that black legislators in Raleigh defeated a proposal to provide funds intended to allow law-enforcement officers to target people who repeatedly commit violent crimes, saying it sounded like an effort to target black men.
"Maybe if we had those funds we'd have gotten this guy a year ago," Mr. Vinroot said.
The muted reaction to the allegations against the police partly reflects the degree to which Charlotte has had a relatively amicable racial climate, and now has a prosperous economy. With an unemployment rate of less than 4 percent, Charlotte has avoided some of the economic frustrations that lead to racial problems. It also has a boosterish political culture -- some say too boosterish -- that prizes consensus and frowns on conflict.
 
Crime as an Organizing Focus
 But the reaction also reflects the degree to which crime has replaced civil rights as an organizing focus for Charlotte's black residents. There are at least three different anti-crime groups here, and organizers say criminal justice issues can no longer be depicted simply as black versus white.
"What angers me the most is that the black folks who are accusing the police of letting race play a part in this investigation haven't said a word about all the other black murder victims in this city," said the Rev. James Barnett, director of the Stop the Killing Crusade. "The only time you ever hear from some black people is when they're blaming whites for something."
That is not to say that race is not an issue in Charlotte, which is struggling in numerous ways with the cost of growth, ranging from drugs to traffic. Indeed, race and crime have been linked in several recent incidents in which blacks have accused the police of brutality.
"We've got a hell of a lot of problems to solve on the racial side," Mr. Gantt said. "But at least we're able to talk about them here. And I think most people realize they require different tactics than, say, fighting the more simple battle of illegal segregation years ago did."

Prices of Bonds Tumble Amid Investor Concerns

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed bond market expectations and officially moved its new short-term interest rate target up a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.50 percent.
The Fed announced its intention to raise its target for Federal funds, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, on Tuesday after the meeting of its policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. 
 But after early gains when the Fed formally confirmed the increase in its target, bond prices slid in the afternoon amid investor uncertainty about the economy and the timing of the next interest rate rise by the Fed.
The market fell under further pressure near its close when several banks, led by Chemical and Chase raised their prime lending rates a quarter of a percentage point, to 6 1/4 percent. By the close of the New York cash market the long bond had given up nearly half of the gains achieved the previous day.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 20/32 , to 9130/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.89 percent, up from 6.84 percent Tuesday.
 
Short-Term Securities Rates
 But the rates on short-term securities continued to fall, indicating that the recent selloff may have gone a lot further than it had to. In addition, some investors appeared to be moving out of longer-term securities, whose prices are much more volatile, to the relative calm of shorter-term investments.
The rate for a three-month bill fell 5 basis points, to 3.45 percent, while the six-month rate fell 2 basis points, to 3.77 percent.
Traders said now that the Fed had fulfilled market expectations and raised interest rates again, investors were more apt to buy securities and Treasuries would probably stabilize. The Fed raised its interest rates target for the first time in five years on Feb. 4 but a selloff in the bond market followed, in part because traders were worried that the Fed had not raised short-term interest rates enough.
Fed watchers at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company said there was no doubt that the central bank confirmed the rate increase when it did not add reserves to the banking system. That the Fed has actually announced its intentions in February and again yesterday has set new precedents and also left the market with no uncertainties to fuel speculation.
William Shea, senior vice president at Nikko Securities International Inc.,said, "The market is likely to remain tentative until we reach 4 percent on the Federal funds, which the market believes is what the Fed needs in order to achieve a real level of interest rates."
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading specialist for Chase Securities, thinks that after rallying the day before, investors have begun to wonder how much higher can prices go from these levels. "Have the fundamentals in the market changed?" he asked. "Has anything changed about the economy?"
"Much of the buying after the Fed made its announcement on Tuesday was not a reaction to the Fed tightening as it was to investors covering short positions," Mr. Alexy said. "Many investors are still uncertain about the Fed's next move."
The rise in the prime lending rate will add to the concerns of investors, giving them little reason to buy and limiting the market's upside potential, traders said.
Treasury prices got support early in the day from the report on United States durable goods orders for February, which fell 2.5 percent, or 1 percent excluding the military market. The drop was much larger than the consensus forecast of a dip of six-tenths of 1 percent.
According to economists, there was little in the report that would cause the market to change its view about what the Fed is thinking.
With the last interest rate rise now a day old, traders suspect what the market now needs to know is whether the economy is stronger or weaker than the Fed is betting on.
 
Municipal Bond Market
 In the municipal bond market, analysts said the City of New York saved $90 million when it sold bonds this week. Underwriters repriced part of the city's $1.06 billion general obligation bond issue late Tuesday after the Fed raised interest rates and the market rallied, cutting yields on the issue by as much as five basis points, to 6.30 percent for a bond due in 2023.
The bond offering was the first under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and comes at a time when the city is grappling with a fiscal year 1995 budget deficit of $2.3 billion.
Underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities priced the bonds to yield from 4.45 percent in 1996 to 6.30 percent in 2023.
At yesterday's Treasury auction of $11 billion in five-year notes, the high yield was 5.91 percent, up from 5.61 percent at the Feb. 24 auction and the highest since 6.03 percent on Dec. 23, 1992.
Following are the results of the five-year-note auction yesterday:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.91%
Low Yield . . . 5.76%
Median Yield . . . 5.88%

Chrysler's Luxury-Sedan Sales Lag

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 23

 BODY:
Dealers' inventories of two luxury models of the Chrysler Corporation's LH sedans are running far above average for the automobile industry, an indication that the cars are not selling as fast as the company had hoped.
The cars have piled up on dealers' lots because Chrysler has not offered lease deals that are as attractive as those of its competitors in the luxury market, said Jack Kirnan, an auto industry analyst with Salomon Brothers. 
 But E. Thomas Pappert, Chrysler's vice president for sales, said today that new, subsidized lease offers on those vehicles should reduce inventories to average levels.
Mr. Kirnan released an otherwise laudatory analysis of Chrysler today that called high inventory of LH sedans "the only potential trouble spot for Chrysler in the near term." In an interview, Mr. Kirnan said that the high inventories did not stem from declining popularity for the sedans, which won critical praise for their unusual styling when they were introduced a year ago.
Rather, he said, "people in that segment of the market are leasing, and the leasing tends to be deeply subsidized."
 
Better Lease Deals Due
 Mr. Kirnan said he expected Chrysler to offer better lease deals not only on the two luxury cars, but also on two other LH sedans, the Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision, for which dealer inventories are also above average. He estimated that a subsidized lease program could cost Chrysler up to $100 million in marketing expenses, or about 20 cents a share.
The industry average for dealer inventory was 65 days at the end of January, according to Ward's Automotive Reports. For the two luxury LH cars, the New Yorker and the LHS, inventories average more than 90 days, Mr. Pappert said. Dealer inventories exceeded 70 days for the Concorde and the Vision, Chrysler said.
Mr. Pappert said Chrysler's inventory goal was 65 days. He said that inventory for another LH car, the Dodge Intrepid, was 57 days.
For other Chrysler vehicles, such as the company's hot-selling trucks, dealer inventories are far below average. For example, the inventory of the Jeep Grand Cherokee is 22 days. "I think Jeep is the hottest ticket on the market right now," Mr. Pappert said.
Chrysler in recent years has lagged behind some of its competitors in leasing, in part because a poor debt rating prevented it from offering competitive rates.
Last year Standard & Poor's raised Chrysler's debt rating, increasing the company's flexibility. Still, Chrysler has shown less willingness than some auto makers, most notably the Ford Motor Company, to emphasize leasing.
Mr. Pappert said some companies were gambling on high predictions for the "residual values" of its cars. Monthly lease payments are based on the value the company projects that vehicles will retain when lessors return them at the end of the lease term. By setting that value high, the company can lower the customer's monthly payments, making the deal more attractive.
The danger to the company is that residual values could plummet. "You're playing futures, just as if you were buying hog bellies," Mr. Pappert said.
About 10 percent of Chrysler's retail transactions are leases, while at Ford the proportion of leases is almost 20 percent, according to Mr. Kirnan.

Eddie Antar Signs Over $52 Million

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 23

 BODY:
Faced with an angry Federal judge preparing to sentence him and his brother Mitchell for racketeering and stock fraud, the founder of the Crazy Eddie electronics chain today signed over foreign bank accounts containing $52 million sought by the Government.
Eddie Antar took the stand for the first time since his trial began and signed over the money to a court-appointed trustee. He answered a series of questions from the United States Attorney, occasionally smiling and nodding. 
 Mr. Antar's handcuffs were removed so he could sign the papers, but his leg shackles were not. He shuffled to the witness stand with a deputy United States marshal standing by.
Eddie and Mitchell Antar were convicted in July of pocketing nearly $80 million by selling Crazy Eddie stock, the value of which they artificially increased through inventory inflation and other schemes.
In an attempt to show United States District Judge Nicholas H. Politan that Eddie Antar did not deserve the tough sentence sought by prosecutors, his lawyer, John J. Barry, presented a letter Tuesday in which Mr. Antar agreed to repatriate money he held overseas.
 
'Bait and Switch' Charged
 Judge Politan in 1990 ordered Mr. Antar to return the money, which the Securities and Exchange Commission charged in a separate case that he had obtained through insider trading and transferred to Israel.
Today, the judge erupted when Mr. Barry said Mr. Antar had refused to sign S.E.C. papers specifying the foreign accounts from which the money would be drawn.
"I consider his offer to repatriate the $52 million a bait and switch," the judge said, adding that it reeked of "fraud and deception." He said Mr. Antar remained in contempt of the 1990 order.
"It's all nonsense and garbage," Judge Politan continued. "I have had it. I have the patience of St. Jude. The patience is over with."
Later in the day, Mr. Antar signed the S.E.C. papers, identifying accounts in Israel and Switzerland holding a total of $53 million, slightly more than what the judge ordered repatriated. His lawyers then asked Judge Politan to delay sentencing until the money arrived. The judge then postponed the sentencing of both Eddie and Mitchell Antar until April 15.
The money would go to a court-appointed trustee. It is intended to be turned over to the S.E.C., which obtained a $73 million judgment against Mr. Antar -- grown with interest to $90 million -- for restitution to Crazy Eddie investors.
Eddie Antar, 46, and his brothers Mitchell, 38, and Allen, 44, built Crazy Eddie into the biggest electronics retailer in the New York area in the 1980s. It was known for loud commercials in which a frenzied pitchman boasted of "INSAAAAAAAANE" prices.
Allen Antar was acquitted following the monthlong trial but has attended this week's proceedings, as have more than a dozen members of their extended clan, which have homes in Brooklyn and the New Jersey Shore.
The Government is seeking a 25-year term for Eddie Antar, contending that thousands of investors lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of years of fraud he directed.

HEADLINE: Lehman Bros. Cutting Staff

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers Inc. plans to cut more than 4 percent of its work force and trim other expenses as it prepares to become a public company, company officials say.
While Lehman is considered among Wall Street's leaders, particularly in the bond market, the company must get its costs down to compete with Goldman, Sachs & Company, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Company, all of which have more capital and higher profits. 
 Lehman's costs were higher than its competitors "by a couple of percentage points," said Gordon Luce, a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst.
Lehman is going public because the American Express Company wants to concentrate on its main businesses, which do not include investment banking. American Express said in January that it would spin off Lehman to its shareholders. Some investors said they might sell their Lehman shares when they got them.
Lehman is expected to provide more information about its operations and finances in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission next week.
As many as a third of the 400 job cuts are expected to come from the 1,200 people who provide support to Lehman's 500 brokers for wealthy individuals, company officials said. The remainder are expected to include senior employees, some with $500,000 salaries. The cuts are already under way.
William Shutzer, a managing director who was one of the firm's senior investment bankers, left the firm early this month to join Furman Selz Inc. The chief equity economist, Robert Barbera, also quit.
In addition to cutting costs, Lehman faces the industrywide challenge of maintaining profits at a time when analysts believe Wall Street is unlikely to repeat last year's record earnings of $8.9 billion before taxes.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Grows at Slowest Pace Since '74

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 23

 BODY:
Prospects for Japan's recovery from its worst recession in the postwar era look uncertain after the Government reported on Tuesday that the economy grew last year at its slowest rate in nearly two decades.
With a surge in the value of the yen and a sharp decline in corporate investment, the Japanese economy in 1993 grew only one-tenth of a percent when adjusted for inflation. 
 The almost imperceptible rate of growth in the world's second-largest economy was its worst performance since 1974, when soaring oil prices provoked a global economic upheaval. Although the economy was slightly stronger than many economists had expected in the last three months of 1993, most of them agreed that any rebound was likely to be lackluster.
 
 
'No Signs of an Uptrend Yet'
 "The downward trend is almost over," said Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "We are entering the turnaround phase. The problem is that there are no signs of an uptrend yet."
Mr. Okumura forecasts virtually no growth again this year unless the Government acts forcefully to reinvigorate domestic consumption.
Tsutomu Tanaka, Vice Minister of the Economic Planning Agency, which is generally optimistic in its outlook, said, "As for judging if the bottom has been reached, we cannot make that determination yet."
That is bad news for the Japanese as well as for the country's major trading partners, especially the United States. The faltering economy and weak demand are likely to mean fewer imports, while encouraging manufacturers to seek sales overseas. That combination could exacerbate trade tensions by keeping Japan's immense trade surplus at record levels.
Despite the mounting political tensions, the Government appears to be in no great hurry to jolt the economy out of its two-year-old slump with a heavy dose of new public works spending or tax cuts -- as the Clinton Administration has been urging.
 
 
Jump-Starting the Economy
 The Government has announced three such stimulus packages in the last year, with little measurable impact on growth. But the United States has been pushing both publicly and through diplomatic channels for a substantial new effort to add impetus to Japan's economy and the world's.
The Government said in its report on Tuesday that the economy shrank an inflation-adjusted six-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Many economists had forecast an even steeper drop, but personal consumption, while weak, was not quite as lethargic as anticipated.
The economy began its long slide two years ago, after a plunge in the stock and property markets ended the spectacular boom of the late 1980's, known here as the bubble economy. The bubble had set off a frenzy of corporate investment and a reckless spree of lending by banks and other financing companies. All these problems surfaced when the speculative bubbles burst.
Commercial banks are now burdened with tens of billions of dollars of bad debts. Manufacturers frequently overexpanded their productive capacity, and so have since reduced new investment drastically. There is a huge glut of office space on the commercial real estate market. Unemployment, though still less than 3 percent, is expected to rise steadily.
 
 
Housing and Public Works
 Among the few bright spots are housing construction, helped by what had been record low interest rates during much of 1993, and Government spending on public works projects.
But the Japanese economy faces several stiff challenges. The recent jump in American interest rates has had a predictable impact on Japan, forcing rates sharply higher for the first time in months.
"The question now is not whether we have a recovery this year, but how strong it will be," said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist here with Salomon Brothers Asia. "These high rates can hurt. They are making businessmen very nervous."
Yoshihisa Kitai, a senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank, said on Tuesday: "What you can say is that maybe the Japanese economy has almost reached the bottom. But it is going to be a weak recovery when it comes. That still seems clear, even after being a little surprised by the figures today."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Goes Up vs. the Yen But Loses Against the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday, gaining ground against the Japanese yen but losing against the German mark after the widely expected tightening of American monetary policy.
At its usual intervention time shortly before noon yesterday, the Federal Reserve refrained from adding reserves to the banking system, with Federal funds trading at 3.5 percent, confirming a quarter-point rise in its key overnight lending rate. 
 On Tuesday, the Fed announced that it would increase pressure on bank reserves, but the extent of the credit-tightening move was left unclear until yesterday.
Traders said the rise in short-term interest rates seemed to have been fully discounted and therefore had little influence on the dollar's direction.
"One might have thought that with interest rates moving in the dollar's favor it would have soared, but the market seems to have gotten ahead of itself," said Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager at the Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank.
 
Dollar Should Benefit
Normally, rising American rates benefit the dollar by increasing the return on dollar-denominated securities. A late flurry of prime rate increases by American banks yesterday also had little impact on the market.
Adding to the dollar's troubles were worries of surging German monetary growth, a development that might slow the pace of European interest rate reductions.
The Bundesbank is expected to trim its official rates soon, but speculation of a sharp rise in the main measure of the German money supply caused the dollar to slip against the mark.
"The market seems to be more dependent on Germany cutting rates than on the States raising them," said Richard Ash, a trader at Commerzbank.
The dollar finished little changed against the yen, as continuing tensions on the Korean peninsula provided the dollar with a base of support.
In late New York trading, the dollar finished at 1.6800 German marks, down from 1.6868 marks on Tuesday. But it rose to 106.33 Japanese yen from 106.05 yen.
Gold prices slipped. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, the active April gold futures contract dropped $2.30, to $387.40 an ounce.
The British pound rose to $1.4980 in late New York trading, from $1.4875 Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4275 Swiss francs, virtually unchanged from 1.4277; $1.3643 (Canadian), off slightly from $1.3675, and 1,663 Italian lire, little changed from 1,668.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Selling a city to the people who live there: The Baltimore of tourists looks homeward and inward.

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky 

 BODY:
AROUND 5 P.M. in most American cities, the traffic generally flows one way. Working-class people head home to the suburbs, where life is presumably safer, parking is abundant and diversions are plentiful.
Which is fine, except for the disconcerting notion that without people,cities decay. Stores and restaurants close. Civic projects die. Empty streets loom dark and dangerous. 
 Thanks to 15 years of urban revitalization, Baltimore has not jeopardized the vast redevelopment that has seeded its downtown landscape with shopping pavilions, museums, a national aquarium, a light rail system, new hotels, scores of restaurants, refurbished housing and a baseball stadium. A $160 million science research and educational center is under construction.
But somewhere along the way, downtown Baltimore lost touch with Baltimoreans. Redevelopment had made the city a tourist destination for others, but not necessarily a magnet for the locals beyond their initial curiosity.
To prevent this trend from getting worse, a civic group of public and private interests called the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore is embarking on a large-scale marketing effort, buoyed by an advertising campaign beginning next month that has enlisted nearly every major media outlet in the city.
In the name of civic pride and spirit, the three television network affiliates, the two independent channels, the largest radio stations, Baltimore's dominant daily newspapers and several weeklies have agreed to provide free time and space to advertise the city for the city to the city.
Jim Dale, the chairman and chief executive of W. B. Doner & Company, the advertising agency coordinating the campaign on a pro bono basis, said the free exposure could be worth $500,000 or more.
By agreement with the electronic outlets, for every spot paid for, the station will donate the same amount of time for another. The Baltimore Sun, the city's principal newspaper, has agreed to provide news listings, two tabloid pullout sections and about $60,000 worth of advertising at a reduced rate.
"They have done so much to rejuvenate the city," said Mark Distler, general sales manager for the NBC affiliate, WMAR-TV. "The idea to promote the city, to get people to come down, was a no-brainer."
The advertising campaign is being built around a program host who will appear in a talk show format at places around town to extol their virtues. The host, Mark Sarien, a 26-year-old men's clothing salesman, won the job this week through an open audition that attracted hundreds of would-be commercial stars.
He has no experience as a television personality, but polish was not so much a requirement as enthusiasm and civic-mindedness. Unabashed boosterism is central to the campaign.
If it all sounds a little hokey, maybe it is. But an advertising campaign selling a city to the people who live there can be an effective tool against the kind of urban rot that undermines municipal efforts at a time that the Federal Government has left states and cities substantially on their own against violence, drug abuse and other civic ills.
Other cities, including Buffalo, Philadelphia and Indianapolis, have initiated similar programs, but have not received the kind of media support Baltimore has generated. New York City has 26 Business Improvement District organizations, with individual budgets and promotional approaches. But none, said Gretchen Dykstra of the Times Square district, with a current campaign of $77,000, has gotten free exposure to help the cause.
"The notion of doing something like this is not particularly new," Richard Bradley, president of the International Downtown Association in Washington, said, referring to Baltimore's efforts. "What is significant is the level at which they have gotten support."
Mr. Bradley said Baltimore had stayed ahead of the curve among cities promoting themselves, largely because it had enough attractions to withstand questions of truth in advertising. Some cities, he said, advertise too much, people investigate and then go home disappointed, seldom to return.
"Several years ago, we were hearing increasing concerns from businesses about the downtown area," said Laurie Schwartz, president of the Downtown Partnership in Baltimore. "Our first step was to focus on safety."
That resulted in the city's hiring of 60 security personnel for the downtown area, paid for through a property tax surcharge, and it led to the second step, developing the promotional campaign with advertising support.
"Addressing those first concerns polished the city," Ms. Schwartz said. "Now it's time to sell the product."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Some relatively obscure business schools shine in a new study.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
LOOKING for a business school that really delivers the bacon? Consider Stanford, Harvard, Wharton or Oklahoma State.
That's right: Oklahoma State. A new study (by a pair of Ivy League economists, no less) offers the first ranking of M.B.A. programs that in the authors' words "does not use subjective responses from various constituent groups." And while the very top of their list looks like the top of everyone else's, a half-dozen relative unknowns end up in the top 20, ahead of some brand-name schools, including Yale, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia, Carnegie-Mellon, New York University and Cornell. 
 According to Joseph Tracy of Columbia and Joel Waldfogel of Yale, survey-based rankings (such as those published in Business Week and U.S. News & World Report) may be biased by the fact that the high-profile schools have their pick of the most talented students, who in turn go on to get the best jobs. What ought to count, they argue in a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, is the "value added" by the degree -- how much more graduates earn than would otherwise be expected from their pre-program qualifications. "This is a very serious matter for students who put their careers and tuition money on the line," Mr. Tracy said.
There are no major surprises in the list of schools that deliver the most lucrative jobs to freshly certified masters of business administration. Even after adjusting graduate salaries for differences in the mix of specialties, Stanford, Harvard and Wharton came out on top in the two economists' list -- not very different from their overall ranking of M.B.A. program quality in the U.S. News survey published last week.
Just what this proves, however, is not clear. The Tracy-Waldvogel team measured the quality of entering classes for each school by an index that includes undergraduate grades, business board scores, work experience and other graduate degrees. The highly rated schools got the best students, suggesting that M.B.A. programs may largely play the role of pre-sorting the smartest and most ambitious for corporate recruiters.
A more significant indicator of program quality, the two economists argue, is average starting salaries measured against an objective benchmark of average student quality -- or, in the language of economics, the "residual" in first-job earnings that cannot be explained by attributes of the students before they pay their tuition.
The top seven schools by this criteria (In order: Stanford, Harvard, Chicago, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Northwestern, Michigan) is a yawn, though some might blink at the prominence of the University of Virginia, which is 13th on this year's U.S. News survey. Thereafter, however, the rankings are sure to shock. Oklahoma State, New Mexico, Wake Forest and Brigham Young occupy slots 8 through 11. And a number of other dark horses round out the top 20: Tennessee (14), Southern Methodist (15) and Oklahoma (18).
What's going on here? One possibility is that the admissions officers at well-ranked schools know something the two economists do not -- in particular, difficult-to-measure qualities of applicants that will make them especially good breadwinners.
That's largely why John Bishop of Cornell is "skeptical of this sort of the model." It is plausible, for example, that a private, high-tuition school like Southern Methodist may admit disproportionate numbers who later get good jobs by virtue of family connections.
Another possibility is that highly ranked, lesser- known business schools specialize in regional job markets, effectively isolating their graduates from competition with M.B.A.'s from equally good programs in other parts of the country. The presence on the list of Brigham Young, a Mormon university, as well as both the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, in the heart of oil and gas country, may support this interpretation.
It also meshes with the Tracy-Waldfogel finding that the most important factor by far in predicting a school's "value added" in terms of starting salaries is the number of alumni who are chief executives of major employers.
Regional business schools may not have the alumni clout of, say, Harvard or Stanford. But a handful of strategically placed graduates may still create networks that yield better-than-average jobs for average M.B.A.'s. The economists note that if Harvard is eliminated from the sample of schools (because such a high proportion of corporate chief executives are Harvard grads), the presence of one extra alumnus at the helm of a Business Week 1000 corporation adds an average of $700 annually to the average salary of a newly minted M.B.A.
Of course, the most straightforward interpretation may still be the most reasonable: Some very solid business schools do not play the publicity game very well and are thus ranked below their real capacities. "We don't pretend to be Harvard," said Greg Mosier, associate dean of the business school at Oklahoma State. "But we think we do a really good job serving our market."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
After American Dream, Waking Up Cranky

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR 

 BODY:
Headlines tell of job extinction becoming a familiar way of life in this country. Sociologists speak of the spreading pain of unmet expectations. Pundits examine the declining prospects for social mobility.
And prime-time television rushes to make movies about weepy figure skaters and children murdering their parents. O.K., that's unfair. The social and economic unease that drizzles over much of the nation does make itself felt in television entertainment but, more often than not, in the damnedest ways. 
 There's the simple escape route taken in series like ABC's "Byrds of Paradise" or CBS's "Road Home." There's the goofy yet unsettling comic twist of CBS's "Tom," in which the traditional American dream of building a family home ends up literally next to the city garbage dump. And then there are the surprisingly bitter doses of reality that can pop out of blue-collar sitcoms like ABC's "Roseanne" or NBC's "John Larroquette Show." In the topsy-turvy world of prime time, it's the sitcom that tackles the anything-but-funny phenomena of abandoned infants and the impoverished elderly.
A solution to your problems in urban America? Simple, if you're white, middle-class and adventurous. Pack up the family and move someplace else. After his wife is shot in a holdup in New Haven, Sam Byrd (Timothy Busfield), a Yale philosophy professor, moves with his three children to Hawaii where, thanks to his job as headmaster at a private school, they can all live in a beautiful home with two devoted servants. Paradise, indeed. There may be a problem or two with some of the locals who resent outsiders, but nothing to threaten the hula lessons.
In "The Road Home," Alison and Jack Matson (Karen Allen and Terence Knox) have long been spending summer vacations at her family's place on the North Carolina coast. But Dad's shrimp-boat business is in trouble and Mom shows early signs of Alzheimer's disease. There's only one thing to do. Alison and Jack, a schoolteacher, and their four children decide to stay for the rest of the summer, and no doubt longer.
Problems, yes, but life is gloriously simple again. Grandma speaks in samplerese: "To plant for seasons, plant flowers; to plant for eternity, plant children." Civilized discourse is learned at the dinner table. The children stop watching television. People have music in the soul. "The way they walk down the street," Alison observes dreamily, "it's a melody, a rhythm." The fantasy will not be terribly relevant for a teacher friend of mine who works at an inner-city grade school with children who are given little else to do in their cramped apartments but watch television. For them, inheritors of the urban future, the comfortingly safe world of this North Carolina might just as well be on another planet.
"Roseanne," of course, has long been rooted in blue-collar realities, ranging from sudden unemployment to desperate maneuvering for a bank loan. A line practically thrown away suddenly turns out to have a double edge. On Tuesday, while cooing over a possibly limitless future for sister Jackie's out-of-wedlock new baby, Roseanne purred to husband Dan (John Goodman), "Remember when we used to have hopes for our own kids?"
Dan was himself preoccupied with finding $400 to lend to his distraught mother because his dad had skipped an alimony payment. In a scene with Dad (Ned Beatty), Dan bitterly reminded him of his obligations, most of which he had managed to ignore while stumbling through his salesman's life. In an emotional crunch, "Roseanne" hangs tough. A lesbian kiss is a mere distraction.
Shifting of emotional gears is nowhere more dazzling in prime time than on "The John Larroquette Show," broadcast in double episodes on Tuesdays from 9 to 10 P.M. The setting is a St. Louis bus terminal packed with odd regulars and odder transients. John Hemingway (Mr. Larroquette), a recovering alcoholic, has taken a job as night manager in an effort to put his life in order. The show can go from stinging one-liners to suddenly touching moments, as when John ended up dancing tenderly in the empty terminal with his assistant, Mahalia (Liz Torres), who had been stood up for a date.
John constantly snipes with Dexter, the young snack-bar operator played by Daryl (Chill) Mitchell, who detects a racial slur in John's every comment. This week they managed to wind up sharing a cheap motel bed with live chickens while watching "A Streetcar Named Desire" on television. Whatever happened, Dexter wondered, to the 1960's and all those liberal promises for a better, more tolerant world? Replied John, shrugging, "Probably just got high and forgot them."
Back at the bus station, an infant was found in a nearby Dumpster, not for the first time. Police Officer Eggers (Elizabeth Berridge), who tends to equate most people with cockroaches, suddenly decided that she would keep the child "nobody wants anyway." John eventually talked her out of being rash, but not before she warned him that even if the baby's mother were found, "next time she'll throw him off an overpass." This offbeat show can veer suddenly into netherworlds like alcoholism and violence. The upshot, bursting through the wisecracks, is often chilling.
But even the seemingly easy laughs on television these days reflect a kind of uneasy resignation or weariness. In "Tom," the title character (Tom Arnold) wonders why his wife, Dorothy (Alison LaPlaca), wants to go to college: "Just takes you four years longer to get the same dead-end job." Their American dream perched next to the town dump is distressingly fragile. Most viewers will probably go along with Dorothy: "Just promise me that someday we've got to wake up."

HEADLINE: ASSASSINATION IN MEXICO;
LEADERS IN MEXICO BEGIN THEIR SEARCH FOR NEW CANDIDATE

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 24

 BODY:
Shocked by the murder of the man many assumed would be their next President, Mexicans today mourned the violent death of Luis Donaldo Colosio as the governing party began to choose a new candidate who can keep the party's long hold on power and bind the country's wounds.
Though Mexicans were left stunned and grieving by the assassination on Wednesday evening, there were signs that the contest for the future leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and very likely the country, would begin immediately, and would prove to be divisive and contentious. 
 No one emerged today as a consensus candidate, but it was clear that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari would make the choice personally, as he did in Mr. Colosio's case, after consulting with a coterie of advisers and the leaders of his party, which has 16 million members. What was unclear was how much latitude he would have.
 
Self-Proclaimed Pacifist
 In Tijuana, Government investigators said one assailant had fired both the shots that killed Mr. Colosio, and identified him as Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, a self-proclaimed pacifist who lived and worked in the northern city. No evidence has emerged connecting him with the violent Indian uprising in the south, with drug running or with any other forces for instability in Mexico.
The investigators said Mr. Aburto had confessed to the shooting and said he had bought the gun, a Brasilian-made .38-caliber Taurus, several weeks ago specifically to shoot Mr. Colosio.
The assassination seems to have clouded Mexico's image of itself as a modern, peaceful country that should be considered the equal of established democracies around the world.
"Verbal violence and ideological violence of the kind that has been written and spoken since January are the antecedents of physical violence," said Octavio Paz, the Nobel Prize writer who lives in Mexico City. "That's exactly what we saw with the death of Colosio."
Before his news conference this evening in Washington, President Clinton called President Salinas to offer his condolences and to assure him that the United States believes Mexico's economic and political institutions are "fundamentally strong."
At the news conference, Mr. Clinton said he did "not expect any long-term change" in Mexico. But he directed the Treasury Department "to try to help the Mexicans" if necessary to support the peso if its value begins to plummet in international markets, adding that Washington would make up to $6 billion available in a credit line to help Mexico weather such market jitters.
President Salinas, in selecting a successor to Mr. Colosio, is hemmed in by constitutional constraints that prevent sitting Cabinet members from running for president less than six months after leaving office. The election is scheduled for Aug. 21, less than five months away.
Before the assassination, Mr. Colosio was the front-runner, considered likely to maintain the party's 65-year-old hold on power, to preserve the policies that have led Mexico to invite foreign investment and enter a free-trade pact with the United States and Canada.
 
Stock Market Closed
 Many politicians said Mr. Colosio's successor would also be the front-runner, perhaps getting support because of sympathy and fears of instability. But they said there might also be voter interest in breaking with the past.
In any case, anxiety about investor reaction led President Salinas to close the Mexican stock exchange.
Politicians said Mr. Salinas might try to open up the selection process by proposing legislation to amend the Constitution, enabling a Cabinet member to run. Alternatively, he could have the election postponed for six weeks, which would enable Cabinet members to be considered.
 
Discounting a Rival
 In making his choice, Mr. Salinas needs to find a middle ground between old-line party regulars dismayed by his willingness to push electoral reforms that weaken the party's grip, and reformers angry that he has not pushed hard enough to eliminate fraud.
One obvious replacement, Manuel Camacho Solis, is considered to be too divisive a choice because of his bitter rivalry with Mr. Colosio.
After leaving the funeral home in which Mr. Colosio's body was held today, Mr. Camacho said, "Two days ago, I said I was not looking to be President of the Republic, and after the events that occured in this lamentable act, I repeat what I said: I do not aspire to be President."
Other possibilities include Mr. Colosio's campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, and the party president, Fernando Ortiz Arana.
A party official said it could be several days before the selection is made.
Mr. Colosio's body was flown to Mexico City early this morning from Tijuana, where the 44-year-old candidate was assassinated as he left a campaign stop in a poor neighborhood not far from the United States border.
 
Day of Mourning Ordered
 President Salinas, members of the Cabinet and officials of the Mexican military formed a guard of honor around the coffin as Mr. Colosio lay in state at the national headquarters of the party, known as PRI, its Spanish acronym.
Mr. Salinas called for calm, a call repeated by other Government officials, business leaders and the heads of the opposition political parties.
The Government declared a national day of mourning and ordered all banks and all money-exchanges to close for the day. They and the stock exchange are to reopen Friday.
In downtown Mexico City this morning, hundreds of supporters crowded around PRI headquarters waiting for the entourage that carried Mr. Colosio's body to the seat of the organization he once headed. The blocklong complex of buildings was still adorned with Colosio campaign banners, three and four stories high. A long line of 48 portable toilets had been installed, each bearing a black ribbon.
 
Feelings of Disbelief
 Inside the Plutarco Elias Calles Auditorium, the coffin was displayed on a stage that was almost bare except for the Mexican flag. "I never imagined this could happen in Mexico," said a 34-year-old woman as she waited to enter the hall.
Her feelings of disbelief were echoed by many.
The assassination of Mr. Colosio, the most prominent victim in Mexico since 1928, is just the latest in a string of violent incidents this year that have made modern Mexico look increasingly like the chaotic nation that struggled with both democracy and violence in the revolution that began in 1910.
On Jan. 1 armed Indian rebels in the southern state of Chiapas took over four small towns. More than 100 people died, and although the fighting has stopped, there is no peace accord.
 
Chiapas Violence Spread
 The violence in Chiapas briefly spread to Mexico City and other areas. In dozens of small towns, poor farmers and field workers have taken over municipal buildings or illegally seized land, sometimes leading to violence.
Earlier this month, one of Mexico's richest and most important business executives, Alfredo Harp Helu, was abducted as he was leaving his home in the southern part of Mexico City.
The spate of violence was a backdrop for political uncertainty that Mexicans found hard to believe.
Mr. Salinas's appointment of Mr. Camacho, a former Mayor of Mexico City, as peace negotiator in Chiapas -- after he had passed him over in favor of Mr. Colosio as the PRI's presidential candidate -- made Mr. Camacho a more recognizable and attractive political figure than Mr. Colosio.
Mr. Camacho teased Mexico for months with allusions to a possible run for President until finally, on Tuesday, he announced clearly that he would not run. Today, he repeated that declaration.
 
Uncertainty and Violence
 Pressed by demands for democracy across Mexico, and understanding that it would not only have to win in August but win credibly, PRI and Mr. Colosio agreed to successively more liberal electoral reforms. Just this week, in a special session of Congress, legislators turned the Central Electoral Institute, which oversees the presidential election, over to non-Government control.
Such changes, plus the rivalries among candidates and the extraordinary pressures brought by the uprising in Chiapas, blended to form an atmosphere of uncertainty that made Mexicans feel threatened, whatever their party or view of the future.
Around the PRI headquarters, the sidewalks were crowded with bewildered people, some crying into their cellular telephones, others looking as if they had lost their way.
Oscar Barragan Santos took the opportunity to give away campaign posters that had suddenly been tranformed into memorial placards.
"I came here at 7 this morning as a volunteer citizen to do something," said Mr. Barragan Santos, a leathery man with tattooed arms and silver-rimmed teeth. "It's bad, it's all very bad. Nobody knows what's going to happen. This is going to hurt all Mexicans because the rest of the world will think poorly of Mexico."

Allied-Lyons to Acquire Pedro Domecq Group

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS 

 BODY:
Despite a generally stagnant global market for liquor, Allied-Lyons Inc., already a giant in the industry, agreed yesterday to pay more than $1.1 billion to acquire the Pedro Domecq Group, whose alcoholic beverages sell particularly well in Spain and Latin America.
The deal would make Allied-Lyons, which also owns Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream, the second-largest alcoholic beverages company, after International Distillers and Vintners, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. Guinness P.L.C. would fall to No. 3. The deal is subject to the approval of the European Union. 
 "We are extremely committed to the spirits industry and the agreement substantially strengthens our global market position," said Tony Hales, the chief executive of Allied-Lyons, which is based in London.
 
 
Partners Since 1987
 The two companies have been partners since 1987, when Allied-Lyons bought Hiram Walker & Company, which held a stake in Pedro Domecq. That deal left Allied-Lyons owning more than 30 percent of Pedro Domecq.
Allied-Lyons's brands include Ballantine's Scotch, the company's biggest seller; Canadian Club whiskey; Beefeater gin, and Courvoisier Cognac. Pedro Domecq, based in Madrid, makes Presidente, Don Pedro and Fundador brandies, as well as Sauza tequila.
"This is part of the continuing consolidation of the industry into relatively few hands, with the giants controlling distribution as well as production," said Steven Dixon, an analyst with Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder, a brokerage firm in New York.
At the heart of the deal is Domecq's strong position in Mexico and Latin America.
"In developed markets, spirits sales have been stable at best, but in emerging markets, particularly with premium brands, sales have been stronger," Mr. Dixon said. "As the economies grow, the people there who are doing well want to enjoy the same products that they see people in more developed countries consuming."
 
 
Shares of Allied-Lyons Drop
 After the deal was announced in London, shares of Allied-Lyons fell 8 percent, to 561 pence, or about $8.40, on the London Stock Exchange.
To help finance the deal, Allied-Lyons said it intended to raise 651 million, or approximately $975 million -- about 88 percent of the purchase price of 739 million -- by offering shareholders two new common shares at 490 pence each for every 13 shares held.
"This is a very good deal for Allied-Lyons," Les Pugh, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said. He said he thought the companies' existing involvement helped Allied-Lyons strike a good deal.
Mr. Hales of Allied-Lyons told Reuters: "The logic is about finding a way to grow faster in some of the developing nations. Mexico is a growth market."
Mexico's population of 90 million is expected to grow to more than 105 million by the end of the decade, and about 60 percent of the Mexican population is younger than 30.
 
 
'Expanding Market'
 "As this age group grows to maturity we expect them to constitute an expanding market for leading local and international brands," Mr. Hale said.
Pedro Domecq currently holds 40 percent of the Mexican wine and spirits market, and in the United States sells more than one million cases a year. Its best seller in the United States is Sauza tequila, followed by Presidente and Don Pedro brandies.
The tequila sells to quite a broad market, said Michael Domecq, the president of Domecq Importers, the American subsidiary based in Greenwich, Conn. The brandies, he said, sell principally to the Hispanic market.
Allied-Lyons is not likely to change that approach, because it also produces Courvoisier, the French Cognac.
The sale to Allied-Lyons would settle a dispute among shareholding members of the Domecq family that broke out at Pedro Domecq's annual meeting last June. Several family members complained about low dividends and expressed interest in selling their shares.
Goldman, Sachs & Company was then retained to place a value on the shares, Mr. Domecq said, a process that took months and which led to discussions with Allied-Lyons that began about three months ago.

HEADLINE: Kantor Warns Japan on Trade Offer

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, urged today that Japan be as forthcoming as possible in a proposal that it is about to make to break the trade deadlock with Washington, because otherwise the United States would resort to more punitive sanctions to open Japanese markets.
"We have been encouraging them to come up with as bold and far-reaching a package as possible," Mr. Kantor said in an interview today. "I met with the Japanese press twice this week to convey that view. It cannot be the same old story. Otherwise, we will have disappointment here and a continuation of our approach of ratcheting up the pressure on Japan." 
 Japan's top Government spokesman, Masayoshi Takemura, who is the chief Cabinet secretary, said today that Tokyo was likely to announce by Tuesday a package of measures to satisfy American demands on opening Japanese markets in autos, auto parts, telecommunications, insurance and medical equipment.
 
 
How Low Can Concessions Go?
 In the last few weeks, a succession of Japanese "special envoys," "secret envoys," "personal envoys," "private envoys" and "self-appointed envoys" from the Foreign Ministry, Finance Ministry, Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Parliament have trooped through Washington, American officials said. The Japanese envoys have been trying to gauge what is the minimum that the Clinton Administration will accept to defuse the current trade crisis.
American officials believe that the Japanese are deeply distressed by the current high value of the yen against the dollar, which makes exports from Japan more expensive, and by the nervousness of the Tokyo stock market. The Japanese, these officials say, seem to be preparing to offer something that will be just enough to elicit a mildly positive response from Washington, which would bring down the value of the yen and ease Japanese stock market concerns, but that will not mean deep concessions.
Senior American economic officials say the Japanese believe that at the end of the day President Clinton does not have the stomach for a further confrontation on trade and that he will reach for an olive branch to get out of the current impasse.
The Japanese, these officials said, have long held the view that in negotiations with the United States, Tokyo can engage in commerce, while Washington will always engage in diplomacy. That is, the Japanese focus on economic interests, while the United States can be counted on to worry about the wider aspects of the relationship, like security ties or cooperation over Korea, and therefore will never press a trade dispute to the breaking point.
Think again, Mr. Kantor said today.
If that is Tokyo's view today, he said, the Japanese had better reconsider before they come forward with their unilateral offer.
 President Clinton, Mr. Kantor said, has made "the firm decision" that he will open Japanese markets, either through negotiations, which up to now have failed, "or on a bilateral basis using our trade laws."
If the Japanese produce something "bold," Mr. Kantor said, the Clinton Administration will be ready to resume negotiations. If they come up with something more illusory than real, the United States will resume its efforts to open Japanese markets by relying on the various trade weapons in its arsenal.
American officials said there were a number of United States-Japan trade agreements -- covering wood products, glass, computers and paper -- in which the Japanese appear to be in violation. In each of these areas, the United States market share in Japan has been going down rather than up. In each case, Japanese noncompliance could be met with punitive tariffs on Japanese exports if Japan did not take steps to remedy the situation, the American officials said.
"We could pick any one and begin to react," a senior American trade official said.
 
 
Motorola Pact Was Renegotiated
 It was such a threat that prompted Japan earlier this month to renegotiate its 1989 market-access agreement with Motorola Inc. to insure that the company would have fair access to the Tokyo-Nagoya market.
"We are trying to be measured," Mr. Kantor said, "but we cannot back down because we cannot put the relationship on a profitable basis for both countries unless they open their markets."
"We understand that it is not going to happen all at once, but we have to begin now. It is not a one-way street anymore."
After eight months of negotiations on a framework trade agreement aimed at opening markets, the United States walked away from the table last month, saying the Japanese were not serious. It was that move, and the threat of American sanctions, which prompted Tokyo to try to come up with its unilateral package.

HEADLINE: Petrolina Journal;
Brazil Waters a Desert. The Desert Is Still Smiling.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PETROLINA, Brazil

 BODY:
Arcing 1,690 miles through the dusty heart of Brazil's sun-baked northeast, the Sao Francisco River has often been called Brazil's Nile.
For centuries its waters flowed untapped through Brazil's poorest region, a parched landscape of sun-wizened cowboys, emaciated cattle, thorn bush and cactus. 
 But today, images here are radically different.
Vineyard arbors strain under the weight of ripening grapes. At air- conditioned plants, workers pack boxes of mangoes destined for American supermarkets. At the airport gift shop, businessmen waiting for flights to Sao Paulo inspect bottles of locally produced wines.
 
Another Imperial Valley?
 Transforming the Sao Francisco Valley, public and private investment is turning the area into Latin America's fastest growing region for irrigated agriculture. Last year, vineyards and mango plantations made the region around Petrolina Brazil's largest center for growing tropical fruit for export.
"Robert McNamara came here in 1969 and said this could be the next Imperial Valley," said Fernando Bezerra Coelho, Petrolina's mayor. "Well, it's happening now." He was referring to the former president of the World Bank.
From 7,500 acres of irrigated land 15 years ago, the Petrolina region now has 225,000 acres under irrigation. Fed by pumps and hundreds of miles of canals, total irrigated area in the valley is expected to reach half a million acres next year. And that is only one quarter of potentially irrigable land.
The blooming of Brazil's desert has brought prosperity to Petrolina, a city that still displays a cactus on its municipal flag and leather cowboy chaps in its museum.
Overlooking the Sao Francisco's slow-moving, chocolate-colored waters rise new 10-story buildings, the highest for hundreds of miles around. Tripling in size in 25 years, this city of 225,000 is now the largest population center for Brazil's northeastern uplands.
Clashing with the region's stagnant, dust-bowl image, projects under way here will soon give Petrolina cellular telephone service, 90 percent sewer coverage, a convention center and a shopping center. Arriving by jet from Brasilia, visitors can see the glint of swimming pools and parabolic television antennas scattered across residential neighborhoods.
From a backwater that had no paved road to the outside world until 1970, Petrolina has become a magnet for workers from across the northeast.
The farming formula here is simple -- irrigation water, flat and inexpensive land, and 320 days of sun every year. Lying just 10 degrees south of the Equator, the valley has a rarity -- no seasons. And last year Petrolina received four inches of rain.
"We can produce whenever we want, to fill market windows," said Cesar Coutinho, president of Curaca Agricola, which annually exports millions of crates of mangoes to the United States and Europe. "So, we produce mangoes for the American market when the Mexicans can't -- from September through January."
American producers visited here recently to study the possibility of exporting grapes to the United States during off-seasons and of timing sweet onion crops to place Petrolina produce on American Thanksgiving tables.
"You can't get good grapes in the United States from November to December, and in April," said James Huston, president of Le Choix, a Detroit produce company. "I foresee a tremendous boom here for the windows, the times when you can't get good grapes, mangoes or sweet onions in the U.S."
The major obstacle to growth in the Petrolina area is the slow development of fruit strains, such as a seedless grapes, that are adaptable to Petrolina's hothouse growing conditions. Initially, this was the job of Brazil's federal agricultural research service, Embrapa, which opened a station here 20 years ago. But since 1985, Embrapa has cut its research staff in half.
Here, as elsewhere in Brazil, a virtually bankrupt federal Government has shifted in the 1990's from being a catalyst for growth to a constraint. Dealing with Brazil's 42 percent monthly inflation is child's play compared with coping with a decade of neglect.
A slowdown in hydro-electric dam construction has sent electric bills skyrocketing. Telephone lines are congested and faxes are illegible because the state telephone company has failed to invest. Poorly maintained highways force truckers to travel to coastal ports at 35 miles an hour. Lack of investment in the airport runway and in modernizing a local rail line prevents Petrolina growers from moving fruit by air or rail. In Brazil, all these sectors -- telephones, highways, railroads, airports, and electricity generation -- are state monopolies.
"We have to send someone into the office every night to send computer data to Sao Paulo," said Leandro Ferreira Neto, sales director for LaBrunier. "It's the only time we can get a clean telephone line."
Undaunted by these obstacles, Mr. Coutinho predicted that the region's tropical fruit exports will hit $200 million by the year 2000 -- four times the 1993 level. But despite the big growth in Petrolina, Brazil's fresh fruit exports are still small compared with Chile's. In 1993, Brazil exported $150 million worth of fresh fruit. Chile exported $1.5 billion.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Bolster Forces if U.N. Votes Korea Curbs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The Pentagon plans to strengthen American military forces in South Korea if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions against North Korea, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today.
The United States has already decided to send Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea and to proceed with joint military exercises there because of the North's refusal to allow international monitors to complete inspections of its nuclear sites. 
 But North Korea has responded with threats to attack South Korea if economic sanctions are imposed in retaliation for its stand on the nuclear sites. Today the North Korean Government warned in a radio broadcast that it would view economic sanctions as "a declaration of war against us and will strongly deal with it."
"This will of ours will turn out mightier than the U.S. nuclear weapon," the broadcast said.
 
Concern of U.S. Commanders
 The dominant view within the Clinton Administration is that North Korea is only posturing, to intimidate Washington and its Asian allies from pursuing tough sanctions in the United Nations. But the unpredictable nature of the North Korean Government in Pyongyang and the fact that it has positioned much of its army near the border with South Korea has worried American commanders.
The United States is now working on a proposal for a new Security Council resolution telling North Korea to readmit the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and allow them to complete their work.
But Gen. Gary E. Luck, the senior American commander in South Korea, has planned a series of possible steps to bolster American forces in the area in case the North remains firm, the Council adopts sanctions and tensions rise on the Korean peninsula. Pentagon officials are working on similar options.
"If sanctions at any level are authorized, that will cause us to reconsider increasing our defensive measures in Korea because the North Koreans have clearly stated that they clearly believe that sanctions at any level would be provocative," Mr. Perry said.
 
Degrees of Risk
 Mr. Perry said General Luck and South Korean officials were consulting on potential military steps, and he suggested that they would be calibrated to the toughness of the sanctions.
If the sanctions were modest, making the challenge to North Korea small, only a small increase might be needed in the 37,000 American forces in South Korea, Mr. Perry said.
But if the United Nations adopted tough penalties like an oil embargo, American forces would be facing a greater risk of a North Korean attack, and that would increase the need for reinforcements, he suggested.
Mr. Perry's comments come amid a debate over whether the Administration has been firm enough with North Korea and is taking sufficient steps to guard against an attack.
Some former officials, like Brent Scowcroft, who was the national security adviser to President George Bush, have said that Washington should be vigorously and visibly strengthening its military forces in the region by, for example, moving an aircraft carrier into the region or sending more Air Force warplanes there.
Mr. Scowcroft has argued that such moves would maintain the pressure on North Korea to end its nuclear program, better protect the American forces in the area and preserve the option of launching a pre-emptive attack against North Korea's nuclear sites.
But the Clinton Administration has taken a more cautious and deliberate approach, hoping that Pyongyang may yet respond to the possibility of economic sanctions and diplomatic entreaties to allow inspectors to return to North Korea and complete their work.
In testimony to Congress today, Walter B. Slocombe, the principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for policy, indicated that the Administration had ruled out a pre-emptive strike.
When Representative Ronald V. Dellums, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, argued that stopping North Korea's nuclear program was not worth risking renewed war on the Korean peninsula, Mr. Slocombe sought to reassure him.
 
Seeking Peaceful Solution
 "The rhetoric about war, about cities burning is not coming from the United States," Mr. Slocombe said. "We see no reason why this problem cannot be resolved in a peaceful way which is in the interests of everybody, even the North Koreans. So if there is military action, it will be as a result of decisions taken by North Korea."
Further reflecting the Administration's caution, the White House is sending Patriot missiles by ship rather than by air to avoid creating a sense of crisis and alarming allies in the region. Mr. Slocombe said the battalion would be operating in Korea by the end of April.
"We're trying to strike a balance here where we make it very clear that we'll do anything that's necessary for the defense of the South Koreans and our own forces and so on, but we still prefer to solve this diplomatically," Mr. Slocombe said.

HEADLINE: THE ASSASSINATION IN MEXICO;
Luis Colosio: A Party Man For 2 Decades

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, who rose through Mexican politics as a protege of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and became Mr. Salinas's choice to succeed him, was assassinated Wednesday in Tijuana. He was 44.
Mr. Colosio was the candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym, PRI. After coming from a vigil at the party's Mexico City headquarters, where Mr. Colosio's body was taken yesterday, Mr. Salinas said, "Mexico has lost a great man, and I a great friend." 
 In the presidential campaign, Mr. Colosio faced challengers on the left and right, and his campaign has been complicated since January by the peasant revolt in the southern state of Chiapas, which met with widespread sympathy. It was not immediately clear who would be chosen to replace him as the party's standard bearer in the Aug. 21 election.
Mr. Colosio was born on Feb. 10, 1950, in Magdalena del Kino, a small town in the northern state of Sonora, where his father was an accountant.
 
The Demonstrations of 1968
 In 1968 Mr. Colosio, who then wore his curly hair in an Afro, was one of the thousands of students angered by the Government's suppression of demonstrators in Mexico City. He would later dismiss this episode as an affectation of youth, but in PRI's official biography, he is quoted as saying, "I belong to a generation that is marked by great changes and social movements."
He studied economics at the Technological Institute of Higher Studies in Monterrey, where he stood out for his love of Verdi and a taste for American football. He graduated in 1972 and joined PRI the same year.
Mr. Colosio went to the University of Pennsylvania on a government fellowship, earning a master's degree in regional science in 1977.
In 1979 he joined the Secretariat of Budget and Planning, under Mr. Salinas, who provided him with an entree into the party. In 1985, he was elected as a congressman from Sonora, and he was elected as a senator in 1988.
But a more important milestone may have come in 1987, when he became a member of PRI's national executive. The following year, he worked on the campaign that brought Mr. Salinas the presidency, and was then named to lead PRI, promising to clean up the electoral system.
Like Mr. Salinas, Mr. Colosio sought to balance reform with the dominance of PRI, which has held power since 1929.
 
Status Restored
 Mr. Colosio was tarred by accusations that Mr. Salinas had won only through vote fraud. But he restored much of his luster in 1991 by guiding PRI to a sweeping victory in congressional elections.
In 1992, Mr. Salinas named Mr. Colosio the Secretary of Social Development. This put him in charge of the National Solidarity Program, a vast antipoverty program aimed at alleviating the effects of the Government's market-oriented economic changes.
The new post also put Mr. Colosio in charge of environmental programs, and during last year's campaign for the North American Free Trade Agreement he helped reassure United States lawmakers that Mexico would step up enforcement of environmental laws.
Despite his close association with Mr. Salinas, Mr. Colosio had to fight for the candidacy against Manuel Camacho Solis, then Mayor of Mexico City.
In accepting the nomination, he said, "Wide-ranging social reform is Mexico's challenge for the rest of the century." Yet he appeared unsure how to respond when rebels in the south demanded just such reform. Mr. Camacho, named as Government negotiaor with the rebels, quickly stole the spotlight and was talked about as an independent candidate until Tuesday, when he said he would not run.
Mr. Colosio is survived by his wife, Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio, and two children, Luis Donaldo and Mariana.

HEADLINE: Fears Send Markets Plunging

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Only two days after the Federal Reserve moved to calm the financial markets, they were thrown into turmoil yesterday by a jarring confluence of global troubles. Only gold, often the last refuge of investors fleeing other markets, rose sharply.
The stock, bond and dollar markets all fell yesterday on a run of bad news or tenacious anxieties. These ranged from the assassination of Mexico's leading presidential candidate, worries that the Whitewater affair may damage the Clinton Administration and a drop in European stock and bond markets, which in turn hurt American stocks and bonds later in the day. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.37 points, or 1.25 percent, to 3,821.09, and the more broadly representative Standard & Poor's 500 declined 4.19 points, to 464.35, a drop of 0.89 percent. The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.95 percent, from 6.89 on Wednesday. [Page D5.]
 
 
No Trading in Mexico
 Moreover, the selling could continue today, particularly in Mexico, where financial markets were closed yesterday for a day of mourning. Trading of Mexican securities was also delayed in the United States at the request of Mexican authorities. But the delay did little to stem big declines in prices of Mexican issues.
Mindful that markets in Mexico are likely to be battered, the United States will provide Mexico dollars to buy pesos and support the value of the currency. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made $6 billion available, jointly pledging "continued strong U.S. support for Mexico's economic policies." The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta is not expected to change Mexico's commitment to economic reform, or to the North American Free Trade Agreement. [Page D5.]
In the United States, large international investment funds that have borrowed heavily to speculate in Mexico and other global markets may be tempted to sell stocks, bonds and currencies -- if they are not already doing so -- as the March 31 end of the first quarter approaches.
Such large sales would lock in profits and make the funds look good to investors, but the selling could cause more price declines in the markets.
 
 
Concern About Fed's Action
 While some of these difficulties may pass, what market professionals regard as a more fundamental problem persists: a mysteriously powerful American economy that refuses to be tamed by what some traders fear was a lukewarm action Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Board, which raised its short-term interest rate target for the second time this year.
 If the Fed's quarter-point increase, to 3 1/2 percent, does not slow economic growth further, the modest current level of inflation, and future interest rates, may flare dangerously high. That would throttle business expansion and hurt consumers by raising the cost of borrowing for everything from cars to homes.
The only thing that may bring peace to the markets is unassailable data that the economy and inflation have not surged, evidence that may not be available for months.
Raymond L. Hines, editor of The Wall Street Generalist, an investment newsletter, estimates that 1.4 billion shares of stock have been sold short, meaning investors have placed bets with borrowed money that the share prices will drop. That compares with a billion shares in November 1990, when markets were roiled in the midst of the Persian Gulf crisis. "A lot of people are looking for the stock market to take a fall," Mr. Hines said.
But market professionals agree that it was just an unlucky day around the world yesterday. "There's been outrageous bad luck in a lot of markets," said David De Rosa, a director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
 The most tragic event was the assassination of Mr. Colosio, which undermined confidence in Mexico, where American institutional investors have flocked in recent years for investment returns that are higher than those in the United States.
But the closing of Mexico's markets yesterday in mourning for Mr. Colosio, who was seen as the likely winner of the Mexican election on Aug. 21, only deflected an investor panic that had nowhere to go.
"The Mexicans were fools to close their markets today," Mr. De Rosa said, "because there was no way for investors to cut their losses in Mexico. So they sold U.S. and Canadian currencies to raise cash. The Mexicans will just get theirs when their markets open Friday."
The dollar fell 1.63 yen, to 104.70 yen. It also fell against the German mark, French franc and Italian lira.
The currency selloff was intensified by an announcement that President Clinton would address Whitewater issues at a news conference last night and by a Republican Congressman's declaration that he had documents damaging to the President. Shortly before the markets closed, Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, disputed President and Mrs. Clinton's contention that they had lost money in the Whitewater development in Arkansas.
In Europe, bond prices generally fell, partly out of concern about what appeared to be inflationary money supply numbers in Germany, Europe's dominant economy.
Similar inflation fears were touched off in the United States when the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, a closely watched inflation gauge, hit another record, its second in two days.
Gold prices rose sharply and silver -- a smaller and more volatile market -- jumped even more. Spot gold futures specifying April delivery rose $4.50 an ounce, to $391.90; the contract for delivery of silver in May was trading at $5.745 an ounce, up 9.3 cents on the day.
"Gold and silver have always been the last in line when nothing else works," said Daniel S. Weissman, vice president-trading for MTB Bank.
The sheer number and force of the various negative factors pummeled American stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell so fast that it set off the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit breaker" rules, which are intended to cool off feverish selling when the Dow falls more than 50 points. Under these rules, sell orders for high-speed computerized trading cannot be executed unless prices are trending upward. The Dow was down as much as 66 points during the day.
 Of the 30 Dow industrial stocks, 24 fell yesterday, with recent institutional favorites like Caterpillar and General Motors dropping sharply. Caterpillar fell 3 7/8, to 116 7/8, and G.M. was off 2 1/8, to 58 3/8.
The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which had been outperforming the Dow and S.& P. 500, fell 10.83 points, to 786.68. The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.32 points, to 257.96, on volume of 303.8 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing issues by 1,739 to 520. The American Stock Exchange market value index declined 3.72 points, to 469.66.
The most active stock yesterday was Novell, whose shares have fallen sharply since Wall Street analysts criticized its plan to acquire Wordperfect, another software company. In contrast to the previous two sessions, when prices fell, Novell stock rose 3/8, to 19 3/8, on volume of 15.5 million shares.

HEADLINE: THE ASSASSINATION IN MEXICO;
Man Who Shot Colosio Recalled as a Loner Who Said Little

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, March 24

 BODY:
The young self-proclaimed pacifist who assassinated a leading politician on Monday remained as much a mystery to officials today as to his puzzled neighbors in a slum not far from the United States border.
No evidence emerged here, either at Government briefings or among his neighbors on dusty Mexicali Street, to suggest that the 23-year-old gunman, Mario Aburto Martinez, had any political connections or was tied in any way to the recent peasant uprising in Chiapas. 
 "He said that even under torture, he will not talk," said a statement from the Federal Attorney General, Diego Valades.
Local newspapers quoted the gunman as proclaiming, "I have saved Mexico!" before being dragged, bloody and bruised, by the police from the shantytown where he shot and killed Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the heir apparent to the presidency, during a campaign rally. But even that statement could not be confirmed today.
 
Doubts Are Growing
 The limited information about the assassin only fueled intense speculation here, at a time when political infighting, drug wars and a new insurgency are giving rise to elaborate rumors. As the country waits for more information, doubts are quickly growing that full answers will emerge at all.
Mr. Valades said the case technically remained open but that the authorities were confident that the man in custody was the one and only gunman. He said that two other men detained after the shooting were witnesses and would be freed shortly unless there was some material change in the situation. He gave their names as Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela and Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega.
"Without doubt the two shots were fired by only one person and with only one weapon," Mr. Valades said today, adding that sodium tests confirmed Mr. Aburto was the gunman. The Attorney General said Mr. Aburto had confessed to the killing in the presence of a lawyer and the Baja California state government human rights ombudsman.
Mr. Valades said the gunman bought a Brazilian-made .38-caliber Taurus revolver "a number of weeks ago with the intention of using it in the acts that we are investigating."
 
Bought in San Francisco
 Federal officials in the United States said the weapon was bought at a San Francisco store in 1977, but would not say who was recorded as haveing bought it. A spokesman for the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Mark Logan, did say that the person who bought the gun lives in the San Francisco area and that officials want to find out whether the gun was later given away or stolen.
The gunman's neighbors, looking across the rutted roadway at his one-room brick home with its bare electric light and tidy outhouse, said they found him totally unremarkable, a single man who went about his business quietly and had few visitors.
"He was a serious guy, a little reclusive," said Valentin Davalos, a 24-year-old driver who lives across the street."He kept his feelings to himself."
Asked if Mr. Aburto had been politically active, Mr. Davalos laughed and said, "He'd rather drink."
 
Described as a Mechanic
 The only visitors the neighbors recalled seeing were men who arrived in two cars with California license plates, possibly relatives, who spent the night either in his tiny house or sleeping in their cars. The Attorney General's statement quoted Mr. Aburto as saying he had four brothers in the United States.
Local reporters raised questions about his claim to be a pacifist agitator. In his statement, the Attorney General quoted Mr. Aburto as calling hmself "the author of various books on pacificst themes, that have been delivered to the foreign press."
But reporters who write about the city's various advocate groups said they had never run across any pacifists and did not know Mr. Aburto.
 
Beaten by Angry Crowd
 The latest, sketchy details about him emerged this afternoon at Mr. Valades's briefing. He said Mr. Aburto completed junior high school and attended a technical school for mechanics.
Born in Zamora, in the state of Michoacan, he has lived in Tijuana since the age of 15 and supported himself as a laborer, Mr. Valades said.
He acknowledged that Mr. Aburto had been beaten by an angry crowd after the shooting, but did not describe his current condition, adding that more interrogations were scheduled.
At the site of the killing, where brightly colored posters of Mr. Colosio still looked down today from whitewashed buildings, residents who witnessed the killing stood in small groups trading their recollections.
"When the guy shot him there were a lot of sounds, music, he fell to the ground," said Manuel Hernandez, 22, an unemployed resident. "I saw the guy's hand up in the air and people all around were grabbing him."
Roberto Cordoba, a photographer, who was standing nearby, thought Mr. Aburto was raising a toy gun.
"People dived on him, beating him," he said. "They were shouting, "Hit him, hit him,' but the police were saying, "Don't kill him because we need to know who sent him.' "

HEADLINE: Mexican Securities Fall After Candidate's Killing

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
The assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio jolted investors around the world yesterday, sending the price of Mexican stocks and bonds down sharply. Silver prices jumped to a four-year high, reflecting Mexico's role as a leading silver producer.
Yet, the killing Wednesday evening of Mr. Colosio, the chosen candidate of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, was not expected to change Mexico's commitment to economic reform, or to the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada. 
 But coming in rapid succession with the peasant revolt in Chiapas state and the kidnapping early this month of Alfredo Harp Helu, the president of a major Mexican banking group, Mr. Colosio's death left analysts predicting that investor anxiety would run high in the months ahead.
Most analysts saw little danger that the Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari would lose control of the peso, especially after President Clinton said yesterday that the United States would support its value.
 
Help From Bentsen and the Fed
 The Federal Reserve has a standing line of credit to maintain the peso, and later yesterday, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, made $6 billion available, jointly pledging "continued strong U.S. support for Mexico's economic policies."
The so-called swap facility is intended to help Mexico protect its currency from speculative attacks when its markets reopen today. Under the arrangement, the United States will exchange dollars for pesos with Mexico so that Mexico has enough foreign exchange reserves to head off a run on its currency. It will be removed at some point in the future when pressure on the peso abates.
Another basis for investor confidence is that President Salinas, the main architect of Mexico's economic changes toward a fully private economy, will remain in office through 1994. And United States executives assume that the ruling party will quickly name a like-minded successor to Mr. Colosio.
"All of the clients we have been talking to today have been focusing on normal legal issues surrounding things like acquisitions and introduction of new products," said Marcel Molins, a partner at the law firm of Baker & McKenzie in Chicago, who works with Baker's Mexican offices on behalf of American companies.
 
Day of Mourning
 Mexico's markets were closed yesterday for a national day of mourning, so only Mexican securities traded abroad were immediately affected by investors' anxiety.
American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, the most widely held Mexican stock internationally, opened at $59 on the New York Stock Exchange. After dropping as low as $58.25, they rebounded to close at $60.125, down $3.625 from Wednesday.
Big Board closed-end funds in Mexican securities were also lower, but did not fall severely. The Mexico Fund was down $1.375, to close at $30.625; the Mexican Equity and Income Fund declined $1, to $20.75, and the Emerging Mexico Fund closed $1 lower, at $18.50
Brady bonds, the Mexican debt securities created in the 80's as part of the restructuring of Mexico's overwhelming foreign debt load, initially dropped yesterday from $72.25 to just over $67 in over-the-counter trading. And the spread in yield between them and United States Treasury Bonds jumped half a percentage point, to about 2.7 percent, according to Salomon Brothers, a leading market maker. Then they bounced back to end the session at $70, with the spread narrowing to just over 2.4 points.
 
Guessing at Today's Market
 Analysts expect a broad but measured decline on the Mexican stock exchange when trading resumes today. They said that stocks traded abroad yesterday fell roughly 5 percent, not an especially severe drop, considering that many of these issues had steeply risen.
James Shore, who manages Latin American investments for Brandes Investment Partners in San Diego, said: "You'll see significant volatility in the markets in the short term because this will reinforce the view of many foreign investors that Mexico is backward. If anything, though, this is creating buying opportunities."
Analysts predicted that the higher risk investors see in Mexican securities would put pressure on the Government to raise short-term interest rates to prevent a flight from the peso. That would add to pressure on stock prices, but several advisers said it would also create buying opportunities in short-term Mexican Treasury notes.
Some United States executives said that the assassination, while obviously disturbing, would not force them to rapidly change their plans. "We have seen much greater crises before," said William Clayton Jr., president of Clayton Industries in El Monte, Calif., a maker of boilers and auto-emission test devices with factories in Mexico City and Tijuana. He noted big peso devaluations in the 1970's and 80's, and years of triple-digit inflation.
And Kai Lindholst, head of the Chicago office of Egon Zehnder International, a Swiss executive recruiter, emphasized that "economic progress in Mexico is not dependent on one person, and will move forward."
His company is searching for a Mexican executive to serve on the board of one of its United States clients, and for Mexicans to head Latin American operations of two others.
That could change, though, if there were more violence or a sense that the governing party was moving too slowly to settle on a successor to Mr. Colosio.
George Baker, of Baker & Associates in Oakland, Calif., advises oil and gas companies on ventures in Mexico. "The American business community," he said, "will need to see steps to confirm its sense of continuity in the next few days."

HEADLINE: THE WHITEWATER INQUIRY;
Transcript of President's News Conference on the Whitewater Affair

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's news conference at the White House last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
PRESIDENT CLINTON Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Yesterday we were reminded that protecting our democracy and expanding its promise around the world can be costly and dangerous. Here at home, we mourn the loss of the servicemen in the tragic aircraft accident at Pope Air Force Base, and we pray for a speedy recovery for those who were injured. This tragedy reminds us that the men and women who serve in the military put their lives at risk in the service of our nation. 
 In Mexico, an assassin killed Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. We send our condolences and our prayers to his family, and I urge the Mexican people at this difficult time to continue their strides toward economic and political reform and progress.
With the Congress beginning its Easter recess tomorrow, this is a good time to assess the real work we are getting done on behalf of the American people. We're moving forward on our economic plan. The budget now moving through Congress, when passed, will give us three consecutive years of deficit reduction for the first time since Harry Truman was President. In 1995, we'll have the lowest budget deficit as a percentage of our annual income of any of the major industrialized countries. Our recovering economy produced two million jobs last year, and we're on track to create two million more in '94.
Around the world America's efforts have helped to bring much needed calm to Sarajevo and led to an important political accord between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats.
Our call for restraint has helped to start talks again in the Middle East.
We'll continue our efforts to stop North Korea's nuclear program and to seek progress on human rights in China, working to build a more positive relationship with that very important nation.
This Friday, a week ahead of schedule, our troops will return home from Somalia. Because of their courageous efforts, Somalia can now build its own future, a step it made in the right direction today with the accord between the leaders of the largest factions in that country.
Since we came here, our country has been moving in the right direction. Just today, the House of Representatives passed our legislation to limit the influence of lobbyists. Our Administration is completing work on a comprehensive welfare reform proposal. We have presented to the Congress our very important re-employment proposal to change the unemployment system to provide immediate retraining to those who lose their jobs.
In a few days, with bipartisan support, the country will have an education reform law that sets national standards for our public schools. In a few weeks, Congress will pass a crime bill and put more police on the street, tougher gun laws on the books and make three-strikes-and-you're-out the law of the land.
Speaker Foley assured me last night that the crime bill will be Item No. 1 on the agenda of the House when it returns to work. And in a few months we will succeed in passing health care reform. Just yesterday the House subcommittee on health passed legislation to provide health security for every American, and while there will be lots of twists and turns in the legislative process, this year Congress will pass, and I will sign, a health reform law which guarantees health care security to every American that can never be taken away.
With the right to choose a doctor, with the plan that outlaws insurance abuses, no more dropping coverage or cutting benefits, no more lifetime limits, no more raising rates just because someone in your family has been sick, or some are older than others. We want to preserve and strengthen Medicare, and we believe in this Administration that those health benefits should be guaranteed to the work place -- building on what works today.
I know that many people around America must believe that Washington is overwhelmingly preoccupied with the Whitewater matter, but our Administration is preoccupied with the business we were sent here to do for the American people.
The investigation of Whitewater is being handled by an independent special counsel whose appointment I supported. Our cooperation with that counsel has been total. We have supplied over 14,000 documents, my tax returns dating back to 1978, and made available every Administration witness he has sought.
I support the actions of the House and the Senate clearing the way for hearings at an appropriate time that does not interfere with Mr. Fiske's responsibilities, and I will fully cooperate with their work as well. Tomorrow I will make available my tax returns dating back to 1977, when I first held public office. Cooperation, disclosure and doing the people's business are the order of the day. This is the best moment we have had in decades to do the hard work on so many issues that affect not only our own progress and prosperity, but the very way we think about ourselves as a nation. The American people should know that I and my Administration will not be distracted. We are committed to taking advantage of this rare moment in achieving these important goals. Terry?
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, you just said that you would release your tax returns back to 1977. Questions also have been raised about whether you made money or lost money in your Whitewater investment. Do you still believe that you lost about $70,000, and do you have any reason to believe that you owe any back taxes?
A. I am certain that we lost money. I do not believe we owe any back taxes. If it is determined that we do, of course, we will pay. I am now sure that we lost something less than $70,000. Based on an interview I heard on television, or I heard about on television, with Jim McDougal on one of the networks, where he said that he felt that one of the loans I had taken from a bank where we've also borrowed money for the land development corporation -- he said he thought one of those was a personal loan.
So I started wracking my brain to try to remember what that might have been, and by coincidence I was also re-reading the galleys of my mother's autobiography, just fact-checking it, and I noticed that she mentioned there something that I had genuinely forgotten, which is that I helped her to purchase the property and what was then a cabin on the place that she and her husband, Dick Kelley, lived back in 1981, and that I was a co-owner of that property with her for just a few months. After they married, he bought my interest out. So that's where that -- I borrowed the money to go in on that investment, and I paid the money back with interest. That was unrelated to Whitewater.
All the other losses that we have documented to date we believe clearly are tied to the investment Hillary and I made in Whitewater. So we, in fact, lost some $20,700 less than the Lyons report indicated because that loan came from a different place, or came for different purposes. And there was another $1,500 payment I made on it. So whatever the total in the Lyons report was, should -- you should subtract from that $20,700 and another $1,500. And we believe we can document that clearly.
Tomorrow, my counsel, David Kendall, will brief the press on the evidence that we have, what's in the tax returns. You will see when you see the tax returns that those losses were clearly there, and he will be glad to support it with other information as well. Helen?
 
On Financing for Campaigns
 Q. Do you know of any funds, any money -- Whitewater seems to be about money -- having gone into any of your gubernatorial campaigns or into Whitewater, particularly federally insured money. Do you know of any money that could have gone in?
A. No. I have no knowledge of that. I have absolutely no knowledge of that. Rita?
Q. President Clinton, you just mentioned James McDougal, your former business partner. A lot of questions have been raised about his business practices. Can you tell us what drew you to him to begin with, and whether or not you still have faith now that he was -- that he is an honest businessman?
A. Well, I can tell you that when I entered my relationship with him -- let's go back to then and not now -- I knew Mr. McDougal and had known him for many years. I met him in the late 60's, when he was running Senator Fulbright's office in Arkansas. I knew that sometime around that time, perhaps later, he got into the real estate business. When I entered into this investment, it was with a person I had known many years who was in the real estate business, who'd never been in the S.& L. business or the banking business. That all happened at a later time.
Now he had done quite well. The reason we lost money on Whitewater is not surprising; a lot of people did at that time. Interest rates, as you'll remember, went through the roof in the early 80's. People stopped immigrating to my state to retire, at least in the numbers they had all during the 70's. And the market simply changed. So we didn't sell as many lots, and the venture was not successful, so we lost the money. Principally, the money I lost was on the interest payments I had to make on the loans, which were never reimbursed because the venture never turned a profit.
Q. Do you still believe in his honesty now and do you think that ----
A. All I can tell you, to the best of my knowledge, he was honest in his dealings with me. And that's all I can comment on, you know. In my experience, and as I said when I heard about his comments on television since he had -- he's always told you that I had nothing to do with the management of Whitewater, that Hillary had nothing to do with it.
We didn't keep the books or the records, that this investment was made, as you know, back in 1978 and that we were essentially passive investors, that none of our money was borrowed from savings and loans and we had nothing to do with the savings and loan. So that's what he has always said, so when he said he didn't think this note that I, where I borrowed money from a bank, not an S.& L., in 1981 had anything to do with Whitewater, I started thinking about it. We talked about it; we couldn't remember what else it could have been until I literally just happened across that in reading my mother's autobiography.
Andrea?
 
On Accusations by Leach
 Q. Mr. President, Congressman Leach made some very dramatic charges today. He said that Whitewater is really about the arrogance of power. And he didn't just mean back in Arkansas. He said that Federal regulators tried to stop investigators for the Resolution Trust Corporation in Kansas City from putting Whitewater into their criminal referrals. That would amount to a cover-up and possibly obstruction of justice. Do you have any knowledge of that?
A. Absolutely not. And it's my understanding -- let me just say this -- it's my understanding that Mr. Leach was rather careful in the words that he used, and apparently he didn't even charge that any political appointee of our Administration had a any knowledge of this.
So he may be talking about an internal dispute within the R.T.C. from career Republican appointees for all I know. Keep in mind, until I came here, all the appointees of the R.T.C. were hired under previous Republican Administrations. There has never been a Democratic President since there's been an R.T.C., and I can tell you categorically I had no knowledge of this and was not involved in it in any way, shape or form.
Q. In light of all that's happened so far, Mr. President, do you think you made any mistakes in the initial investment and in the way the White House has handled it?
A. I certainly don't think I made a mistake in the initial investment. It was a perfectly honorable thing to do, and it was a perfectly legal thing to do. I didn't make any money; I lost money. I paid my debts and then later on, as you know, Hillary and I tried to make sure that the corporation was closed down in an appropriate way and paid any obligations that it owed, after we were asked to get involved at a very late stage, and after Mr. McDougal had left the S.& L. So I don't think that we did anything wrong in that at all. And I think we handled it in an appropriate way. We were like a lot of people. We invested money and we lost.
I'd be the last person in the world to be able to defend everything we've done here in the sense that whatever we did or didn't do has sparked an inordinate amount of interest in a 16-year-old business venture that lost money. But to suggest, let me just say again, I have had absolutely nothing to do, and would have nothing to do, with any attempt to influence an R.T.C. regulatory matter, and I think if you look at the actions of the R.T.C. just since I've been President, and you examine the facts, everybody that works there was appointed by a previous Republican Administration. The evidence is clear that I have not done that.
Q. You've been kind of tough at times on people you felt made out during the 80's, who didn't pay their fair share. Can you tell us, sir, tonight that you have abided by the very high ethical standards ----
A. Absolutely.
Q. ---- to which you've sought to hold others? And also, sir, if it turns out that you do owe something in back taxes, will you be prepared perhaps to revise some of those judgments you've made about others?
A. No, not at all. I ask you to tell the American people what percentage of my income I paid in taxes in every year where I reported my tax returns.
And let me tell you what my wife and I spent the 80's doing. I was the lowest-paid governor of any state in the country. I don't complain about it. I was proud of that. I didn't do it for the money. I worked on creating jobs and improving education for the children of my state. Every year I was Governor my wife worked in a law firm that had always done business with the state. She never took any money for any work she did for the state. And, indeed, she gave up her portion of partnership income that otherwise came to the firm and instead every year gave an enormous percentage of her time to public service work, helping children and helping education and doing a lot of other things, giving up a lot of income.
Now, we did that because we wanted to. The fact that we made investments, some of which we lost money on, some of which we made money on, has nothing to do whatever with the indictment that I made about the excesses of the 80's. And we always made every effort to pay our taxes. I would remind you that we, like most middle-class folk, we turned our records over to an accountant. We did -- I always told the accountant to resolve all doubts in favor of the Government. I never wanted any question raised about our taxes.
When it turned out, in our own investigation of this Whitewater business that one year we had inadvertently taken a tax deduction for interest payments when in fact it was a principal payment, even though the statute of limitations has run, we went back and voluntarily paid what we owed to the Federal Government. And if it turns out we've made some mistake inadvertently, we will do that again. But I have always tried to pay my taxes, and you'll see when you look at all the returns that we've always paid quite a considerable percentage of our income in taxes.
Yes.
Q. Mr. President, one thing that's puzzled a lot of people is why, if you did nothing wrong, did you act for so long as if you had something to hide. And now that you're about to release these documents to the public, your tax records and other things, do you think it would have helped if you had released these documents to the public earlier? Would it have stopped this issue from reaching the proportions that it has?
A. I don't have any idea. But I don't think I acted as if I had anything to hide. After all, I did volunteer, I had already given out my tax returns going back to 1980. And then when -- keep in mind, when the furor arose at the request for the special counsel, even though everybody at the time said, well, we don't think that he's done anything wrong, there's no evidence that he or the First Lady have done anything wrong, we still think there ought to be a special counsel. I said we would give all this over to the special counsel.
It was only after the special counsel had all the information that the people who first wanted the special counsel decided they wanted the documents as well. So we're making them available. Perhaps I should have done it earlier, but you will see essentially what I've told you, and things that you basically already know.
 
On Use of Influence
 Q. Mr. President, you said a few minutes ago that the people in the R.T.C. who are involved in Mr., in Congressman Leach's allegations, are all career Republican officials. But aren't they members of your Administration? And do you plan to take any action in speaking to either Mr. Bentsen or Mr. Altman about taking action and investigating Mr. Leach's charges?
A. I think the last thing in the world I should do is talk to the Treasury Department about the R.T.C. You all have told me that that creates the appearance of impropriety. I don't think we can have a -- it's not just a one-way street, it's a two-way street. I -- you know, Mr. Leach will see that whatever should be done is done. But I can tell you I have had no contact with the R.T.C. I have made no attempt to influence them. And you can see by some of the decisions that they have made that that is the furthest thing, it seems to me, that ought to be on your mind.
Q. You abandon all reponsibility for a department, a Cabinet department in your Government?
A. No. I haven't abandoned all reponsibility. You can't have it both ways. Either we can talk to them or we can't. And, you know, I just think this is a matter of public record now, and Mr. Leach will certainly see to it that it is looked into. He's already said that that's his job, and I'm sure he will see that it is.
Yes.
 
On Hillary Clinton's Role
 Q. With so many questions swirling around Whitewater and the Rose Law Firm, there's some concern that the moral authority of the First Lady is eroding as well. Are you reconsidering her role as the point person for health care reform?
A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. People should not be able to raise questions and erode people's moral authority in this country. There ought to, have to be, evidence and proof. We live in a time when there is a great deal of question-raising. It seems to be the order of the day. But I know what the facts are and I'm giving you the facts on this. Here we just had -- all these questions were raised about whether she was properly or improperly representing a client before a state agency -- to do something, I might add, that the Federal Government had asked savings and loans to do -- that is, go out and raise more capital to become more solvent -- so that's what she was doing, in the full light of day, in full disclosure.
Now we have, even in retrospect, an eminent national expert saying that she is getting a bum rap. When people ask questions that don't have any basis -- no, I think you should ask whatever questions you want to ask, and I think that we should do our best to answer them -- but I think that the 20-year record she made as a lawyer, never before having her ethics questioned, never before having her ability questioned, when everybody who knew her knew that every year she was giving up a whole lot of income to do public business, to advance the cause of children and to advance the cause of our state. No, I don't think so. I think in the end, when all these questions get asked and answered, her moral authority will be stronger than it has ever been because we will have gone through this process and been very forthcoming, as we are, to the special counsel.
And then in the end, people will compare how we did this with how previous Administrations under fire handled their business, and I think it'll come out quite well.
Q. Mr. President, the assassination of Mr. Colosia today has shaken the financial markets in this country, created doubt about the stability of Mexico. Mexico opens its stock market and banks tomorrow. You said you would help Mexico. What can the United States do to help Mexico in these trying times?
A. Well, first of all, let me say Mexico is a very great country that has made enormous progress, economically and politically. There is a lot of ferment and change going on there that is inevitable and that can be very positive. What I think the United States can do first of all is to tell the rest of the world that we know this about Mexico, they're our neighbors and we think they have a great future. And we don't expect any long-term damage to come from this terrible personal tragedy and political setback.
Second, the only business I did last night on this -- I called President Salinas as a friend as well as as the President of the United States to express my sorrow -- the only business I did was to talk to the Secretary of the Treasury about what we might be able to do in the event there was some sort of unusual trading against the Mexican currency. And there may be something we can do to step in and stabilize that. As you know, there've been times in the past when our friends have had to come to our aid; the Germans, the Japanese and others have come to our aid when there was unusual trading against the dollar. And we are prepared to try to help the Mexicans if that is necessary, but we hope it won't be.
Today we did just a little bit on Mexican securities when we suspended trading here in the United States for a very short time so that the American people who would be interested in this would at least be able to verify what the facts were, and what they were not, about the terrible incident last night. And I think that helped a bit; I certainly hope that it did.
 
On Public's Perception
 Q. Increasingly, polls are showing that more and more Americans are unsure whether you acted properly in Whitewater -- that maybe you did something wrong. Does that concern you? And when do you think it would be proper for the first lady to answer questions about Whitewater?
A. Well, first of all -- does it concern me? Only a little bit. The truth is I'm amazed when I read in The New York Times or some place today that there'd been three times as much coverage of Whitewater as there had been of health care. I'm amazed that there hadn't been more change in the polls.
I think what the American people are really upset about is the thought that this investment that we made 16 years ago that lost money, that did not involve savings and loans, might somehow divert any of us from doing the work of the country and getting the economy going and dealing with health care and the other issues.
So in that sense, I think people are right to be concerned.
And they want to know that I'm going to answer the questions. A lot of people don't even know, I don't think, that there is a special counsel, that we have fully cooperated, that he has said we have, that the Watergate prosecutor, Sam Dash, contrasted our conduct with previous Presidents and said we'd been highly ethical. And we're moving forward.
Now, the First Lady has done several interviews. She was out in three different places last week answering questions exhaustively from the press. I think she will continue to do that. And if you have questions you want to ask her about this, I think you ought to ask the questions.
<HBOn Living Up to Standards
 Q. Mr. President, during the campaign you said your Administration would set a higher standard, yet in the travel office case last year, your own chief of staff found that some of your aides used their official position to advance their personal interests. More recently we've seen a senior White House official delinquent in Social Security taxes that disqualified others from serving in your Administration and others in the White House neglecting until recently to undergo security clearance required of other Government officials handling classified information.
Why, sir, do you think it's so difficult for members of your staff to live up to your campaign promise?
A. First of all, let's deal with those things each in turn. Now, the finding was not that anybody who worked for me sought to advance themselves personally, financially in the travel office issue. That was not defined. We found that the issue had not been well handled, and I might say, unlike other White Houses that stonewalled, denied or delayed, we did our own internal investigation, admitted what mistakes we made, and made some changes there. I'm proud of that.
Secondly, no one was barred from serving in our Administration because they hadn't paid Social Security taxes. The people were barred from serving in Presidential appointed positions that required Senate confirmation unless they complied with Administration policy. Mr. Kennedy did not do that entirely, and he has been reassigned. He has been under -- he's had a difficult time -- and I am convinced that he has done a lot of work that's been very valuable for us. But I think that he should not have done what he did; I think he should fully pay. He has done that. I think that's what he should have done.
Now when the White House passes -- let me just talk about what the facts are. About 90 percent of the people who work here have been through all the clearances. The others are going through the clearances. I learned, when I read about this, that apparently previous Administrations have had some of the same problems. That is, they'd been lax, because of the cumbersome nature of the process. We now basically put in rules that say that anybody comes to work here now has to get all this done in 30 days or is immediately on leave without pay. They can't get paid unless they do it. I asked Mr. McLarty and Mr. Cutler to fix this and make sure it never happens again, so I feel confident that we have. But since you raise the issue, let me also ask you to report to the American people that we have, and we have enforced higher standards against the ethical conflicts than any previous Administration.
People leave the White House; they can't lobby the White House. If they're in certain positions, they can't lobby the White House for a long time. If they're in certain positions now, they can never lobby on behalf of a foreign government. I have supported a campaign finance reform bill that I am hoping the Congress will pass, and I believe they will, which will change the nature of financing political campaigns. I've supported a very tough lobby reform bill, which will require more disclosure and more restraint on the part of lobbyists and public officials than ever before, and we will comply with those laws. So I think our record on balance is quite good, and when we make mistakes we try to admit them, something that has not been the order of the day in the past.
 
On Assessing the Blame
 Q. Thank you Mr. President. So many things have happened since this Whitewater story broke or resurfaced depending on your point of view. Your counsel has resigned. A number of your top aides have been subpoenaed because of their contacts with Treasury officials in on the investigation. I'm curious: Who do you blame more than anything else for the Whitewater mess that the Administration is in now?
A. Well, I don't think it's useful to get into blame. I think what's important is that I answer the questions that you have that are legitimate questions, that I fully cooperate with the special counsel, which was requested widely by the press and by the members of the Republican Party and who is himself a Republican, that we fully cooperate. And we've done that. Senator Inouye from Hawaii pointed out today, he said I've been experienced in these investigations, he said, you folks have claimed no executive privilege, you've fully cooperated. No one can quarrel with that.
And then I get back to the work of getting unemployment down, jobs up, passing a health care bill, passing the crime bill, moving this country forward. I think the worst thing that can happen is for me to sort of labor over who should blame -- who should be blamed by this. There'll probably be enough blame to go around. I'm just not concerned about it.
Q. A follow up sir. Do you feel ill served in any way by your staff?
A. Well, I think on the -- I've told you what I think about these meetings. Now let's go back to the facts of the meetings. We now know that Mr. Altman's counsel checked with the ethics officer in Treasury before he came over and gave the briefing to the White House. But I have said, so it appears at least that the counsel thought that Mr. Altman had an ethical clearance to come and do this briefing. We certainly know that no one in the White House, at least to the best of my knowledge, has tried to use any information to in any way improperly influence the R.T.C. or any Federal agency.
Would it have been better if those meetings had not occurred? Yes, I think it would have been. Do we have people here who wouldn't do anything wrong but may -- but perhaps weren't sensitive enough to how something could look in retrospect by people who are used to having problems in a Presidency or used to having people not tell them the truth? I think that we weren't as sensitive as we should have been and I said before, it would have been better if that hadn't occurred.
But I think, you know, the one thing you have to say is you learn things as you go along in this business. None of this in the light of history will be remotely as important as the fact that by common consensus we had the most productive first year of a Presidency last year of anyone in a generation. That's what matters -- that we're changing people's lives. That's what counts, and I'm just going to keep working on it.
Yes.
 
On a Conflict of Interest
 Q. Mr. President, you and your wife have both used the phrase "bewildered, confused" about why all the interest in Whitewater. Yet in the Arkansas savings and loan business, your wife represented Madison Savings and Loan before the Arkansas Savings and Loan Board whose head was a former lawyer who had done work for Madison Savings and Loan. Do you not see any conflicts of interest in your actions or your wife's actions which would appear to contradict what you just said about her not doing any work before the state, that would cause people to question -- --
A. I did not say that. I said that when my wife did business, when her law firm represented some state agency itself -- state agencies all over America use private lawyers -- if she did any work for the state she never took any pay for it. And when the firm got income from state work, she didn't take her partnership share of that income; she gave that up, because she wanted to bend over backwards to avoid the appearance of conflict.
Was there anything wrong with her representing a client before a state agency? And if you go back and look at the facts, that basically the firm wrote the securities commissioner a letter saying, Is it permissible under Arkansas law to raise money for this S.& L. in this way? And it showed that she was one of the contacts on it. And the securities commissioner wrote her back and said it's not against the law. That was basically the extent of her representation.
Now all I can do is tell you that she believed there was nothing unethical about it. And today, in an interview Prof. Steven Gillers of New York University, who is a widely respected national expert on legal ethics, once again said there was nothing at all unethical in doing this. These kinds of things happen when you have married couples who have professions. And the most important thing there is disclosure. There was no sneaking around about this; this was full disclosure. Professor Gillers -- I brought the quote here -- said, "I think this is a bum rap on Mrs. Clinton, and I'm amazed that it keeps getting recirculated."
Now there's a person who doesn't work for us, whose job it is to know what the code of professional responsibility requires.
Yes?
Q. Mr. President, you and the First Lady have several times said that you've been amazed and dismayed by the intensity of both the opposition and the scrutiny surrounding Whitewater in particular. Has any of this been instructive for you? Have you taken any lessons from this ordeal whether it's about the Presidency, about the process, about the city, or anything?
A. Oh, I think I've learned a lot about it. I think one of the things that I've learned about it is that it's very important to try to decide what the legitimate responsibility of the President is to be as forthcoming as possible and to do it. It's important for me to understand that there is a level here, and this is not a blame, this is just an observation, because of the experiences of the last several decades, of which I was not a part in this city, I think there is a level of suspicion here that is greater than that which I have been used to in the past, and I don't complain about it, but I've learned a lot about it, and that my job is to try to answer whatever questions are out there so I can get on with the business of the country. And I think I've learned a lot about how to handle that.
I also learned here that there may or not be a different standard than I had seen in the past -- not of right and wrong, that doesn't change -- but what may appear to be right or wrong. And I think that you will see that like everything else, this Administration learns and goes on. We always learn from our mistakes, and we've proven that.
Yes sir, in the back.
 
From Korea to Russia
 Q. Muchas gracias, Senor Presidente. I wonder if you realize the situation that is developing in Korea, what is the perspective? What will be the situation in South Africa next month? And do you believe that the former Soviet Union, Russia, has a stabilization and that will contribute peace to the world? How do you respond?
A. That's the quickest anybody ever asked me three questions at once.
Let me see, first of all, the situation in Korea is serious. And we have responded in a serious way. The North Koreans themselves have said they are committed to a non-nuclear Korean peninsula. We want that. We want a good normal relationship with them. They have terminated the I.A.E.A. inspections. We are examining what we can do. We're talking to our South Korean partners as well as to the Chinese, the Japanese, the Russians and others. We still hope that this can be resolved and we believe it can be. But the choice is really up to North Korea.
Will they be isolated form the world community or will they be a full partner? They could have a very bright future indeed. They have many contributions to make indeed to a united Korea and we hope that it will work out. But we did -- I did decide to deploy the Patriots on the recommendation of General Luck as a purely defensive measure in the wake of the difficulties we've had and we'll make further decisions as we go along.
With regard to South Africa, I am immensely hopeful. I have tried once to encourage Chief Buthelezi to join in the political process. And I still have some hope that he will. It is not too late, and they have made real efforts to try to accommodate the conflicts between national and local interests. But I think we will be celebrating in late April a great triumph of democracy of the first nonracial or multiracial democratic process in South Africa.
With regard to Russia, I think that on balance our relationship is still sound. It is based on our perception and their perception of our shared interests. And when we disagree we will say so. And we will act accordingly. But I do think that the Russians have made a constructive contribution to our efforts in Bosnia which are -- have had a lot of success. We've got a long way to go but we've had some real success and I'm hopeful that they will elsewhere. I know they made a suggestion on Korea today and we'll see what happens there.
 
On Alternative Health Plan
 Q. Congressman Stark's health care bill doesn't do everything that you have proposed. Would you veto it if it reaches your desk?
A. No, because it does what I ask. It doesn't solve all the problems but it does provide universal coverage. It emphasizes the workplace -- that is, there is no tax on people unless they elect not to take out insurance. And it provides comprehensive benefits, which I think are very important, and it leaves Medicare alone with the integrity of Medicare. There's things that it doesn't do that I wish it did. I don't think it's as successful, or would be as successful in holding down costs and extending opportunities as our plan, but certainly if it were to be enacted by the United States Congress I would sign it because it meets the fundamental criteria I set up of covering all Americans with health care.
I guess we've got to go. Everybody wants to be watching these ball games, I think. You know, we're going to -- I'm going to make -- nobody's asked me if we're going to tax gambling or anything. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President ----
A. This is a setup. It's my joke. Only people who bet against my team in the N.C.A.A. Go ahead.
 
On Past Tax Returns
 Q. Mr. President, I take it that the tax returns you're putting out tomorrow are the ones that have already gone to the special counsel. If the special counsel wanted to question you about that, would you answer a subpoena? Would Mrs. Clinton? And what about Congressional hearings? What would be the protocol on going before Congress to explain it to them?
A. Well, let me answer the first question first. We decided, in addition to putting out the '78 and '79 returns, we should go ahead and put out the '77 returns -- that that would be an appropriate starting point because that's the year I first entered public life. And you know, I mean, there's, I know there's kind of a moving bar here. None of us are quite sure how far back anybody should go anymore about anything. But we thought that we would do that and at least you would then have a complete record of the money we earned and the taxes we paid -- Hillary and I together did -- as long as I've been in public life.
In terms of the information, I expect that the special council will want to question me and will want to question the First Lady.
It's my understanding that, typically, in the past it's been done in a different way. I mean, I will cooperate with him in whatever way he decides is appropriate. Similarly, if Congress wants any information direct from us, we'll of course provide it to them in whatever way seems most appropriate. Again, I understand there are certain protocols which have been followed in the past which I would expect would be followed here but I intend to be fully cooperative so that I can go back to work doing what I was hired to do.
Thank you very much.
Q. [Several reporters shouting] ----
A. No. I -- what I said, I made a joke about that. I said I was going to try to tax anybody who bet against my team in the basketball finals.
But I have made no decision on the financing of welfare reform. I can tell you this: It's a tough issue because we have to pay for anything we do. And we'll -- and there are all kinds of proposals out there. I know that the Republican welfare reform proposal has a lot of things in it that I like. But I think it's way too hard on financing things through savings from immigrants. I think it goes too far there. So there are no real easy answers. But I can say categorically that I have been briefed on a very wide range of options and that nobody in this Administration has made any decision -- and no one will make a decision except me -- about how to fund it. That decision has not been made.
We will come forward with that plan. We do think it offers the real promise of ending welfare as we know it, of moving people from welfare to work, if we can also guarantee these welfare parents that when they go to work their children will not lose the health care that they have on welfare, so they won't be punished for going to work. That's the key issue.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: Japan's Top Banker Assails Nation's Banks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 24

 BODY:
The governor of the Bank of Japan delivered a stern tongue-lashing today to Japan's battered commercial banks, criticizing in stark terms their pack mentality, their inability to evaluate financial risks and their unwillingness to innovate in spite of their huge size.
The governor, Yasushi Mieno, has periodically criticized Japanese banking practices since a plunge in the stock and real estate markets four years ago exposed a pattern of reckless lending and buried the banks under a mountain of bad debts. Analysts say that the country's 21 largest banks hold at least $270 billion in bad loans and that the toll is mounting. 
 But Mr. Mieno's latest remarks, made in a speech here today at a forum sponsored by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, were even harsher in their assessment of the banks' weaknesses. He insisted that deregulation was the best solution for many of the shortcomings -- not more of the Government hand-holding that many analysts regard as the root of the problems.
 
 
Urges Competition
 In effect, Japan's top banker said the banking system needed not a cyclical rebound but a widespread overhaul, and he advocated a strong dose of competition as a remedy.
Takaaki Wakasugi, a professor of finance at Tokyo University and the University of Michigan, who has long made the same arguments, agreed with what the governor said. "Our style of doing things has been wrong," Professor Wakasugi said.
The professor has argued for years that Japanese banks have been discouraged from weighing lending risks intelligently because of heavy-handed intervention in business life by the Government bureaucracy.
Mr. Mieno said Japanese banks had refused to do the sort of independent, hard-nosed analysis of the ability of borrowers to repay that is standard in other countries. Instead, he said, they tend "to use industry averages as a benchmark and stay in the pack" in their lending decisions.
 
 
Banks Not Allowed to Fail
 The practice led Japanese banks to pour a flood of ill-considered loans into the real estate industry, or to accept property as loan collateral, in the late 1980's -- a period now known as the "bubble era." Those loans have threatened the stability of Japan's banking industry, even though the Finance Ministry refuses to allow any banks to fail as a matter of policy.
"Ill-managed behavior in one corner can spread risk throughout the sector," Mr. Mieno said.
He also asked why Japanese manufacturers were trend-setters in developing new products while commercial banks conspicuously lagged behind.
"Why is it that innovation is hard to come by for Japanese financial institutions?" he asked. Mr. Mieno hinted that deregulation and more competition were required in what is one of the most tightly regulated industries in Japan.
 
 
Recovery May Be Hurt
 Mr. Mieno concluded that the problems in the banking sector had so impaired the banks' operations that they were impeding the economy's recovery from a two-year recession.
The Government reported this week that the economy grew just a tenth of a percent last year, the slowest rate in 19 years. Bank lending has barely increased, and thus the commercial banks have not filled their traditional role of fueling a recovery by spurring business activity.
While small companies often fail, it is exceptionally rare for a large, well-established company to go bankrupt in Japan, because of Government support. Likewise, no commercial bank has failed here since World War II, because the Finance Ministry just does not allow it.
Each industry is overseen by a ministry, and the ministries feel they have a stake in rescuing companies in trouble, no matter the cost. "If a big company goes bankrupt, it implies the bureaucrats failed," Professor Wakasugi said.
As a result, he said, banks have been willing to make what in hindsight were reckless loans to companies, particularly big companies, without worrying about their soundness. "This has spoiled banks' ability to really evaluate companies," Mr. Wakasugi said.
 
 
Scathing Analysis
 The Bank of Japan tends to be more market-oriented than the Finance Ministry, and its reports on banks in recent years have been scathing in analyzing their weaknesses.
For instance, a study prepared two years ago showed how commercial banks were making tens of billions of dollars' worth of loans to what are known here as nonbank banks. These are finance companies that make loans but do not accept deposits.
The commercial banks, according to the study, failed to conduct even the most rudimentary sort of evaluation of how the nonbanks were using the capital. In many instances, it said, they were pouring money into the real estate market -- just before it collapsed.
The result is that financial problems at the nonbanks have saddled the commercial banks with a burden of bad debt that may take a decade to alleviate.

HEADLINE: NASA's Big Plans and Smaller Purse Don't Add Up, Budget Agency Says

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The space agency's efforts to reinvent itself and do more with less money are likely to fail, forcing it to make hard choices about canceling programs and reducing the scope of its mission, the Congressional Budget Office said today.
In a report issued by the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, the budget office said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would have to "narrow its objectives" in the face of continued budget cuts. 
 The space agency has been trying to trim costs by canceling or delaying programs, reducing others and operating with greater efficiency, the budget office's said in its report. But its analysis of the agency's plan, the report said, "concludes that improving the way NASA conducts its business -- buying more for less -- is unlikely to produce significant budgetary savings for the next five years."
 
Prediction of Failure
 NASA's strategy of continuing its ambitious projects, like the space station, despite a shrinking budget and a history of habitual cost overruns, will probably not be successful, it said.
In response, the space agency's Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, said the agency would not back away from its traditional program of aeronautics and space for one with a much narrower mission. "The report takes a defeatist approach and sends a chilling message to any Government agency that dares reinvent itself," Mr. Goldin said in a statement, "that dares give the taxpayer effectiveness, efficiency and creativity."
The Congressional Budget Office report said NASA's financial situation should cause it to consider alternatives to its current programs, including ending the space station and the manned space program. The agency should consider reducing its broad sweep of programs and doing a few things well instead of struggling with many, it said.
 
Alternatives Proposed
 The report offered these three examples of how NASA could focus on some of the things it does now at different budget levels, but noted that these were not the only alternatives available:
*At the present budget level of $14.3 billion a year, the agency could concentrate on manned space flight, including building the space station and planning for eventual manned missions to the Moon and to Mars. This plan would severely restrict the current emphasis on space science, like astronomy and Earth environmental missions.
*The agency could spend $11 billion a year to emphasize robotic spacecraft and conduct only a few space shuttle flights a year, instead of the current eight. Such a plan would de-emphasis manned flight and result in canceling the space station.
*NASA could stop all costly manned space flight and concentrate on robot spacecraft, as well as developing new technology for private industry. Such a program would cost only $7 billion a year, the report said.
 
Program in 'Serious Trouble'
 Representative George E. Brown Jr., the chairman of the House committee, said the report made it clear that "the space program as a whole is in serious trouble." The Clinton Administration has said that it wants to keep NASA's budget at a fixed level, about $14.3 billion annually, for the next five years, he said, but Congress in recent years has cut almost $1 billion from the President's request.
Appropriations below the requested level will not allow NASA to continue all its current programs, Mr. Brown said at a news conference, and the agency's plan to build a space station is in particular danger of being canceled.
The California Democrat, who previously led the fight in the House to preserve plans for the international orbiting laboratory, said that if the agency's budget was trimmed below that asked by the Clinton Administration, "I'm probably going to have to go against the space station."
A billion-dollar budget cut, coupled with the effects of inflation, would effectively reduce NASA's budget to $11 billion annually at the end of five years, Mr. Brown said. "This is not enough to build a space station," he said.
 
Review on Space Station
 NASA announced today that it had completed a critical design review of space station plans and everything was on schedule to begin assembling the orbiting laboratory in 1997. At a news conference in Houston, agency officials and representatives of other nations involved in the project said the station could be completed for permanent occupancy by up to six astronauts by June 2002, three months earlier than previously estimated.
Representatives of the European Space Agency, Japan and Canada indicated they were ready to continue with the project, even as it was redesigned to include major portions to be built by Russia, which was added as a full partner late last year.
But the latest review suggested that there would be some changes from earlier plans, including possibly a reduced contribution from Canada, which earlier said it would spend $1.3 billion in Canadian dollars, or $947 million in American dollars, to build a robot arm system for the station. In addition, officials said, the European Space Agency would use its new, large Ariane 5 rocket for 2 of 34 flights needed to assemble the station and possibly for additional work to take supplies to the completed laboratory.
Dan Tam, manager of the project business office, said NASA had spent about $10 billion on the space station effort since its inception, and would have to spend another $17.4 billion to complete it. In addition, he said, it would cost the partners $1.3 billion a year to operate the outpost after completion.

HEADLINE: Myth: Small Business as Job Engine

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
For years, small business has been portrayed as the source of virtually all new jobs, a notion furthered by the litany of layoffs in recent months by corporate giants like I.B.M., Westinghouse, Johnson & Johnson, General Motors and A.T.& T.
The notion has been invoked again and again, by everyone from President Clinton in his first State of the Union Message to Senator Bob Dole to officials of the Small Business Administration -- and echoed widely by journalists. 
 But to think that America's economic future lies largely with high-tech start-ups and other small businesses, outfits with 50 or 100 workers or fewer, is to miss a main dynamic of the marketplace. Big companies have also been hiring, though with considerably less fanfare. And the big businesses that are adding workers are as varied as those cutting back, from Chrysler and Wal-Mart to Merrill Lynch, Motorola, United Parcel Service and Pepsico. These companies have increased their total employment by anywhere from 3,000 at Merrill Lynch to 182,000 at Wal-Mart from 1992 to 1994.
 
Image, Not 'Reality'
 "People have this image of an economy in which large firms inexorably shrink and small firms valiantly struggle to replenish the stock of jobs," said Steven J. Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago. "But this image deviates sharply from the reality."
It is an image that took root about a decade ago, when David Birch, a business consultant and lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, contended that small businesses created 8 out of 10 new jobs. The statistic has been repeated like a mantra ever since, usually to argue for special breaks for small businesses in Washington.
Even Mr. Birch now says he regards his own statistic as neither "interesting" nor "meaningful." But, he complains, "That number won't go away."
One reason, Professor Davis says, is that small businesses hire at twice the rate, relative to their total employment, of midsized and big ones. A recent study of manufacturers by Mr. Davis and two colleagues, for example, found that companies with at least 10 workers created nearly two-thirds of all the new jobs from 1973 to 1988.
But, they also found, small businesses eliminate jobs at a far higher rate. And their job cuts are less visible since large layoffs by large companies make big headlines, while the disappearance of the corner hardware store or the local car dealership is noticed mostly by the neighbors.
In recent years, start-ups and small businesses have also been the first to add workers. They do a disproportionate share of the hiring early in an economic recovery, while big companies are often the last to lay off -- and to hire.
Besides, says James L. Medoff, a labor economist at Harvard University, Americans love small business the way they love small towns and family farmers and are more ready to believe that it plays a uniquely virtuous role. All of the storied companies -- Microsoft, Intel, Wal-Mart -- started small, and everyone looks to small business for that next big success story.
But while small business is getting most of the credit, many big businesses are indeed hiring.
Take Motorola, which has expanded its worldwide payrolls by 18,000 employees in the last two years. Over the last couple of years, it has hired hundreds of factory hands, engineers designers and marketers in Boynton Beach, Fla., to help it keep up with the explosive demand for beepers. It took on so many people that it hit the company limit of 3,000 workers in one plant -- "we like to keep things informal and cozy," a company spokesman said -- and was forced to set up a new operation, which it placed in Fort Worth.
Then there's Wal-Mart. While venerable retailing chains like Sears, Roebuck & Company and Woolworth wiped out some 80,000 jobs last year, Wal-Mart alone -- now the second- largest employer in the United States after General Motors -- created some 85,000 new jobs last year alone.
Other retailing giants like Home Depot have also helped lift total retail employment in the United States by more than 400,000 in 1993. And large chains like Toys "R" Us, Federated Department Stores and Dayton Hudson have all announced expansion plans that would add thousands of jobs -- many, to be sure, part time and without benefits like health insurance or pensions.
 
No Reports on Size
 The Department of Labor does not report how many jobs are created or lost by companies of different sizes. But anecdotal evidence suggests that big companies are also getting bigger and taking on more workers in at least half a dozen other industries, from groceries to securities, restaurants to mortgage banking and temporary help to soft drinks.
"In the service businesses generally, there has been a very definite trend that has favored the large companies," said Mitchell Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary help company, which also tracks hiring trends.
Economists who have studied job creation and destruction systematically have concluded that size is not an especially good predictor of job-creating prowess. As it turns out, jobs sprout in companies of all sizes: Small companies hire, but so do big and medium-sized ones, and big companies do a lot of laying off, but so do small ones.
"Size isn't the issue," said Frank Levy, an economist at M.I.T. "The issue is which firms are adding jobs."
The lesson, economists say, is that subsidizing small businesses or showering them with tax breaks is not the sure-fire way of stoking job creation that it is cracked up to be.
 
New Study Published
 Three economists -- John Haltiwanger at the University of Maryland, Scott Schuh at the Federal Reserve and Professor Davis at the University of Chicago -- recently completed a study, "Gross Job Flows in U.S. Manufacturing," which will be published by the Census Bureau. It is regarded by many other researchers as the most careful analysis of job creation and destruction to date. The study concluded that job creation was closely related to companies' share of total employment. The team used census data to track individual manufacturers during most of the 1970's and 1980's.
Although small companies are an important source of new jobs, the researchers found, these companies hardly have a monopoly on job creation. And while 80 percent of all private businesses are small, with 50 or fewer employees, three-fourths of all workers in the private sector work for larger companies.
Companies with 500 employees or more created slightly more than half of all the new jobs from 1973 to 1988. Companies with at least 10 workers created nearly two-thirds. But smaller operations, with fewer than 50 on the payroll -- the mom-and-pop and start-up operations that politicians often cite -- accounted for just one in five new jobs.
The team has yet to conduct the same analysis for the much larger universe of service-producing companies, but one study in Maryland -- providing a sample of about 45,000 companies -- also suggests that medium and large companies do a lot of hiring.
"Small businesses are leaner, and therefore an improving economy puts more pressure on the small guy to hire than on the big guys," Mr. Fromstein of Manpower said. "He hires first. But if the upswing continues, big companies will be hiring too."
 
Why It Matters
 Of course, the issue of who creates new jobs is more than academic or sentimental. Most politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike, have invoked the small-business jobs thesis at one time or another in support of preferential treatment for little businesses. Right now, tax breaks for small business cost the Treasury at least $3 billion a year while special loan guarantees eat up approximately an additional $1 billion every year.
In a speech last year to mayors, the President said "small businesses have created virtually all of the new jobs in our country in the last 10 years," a theme he also touched on in his 1993 State of the Union Message when he proposed "the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history."
Mr. Birch's initial statistic, labor economists say, was based on faulty analysis. Tapping into a proprietary data base that tracked employment at individual plants, offices and stores from year to year, Mr. Birch arrived at his number by counting up all the new jobs in each size category at the beginning and end of the decade. Then he divided the change in each size category by the total jobs created in the economy.
It was an approach that seemed to shed light on job growth. But, as other economists have since noted, statistically it has flaws.
"It's very easy to find that large firms seem to contract and small firms seem to grow, but the finding has no particular meaning," said David Card, a labor economist at Princeton University, who edits a journal on statistical methods.
 
Jobs Wiped Out, Too
 Another problem is that Mr. Birch's analysis ignored the distinction between net and gross job creation. In the dynamic American labor market, employers create new jobs at the rate of about 10 percent of total employment a year on average. But, as businesses shrink or disappear, they also wipe out lots of jobs.
"Using a net calculation conveys the image of a few sectors creating all the jobs," Professor Davis said.
During the 1970's and 1980's, he said, manufacturing companies with 50,000 employees or more created jobs at the rate of 6.3 percent a year, substantially lower than the average 9.5 percent for all manufacturing companies, but hardly zero.
Mr. Birch fell into another statistical trap. When big companies lose jobs, they generally simply shrink. But when small ones shed jobs, it is often because they go out of business. Unless the researcher corrects for the fact that small companies disappear from the sample, the results understate job creation by big business and overstate it for small business.
To this catalogue of statistical problems, perhaps the biggest is that the Small Business Administration defines small business as any company with fewer than 500 employees, which includes more than 98 percent of all companies -- and not just the corner hardware stores or local car dealers that most Americans have in mind when politicians push for special tax treatment or exemptions from government regulations.
Ultimately, many economists say, not only is the theory that small businesses create all the jobs misleading, but it does not provide a good rationale for government to come to the aid of small businesses even if it were legitimate.
"Even if it were true on average, there is nothing to say that the particular policy the Government is considering would create more jobs at the margin," Mr. Katz of the Labor Department said. "The real question is whether a particular tax preference or other policy makes sense, not whether some group of companies is the biggest job creator."

HEADLINE: THE ASSASSINATION IN MEXICO;
The Other Victim

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico, March 24

 BODY:
With the killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the governing party's presidential candidate, a young assassin ripped at the frayed promise of political stability that has been at the source of the party's 65 years in power.
Almost from the start of his political career, Mr. Colosio had been fashioned by his mentor, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, to represent a new Institutional Revolutionary Party, one that would keep its control over Mexico by modern means. 
 As the party leader for three years until 1992, Mr. Colosio overhauled its powerful machine. As the Government's first Secretary of Social Development until last fall, he personified its effort to contain the social tensions born of its shift from a heavily protected economy to one of free trade, limited state intervention and close partnership with the United States.
And as the party's candidate in elections scheduled for Aug. 21, the 44-year-old Mr. Colosio had struggled to maintain its pledges of better economic times and more democratic politics at a moment when things in Mexico have rarely seemed so uncertain.
 
Lights 'All Gone Out'
 "It was as though there was a light on here, with Nafta, with the election," the novelist Carlos Fuentes said in a telephone interview today, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. "And now it's as if the lights had all gone out."
Mr. Colosio's slaying in the northern city of Tijuana, on the same border where he grew up in a small, dusty farm town, took place almost as far as it could have in Mexico from the peasant uprising that exploded with the New Year in the southern state of Chiapas.
Yet just as powerfully as the rebellion of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, the assassination suggested the limits of the new Mexico's ascension over the violent and corrupt forces that marked the old one.
What motive might have driven the 23-year-old killer, Mario Aburto Martinez, remained unclear tonight, and there were indications that he might have been deranged.
According to the police, Mr. Martinez described himself as an industrial mechanic who had gone to Tijuana from the politically troubled western state of Michoacan, and as a former funeral parlor employee who wrote books on pacifism.
 
Speculation Ranges Wide
 In casting about for someone to blame, though, Mexicans were quick to wonder about other possible forces behind the violence: the ruthless Tijuana-based drug traffickers who were blamed for the killing of a Catholic Cardinal in the Guadalajara airport last May; the sort of renegade former police agents suspected in the recent kidnapping of a wealthy financier, Alfredo Harp Helu; one of the political adversaries in this most competitive of presidential campaigns.
No matter how wild it gets, there is some twisted reason to the speculation among Mexicans about Mr. Colosio's killer. Where so many interests so deeply vested have been hurt by the Government's efforts to reorient the economy and reconfigure its base of power, there is a sense that almost anything has become possible.
"He represented the continuation of the changes that Mr. Salinas has started," a political analyst in Mexico City, Luis Rubio, said of Mr. Colosio. "And in doing that, he alienated a good chunk of the people who had traditionally held a stake in the system."
Among the handful of fortyish, American-educated technocrats from whom Mr. Salinas chose a candidate last year, Mr. Colosio had emerged as the one most likely to continue his economic and social policies while holding together a governing coalition that is increasingly strained in its embrace of rich and poor, of old party hacks and new, more independent political forces.
What Mr. Colosio was leading, as he knew well from his tenure as the party president, was less an organization of members than a political machine in which the Government brings together and manages a shifting constellation of interests.
 
Fear of Division
 Six years after a governing-party defector, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, pushed it closer than ever to losing the presidency, the coalition wore its fear of division like a thick scar. Yet its central myth -- that all the country's political forces had room beneath its roof, that it alone could keep the country from political turmoil -- had essentially survived.
Under Mr. Salinas's tutelage, Mr. Colosio sought to adapt that myth to changing times.
Even as he pledged and repledged his devotion to clean elections, greater democracy and a reorganization of the country's corrupt judicial system, he made a clear point of bringing in the old guard.
Since the revolt by mostly Mayan Indian peasants in Chiapas, Mr. Colosio had seized the banner of democratic change more forcefully, endorsing many of the political changes demanded by the insurgents. And following the announcement on Tuesday that his chief party rival, Manuel Camacho Solis, would not challenge him for the presidency, Mr. Colosio's campaign -- which never came close to trailing in the polls -- appeared as strong as it has since the year began.
With his sudden, violent death, it seemed likely that at least some Mexicans would turn again to the governing party, out of familiarity if nothing else. But in choosing a new candidate, the party also faces an enormous challenge.
 
Two Possible Candidates
 A law holding that cabinet members and state governors must step down at least six months before running for election would seem to leave only Mr. Camacho and the former Education Minister who was managing Mr. Colosio's campaign, Ernesto Zedillo, as viable choices among Mr. Salinas's top aides. But many governing-party leaders remain deeply angry with Mr. Camacho for his public flirtation with the idea of a breakaway candidacy. Mr. Zedillo, while perhaps a less contentious choice, was also criticized -- for running a weak campaign.
More immediately, the question is how the new candidate will be chosen.
Were the party to act on what Mr. Colosio described as one of his plans and call for the first primary vote, it could face a wrenching new episode. But if Mr. Salinas were to follow tradition and decide alone, he would do so in the face of a clamor for democratic change such as Mexicans have not seen in decades.
"Colosio was supposed to be the candidate who would avoid any rifts, and the rifts came," said Mr. Fuentes, who was among those calling for an open election of the new candidate. "How many more reasons do you want to finally opt for the democratic way in Mexico?"

HEADLINE: THE WHITEWATER INQUIRY: Washington Talk;
Great Lengths to Delay a Senate Vote, With Charity for None

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
In "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," Jimmy Stewart reached for the most inspiring thoughts in American history when he filibustered against corruption by reading from the Declaration of Independence: "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness -- That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed. . . ."
In the real Senate early today, Republicans trying to delay an education bill were not so picky. Apparently desperate for material, they made the clerk read from President Clinton's budget message: "The fiscal year 1995 budget, which I transmit to you with this message, builds on the strong foundation of deficit reduction, economic growth and jobs. . . ." 
 Even that sounded better, though perhaps not to Republican ears, than their first effort at delay, when they directed the clerk to read the entire 231 pages of the House-Senate compromise on that education bill they disliked, beginning: "The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate. . . ."
The purpose of that six-hour reading was to delay until after midnight the filing of a motion to cut off debate. Under the rules, that put off the vote on closing debate, scheduled for Friday, until Saturday. And that interfered with senators' plans to rest, meet constituents and raise campaign money.
The motive of Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, in starting the fight was his complaint that the conferees had thrown out an amendment that he had got the Senate to adopt. His amendment would have barred any Federal school aid to any state or locality that prevented "constitutionally protected school prayer in public schools by individuals on a voluntary basis."
Mr. Helms insisted that his amendment had been the clear will of the Senate but that it had been subverted in the House-Senate conference by Senator Edward M. Kennedy. "I am the one Senator Kennedy is trying to roll," Mr. Helms told the Senate. What the conferees inserted instead was a much narrower prohibition; it forbade using any money available under this bill, the so-called Goals 2000 measure, for anti-prayer policies.
The House had come to the negotiation with no language at all on prayer in its bill, although representatives had grandstanded with the House's most historically meaningless kind of vote, a motion to instruct its conferees to take the Helms language. Nobody around the Capitol today could recall when House conferees last paid any attention to instructions.
Mr. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, insisted that everyone had been told in advance that the prayer issue would be the last matter dealt with by the conference, that Mr. Helms had been shown the language that was finally chosen and did not complain -- and that, anyway, the Republicans who were negotiators (Mr. Helms was not) had made no objection.
There is another set of reasons behind the bad tempers and displays of some of the silliest rules any parliamentary body has ever developed.
Democrats are anxious to leave for this recess with some record of accomplishment, and Republicans are trying to thwart them.
In the House, Republicans threatened to tie up the institution with meaningless votes and forced the Democrats to put off their crime legislation until after Easter. In the Senate, the issue isn't settled yet, but politics is at least as much a part of the equation as prayer.
The most immediately affected prayers are not those of Mr. Helms's constituents, but of senators who are Jewish and may not be able to get home for Passover, which begins at sundown Saturday, if the Senate meets that day.
A spokesman for Senator Helms said the Passover question "did not enter his mind."
From time to time today, meetings were held trying to resolve the fuss over school prayer. But if no compromise is found and the filibuster goes on, perhaps life can imitate art and steal directly from Senator Jefferson Smith's lines in the 1939 film.
It would be particularly appropriate, after all, for a dispute that is supposed to be about prayer to use one of his closing lines from the movie filibuster when he quoted from the First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians, "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity."

HEADLINE: BOSNIA SERBS LIST DEMANDS ON TALKS

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia, March 24

 BODY:
Leaders of the Bosnian Serbs said today that they would not take part in talks on an overall peace settlement in Bosnia until United Nations sanctions against federal Yugoslavia are lifted.
Members of the self-proclaimed parliament of the Bosnian Serbs today also endorsed their leaders' rejection of a new federation of Bosnian Croats and Muslims that emerged from mediation by the United States and Russia. 
 The assembly's decision was no surprise. Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the self-proclaimed parliament of the seized territory that the Bosnian Serbs call the Srpska Republic, called the union an unnatural creation that would tear itself apart.
"The Republic of Srpska demands that before any further negotiations the international community meets its obligations towards Serbs regarding the suspension, lifting of sanctions," a statement by the assembly of Bosnian Serbs said.
 
'Formal End to Bosnia'
 Noting that Bosnian Serbs had not been consulted in advance on the agreement between the Bosnian Croats and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, the statement said the new federation "means a formal and legal end to the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
It underlined that the Bosnian Serbs' ultimate goal continued to be forming a Greater Serbia by joining the Serbian-controlled territory in Bosnia to other Serbian-held territories in the former Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian Serb assembly's decision came after Bosnian Serb forces hijacked and looted a United Nations aid convoy, forcing its Danish drivers to walk across a front line the Serbs said was mined, carrying a white flag.
A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Zagreb said the Bosnian Serbs had forced the unarmed Danish drivers from the 10 trucks at gunpoint, and then stole their personal possessions.
 
94 Tons of Aid Hijacked
 The United Nations said the convoy was held up on Wednesday while carrying 94 tons of food and medicine to the Muslim enclave of Maglaj. Nine of the 10 trucks were still missing and drivers said some medicine was dumped in a river.
It was the most audacious yet in a series of provocations the Serbs have directed at United Nations forces since their involvement in Bosnia began, and raised once again the question of the extent of political control over the Bosnian Serb army.
Yugoslavia's Tanyug news agency said the convoy was stopped because the road was mined, and that there was no hijacking. It later quoted Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, as saying the "insane" person responsible had been fired.
United Nations officials discounted claims that the hijacking of the convoy was the work of an individual, saying the assailants were armed and in uniform.
Meanwhile, a United Nations decision to invite Turkey to send soldiers to join the peacekeeping force in Bosnia brought sharp criticism from Bosnian Serbs, Greece and Bulgaria.
The United Nations had been reluctant to accept Turkish troops for Bosnia because of centuries of Ottoman rule in the Balkans. Mr. Karadzic said the United Nations decision was "one among several very dangerous precedents created in the Yugoslav crisis."

Black-Run Denny's Unit Taken Over

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 24

 BODY:
Nearly two years after Donald J. Bohana opened the first black-owned Denny's restaurant here, serving soul food to attract black customers, officials of the restaurant chain have seized control of the establishment.
The Flagstar Companies, Denny's parent, said in a statement that they had acquired the franchise from Mr. Bohana because he was having difficulty meeting his financial obligations as a result of "current economic conditions in Southern California." 
 The parent company, based in Spartanburg, S.C., said Mr. Bohana had agreed that the restaurant, situated in the Watts-Willowbrook area, would be "best operated as a company restaurant in order for it to remain in the community."
The success of the Watts-Willowbrook Denny's, the first full-service restaurant to open in the area since the Watts riots of 1965, is important to the Denny's chain, which is seeking to improve its reputation among blacks.
 
An Image to Live Down
 Last year, dozens of black customers filed lawsuits, charging that Denny's restaurants around the country refused to serve them or made them pay for their meals in advance.
Coleman Sullivan, a spokesman for Denny's, said the company had been operating the Watts restaurant for the last week and was continuing to serve soul-food dishes like oxtails, chitterlings, collard greens and sweet potato pie, which Mr. Bohana introduced. The restaurant also serves Denny's standard fare.
Denny's has said that the popularity of Mr. Bohana's soul-food menu helped spur the chain to use a regionalized-menu concept at its 1,504 restaurants as a way to increase generally sagging sales.
It remains unclear why Mr. Bohana failed to make the restaurant's lease and loan payments. Employees of Flagstar and of Los Angeles County, who are familiar with its balance sheet and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the restaurant generated enough revenue to cover its bills.
 
Employees From Neighborhood
 Mr. Sullivan said that while new managers had been hired to oversee day-to-day operations at the restaurant, the 45 employees had been retained. Many of them live in the area. Denny's is seeking a new franchisee for the restaurant, preferably someone black, Mr. Sullivan said.
"From a business standpoint, it makes sense for us to be in Watts because the restaurant is in a good location where there's a lot of traffic," he continued. "But we also recognize that this was the first full-service restaurant in the area, and we bear a special responsibility to people in the community to provide them with services they otherwise would not have."
Denny's officials declined to disclose terms of the acquisition of Mr. Bohana's restaurant or to specify the nature of his financial trouble. But county officials said today that he had failed to make payments on a $735,000 county government loan he received because the restaurant was in a redevelopment zone. In addition, they said, Mr. Bohana had not been paying leasing fees at the shopping plaza where the restaurant is situated.
Mr. Bohana declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer, Jesse Young, who did not return phone calls to his office.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
What do Arkansas lawyers say about the Rose firm? For starters, they're glad it isn't them.

BYLINE: By David Margolick 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Driving home to Minneapolis from Florida the other day, Louise Larson took a detour to inspect the Rose Law Firm, alma mater of Hillary Rodham Clinton and an unhappy epicenter of the Whitewater affair. Arriving at the firm's red brick offices, Mrs. Larson, an older woman who wore her white hair in a tight bun resembling a Q-Tip, walked up to the front door and handed her Instamatic to a newspaper photographer stalking Rose lawyers. Just then a member of the firm poked his head out of a window above.
"What are we now, a tourist attraction?" he said. "We're turning into Graceland!" 
 It was one of the few recent public utterances of any kind by a Rose lawyer.
When the firm was flying high, its members easily met the Little Rock bar's lofty standards for gregariousness and gab. At the time, Mrs. Clinton and three other Rose partners -- Vincent W. Foster Jr., Webster L. Hubbell and William H. Kennedy 3d -- were Washington-bound, and the 28 partners left behind seemed destined for influence and prosperity once inconceivable for an Arkansas law office.
Now Mr. Foster is dead, and Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Kennedy are under attack. Mr. Hubbell, the firm's former managing partner and ethics czar (and, The American Lawyer magazine had recently speculated, a future Supreme Court justice), is both unemployed, having resigned as Associate Attorney General, and accused by his former partners of padding his expense accounts. And the Rose firm itself, which claims to be the oldest law office west of the Mississippi, has had to fight off insinuations that it surreptitiously shredded documents, engaged in conflicts of interest and overbilled clients. Beyond all that, of course, it stands accused of inept public relations.
Consequently the pipeline from the partnership to the press has largely run dry -- except, that is, for leaks about Mr. Hubbell's predicament. The firm's managing partner, Ronald Clark, is also its spokesman, but he is a spokesman who rarely speaks. Other partners talk tersely and with a stiff upper lip: one, Herbert Rule 3d, told a reporter that he and his colleagues were less preoccupied by Whitewater and its fallout than by the progress of the University of Arkansas Razorbacks in the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament.
But if the Rose brass is not talking, other lawyers around Little Rock surely are -- although only some of them for attribution. ("It's a small town," one explained. "Let me rephrase that: It's a small state.")
Conversations with them find consensus on a number of points.
First, they are relieved that it is not the internal workings and billings of their firms that are under inspection by the press and the Whitewater special prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske Jr. -- a process from which, they feel, few lawyers could possibly emerge entirely pristine.
Second, they are shocked by the willingness of some Rose lawyers to whisper tales about Mr. Hubbell to the press. "Apparently there are a lot of people talking about what's going on, but not for identification," said Alston Jennings Sr., a Little Rock lawyer.
Third, they are puzzled by the firm's decision to go after Mr. Hubbell, a former Mayor of Little Rock who remains popular here and who is, they believe, guilty at worst of sloppy bookkeeping. Asked about motive, they suggest possibilities as venial as shell shock among people unaccustomed to scrutiny, and rudderlessness at an institution whose best and brightest left for Washington; as venal as greed; as petty as bruised feelings; as grand as a plot by powerful Republican clients to bring down Bill Clinton.
Some lawyers think that one faction at Rose, a firm that has traditionally been more a loose confederation of fiefs than a cohesive whole, remains irked at Mr. Hubbell because of his defeat in a case that he assumed for his in-laws on a contingency-fee basis, a loss that reportedly set the firm back $1 million.
"Lawyers are arrogant, and they have more than their pro rata share of arrogance over there," one lawyer said of the Rose firm. "If a lawyer does anything that embarrasses them or costs them money, they take him out of the herd and stone him to death. Margaret Mead had a few things to say about this, and I don't think things have changed in a million years."
Others speculate that the firm, out to polish its sullied image, is offering Mr. Hubbell to the public as a sacrificial lamb. Some point to residual anger at him for his role four years ago in deposing C. Joseph Giroir Jr., then the firm's managing partner and largest rainmaker. Some think a few Machiavellian Rose lawyers are deliberately messing things up, a pre lude to walking away sanctimoniously with a few clients.
These lawyers say they do not doubt that the Rose firm, which dates from Arkansas's days as a territory, will survive. But in what form, with what personnel, at what level of prosperity and with what roster of clients -- all that is another story.
Clients, they note, do not like lawyers who seem unable to keep private matters out of the public eye. "If you have a legal problem, are you going to go to a law firm where you have to run a gantlet of everyone from 'Hard Copy' to Ted Koppel to get through the door?" said one Little Rock lawyer, Jeff Rosenzweig. "Are your secrets going to be safe, or is Bob Fiske going to go over them?"
In a rare interview, Mr. Clark, the Rose firm's current managing partner, would say little about Mr. Hubbell. But he called the firm's new notoriety "somewhat amusing," said morale there was "generally very good" and predicted no financial fallout.
"We've gotten very strong support from our clients," he said. As for the firm's lawyers, he added: "If anyone chooses to leave, that's their business. I have no reason to believe that any lawyers will leave."

HEADLINE: The Law as the Free Market's Rogue: Hostage to the Prisoner's Dilemma

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
KATE: For someone who has nothing nice to say about lawyers, you certainly have enough of them around.
GARFINKLE: You have to. They're like nuclear warheads. They have theirs, so you need yours, but . . . they're only good in their silos.
-- "Other People's Money,"
 by Jerry Sterner 
 Looking for a new reason to blame lawyers for it all? Economists are at your service.
One recent study documented a strong negative link between the proportion of law graduates in a country's work force and its rate of economic growth. Another estimates that litigation between companies reduces their combined stock value, on average, by 1 percent -- real money in a world of multibillion-dollar corporations.
But as many a learned counsel would be happy to point out, there is a seeming contradiction in economists' distaste for lawyers. Modern economics is built on the rock of competition and free choice. If lawyers, who are certainly competitive, can find willing customers for their services, where do economists get off second-guessing the market?
Not to worry, lawyer-bashers. Two seasoned practitioners of the dismal science, Profs. Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton and David Bloom of Columbia, have just come up with an explanation. Competitive markets do sometimes fail to produce efficient outcomes, they note. And they believe that the market for legal services fails in a particularly perverse and fascinating way, known in the jargon of the mathematical theory of games as "the prisoner's dilemma."
Consider a pair of criminal suspects, each held incommunicado. There is no direct evidence of their guilt, and so they can be convicted only if one confesses. Hence, the prosecutor offers each a deal. If only one turns state's evidence, he goes free while the other receives a stiff sentence. If both confess, they both go to jail, although the sentences are less severe.
Were the two prisoners able to coordinate their strategies, neither would confess and neither would go to jail. But since neither can be sure what the other will do, both have incentive to act in a mutually destructive way. A confession, after all, means either freedom or a light sentence. Hanging tough while the accomplice confesses brings the worst possible outcome, what game theorists call "the sucker's payoff."
The prisoner's dilemma is old news to military strategists. It figures in every arms race and may go a long way toward explaining why cold wars become hot ones. But what does it have to do with lawyers?
 
Noncooperation Dominates
 Take Smith and Jones, who disagree about the ownership of $100,000 worth of property. They can settle the dispute very cheaply by splitting the difference or by asking a neutral party to arbitrate. Alternatively, either can hire a lawyer for $10,000 to represent him in a formal proceeding.
Jones believes that by hiring counsel while Smith does not, he can improve his chances of winning by at least enough to make his $10,000 expenditure worthwhile. Likewise for Smith. On the other hand, if both hire lawyers the value of legal representation is neutralized, and the total size of the pie to be split between the two parties is reduced to $80,000.
So one might expect that Smith and Jones would cooperate -- that is, that the incentives offered each of them by the free market would lead them to minimize the collective cost of settling their dispute. What makes the prisoner's dilemma so compelling and so frustrating is that noncooperative behavior dominates cooperative behavior in spite of the certain knowledge that the process will burn $20,000 in legal fees.
 
'Agents of the Devil'
 And it is here that Professors Ashenfelter and Bloom strike their blow against the bar, offering evidence that noncooperation pays -- that the likely payoff in hiring a lawyer does exceed the cost.
In a yet-to-be-published paper entitled "Lawyers as Agents of the Devil," the two economists looked first at public-employee wage disputes from 1981 to 1984 in New Jersey, where arbitrators, rather than splitting the difference, were required to choose one of the disputants' final offers. By the estimates of Professors Ashenfelter and Bloom, expert representation sufficiently increased the probability of winning to make it worthwhile to hire a lawyer.
They also examined the outcomes of 755 union grievance proceedings in Pennsylvania in which arbitrators decided whether employers had the right to discharge workers. Here, they assumed that the loss of a coveted union job cut an average worker's future earning power by 10 percent, and calculated that the improved chances of keeping that job by retaining a lawyer was worth at the very least $5,000 -- far more than the cost of representation. Similar results were found in a study by the Rand Corporation Institute for Civil Justice involving debt-collection, personal-injury and breach-of-contract cases resolved through arbitration in Pittsburgh.
 
But Where Does Justice Lie?
 It is possible, Professors Ashenfelter and Bloom concede, that cases in which both sides are represented by lawyers are most likely to produce equitable results. If that is true, then there is no genuine waste -- no failure of the legal market to produce an efficient result -- assuming that justice has a value exceeding the extra cost of hiring lawyers to pursue it.
But a lawyer's job in the adversarial system is to win, not to produce justice, notes Prof. Gordon Tullock, lawyer by training and economist by sensibility at the University of Arizona. Thus it is also possible that the presence of lawyers reduces the probability that a judge, a jury or an arbitrator will arrive at the just solution.
Indeed, Professor Tullock believes that the continental European legal system, in which the court itself takes the lead in ferreting out and interpreting evidence, is both cheaper and more just than the American system.
 
Gladiators and Peacemakers
 In any event, economists may not have the last word on the games that lawyers and their clients are compelled to play. Douglas Baird, director of the law-and-economics program at the University of Chicago Law School, contends that the "traditional prisoner's dilemma ends badly only because the prisoners aren't able to communicate or to hold the other to an agreement." And, he asserts, those conditions do not typically apply to legal disputes.
Profs. Ronald Gilson of Stanford Law School and Robert Mnookin of Harvard Law School press the point further in an article soon to be published in the Columbia Law Review. They argue that if parties to a dispute believed that they stood to gain collectively from cooperation, and if each was in a position to neutralize the advantage of trickery by the other, would not cooperation become the dominant strategy?
By the same token, they believe that lawyers themselves often have strong incentive to signal a willingness to cooperate. Since many clients prefer to hire lawyers who are disinclined to no-holds-barred warfare (providing the other side does the same), it would pay many lawyers to establish reputations as peacemakers. And indeed they note that the divorce bar is clearly divided between "gladiators" out for blood and "peacemakers" who seek amicable resolution.
But if the free market is inclined to reward lawyers who use low-cost strategies, why has there been an escalation in civil litigation in recent decades? One reason, Professor Mnookin argues, is that as the legal profession has grown, it has become harder for lawyers to establish a clear reputation as peacemakers among other lawyers and potential clients.
Another is that commercial law has become more complex, offering more ways for an advocate to hide his intentions and fail to honor the spirit of an interim agreement. This "noise" in the legal system is often so loud, Professor Mnookin suggests, that it is easy to misinterpret the other side's strategy. And a very noisy case may lead to the classic prisoner's dilemma, in which neither party can risk a cooperative stance lest he be tagged as the sucker.
 
'Cooperative Boutiques'
 While the two economists see lawyers as the problem, Professor Mnookin views them as the potential solution. He wants to make it easier for lawyers to establish and sustain professional reputations as reliable peacemakers -- for example, by letting them more simply withdraw from cases in which clients pressure them to act uncooperatively. And he imagines the establishment of "cooperative boutiques," laws firms that would handle only cases in which all parties signaled their interest in cooperation.
The big question here is whether lawyers as a whole have the will or the way to reduce the demand for their services. And Professor Tullock is plainly skeptical. How, he wonders, could the bar cotton to reforms that would cause "many lawyers to become vacuum cleaner salesmen?"

The figures here, from a survey of wage arbitration results in New Jersey from 1981-1984, are the percentages of cases won by each side. (Source: Orley Ashenfelter and David Bloom)

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Killing and Inflation Fears Spur Gold and Silver Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A precious metal rally accelerated yesterday as gold and silver prices surged on buying linked to the Mexican political assassination, fresh overseas demand and nagging inflation fears.
Indeed, silver prices jumped to their highest levels in more than four years, reflecting in part Mexico's role as a leading producer. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for May delivery, the most active futures contract, jumped 9.3 cents, to $5.745 an ounce. 
 April gold rose $4.50, to $391.90 an ounce on the Comex.
Since March 8, silver has gained about 11 percent. Gold has risen just 4 percent in the same period.
"There was some catching up to be done," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Company.
He said the main factor behind gold's gain was the fatal shooting of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, who almost surely would have been Mexico's next president. Gold is considered a safe investment in times of global political uncertainty as well as in inflationary times.
Mr. Colosio's death also contributed to a steep drop in the United States stock market yesterday. Analysts said falling stock prices increased investor demand for gold.
The gold rally began overnight in Hong Kong on buying by Middle Eastern syndicates returning to the market after the monthlong Ramadan observance, said George Milling-Stanley, precious metals analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. "Gold came in like an express train," he said.
Mr. O'Neill said inflation worries remained in the background despite the relatively low inflation that has characterized the American economy for the last year. "Although there's no immediate inflation, I do think the metals are expressing some future inflation fears," he said.
Mr. Milling-Stanley discounted inflation jitters as a factor in gold's advance. He said the metal was moving higher on reawakened demand from the Middle East, the Far East and India that would likely push gold's price above $400 an ounce in the second quarter, if not sooner.
The precious metals rally also extended to platinum. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum for April delivery surged $4, to $408.10 an ounce.
Also at the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices rose in quiet trading ahead of today's OPEC meeting in Geneva, where oil ministers will discuss production quotas for the second quarter. May crude oil gained 18 cents, to $15.08 a barrel. April home heating oil rose 0.19 cent, to 45.21 cents a gallon, and April unleaded gasoline rose 0.07 cent, to 46.66 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Districts To Improve Business Proliferate

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
On the south side of West 40th Street at Eighth Avenue, a man in a white uniform and broom was busily sweeping one morning earlier this week. On the north side, a man dressed in cherry red was doing the same.
Each man worked for a different business improvement district, those increasingly ubiquitous organizations dedicated to sanitation, security, sales promotion and other tasks that property owners have decided to pay for themselves. There are now 31 such groups, called B.I.D.'s, in New York City, and as many as 15 others are being formed. 
 "B.I.D.'s have made a stunning difference in midtown," said Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square district, whose street cleaners wear the cherry red suits. "When districts feel clean, they feel orderly. And when they feel orderly, they feel safer."
 
New Fashion District
 The white-suit cleaners belong to the new Fashion Center Business Improvement District, which celebrated its beginning yesterday with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donna Karan and apparel industry executives. "People had talked about it for several years," said Carvel Moore, the executive director. "The success of what was happening in Times Square, 34th Street and other B.I.D.'s was the clincher."
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Finance, calls the improvement districts an example of "reinvented government."
"They are a recognition by the city government, however inadvertently, that the city does not do what the people were already paying taxes for," he said. "The B.I.D.'s do this job very well and they also do this job very cheap."
Mr. Dyson wants eventually to rebate 50 percent of the assessments that property owners pay to be part of the districts, a program he estimates would cost $7.5 million and acknowledges the city cannot now afford. His goal is to see Manhattan, at least south of 96th Street, blanketed with improvement districts.
 
Lower Manhattan
 In another step in that direction, business people in lower Manhattan are in the final stage of filing an application to set up an improvement district downtown that would be the city's largest, with more than 100 million square feet of building space. Public hearings have been held this week, and organizers hope to have the organization up and running by year's end.
"This is something that has to happen for downtown to keep up with midtown," said Tom Cusick, the president of the Fifth Avenue Business Improvement District, who is also steering the new district through the application process.
The success of business improvement districts has inspired Douglas Elliman, the large Manhattan real estate company, to begin work on what it calls a residential improvement district. It would extend from 59th to 96th Street and from the East River to Central Park, and fall under the same sort of laws as those governing business improvement districts.
The principal goal would be to augment security, with private guards working closely with officers of the 19th Precinct, though other improvements are also contemplated. "This is reinventing our neighborhoods," said Lucius Riccio, the former Transportation Commissioner, who is a consultant on the project. "We want to create a total environment where people can feel safe."
The functions of the districts are constantly expanding. The Grand Central Partnership has sold $32 million in bonds and the 34th Street district has taken in $25 million to finance such improvements as street lights, curbs, trash cans, signs and newsstands. Mr. Malkin, the largest landlord in both districts, said property owners annually pay 11.5 cents per square foot in the Grand Central district, compared with $8 to $12 a square foot in property taxes.
In addition to the new directions, some midtown districts are expanding. The Fifth Avenue district is getting approval to absorb Madison Avenue from 53d to 61st Street. The Grand Central Partnership is adding three increments totaling 15 blocks. Business people on the Avenue of the Americas, now surrounded by improvement districts, are considering joining one or more districts.
Business improvement districts are authorized by state and local laws passed in the early 1980's. The city's first was the 14th Street-Union Square district, which began in 1984. It was the joint initiative of the heads of the Consolidated Edison Company, the Guardian Life Insurance Company and the New School.
"The streets were filthy and businesses were leaving," said Robert Walsh, executive director of the district.
The process of forming a business improvement district involves a variety of filings and procedures that take 9 to 12 months. The most important requirement is convincing the city that all property owners have at least heard of the initiative. There is no vote. To stop the formation of a district, 51 percent of property owners must make a formal filing of their objection.
The groups vary in their goals, though sanitation and security are high on almost all agendas. The Times Square district, for example, has striven to promote the idea that the area's tawdry image is changing through free shows by Broadway stars and the like. It is studying the effects of pornography on Eighth Avenue.
The Fashion Center district wants to ignite interest by buyers from department stores and other large purchasers. Enticements will range from cheap air tickets and hotel rooms to an on-line video program of available services.
The Grand Central Partnership has spent $2.7 million to illuminate its namesake terminal. It has also cut crime and removed homeless people from the terminal and surrounding streets and got them into homes and jobs.
The new Fashion Center group will work with the Bryant Park group to stage twice-yearly fashion shows in the park. "This will attract attention to this essential industry," said Mr. Malkin, who is also a founder of the fashion improvement district, in which he owns 10 showroom buildings.
Barbara Wolff, the assistant commissioner in the Department of Business Services, the city official who oversees business improvement districts, likes to tell a story to illustrate how the groups work. During a blizzard this winter, she encountered one of the Times Square sanitation workers, clad in cherry red, furiously shoveling snow. She asked why he was working so hard since the snow was still falling.
"Well, this is my job," he said. "I'm making New York City a clean place."

Claims Drop By Jobless

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 last week, the Government reported today.
The Labor Department said a seasonally adjusted 340,000 people filed initial claims at state unemployment offices in the week that ended last Saturday. That was down from a revised 345,000 the previous week, which was earlier reported as 342,000. 
 Economists are expecting similar declines in the weeks ahead as spring weather permits construction crews to put in more hours and factories to step up production levels.
The Labor Department said its four-week moving average of jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 337,250, a decline of 8,750 from the previous week. It was the lowest level since Jan. 8. That number is more closely tracked by economists because it smooths out the fluctuations in the weekly number.
The Labor Department said Ohio had the biggest decrease in the number of initial claims during the week ended March 12, with a decline of 4,010. California followed with a decline of 3,604. No reason was given for the Ohio decline, but the report said there were fewer claims in most industries in California.
Other states reporting large declines were New York, 3,420; Connecticut, 2,204, and Illinois, 2,181. The report cited fewer layoffs in the construction and service industries in most states that showed a decrease.

HEADLINE: All We Need Are More Manufacturing Jobs;
The Overqualified Trap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Two of the job seekers in "Low Pay and Closed Doors Greet Young in Job Market" conclude that to find more challenging jobs "they will have to go to graduate school" (front page, March 10). Unless they choose a field of study in high demand, graduate school is not a simple solution.
Indeed, a graduate degree can lessen the chance of finding a job if one does not have substantial experience beforehand. The experience trap is such that most positions that require a master's degree also require two years of experience. Entry-level positions that would enable one to gain experience require only a bachelor's degree. Thus companies are reluctant to consider applicants with advanced degrees because they are perceived as overqualified.
Times of structural shifts in the economy highlight the deficiency of a market economy in matching employees with employers. From an economic standpoint, unemployment and underemployment reduce the productive potential of the economy. From a human perspective, a spiral of rejection can lead to destruction of self-esteem.
Young people leave college with self-confidence, believing they can help change the world. At the end of the humiliating job search they wonder if they can change a light bulb.
Other than through contacts and unethical insider information, the prime way people look for jobs is through newspaper want ads. Many newspapers have yet to enter the computer age, except for a few like your Fast Track service. It is time consuming for applicants to sift through the want ads and for businesses to go through hundreds of resumes. Computerized searches using new software would greatly increase the efficiency of matching applicants with employers.
Therefore, Congress ought to speed approval of the computerized national jobs bank contained in the Clinton Administration's job retraining plan. Putting jobs on line maximizes both economic efficiency and social justice, which cannot be said of too many things.

HEADLINE: Moscow, March '94: Chaos and Hope

BYLINE: By Richard Nixon; Richard Nixon, the former President, returned a week ago from his 10th trip to Moscow in 35 years.

DATELINE: WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J.

 BODY:
Those who suggest that because of its vast problems Russia should no longer be treated as a world power ignore an unpleasant but undeniable truth: Russia is the only nation in the world that can destroy the United States. Therefore Russia remains our highest foreign policy priority.
The Russia I saw on this trip is a very different nation from the one I visited just one year ago. Optimism about the future is being replaced by pessimism. A strongly pro-American attitude has in many cases become disturbingly anti-American. Boris Yeltsin is still a political heavyweight but he is no longer a superman. When Russia was a dictatorship as part of the Soviet Union, a good relationship with the man at the top was all that was necessary. This is no longer enough. 
 Not all the news is bad. Contrary to some reports in the Western media, the departure of some prominent reformers from the Government does not mean the abandonment of reform. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will continue to implement free-market reforms. Though the program would be more gradual, Government leaders say, it would also be more comprehensive and not limited to a tight monetary policy.
But Russia's political scene can only be described as chaotic. President Yeltsin has lost much of the mystique from his historic role in the destruction of Soviet Communism. He may be finding that history is against him. Over the centuries, revolutionary leaders have not been good nation builders. But it would be premature to write Mr. Yeltsin off because of his frequent absences from Moscow and his increasingly erratic conduct. The first freely elected President in Russian history, he is still the country's most popular politician -- the best guarantor of Russian democracy and stability until his term expires in 1996. The U.S. should treat him with respect and work closely with him.
But America should also pay more attention to the new generation of Russian leaders -- many of whom I met -- such as Grigory Yavlinsky, an impressive young economist; Sergei Shakhrai, the analytically minded Minister of Nationalities; and the formidable Economics Minister Aleksandr Sho khin. All in their late 30's or early 40's, they are not yet ready for top leadership, but they are without question presidential material. The 55-year-old Prime Minister is now generally acknowledged to be the front-runner to succeed Mr. Yeltsin.
All the key opposition figures -- and I met with them all, including the Communist leader, Gennadi Zyuganov; the Liberal Democratic Party chairman, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi -- stated categorically that there can be no return to the Soviet past. And they all assured me that they would pursue their objectives through constitutional means. Mr. Zyuganov is an impressive Communist Party hard-liner, but when I asked him if the nation could ever return to Communism, he ruefully replied, "No, we cannot cross the same river twice." After 75 years of Godless communism, in Russia today God is alive and Communism is dead.
Although President Yeltsin reacted negatively to my seeing Mr. Rutskoi, on reflection he should realize that Rutskoi supporters will split the Zhirinovsky vote and reduce the threat to Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Zhirinovsky is a ruthless, shrewd demagogue. But after examining him at length on issues ranging from his views on foreign policy to his attitude toward the U.S. and anti-Semitism, I share the view of President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine: he will not be elected President of Russia. He lacks the presence and conviction to lead a great nation. For Hitler, anti- Semitism was a faith; for Mr. Zhirinovsky, it is a tactic, a cynical attempt to exploit popular biases.
When I questioned him about some of his ludicrous statements -- that California would one day be part of Mexico, that Miami would be a black republic, that Paris would be an Arab city -- he referred to opinion polls about his popularity. One of his top associates (who had attended our meeting) said later that Mr. Zhirinovsky had intentionally adopted the extravagant posture of a holy fool. For centuries these "yurodiviyel" were opposition figures whose very inadequacy protected them from brutal repression. Although Russians have always had a soft spot for holy fools, they have never chosen them as their leaders -- as Mr. Zhirinovsky will soon discover when he enters the presidential sweepstakes.
The most disturbing development since the December election has been the sea change in Russian's foreign policy. The rhetoric of Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has shifted 180 degrees. Before the election, he was too pro-American for his own good. Now he has changed his emphasis on universal human values and commonality of interests with America to a renewed Russian superpower role and the need for Moscow to chart its own course. It is without question a change of the head, not the heart. He has read the election returns and is reacting like any other politician.
Most important, the U.S. should be candid with Russia when our views do not coincide. We are great world powers and our interests will inevitably clash, but the greatest mistake we can make is to try to drown differences in champagne and vodka toasts at "feel-good" summit meetings. The highest art of diplomacy is not to paper over irresoluble differences with gobbledygook, but to find a way to disagree without damaging profoundly important strategic relationships.
In implementing the Partnership for Peace, we cannot allow Russia to determine the future of NATO. The alliance -- the main security bridge across the Atlantic -- is too important to America and to Europe to be sacrificed for the sake of Russian sensitivity. Moscow should be offered guarantees that NATO expansion to include Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia will take place gradually and will not endanger Russian interests. If it does not find those guarantees adequate, we will have to agree to disagree; Russia must not be given a veto over a NATO decision to expand.
Russia has legitimate interests in the region, particularly for the protection of 25 million Russians in the former Soviet republics who suddenly became foreigners in their own land. The claim that Russia is again becoming an imperialist power is exaggerated. Despite their imperial nostalgia, most Russians and their leaders are reluctant to engage in new adventures or even accept economic responsibility for the newly independent states.
The independence of all the former Soviet states is important. The independence of Ukraine is indispensable. A Russian-Ukrainian confrontation would make Bosnia look like a Sunday-school picnic. Moscow should be made to understand that any attempt to destabilize Ukraine -- to say nothing of outright aggression -- would have devastating consequences for the Russian-American relationship. Ukrainian stability is in the strategic interest of the United States. To the extent that Kiev is prepared to proceed with economic reforms, supporting these efforts should be a national security priority for the U.S.
I found no one who had a good word for the U.S. aid program. The issue is not the amount but how it is administered. Rip-offs, shakedowns and outright corruption among recipients, along with incompetence among administrators, have combined to create enormous disillusionment. President Clinton would be well-advised to order an immediate, comprehensive review of aid to Russia and the other former Soviet states before Congress forces him to do so.
The survival and success of political and economic reform are not only in the interest of the Russian people. They are in the interest of peace, since democracies are less likely to wage war against one another. Above all, reform is in the interest of freedom. Its success would provide an example for others to follow; its failure would embolden dictators and would-be dictators throughout the world.
It is a miracle that the new Russian revolution still shows promise. The reformers may fail even with our help. They will certainly fail without it. Mr. Clinton deserves bipartisan support on providing adequate aid to the forces of freedom in Russia. But this support should be hardheaded, without illusions about Russian conduct and without the sacrifice of U.S. interests.

HEADLINE: Mexico: Shaken, but Strong

 BODY:
For Mexico this has been a year of trial by fire, and it is only March. After the jolt of a January guerrilla uprising, Wednesday's assassination of the front-running presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, has profoundly shaken the confidence of what was long thought to be one of Latin America's most stable political systems. On this side of the border, investors who welcomed Mexico's emergence as an open and modernizing economy are now reassessing their bets.
But panic would be exactly the wrong response in either country. Without prettifying Mexico's still imperfect democracy, Washington should strongly reaffirm its confidence in and commitment to Mexico's underlying stability and its continuing reformist course. And Mexico should continue buttressing its economic reforms with greater democracy, a cause Mr. Colosio identified himself with. 
 The very day Mr. Colosio was murdered at a Tijuana campaign stop, Mexico's Congress was voting for constitutional changes proposed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in an effort to make the August presidential election the most cleanly run in the country's modern history.
These changes stemmed from President Salinas' enlightened recognition that the Indian rebellion in Chiapas signaled a broader need to rebuild popular faith in a political system too often vulnerable to accusations of fraud and bossism. Mr. Salinas has also responded well to the Chiapas crisis by promoting a negotiated solution with the rebels.
One consolation for this year's troubles is the encouraging resiliency it has called forth from a political establishment once notorious for its complacency. During the last presidential election year, 1988, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has been in power since 1929, was so rigid and unresponsive that it became an embarrassment even to its own candidate, Mr. Salinas.
Today, largely thanks to him, the PRI is stronger and more popular, though it is still no paradigm of internal or external democracy. A reasonably open and competitive process for choosing a candidate to succeed Mr. Colosio would be a useful further advance.
Also important at this stage is to undertake a credible inquiry into the Colosio killing and to assure a verifiably free and fair election campaign and vote count. The United Nations and the Organization of American States, both experienced in supervising Latin American elections, should make themselves available to help, if so requested.
Mexico's friends share its horror and outrage at this intrusion of murder into its political life. Assassination is the polar opposite of democracy -- a man with a gun stealing choices that belong to a majority at the ballot box. The best response would be for Government and opposition parties to agree to reinforce democracy by accelerating the political reforms already under way.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Client Is Lenin

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
After a meeting with the Prime Minister of Communist China, the Prime Minister of Japan had this to say:
"I told him that it is not proper to force a Western or European-type democracy onto others." 
 According to press reports, the Prime Minister of Japan, Morihiro Hosokawa, also said that the "Western" concept of human rights should not be applied to all nations.
Wrapped up in those statements is the historical falsehood, ethical duplicity, human callousness and political betrayal that the international China lobby now deploys to carry out its latest assignment from Beijing.
The job is to pressure the Clinton Administration to renege on its pledge that unless Beijing shows some respect for the human rights of Chinese and Tibetans the U.S. will end China's low tariff privileges.
What arrogance -- for a Japanese Prime Minister to talk so. Does he think we have forgotten that millions of Asians, Europeans and Americans had to die to defeat Japanese imperialism and allow democracy to be "forced" on Japan -- the system that allowed him to be elected, become Prime Minister and run about kowtowing to the Chinese Communists and insulting our intelligence?
Mr. Hosokawa is Japan's business, but his line is at the heart of the propaganda of the businessmen and politicians who make up the American branch of the China lobby.
In Washington suddenly, people who believe in human rights are being pictured as cultural and political imperialists trying to push around a bunch of dignified old Confucianists.
The truth is that nobody is dreaming of "forcing" Western democracy on Communist China; such a sinful thought. American human rights policy asks simply that Beijing permit some of the decencies to which it is already pledged as a member of the U.N. and signatory to a variety of international conventions.
For example: the right to dissent without being arrested, tortured and imprisoned for years. The right of Tibet to negotiate for at least partial freedom after a half-century of Chinese captivity.
Please, please do these things, the U.S. begs. If not at last we will have to do what Congress has demanded for years -- refuse to cooperate with Chinese despotism by continuing the low tariff rates that oil its economy.
Forget that sociodrivel about Confucianist traditions being at odds with "Western" human rights. The Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi puts it straight in The Los Angeles Times: The Communists fight human rights not because they are Confucianists but because they are Leninists. For all its increasing armed power Beijing, like all dictatorships, knows the greater power of creeping freedom.
Is there one member of the China lobby who respects himself enough to speak the truth? Listen, we are in China to make money in a cheap labor market. If U.S. human rights policy interferes with that by upsetting the Communists, to hell with it.
We get only the pious line about how a strong Chinese economy will bring more human rights -- presumably as under the economies of imperial Japan and Hitler's Germany.
Decision time for President Clinton is May or June. He is being pulled one way and another. A President gets paid to be pulled one way or another -- and remain true to his word.
Rumors float: The fix is in for Beijing, the lobby has won. Government officials of honor say no, the struggle goes on, and I believe them.
Maybe Beijing will make the concessions. Those low tariffs mean a lot to them. The dictatorship will not change much. At least the U.S. will have kept faith with the people in the torture cells.
But the American businesses in the China lobby -- they have lost already. They have shown themselves pantingly eager to use the greatest American asset -- the economic power created by free labor and capitalist strength -- to bolster a Government built on controlled labor and police strength. They certainly will not be respected in China.
At home? Certainly it has happened before -- the arming of foreign dictatorships that prostitutes American idealism, endangers American security and produces a new generation of American cynics. But that does not make it any easier for Americans who believe in political freedom to watch, excuse or forget.
