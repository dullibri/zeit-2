¶The Food and Drug Administration, Washington, will work with at least six agencies and a foundation on a new antismoking effort, which has a budget of up to $390 million to be spent during the next five years. The roster includes three agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies: Campbell-Ewald, DraftFCB and Mullen. Among the others will be the American Legacy Foundation, the organization that works to reduce smoking among teenagers; the Grey Group, part of WPP; and Riester. Adage.com reported that some of those selected may subcontract work to agency partners; for example, the foundation works with the agencies Arnold Worldwide, part of Havas, and Fenton.
¶Fidelity Investments, Boston, named DraftFCB, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as agency of record for what the company calls its acquisition-based direct marketing business aimed at personal investors. The assignment had been handled internally. Spending was not disclosed. 
¶The Clorox Company, Oakland, Calif., chose Grupo Gallegos, Huntington Beach, Calif., for a new assignment, to lead the company's digital efforts aimed at Hispanic consumers. Spending has not been determined.

¶Bartle Bogle Hegarty, London, part of the Publicis Groupe, is shaking up its New York office after undergoing what Gwyn Jones, group chief executive of the agency, called in a statement ''some real challenges on the business side.'' In addition to the dismissals of an undisclosed number of employees, Greg Anderson, chief executive of the office, is leaving to pursue other interests, Mr. Jones said, and Richard Stainer, managing director of the office, will return to London to seek a post there. The New York office will now be led by Emma Cookson, chairwoman; John Patroulis, chief creative officer; and Sarah Watson, chief strategy officer. Adage.com estimated that 25 to 30 percent of the office's 120 employees could be let go.
¶Beth Lawrence, who since December 2009 has served as executive vice president for advertising sales and media solutions at the Weather Channel Companies, New York, is leaving, she wrote in an e-mail last week addressed to her ''friends in the ad business,'' as the company reorganized and her role ''will effectively not exist any longer.'' She did not disclose her plans.
¶Fernando Osuna, executive creative director at Lopez Negrete Communications, Houston, was named executive creative director, assuming duties from Alex López Negrete, who continues as the agency's president and chief executive.
¶Tom Telesco, president for the North American operation of Orion Trading -- part of the Orion Holdings unit of IPG Mediabrands, which is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies -- was promoted to worldwide president, assuming duties from Brian McMahon, who remains president and chief executive at Orion Holdings. Laura Ryan, executive vice president and director for client and media services at Orion Trading, was named to assume Mr. Telesco's duties as president for Orion Trading United States.
Miscellany
¶Korey Kay & Partners, New York, formed a division, KoreyKay501(c)(3), devoted to marketing communications and fund-raising advertising for nonprofit organizations. Korey Kay will work on media outreach for the division's campaigns with the CauseWay Agency, Westport, Conn., which lists among its clients the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Crime Prevention Council.
¶ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe, reduced its forecasts for worldwide advertising spending growth for this year and next. The forecast for 2012 now calls for a gain in ad spending of 3.8 percent compared with 2011; a forecast made in June called for a gain of 4.3 percent. The forecast for 2013 now predicts an increase in ad spending of 4.6 percent compared with 2012; a forecast made in June called for a gain of 5.3 percent. ZenithOptimedia attributed its downward adjustments to its forecasts for both this year and next to the economic difficulties among euro zone countries.
¶Premier Retail Networks, San Francisco, part of Technicolor, which operates more than 120,000 digital screens, is being renamed Izon Media, pronounced ''Eyes on'' to play up how consumers view the screens in stores and restaurants like Costco, 7-Eleven, Target and Walmart. To promote the name change, Izon Media will run a sweepstakes during Advertising Week in New York with two Fiat 500s as the grand prizes; it will be the first time the company is a sponsor of the annual Advertising Week.
¶Hyper Marketing, Chicago, acquired Acorn, an agency in Dublin, which will continue to operate under the Acorn name. Financial terms were not disclosed. The acquisition is part of international expansion efforts by Hyper Marketing that include plans in the next two years to open offices in Brussels, Geneva and London.
¶Worldwide advertising spending rose 2.4 percent in the second quarter compared with the same period last year, according to the Nielsen Global AdView Pulse report from Nielsen. Ad spending in the United States also rose 2.4 percent in the quarter, compared with the year-ago quarter. Ad spending in Europe fell 3.8 percent in the quarter, compared with the same quarter a year ago.

HEADLINE: Purveyors of Office Space and Lively Arts

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
One recent Monday morning the pianist Taka Kigawa took his place at a keyboard in the lobby of 1 Liberty Plaza, an office building near Wall Street, and worked through Debussy's Preludes, Book II. A small audience -- perhaps a dozen people at first, more than 100 an hour later -- sat at tables or stood on the periphery, sipping coffee, listening to Mr. Kigawa and watching the parade of businessmen and tourists drift past the large window to the pianist's left.
By the end of the 150-minute concert some 260 people had come and gone, many of them office workers who discovered the concert by happenstance.
The program, it turned out, was presented not by one of New York's major classical music organizations but by the building's landlord, Brookfield Office Properties, a high-end commercial real estate operation that has emerged as a surprisingly significant player in the arts presentation business since 1988, when it established Arts Brookfield, its cultural arm. Arts Brookfield spends about $1 million a year staging free performances and visual arts exhibitions in the public spaces of the office buildings it operates in New York, most notably in the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center. 
The company spends another $2 million annually on similar programs in Toronto, Calgary, Denver, Houston and Los Angeles. All told, that covers about 400 free events seen by an estimated 350,000 people each year.
Real estate operations have long commissioned visual artists to provide paintings and statuary for their properties, and the owners of such firms often sit on the boards of concert halls and museums or give generously to the arts. But Brookfield is alone among New York's purveyors of office space in running an arts presentation office, and its motivation is not philanthropic. Brookfield executives say that for them art is an investment in the core business that pays off in a better class of tenants and higher rents.
Stranger still, for a business that tends to the conservative, its most high-profile projects have been devoted to contemporary and avant-garde work. And performers have come to regard Brookfield as an ideal patron.
''They have been really open-minded and flexible,'' said the composer Judd Greenstein, who brought concerts from his Ecstatic Music Festival -- hybrid chamber music, rock, jazz and electronic programs -- to the World Financial Center this summer. ''You can talk to them about the power of an idea, and that's really liberating.''
Arts Brookfield is run by Debra Simon, a former dancer who joined the company in 2002 after several years at the Alliance for Downtown New York, where she was in charge of cultural planning and marketing.
''When the World Financial Center opened,'' Ms. Simon said, ''the neighborhood was nothing like it is today. And with companies like American Express and Merrill Lynch choosing to move their world headquarters down here, people were thinking that, given the lack of other amenities at the time, one way to make the place lively and engaging would be to start an arts program.''
Brookfield's presentations are eclectic: a recital by massed tap-dancers (300 of them), a kite-flying exhibition, a blues festival. At the Winter Garden, for example, ''The Sweet Life,'' a photo exhibit devoted to the golden age of Italian cinema, opened on Thursday and runs through Oct. 12. On Monday ''El Futuro Más Acá'' -- a series of Mexican science fiction films, presented by Cinema Tropical -- begins a monthlong run.
Ample jazz, pop, world music concerts and family fare run through its programming, while theater productions by the likes of New York Classical Theater, Nerve Tank and the Women's Project have increased in recent years.
Contemporary work remains the company's main calling card. Its dance presentations have included kinetic choreography by Andrea Haenggi, who had her dancers tumble along the World Financial Center's escalators with the audience in tow, and Elizabeth Streb, whose most recent piece, ''Human Fountain,'' had 18 dancers diving from a 35-foot-high scaffold onto a cushioned platform. Since 2006 the company has presented the annual Bang on a Can marathons, noon-to-midnight celebrations of contemporary styles of all stripes. This year's installment, in June, drew 10,000 listeners.
''When Deb Simon invited us to present the marathon there,'' said the composer David Lang, one of Bang on a Can's founders, ''the first thing we thought about -- even before we thought about what music we should program -- was that for the first time the marathon would be a free event. That's something we'd always wanted to do. The music we present, after all, doesn't have a name attached to it or a venue dedicated to it, and it's hard to describe to people. So having this carnival atmosphere, where people can stumble into it and discover the music as they're going to get lunch, or go to work, is very exciting to us.''
Ms. Streb, the choreographer, said that Brookfield presenting her performances free to the public is an important element of the program. ''My theory is that theater is privatized to a certain degree,'' she said, ''and I've been concerned about how to hook in people in different classes. When a corporation believes in putting its money into that, and gathering crowds to watch something, perhaps unexpectedly, that's important.''
Several performers said that Brookfield had imposed no limitations on them, although John Schaefer, the WNYC radio host who presents both a silent film series (with music) and New Sounds Live contemporary music concerts at the World Financial Center, said that performers are asked ''to recognize that it is a public space, and that they don't want anything that's too far away from family fare in terms of language or imagery.''
Naturally the challenges of performing in building lobbies are particularly acute for musicians. The cavernous Winter Garden is all hard surfaces, and the steel, glass and stone, along with the high ceiling, give the room a cathedral-like reverberation. ''I have to be very careful what I book there,'' Mr. Schaefer said. ''Some things sound great, others turn to soup. But they have a high-quality sound system, which the guitarist Robert Fripp described as 'quietly spectacular.' ''
That sound system, Ms. Simon said, will be upgraded as part of a $250 million renovation that is expected to be complete at the end of 2013. (Performances in the Winter Garden will not be interrupted.)
What's in this for Brookfield?
''We think it makes our buildings more successful,'' said Dennis Friedrich, the company's chief executive. ''We find that because it's become a global economy, workers spend more time at work, and they live closer to work, and the leaders of these firms want to be sure that the experience they can offer their employees goes beyond just the traditional business model. There is a commercial benefit at the end of the day.''
Ms. Simon said that Brookfield has never commissioned studies showing the extent of that benefit. But Bruce Surry, executive vice president of CBRE group and a broker who specializes in Lower Manhattan office space, said that the programming did make Brookfield's properties more attractive.
As Arts Brookfield approaches its 25th anniversary, Ms. Simon said she is planning to expand outdoor programming during the winter, particularly at the World Financial Center. And she finds herself drawn to what she described as ''large-scale light and video installations that can be in residence for months at a time and that will keep changing so that people can experience something new each time they see them.''
But her most ambitious project, scheduled for 2014 and still admittedly vague, will tie together all the Brookfield buildings in New York. ''The idea is to have events taking place simultaneously in every one of our spaces,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Now Entering The Month of Surprise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Surprise!
October has arrived, and with it, the specter of an "October Surprise" that might alter the political trajectory of the presidential campaign at the last minute.
In 1972,Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state underPresident Nixon, announced that "peace is at hand" in the Vietnam War just days before the election. In 1992,Caspar Weinberger, the defense secretary during the Reagan administration whenGeorge H. W. Bush was vice president, was implicated in the Iran-contra arms scandal four days before Mr. Bush lost the election toBill Clinton. In 2004, Osama bin Laden released a video statement on Oct. 29.
Will such a surprise happen again? In 1980, the nation held its collective breath waiting for an October release of the Iranian hostages; it did not happen until hours afterRonald Reagan's inauguration. It is possible that October comes and goes this year without a pivotal moment. 
But if it does come, here are five possibilities:
A DEBATE MOMENTPresident Obama andMitt Romney will stand next to each other on a stage three times during October. Each one of those debates will provide an opportunity for an October Surprise that might change the trajectory of the 2012 campaign.
That surprise might come in the form of a gaffe that raises new questions about one of the men. Or it could be a surprise policy proposal offered as a Hail Mary pass to alter the political discussion. Or it could be a striking stylistic observation that changes the way voters assess the two candidates.
FOREIGN POLICY The events in Benghazi, Libya, in September were a vivid reminder of how quickly an event overseas can hijack the political news cycle in America - and often rightly so. The Libyan situation is important in its own right, but so are the reactions to it by Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney.
What else could pop up on the world stage in October? More re-evaluations of the terrorist attack that killed the ambassador to Libya? Developments in the Iranian nuclear drama? Dramatic economic collapses in European nations already weakened and teetering? Something totally unexpected?
ECONOMIC STATISTICS Here at home, there will be one more opportunity in October for the government to report the jobless rate and other economic data. That will come at the end of this week, on Friday, Oct. 5. Will the unemployment rate go up again, hold steady, or tick down a bit? A slight change in either direction might not matter much, but a dramatic shift would definitely qualify as a potentially critical October Surprise.
There will be one more jobs report, on Nov. 2. But throughout October, the economy will be the single most important subject on the minds of voters. That means that a big gain or loss in the stock market could affect the election. So could big financial news affecting some of the country's largest institutions.
INVESTIGATIVE NEWS Journalists have already spent years delving into the backgrounds of Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama. But the digging continues, and there is still plenty of room for new revelations that could affect the outcome of the election.
In 2000, just days before the election,George W. Bush was forced to acknowledge that he had a drunken driving conviction in his past. That kind of personal information could yet emerge about one of the two current candidates. If it does, it could affect the small number of truly undecided voters.
For the two campaigns, both of which have elaborate opposition research departments, October is the last hope to peddle damaging information about the opponent.
UNRELATED INCIDENT Finally, there is always the possibility that something happens in October that has no particular relevance to the election, but steals the spotlight, an event on par with July's shooting in Aurora, Colo., or a natural disaster like the Japanese earthquake.
Both campaigns expect to have the month of October to make their final appeals to voters. If an unrelated event consumes the attention of the news media and the American public, the campaigns will find it harder to break through with their closing messages.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

After working as a lawyer for 22 years, Theodore A. Scott wanted a break. So he entered a contest sponsored by Gold Peak Tea, a Coca-Cola tea brand, offering the ultimate respite for weary workers: a year off work and a $100,000 prize.
Mr. Scott, 60, made it to the second round for which he created a video that was voted on by Gold Peak Tea fans on Facebook. To his surprise, he won the grand prize. He and his family were elated.
''Everybody is shouting and laughing and crying and so happy,'' Mr. Scott said. ''It's just like we won the Super Bowl or won the lottery.''
But the feeling was short-lived. Days later, Mr. Scott was informed that he had violated the terms and conditions of the contest and was disqualified. The reason given was that he had used an online contest forum, a Web site where people who enter crowdsourced digital sweepstakes post links to those contests and ask members to vote for them. 
But Mr. Scott did not go away quietly, and Gold Peak Tea finds that it is just the latest company to try to create excitement for its brand on social media only to find that sentiment can quickly turn.
The contest, called ''Take the Year Off,'' was one of several this year sponsored by marketers like McDonald's and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority aimed at downtrodden workers looking for respite in a tough economy.
An image on Gold Peak Tea's Facebook page promoting the contest that showed a woman kneeling against a file cabinet appearing to scream caught Mr. Scott's attention. ''I get it. I see where she is. I understand her,'' he said in an interview last week. In his contest entry, Mr. Scott described how his job had taken him away from his family. ''I had a family. I had a home,'' Mr. Scott's letter began. ''But I let my career defer them. I let my debts outweigh them. I let deadlines sideline them. I let an office, computer, phone, and e-mails crush them.''
Mr. Scott pledged to spend the year off enjoying time with his family -- he has four sons, four grandsons, and has been married for more than 35 years. ''I'll enjoy simplicity. Listen to music. Read. Write. Relax. And sip a glass of iced tea -- at home,'' he wrote in the essay.
In his follow-up video, Mr. Scott is seen at his desk, answering calls, books stacked on his desk, shuffling from office to office.
To increase his chances, Mr. Scott became a member of an online contest forum on About.com and made his pitch to the voters there. Susan Stribling, a representative for Coca-Cola, said the company declined to comment but pointed a reporter to a statement that had been posted on the company's Facebook page. According to the statement, Mr. Scott had been disqualified for trying ''to inappropriately induce members of the public to vote for his submission, a violation of Official Contest Rules.''
In an e-mail to Mr. Scott, Sarah Tabb, an associate brand manager for Gold Peak Tea, cited Section 6B of the contest rules which states that finalists were prohibited from obtaining votes by ''offering prizes or other inducements to members of the public, vote farming, or any other activity that artificially inflates such finalists votes as determined by sponsor in its sole discretion.''
Sandra Grauschopf a sweepstakes consultant for brands and the writer of the contests and sweepstakes guide on About.com, said the issues with voter forums were complicated for companies. Brands are caught between wanting to drive traffic to their Facebook pages by encouraging consumer voting and managing how those votes are obtained, Ms. Grauschopf said.
''It's a tough situation for them to be in,'' she said of the companies hosting the sweepstakes. ''On the other hand, they don't want to have their image tarnished by other people saying that there is cheating going on.''
In a statement, ePrize, the company the administered the contest on behalf of Coca-Cola, said brands were seeing ''success with promotional campaigns online, particularly in social and mobile channels.''
''But along with that, there will be more technologies developed and attempts to abuse the system,'' the statement continued. ''Of course, there are other instances in which people don't intend to break the rules but simply do not follow them correctly.''
Mr. Scott, defended his use of the forum saying he saw nothing in the rules that prohibited someone from asking for votes. ''These were real people,'' he said. ''Not robotics or the creation of fake Facebook accounts.''
Ms. Grauschopf agreed. ''In my opinion, that's not cheating if those are real people who aren't being induced.''
Coca-Cola declined to say who tipped the company off to Mr. Scott's methods.
Ms. Grauschopf said, ''It sounds to me like they are saying, we don't want the public relations problems.''
One such public relations disaster happened with another online voting contest involving American Apparel, the clothing company known for its risqué ads. In 2011, The company held a contest that asked readers to vote on who should be its plus-size model.
Nancy Upton, an entrant, submitted photos of herself in daring poses, including one where she was almost naked from the waist down and another where she was bathing in a tub of salad dressing.
In the end, Ms. Upton was voted the winner, much to the chagrin of American Apparel. After some back and forth, the company decided to select another candidate as the winning model.
In Mr. Scott's case, Gold Peak Tea chose another entrant's submission as the winner, despite a number of posts on the company's Facebook page calling for Mr. Scott to be reinstated as the winner. (Gold Peak Tea has removed some of the posts related to Mr. Scott's case citing its decency rules for the Facebook page.)
Mr. Scott has since posted a rebuttal on the Gold Peak Tea Facebook page, and has created a Twitter account to support his cause, @GoTeamTheodore. He said he is deeply embarrassed.
Linda A. Goldstein, a partner and chair of the advertising, marketing and media division at the law firm at the law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips said there was ''a very strong'' legal precedent in the courts for upholding contest rules.
''There's a broad discretion for the sponsor to disqualify an entrant,'' said Ms. Goldstein, who has worked with Coca-Cola in the past. ''The precedent in the courts for upholding the rules in the sponsor's favor is quite strong.''

HEADLINE: Right-Wing Extremists' Popularity Rising Rapidly in Greece

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
ATHENS -- The video, which went viral in Greece last month, shows about 40 burly men, led by Giorgos Germenis, a lawmaker with the right-wing Golden Dawn party, marching through a night market in the town of Rafina demanding that dark-skinned merchants show permits.
Some do, and they are left alone. But the action quickly picks up, as the men, wearing black T-shirts with the party's name, destroy a stall with clubs and scatter the merchandise. ''We saw a few illegal immigrants selling their wares,'' Mr. Germenis says in the video. ''We did what Golden Dawn has to do. And now we're going to church to pay our respects to the Madonna.''
Just a few months ago, the name Golden Dawn was something to be whispered in Greece.
But three months after the extremist right-wing group won an electoral foothold in Parliament, talk of Golden Dawn seems to be on everybody's lips. 
In cafes, taxis and bars, Greeks across the political spectrum are discussing the palpable surge in Golden Dawn's popularity, which has risen in recent political polls even as the group steps up a campaign of vigilantism and attacks against immigrants.
The poll gains come amid growing disenchantment over rising illegal immigration, and with the government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, which is being forced by its international lenders to push through $15 billion in additional, highly unpopular, austerity measures. If Greece were to hold new elections soon, Golden Dawn could emerge as the third-largest party in Parliament, behind Mr. Samaras's New Democracy and the left-wing Syriza. Currently, Golden Dawn is the fifth largest, with 18 out of 300 seats.
''We have a major socioeconomic crisis in which several hundred thousand Greeks are losing ground,'' said Nikos Demertzis, a professor of political sociology at the University of Athens. ''And you have a rising number of immigrants in Greece, many illegal. This is creating a volcanic situation where all the classic parameters for the flourishing of a far-right force like Golden Dawn are present.''
Golden Dawn's tactics are similar to ones it used before parliamentary elections in June. Preying on fears that immigrants are worsening crime rates and economic hardship, the group has been stepping up attacks against immigrants, many of whom are legal citizens, with the police frequently standing by. It is also trying to expand its reach with the Greek diaspora.
The group recently opened an office in New York, announcing its presence with a sleek Web site depicting a stylized Swastika against a darkened Manhattan skyline. The Web site was disabled by hackers less than a day later and remains down, and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association condemned the group's outreach, saying that ''fascism has no place in the United States.''
Golden Dawn has also established an outpost in Australia, where Greeks have been emigrating by the thousands to escape the crisis in their homeland.
The group is still far from being a major threat to Mr. Samaras's party, or to his fragile three-party coalition government. Most Greeks express alarm at the group's rise, and anti-fascist organizations in Athens are continuing efforts neighborhood by neighborhood to counter its increased vigilantism.
Yet, rising political and social discontent is rich fodder for Golden Dawn as it tries to cultivate a larger base. These days, it is not uncommon for conversations to evolve into laments about the ineffectiveness of Mr. Samaras's government, before a mention of Golden Dawn's rise in the polls slips in.
''People have no faith in the political system,'' said Dimitris Kaklamanos, 41, a worker at a Shell gas station in the town of Piraeus, on the outskirts of Athens.
Mr. Kaklamanos said he had long voted for Pasok, the Socialist party, but grew disillusioned with corruption and the ineptitude of its politicians. Now, he feels attracted to Golden Dawn, he said, whose popularity he expects to continue to rise, especially as the group replaces police and government services in poor areas where the state has almost ceased to function.
Other political parties ''know that Golden Dawn is gaining power and they see that as a threat,'' Mr. Kaklamanos said. ''But Golden Dawn are the only ones out there demonstrating they care about the Greek people.''
He cited food and clothing drives conducted by the group across a widening area of Athens, as well as protections it extends to vulnerable Greeks in neighborhoods where crime has surged in tandem with illegal immigration.
Kaiti Lazarou, 55, the owner of a newspaper and cigarette kiosk in Piraeus, agreed. ''I myself have gotten food and potatoes from them in Syntagma Square,'' she said. ''I would not be surprised if they become the government one day, and why shouldn't they? They protect the Greeks, while Samaras and the government are out of touch with the people.''
In an interview last week, Mr. Samaras said that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants fleeing hardship in Africa, South Asia and now Syria were creating ''major distress'' in Greece, which they use as a gateway to the European Union after entering through Turkey. He appealed to Greece's European partners to modify immigration accords so that other countries could take on a greater share of Greece's immigration burden.
With more than 1.5 million immigrants in a country of about 11 million, ''this is creating extremism'' that feeds the popularity of Golden Dawn, Mr. Samaras said. Outlawing the group could backfire by fueling their popularity, he added.
Mr. Demertzis, the University of Athens professor, said Golden Dawn was effective because it did more than just utter political platitudes. Its members ''do their propaganda through deeds, exactly the same way that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt does, or Hezbollah in Lebanon.''
In Golden Dawn's case, the most high-profile activities center on anti-immigrant campaigns, like the one documented in the video, depicted as the actions of good Samaritans.
In another raid, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the town of Missolonghi, Greek shopkeepers shout at Golden Dawn members as they walk through a fruit and vegetable market kicking over stands loaded with produce. The raid was led by another Golden Dawn lawmaker, Costas Barbarousis. ''These tactics were used in the dictatorship!'' one woman cries.
After the episodes, Golden Dawn lawmakers were barred from receiving the protection of the police, who human rights groups say are increasingly looking the other way when confronted with evidence of violence by Golden Dawn sympathizers, with some officers seeming more sympathetic to them than to their victims. Mr. Samaras played down concerns that the Greek police were sympathetic to the group. ''I'm very happy with the way they've done their job,'' he said in the interview.
Justice Minister Antonis Roupakiotis condemned the Golden Dawn attacks, saying they created ''conditions for the growth of neo-fascist practices in the country.'' He added that his ministry would consider tougher penalties for racist violence. New Democracy, Pasok and independent Greeks also condemned the attacks.
But such talk may only go so far.
''It's the current government that brought more power to Golden Dawn because the people are angry at what the government is doing,'' said Iakovos Zorzios, 73, a retiree whose pension has been cut as part of Greece's austerity measures.
''How can we not be angry when the government cuts our earnings so much?'' said Mr. Zorzios, who is bracing for yet another reduction in the latest austerity plan forged this week. ''How can they expect us not to support Golden Dawn?''

HEADLINE: Shift by Cuomo on Gas Drilling Prompts Both Anger and Praise

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- A few months after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was poised to approve hydraulic fracturing in several struggling New York counties, his administration is reversing course and starting the regulatory process over, garnering praise from environmental groups and stirring anger among industry executives and upstate landowners.
Ten days ago, after nearly four years of review by state regulators, the governor bowed to entreaties from environmentalists to conduct another study, this one an examination of potential impacts on public health. Neither the governor nor other state officials have given any indication of how long the study might take.
Then on Friday, state environmental officials said they would restart the regulatory rule-making process, requiring them to repeat a number of formal steps, including holding a public hearing, and almost certainly pushing a decision into next year.
The move also means that after already receiving nearly 80,000 public comments, the state Department of Environmental Conservation will be soliciting more input from New Yorkers about hydrofracking, or fracking, as the drilling process for natural gas is known. 
The developments have created a sense in Albany that Mr. Cuomo is consigning fracking to oblivion. The governor has been influenced by the unshakable opposition from a corps of environmentalists and celebrity activists who are concerned about the safety of the water supply. The opponents include a number of people close to the governor, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime environmental activist in New York whose sister is the governor's ex-wife.
The fracking issue is the biggest environmental question, and the most polarizing, facing Albany, and New York's decision is being closely watched nationally, as President Obama and Mitt Romney have both expressed support for increased use of natural gas as a means to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. The natural gas industry has been eager to drill in the Marcellus Shale, a deep underground repository that runs through West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. Extraction there was too complex and costly until the advent of hydrofracking.
The debate is politically complex for Mr. Cuomo, who has established a record as a social progressive and a fiscal centrist. Mr. Cuomo has been interested in fracking because of the promise that it could bring jobs to an economically struggling region of the state. The industry has also been a prolific campaign donor, and rejecting fracking would risk Mr. Cuomo's close relationship with The New York Post, which has strongly advocated for drilling.
But opposition to fracking has become such a touchstone for liberals that approving it, even in a limited fashion, would undoubtedly alienate some of his most dependable supporters. Anti-fracking protesters have shadowed Mr. Cuomo for months, at his home, his office, and his speaking engagements, and a wide array of celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Yoko Ono, have mobilized to express opposition to the technology.
''Andrew has a very good political antenna, and we've never seen anything like this in terms of grass-roots power,'' Mr. Kennedy, whose father was a United States attorney general, said in a telephone interview. ''In 30 years, I have not seen anything come close to this, in terms of the mobilization of the grass roots. You've got 20,000 people in the state who consider themselves to be anti-frack activists. So I think that's got to impact the political process all around.''
The governor appointed Mr. Kennedy, who lives in Westchester County, to an advisory panel on fracking last year, and Mr. Kennedy has been in frequent contact with the governor and his staff about the issue.
Mr. Kennedy said that he and the governor had discussed the research on fracking, including examinations of how frequently the concrete well casings used in fracking fail, exposing potential toxins. He said they had also discussed a March study from the Colorado School of Public Health that found that people living near fracking sites were more likely to be exposed to harmful air pollutants like benzene and toluene.
''I'm surprised how long he's withstood the tide,'' Mr. Kennedy said of the governor. ''I'm proud that he's done that. There's no other governor who's just said 'let's hold off.' And he's under, I can tell you, tremendous pressure by the industry and by others.''
Mr. Cuomo told reporters last week that the commission of yet another study on fracking did not signal an end to the process.
''We've said all along that the decision will be made based on the science, right?'' he said. ''It was not predetermined, it was not a political position, let's get the facts, let's make a decision on the facts. I understand the emotion, I deal with the emotion every day on both sides of the issue, right? So we get the emotion, we get the rhetoric, we get the hyperbole. Let's get some facts and data and some science, and we'll make the decision on the science, which is what should be done here.''
The governor has also said that he sees the additional health study as a way to mitigate future lawsuits.
Katherine Nadeau, a program director at Environmental Advocates of New York, said talk of an end to fracking was premature.
''From what I can tell, it doesn't seem to me that the administration is necessarily backing off, but they are listening to the enormous public concern and outcry and making sure to take this incredibly slowly,'' she said.
But industry and landowner groups are growing increasingly concerned about the shifting tone toward fracking expressed at the Capitol.
Brad Gill, executive director of the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, an industry group, said that while some of his members ''have made the decision to move on, those that remain are taking Governor Cuomo at his word. But they are also struggling.''
''After four years of waiting, any additional unforeseen circumstance, irrespective of its merit or cause, places an extraordinary burden on those fighting to be part of a new New York,'' he added, referring to one of Mr. Cuomo's campaign slogans.
Scott Kurkoski, the lead lawyer for the Joint Landowners Coalition of New York, a pro-fracking group, was more pointed.
''The part that concerns us is our governor has said he wants to keep it out of politics and focus on the science, but it looks like politics is really taking over now,'' he said, adding that some smaller landowners who were hoping to lease out their land for fracking were facing foreclosure.
''I don't think the governor cares about the plight of the upstate New York landowners,'' he said.
In horizontal hydraulic fracturing, large volumes of water and chemicals are injected deep underground at high pressures to break up rock formations and release pockets of natural gas. In the late spring, the administration had drawn up a plan to approve fracking in portions of several New York counties located west of the Catskills, along the border with Pennsylvania, and to permit it only in communities that express support.
But that plan only hardened opposition.
''The governor's office is moving cautiously by floating solutions and listening to the critiques,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''You really feel like there's some democracy happening here.''
It was not entirely clear what further health impacts would be studied that were not already encompassed by the review process that began in the summer of 2008. In a statement in response to questions, the Department of Environmental Conservation said ''health impacts were not overlooked'' in the agency's prior reviews, and ''were fully assessed'' in a draft environmental impact study that was released last year.
Joseph Martens, the agency's commissioner, said last week: ''Obviously if there was a public health concern that could not be addressed we would not proceed.''
Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Binghamton Republican and leading proponent of fracking, said he hoped the new study was ''the last major hurdle,'' adding, ''I want to believe that.''

HEADLINE: Attacks On 6 Banks Frustrate Customers

BYLINE: By NICOLE PERLROTH

 BODY:
Six major American banks were hit in a wave of computer attacks last week, by a group claiming Middle Eastern ties, that caused Internet blackouts and delays in online banking.
Frustrated customers of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and PNC, who could not get access to their accounts or pay bills online, were upset because the banks had not explained clearly what was going on.
''It was probably the least impressive corporate presentation of bad news I've ever seen,'' said Paul Downs, a small-business owner in Bridgeport, Pa. ''This is extremely disconcerting.'' 
The banks suffered denial of service attacks, in which hackers barrage a Web site with traffic until it is overwhelmed and shuts down. Such attacks, while a nuisance, are not technically sophisticated and do not affect a company's computer network -- or, in this case, funds or customer bank accounts. But they are enough to upset customers.
A hacker group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters -- a reference to Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim holy man who fought against European forces and Jewish settlers in the Middle East in the 1920s and 1930s -- took credit for the attacks in online posts.
The group said it had attacked the banks in retaliation for an anti-Islam video that mocks the Prophet Muhammad. It also pledged to continue to attack American credit and financial institutions daily, and possibly institutions in France, Israel and Britain, until the video is taken offline. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were also targeted.
On Friday, PNC became the latest bank to experience delays and fall offline. Customers said they had been unable to get access to PNC's online banking site, and those that visited the bank's physical locations were told it was because PNC, and many others, had been hacked.
Fred Solomon, a PNC spokesman, said Friday afternoon that the bank's Web site was back online, but that it was still working to restore online bill payment. Asked why the bank was not better able to withstand such an attack, he said that while PNC had systems in place to prevent delays and disruption from hacker attacks, in this case ''the volume of traffic was unprecedented.''
Representatives for other banks also confirmed that they had experienced slow Internet performance and intermittent downtime because of an unusually high volume of traffic.
Security researchers said the attack methods were too basic to have taken so many American bank sites offline. The hackers appeared to be enlisting volunteers for the attacks with messages on various sites. On one blog, they called on people to visit two Web addresses that would cause their computers to flood banks with hundreds of data requests a second. They asked volunteers to attack banks according to a timetable: Wells Fargo on Tuesday, U.S. Bancorp on Wednesday and PNC on Thursday.
But experts said it seemed implausible that this method would create an attack of this scale. ''The number of users you need to break those targets is very high,'' said Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault who has been investigating the attacks. ''They must have had help from other sources.''
Those sources, Mr. Blasco said, would have to be a group with money, like a nation, or botnets -- networks of infected computers that do the bidding of criminals. Botnets can be rented through black market schemes that are common in the Internet underground, or lent out by criminals or governments.
Last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview on C-Span that he believed Iran's government had sponsored the attacks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. The hacker group rejected that claim. In an online post, it said the attacks had not been sponsored by a country and that its members ''strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public opinion.''
The hackers maintained that they were retaliating for the online video. ''Insult to the prophet is not acceptable, especially when it is the last Prophet Muhammad,'' they wrote.
It is very difficult to trace such attacks back to a particular country, security experts say, because they can be routed through different Internet addresses to mask their true origin.
But experts said they had seen an increase in such activity from Iran and in the number of so-called hacktivists, hackers who attack for political purposes rather than for profit, based in Iran.
''We absolutely have seen more activity from the Middle East, and in particular Iran has been increasingly active as they build up their cyber capabilities,'' said George Kurtz, the president of CrowdStrike, a computer security company, and former chief technology officer at McAfee. ''There is also a strong activist movement underfoot, which should be concerning to many large companies. The threat is real, and what we are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg.''
James A. Lewis, a computer security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in this case, the attack methods used were ''pretty basic'' to have been state-sponsored. But he added that even if the attacks were not the work of Iran's government, the state would be aware of them because Iran monitors its networks extensively.
For Mr. Downs, the small-business owner in Pennsylvania, such half explanations were of little consolation.
''A major bank has a problem and gives no indication of what's happening, when it started or when it will stop,'' he said. ''That's pretty freaky if it's your own business's money and you need to do things with it.''

HEADLINE: Plan for Charter City to Fight Honduras Poverty Loses Its Initiator

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Paul Romer is a respected economist with an unconventional plan to lift people out of poverty. And in Honduras, he thought he had found a government eager to put his ideas into practice.
What if you simply sweep aside the corruption, the self-interested elites, and the distorted economic rules that stifle growth in many poor countries and set up a brand new city with its own law and governance?
The charter city, as Mr. Romer calls it, would be administered by countries that have developed strong institutions and rule of law. If it sounds crazy, think of Hong Kong. 
Once Honduras signed on and its Congress passed a law at the beginning of 2011 to start the process, the concept moved from big idea to a tentative possibility. Stories followed in The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times Magazine.
But now, Mr. Romer, an expert on economic growth, is out of his own project, tripped up by the sort of opaque decision making that his plan was supposed to change.
An internal contradiction in the theory is playing out: To set up a new city with clear new rules, you must first deal with governments that are trapped in the old ones.
''I do feel disappointed on behalf of the people I have gotten to know,'' said Mr. Romer, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business and the director of its Urbanization Project. ''The Hondurans who hoped this would be a way to escape from business as usual.''
The tipping point came with the announcement a few weeks ago that the Honduran agency set up to oversee the project had signed a memorandum of understanding with its first investor group.
The news came as surprise to Mr. Romer. He believed that a temporary transparency commission he had formed with a group of well-known experts should have been consulted. He withdrew from the project.
The law setting up Honduras's experiment in a charter city, a special development region, or RED in its Spanish initials, creates flexibility that promotes innovations, but requires strict disclosure along the way, Mr. Romer said. ''The one absolute principle is a commitment to transparency,'' he said.
Octavio Sánchez, the chief of staff to President Porfirio Lobo of Honduras and the government's point person for the project, agreed that a transparency commission with foreigners on it would be essential once all the laws were in place. ''We would love him to be there,'' he said of Mr. Romer. ''Because he really believes in this.''
The investor group is led by Michael Strong, an activist who has worked in the past with libertarians like John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods. He promises that his investors include Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Central American investors, but when pressed for details, named only one Guatemalan businessman.
With $15 million on hand, he said, the group will begin with a small pilot project to build infrastructure and is already talking to prospective tenants.
Mr. Strong also said he had plans in the future to build low-cost housing and set up schools, but he admitted that ''A lot of things we don't know until the RED government goes up.''
With so few details made public, even the normally pro-government newspapers in Honduras have begun to question whether there is any real money behind the project.
Opponents on the left have been filing challenges with the Honduran Supreme Court against the charter cities plan. The news of the investment deal brought more.
According to Mr. Strong and others involved in the project, including Mark Klugmann, an American consultant who is working with Mr. Sánchez, the transparency board never legally existed. Mr. Sánchez agreed, although he had never disputed the existence of the board in the past.
Mr. Romer said that President Lobo signed the decree in his presence in December. But he acknowledged that the board was on tenuous legal footing because of the challenges in the Supreme Court. The decree was never published.
Indeed, the challenges have held up other parts of the plan, like a bill in Congress to define where the city would be. (Mr. Strong is moving ahead with options to buy land on the Caribbean coast near Puerto Cortés anyway.)
Nobody disputes that impoverished, violent Honduras needs some kind of shock therapy. ''You put the bucket list of everything that needs to be changed -- you do all the things at once in a small place,'' Mr. Sánchez said. ''We needed to create the right conditions in the midst of political turbulence.''
Mr. Sánchez, 37, who has a law degree from Harvard, had already been thinking for a decade about many of the same ideas as Mr. Romer, and was working with Mr. Klugmann on ideas for autonomous development zones when a friend gave him a copy of a video talk by Mr. Romer. ''The possibility of a foreign country ruling, that didn't fit. But everything else fit,'' he said.
The idea, Mr. Sánchez explained in a telephone interview, is to adopt ideas that have worked in other countries. A team from the government went to South Korea and Singapore. In the nation of Georgia, they found a model in Lazika, an instant city that the government has begun building that is inspired by the charter-city concept.
Mr. Strong has his own version of Mr. Romer's relationship to the project. ''When Sánchez finally saw Romer's video talk, he saw that this was a high-profile source of external validation that could help push their ideas through,'' he wrote in an e-mail. Mr. Romer's project was ''a marketing catalyst.''
Mr. Romer is now looking elsewhere.
''If it were easy to undertake social reform, it would have happened,'' he said. ''You just have to keep trying.''

HEADLINE: 25 Years of What They Need to Know

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN BECKETT

 BODY:
When Peter Pilotto began working with the Center for Fashion Enterprise in London, the fashion incubator gave him a weekly cash flow analysis of his fledgling label. ''We never even heard about cash flow in design school,'' the designer said.
But that is why over the last 25 years, centers offering training and advice on how to turn a creative effort into a successful business have spread from Milan to Dunedin, New Zealand. 
As Lisa Smilor, deputy director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America fashion incubator in New York City, said: ''We advise designers on the things they don't even know they have to learn.''
The first fashion incubator was started in Toronto in 1986 and is on the Web at www.fashionincubator.com. Toronto Fashion Incubator was established with the support of the city government, in part because fashion at that time was Toronto's second-largest industrial employer.
Many say the gambit worked. ''Research shows that the T.F.I. has created 15,000 new Canadian jobs,'' said Laurie Belzak, an economic development officer with the City of Toronto.
And ''new businesses have only a 37 percent chance of surviving four years,'' Ms. Belzak said, citing a Dun & Bradstreet study. ''But the survival rate for our T.F.I. grads is 75 percent.''
Other incubators cite similar statistics. ''Eighty-seven percent of the designers we work with are still in business,'' said Wendy Malem, director of the Center for Fashion Enterprise, established in 2002.
Mr. Pilotto signed on with the center's residence program after he and Christopher De Vos, his design partner, graduated from the fashion department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. The program provides studio space as well as mentoring and business advice. ''I had access to state-of-the-art machinery young designers could never afford on their own,'' he said.
The other fashion capitals have incubators as well. The Atelier de Paris program also offers studio space, while in Italy, the Incubatore della Moda provides everything from work areas to advertising exposure and even a place on the runway during Milan Fashion Week.
Mario Boselli, chairman of the Camera Nazionale della Moda, which coordinates and promotes fashion in the country, calls the support provided by the incubator ''an absolute necessity for young designers'' in today's competitive world. And, he says, the program has succeeded ''beyond our expectations.''
Supporting fashion businesses does not just benefit cities or industry organizations, it also secures the future of retailers. That awareness appears to lie behind Topshop's and Topman's sponsorship of the Fashion East incubator in London and the Macy's department store incubators in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco.
By 2010, so many fashion incubators had been established that a global association, the International Fashion Incubator Network, was created. The organization now has 150 members, many of which are not just in fashion capitals.
In Australia, Design Edge offers a virtual program. And in Amsterdam, the NL Fashion Incubator Foundation stages fashion shows, exposing designers to the news media and buyers.
''Many third world countries have incubators, often to try and utilize and preserve local skills'' like weaving, dying and sewing, said Tracy Kennedy, manager of the Dunedin Fashion Incubator, started in that New Zealand city in 2001.
Like other incubators, the Dunedin organization offers different levels of support, providing advice to hundreds of part-time members in an outreach program and mentoring and studio space to a handful of full-time resident designers.
Charmaine Reveley, a former resident whose dresses are sold throughout New Zealand, said she was pleased not just with the mentoring she had received from the incubator's advisory board of experts, but also by the support from her fellow designers.
''There were others who were further on in the program than I was,'' Ms. Reveley said. ''They had faced some of the same problems I was going through and could advise what to do.''
Ms. Reveley, who now has six full-time employees, said the program also gave her valuable advice about retailing. ''They brought in wholesalers, and taught us how to choose and approach a store,'' she said.
Incubators offer a variety of other services, like in Singapore, where the Action Community for Entrepreneurship has created 7,900 square meters, or 85,000 square feet, of retail space at the Millenia Walk mall. The Maisons de Mode in Lille, France's center for textile manufacturing, also provides low-cost boutique space that has helped revitalize the city.
The Dunedin incubator draws on its association with the photography students at the Otago Polytechnic School of Design to help designers create look books. And W Hotels just joined with the fashion incubator run by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in New York to provide designers with trips to the dozens of destinations where the chain has hotels to help them find inspiration.
Some incubators also offer help with public relations, although Ms. Malem in London said the center had experienced a learning curve when it came to that subject: ''We used to have one P.R. firm rep all the designers, but we learned that you need to match each one up individually.''

HEADLINE: In Debates, Obama Must Hide His Scorn

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- There may be only one impediment to President Barack Obama's maintaining his small lead in the U.S. election over the next week: arrogance.
For all the focus on the first debate between Mr. Obama and the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, in Denver on Wednesday, history suggests these forums are rarely settled on substance; Mr. Romney and the president are both smart and cautious, not gaffe-prone. The very few game-changers in debates occur when a candidate makes a mistake or exposes an unattractive personality trait.
Mr. Obama and his top political advisers are basically contemptuous of their opponent, according to people who have spent time with the president in private. Four years ago, the Obama camp viewed John McCain as wrong for the times, but had personal respect for him. 
It's different today. The president's campaign sees Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch stiff without core beliefs, willing to say or do anything for political advantage.
Fair or not, that's a derisive characterization.
It is the expression of that viewpoint, not any substantive shortcomings, that poses the greatest danger for the president in the debate. Even with a seasoned veteran, Jim Lehrer of ''NewsHour'' on PBS television, serving as moderator, you can expect the two candidates to stick largely to their programmed views and responses. More compelling and revealing would be for the candidates to question each other in freewheeling exchanges. This is off the table.
The most seminal of the 10 presidential elections with televised debates was the first: John F. Kennedy versus Richard M. Nixon in 1960.
Since then, few have changed the predisposition of voters. In 2008, the Gallup polling organization examined surveys before and after all the debates. The conclusion was that the forums had ''a substantive impact on election outcomes'' only a few times. The 2008 election wasn't one of them.
One that did matter was the 1980 exchange between Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter just before the election. It was less because of the way Reagan framed the issues -- though his line ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?'' remains a classic -- than it was his triumph on likability. Undecided voters saw him as sufficiently competent, and they warmed to the idea of seeing him on their television screens for the next four years rather than the hectoring Mr. Carter.
The other was in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore had a lead going into the first debate. Most people who watched it, and those who heard it on the radio, gave the Democrat the clear substantive advantage over Governor George W. Bush of Texas.
Yet, over the next few days, media coverage focused on the vice president's interruptions, audible sighs and disdainful exasperation toward his rival, and largely ignored Mr. Bush's substantive mistakes. A downward slide in the polls began for Mr. Gore, who lost the presidency even though he won the popular vote.
In the debate this week and the ones to follow, it's this potential for showing Gore-type scorn for your opponent that is the chief danger for Mr. Obama. In the heat of campaigns, almost all politicians develop some hostility toward their foes. After the hard-fought 1960 campaign, Kennedy said, ''If I've done nothing for this country, I've saved them from Dick Nixon.''
Yet most good politicians also possess a healthy, if begrudging, political respect for an opponent. Kennedy did in 1960. The president in this campaign doesn't even bother with begrudging. Look at the tape of an address he gave Sept. 21 in Woodbridge, Virginia, in which he sarcastically noted that ''for some reason,'' Mr. Romney ''got really excited'' when he rewrote a speech to include a new attack on the president. It wasn't so much what Mr. Obama said; it was the contempt that he conveyed in his voice and expression.
Hubris caused him difficulty once before. In 2008, after a stunning victory in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, he was cruising to a win in the New Hampshire primary that might have sealed the nomination. In a debate days before the contest, while discussing the personal appeal of his opponent, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama sniffed: ''You're likable enough, Hillary.'' That condescension produced a backlash, and a few days later she scored an upset in New Hampshire, setting the stage for a protracted nomination battle.
Team Obama is now in full spin mode, stressing how great a debater Mr. Romney is and warning that the president is a little rusty. Don't take it seriously; it's a game to lower expectations.
There are many reasons the president is ahead, including the deficiencies of his opponent and the threats to the Republican brand as the party has moved right ideologically.
There are also positive explanations, including the sense that Mr. Obama inherited an economic mess and made things better. And, no small matter, the president easily wins the likability contest; by huge margins, voters say they would prefer seeing him rather than Mr. Romney on their TV or computer screens for the next four years.
Mr. Romney can't change that; Mr. Obama could.

 BODY:
1912 Lost Hope of Peace in Balkans
LONDON -- A grave view is taken by this morning's [Oct. 1] press of the crisis in South Eastern Europe. The ''Daily Telegraph'': ''Matters have reached a far more dangerous pitch than at any time since the dramatic coup made by Austria-Hungary in 1908, and while it is still permissible to hope that war may be averted, the chances that the peaceful diplomacy of the Great Powers may prove successful are none too bright.'' The ''Standard'' says: ''The most serious of the rumors is that Bulgaria and Servia [SIC]have sent a joint Note to the Porte [SIC]demanding that autonomy shall be immediately granted to Macedonia, with an intimation that a refusal will be followed by a declaration of war. If that has really been done, the hope of peace is at an end, for it is unlikely that the Porte will yield to this brusque ultimatum.'' The ''Morning Post'': ''If the Powers decide that the administration of Macedonia must be made consistent with civilization, there is likely to be an explosion of feeling among the Turks which may put an end to peace and cause intolerable disorders, not only in Macedonia, but in other parts of Turkey.'' 
1937 France to Repatriate Refugees
PARIS -- The French government has decided to repatriate all Spanish refugees in France on grounds of economy. The decision was arrived at after consultation with the Spanish authorities, who, it was stated yesterday [Sept. 30], fully concurred with the reasons given for the French government's action. In a statement to the press last night M. Marx Dormoy, Minister of the Interior, declared that there are at present 55,000 Spanish refugees in France, who are costing the Treasury and local municipalities more than 1,000,000 francs per day. The Minister said that only those refugees who are a public charge will be repatriated, and that the sick and infirm will be allowed to remain. The refugees will be conducted to the frontier of their choice, those siding with the Valencia Government going by Port Bou, and the Nationalists by Irun.
1962 Military Escort at 'Ole Miss'
OXFORD, Mississippi -- United States military units escorted a force of 170 marshals on to the campus of the University of Mississippi this afternoon [Sept. 30]. The cavalcade was led by Mississippi state highway patrol police and reportedly university officials. Shortly afterward, James H. Meredith, the Negro seeking admission to the University, arrived at the Oxford airport. He left immediately in a car -- apparently headed for the university -- behind an Army truck carrying Federal marshals. The marshals, who earlier entered the campus, went directly to the university's main administration building, in which the registration office is located, and surrounded it. The marshals were loaded with equipment for quelling riots, but there was no physical opposition whatever. News that the marshals were coming by plane from Memphis had been flashed over radio and television and several hundred persons had rushed to the Oxford Airport in some 200 cars to see them. The sight was a harrowing one for most of the spectators, for they had dreaded a Federal show of force in desegregating their beloved ''Ole Miss.''

HEADLINE: Web Sites Promoting Ride-Sharing Grow Popular

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- On a recent Friday evening, Vincent Accart maneuvered his 20-year-old Mercedes station wagon through the rush-hour traffic to a rendezvous at a busy fuel station on the edge of Paris. There he met three strangers who hopped into his car for a three-and-a-half-hour drive to Rennes, in Brittany. It had all been arranged beforehand, via the Web.
For more than a year, Mr. Accart has been making the weekly commute to Paris, where he found new employment last year after losing a job closer to his home in Rennes. To amortize the cost of fuel and tolls -- about &#x20ac;150, or $195, for a round trip -- he fills the other seats in his car, using a French Web site that arranges shared rides. 
''When my car is full, it covers 75 percent of the cost,'' he said, adding that moving to Paris was not an option because of the prohibitive cost of housing his six-member family. ''I'm not doing it to make money, just to be able to keep my job.''
One of the side effects of the European economic crisis is a surge in carpooling, as people from many walks of life seek to cut their outlays on travel. Workers making daily treks to and from the office, students heading home for the weekend and even vacationers chasing the sun are turning private vehicles into the newest form of public transportation. Rising environmental awareness may have fueled the trend.
Paradoxically, the growth of ride-sharing services has given Europe a competitive advantage in one niche of the digital economy, where European ventures in other businesses have often struggled to keep pace with those of bigger American rivals or have simply copied U.S. ideas. Two European companies, BlaBlaCar, based in Paris, and Carpooling.com, based in Munich, are global leaders in ride-sharing. With recent capital infusions from outside investors, they are accelerating international expansion.
''It started out a bit like hitchhiking, but now it's almost like booking a seat on a train,'' said Nicolas Brusson, a co-founder of BlaBlaCar. ''The potential market is huge.''
The volume of business is impressive. BlaBlaCar says it arranges 400,000 rides a month -- the equivalent of more than 1,000 French high-speed trains, loaded to capacity. The number of drivers and passengers who have registered on the site has grown from 100,000 in 2009 to 2.3 million today.
Carpooling.com says it is even bigger, with more than a million rides booked monthly via its site and more than four million registered users.
The sites work in similar ways. On BlaBlaCar, registered drivers offer seats at prices of their choosing; the company caps these rates to prevent drivers from making profits on the trips. Passengers pay for tickets online and the company keeps a commission. Carpooling.com also shows fares from partner services like Deutsche Bahn, the German railroad.
Revenue from ride sharing remains modest. Mr. Brusson said it posted about &#x20ac;1 million in sales last year, about $1.3 million, but he added that this total was more than doubling each year.
Accel Partners, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, recently pumped &#x20ac;7.4 million into BlaBlaCar. Daimler, the German car manufacturer, invested an undisclosed amount in Carpooling.com, whose other backers include a German venture capital firm, Earlybird.
''One thing I like about BlaBlaCar is that it is not a copycat, it is an original idea coming from Europe,'' said Philippe Botteri at Accel Partners, who sits on the BlaBlaCar board.
With international expansion in mind, both companies recently adopted new names. In their domestic markets, BlaBlaCar and Carpooling.com still operate Web sites under clunkier, local-language names: covoiturage.fr in France, which uses the French word for carpooling, and mitfahrgelegenheit.de, employing the German for ''ride-sharing opportunity.'')
While most of BlaBlaCar's business is still in France, the company has opened sites in Britain, Italy, Portugal and Spain and is considering other markets. From its stronghold in the German-speaking countries, Carpooling.com has rolled out sites covering much of Europe.
In the next few months, Carpooling.com plans to start its service in the United States, where no ride-sharing site has established a nationwide presence on a comparable scale.
''We are convinced that the United States is a potentially attractive market,'' said Simon Baumann, a spokesman. ''The car is perhaps even more important there than in Europe.''
Mr. Brusson, however, said he was skeptical about the potential for the United States, citing factors like a lack of openness to public transportation and lower gasoline costs, which reduce the need to share car journeys. But while Americans have been slower to adopt Internet-arranged carpooling, they have eagerly embraced other kinds of ''collaborative consumption,'' in which individuals use the Web to share, rent or sell their own goods and services.
Airbnb, the fast-growing site that offers short-term rentals of private homes, operates on a business model similar to those of the ride-sharing sites.
While safety and security are obvious concerns for users of such services -- and for the sites that link them up -- BlaBlaCar and Carpooling.com insist that they have systems in place to reduce the potential for trouble.
On BlaBlaCar, for example, drivers have to provide their banking details and post profiles that include information about their cars. Many add pictures, thought they are not required to do so. Passengers can rate the drivers and add comments about the quality of service. Some female passengers choose to travel only with female drivers, Mr. Brusson added.
''It's very rare that we get a story of someone zigzagging at 200 kilometers per hour,'' he said. If this happens, and it is corroborated, he said, the driver involved is barred.
BlaBlaCar also came up with a quirky way to deal with another potential menace -- garrulous drivers and passengers. One feature, which gave the company its new name, is a ''blabla index,'' which lets drivers specify the amount of conversation they will tolerate.
Jerome Lefloc'h, who was traveling to Rennes with Mr. Accart to visit friends for the weekend, said he enjoyed the social interaction that could spring from sitting with strangers for a few hours.
''It's a lot cheaper than the train, and more pleasant, too, because you can talk to the other people in the car,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Burmese Odd Couple

 BODY:
It is an amazing stroke of luck that Myanmar has managed to produce both a Nelson Mandela and a Mikhail Gorbachev. Yes, such analogies are generally glib, but in this case they are apt. In Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese have an opposition figure who traded personal freedom for moral authority and now has begun to spend that moral authority wisely. Less celebrated but equally fortunate, they have in U Thein Sein a president who, though he emerged from a brutal regime and a stacked election, has embraced political and economic reform with a conviction that has stunned the most skeptical foes of the old order.
The country faces immense challenges, including corruption and cronyism, bitter ethnic/religious conflicts, and the potential disappointment if the euphoria passes and the impoverished millions are still impoverished. Until Myanmar writes a new constitution, the old guard still has the right to resume the absolute power it held for almost half a century. 
But this beautiful, long-suffering land wedged between China and India finally has the makings of a transformation that deserves America's enthusiastic help. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton clearly realize this, as do most of the advocates who have campaigned for this moment. America's ability to assist at the birth of a new, free Myanmar, though, still faces critics so invested in the cause that they are reluctant to take yes for an answer.
I heard both Aung San Suu Kyi and Thein Sein last week as they passed through New York. (You will find conversations with both posted on my blog.) They are, at first blush, improbable partners. Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent 15 years under house arrest, radiates confidence, intelligence and charm. The daughter of Burma's founding general, Oxford-educated, well traveled, multilingual, a Nobel laureate, she seems born to lead, and listening to her makes you a little embarrassed for the level of our own current political discourse.
Thein Sein is a cautious, uncharismatic man with a comb-over and wire-rimmed spectacles. He speaks through a translator, repeating well-rehearsed lines.
He grew up, the son of poor farmers, in a village in the Irrawaddy River delta. He came up through the military with a reputation as an army bureaucrat rather than a combat officer, as a sober strategic thinker, and as the rare honest man in a junta of kleptocrats. He told me he didn't travel outside Myanmar until he was a colonel in his mid-40s.
Yet these two share, in addition to an essential pragmatism, an awareness that dictatorship has led their country close to utter ruin, and, so far, the spine to stand up to the less forward-thinking members of their respective parties. Both seem impressively aware that consolidating Burma's promise depends not on the personal qualities of a few reformist leaders but on restoring the institutions and culture of democracy.
The most remarkable thing about Aung San Suu Kyi is how quickly she has learned the difference between being an icon and being a politician. Not all dissidents can see beyond injustice to the virtue of compromise, and those who do often spend as much time dueling with their allies as with their oppressors. Nelson Mandela did not rescue South Africa by spending 27 years in prison; he rescued South Africa by spending 27 years in prison, and then negotiating a power-sharing deal with the people who sent him there, to the dismay of some of his more unyielding colleagues. Aung San Suu Kyi, month by month, grows more sophisticated at using her stature without spooking the old guard. She brought her party into elections, even though she was allowed to contest only a fraction of the parliamentary seats. She has lent some of her credibility to Thein Sein's administration, endorsing an end to sanctions. She speaks of the need to make the military feel secure against retribution: no war crimes tribunal, no confiscation of property. When asked what could imperil her country's resurrection, she includes high on the list of dangers the militants within her own ranks. She is an entirely plausible next president in 2015, when Thein Sein says he hopes to retire (depending, he adds, on ''the wishes of the people'').
Thein Sein has been understandably overshadowed by Aung San Suu Kyi's heroic celebrity, but he has managed a surprisingly swift, mercifully bloodless, top-down reformation. He released hundreds of political prisoners, relaxed censorship, initiated cease-fires with several ethnic rebel groups, persuaded the opposition to participate in elections, built a circle of comparatively candid and savvy advisers, and reached out to the West. Aung San Suu Kyi says, as Margaret Thatcher said of Gorbachev, that this is a man we can do business with.
The array of human rights groups, diplomats and would-be investors who have kept the spotlight on Myanmar should feel proud of the role they have played, and most of them are in a state of happy disbelief. But there is some danger that people will draw the wrong lesson from this success story: that most of the credit belongs not to these two Burmese patriots and their ilk but to the ostracism by the Western world.
Sanctions are a crude instrument of foreign policy. Sometimes, as with Iran now, they are the best leverage we have. But they can make victims of the innocent, stir nationalist resentment, isolate the target countries from the good influence and example of free countries and drive them into the arms of unsavory allies. The U.S. isolation of Cuba has, if anything, prolonged the grim tenure of the Castros. In South Africa, sanctions (especially the expulsion from world rugby competition) shamed the ruling white minority, but the economic embargoes were easily circumvented, and the quarantine motivated the beleaguered white regime to acquire a small nuclear arsenal, later destroyed.
Sometimes we get a little intoxicated with our own goodness. When the Soviet Union denied visas to Jews who wanted to emigrate, Congress passed the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, which punished the restrictive practice by withholding most-favored-nation trade status. Senator Jackson, Representative Vanik and the Soviet Union are all dead now, and Russian Jews are free to leave, but the law remains on the books -- a relic of good intentions, and a needless source of friction.
Until very recently, the U.S. approach to Myanmar was all sticks, no carrots. It was, by some estimates, the most heavily sanctioned country on earth.
Advocates of democracy in Myanmar heatedly debate whether the sanctions accomplished much beyond making the sanctioners feel useful. Critics say the sanctions hardened the resolve of the military junta, threw thousands out of work, notably women employed in the garment trade, and allowed China to become the country's major arms supplier and trade partner.
Did they also help nudge the generals toward reform? Thein Sein insists not; he says the generals planned for two decades to democratize but thought it prudent to move gradually. That's his story and he's sticking to it. Others who know the country well suggest a variety of motivating factors other than sanctions. One was Burma's unmistakable economic decline and dysfunction, horribly amplified by the hapless official response to Cyclone Nargis in 2008. (Thein Sein was in charge of disaster preparedness, and the ghastly carnage would have presented him with a shocking demonstration of the regime's ineptitude.) Another was the popular revulsion at the killing of Buddhist monks who marched in the 2007 Saffron Revolution. We know from WikiLeaks cables that the junta -- and especially its chief strongman, Than Shwe -- was anxious about a possible war crimes tribunal. And the generals may have worried about their country becoming a pawn of burgeoning China, which hankers for access to its ports and mineral wealth.
''The Arab Spring made a big impact,'' added Thant Myint-U, a Burmese-American author and adviser to the Myanmar president. Those popular uprisings convinced the generals that unless they began to relax their grip,''they might end up like some of the autocrats in North Africa.''
Even Aung San Suu Kyi, who was a strong advocate of sanctions until the latest reforms, says their effect was subtler and more psychological than most people understand. Outside pressure did not starve the dictatorship into submission, or create the pervasive poverty. Even the displaced garment workers eventually found other markets, she says. But the military rulers made a vociferous show of blaming the West for every Burmese misery and eventually, she says, ''The regime started believing their own propaganda, that sanctions are responsible for the ills of the country.''
The most powerful effect of the sanctions against Burma may well be the lifting of them. The desperately needed rewards -- trade, aid, investment and tourism, diplomatic respect and access to expertise -- reinforce good behavior. And that is now happening as the administration and Congress slowly untangle the restrictions.
You would think the advocates of free Burma would be overjoyed, and most of them are, but not all. While Secretary Clinton was warming relations with Thein Sein, Congress in August -- led by the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, a longtime champion of Burmese liberation -- was renewing a sanctions bill called the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act that already seemed archaic. A well-informed Congressional staff member said this was done to appease advocates who were focused not on the broad moves to democracy but on narrower grievances like the plight of ethnic minorities or the exploitation of Burma's oil and gas. Fortunately, the administration is allowed to waive the restrictions in the law after jumping through various hoops.
David Steinberg, a Myanmar scholar at Georgetown University and a sanctions skeptic, said the campaign for a free Burma has always included a contingent enamored of its own righteousness. Earlier generations embraced the Spanish Civil War, and then the anti-apartheid movement, he said. ''Burma was the last good cause.''
Steinberg and other friends of Myanmar say it is now time for Burmese with grievances to seek redress from their own government, not on Capitol Hill. Aung San Suu Kyi agrees. ''I'm sorry some people feel threatened that the sanctions are going to be removed,'' she said last week. But, she concluded, ''I think it's time that we stood on our own feet.''

HEADLINE: The Real Referendum

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Republicans came into this campaign believing that it would be a referendum on President Obama, and that still-high unemployment would hand them victory on a silver platter. But given the usual caveats -- a month can be a long time in politics, it's not over until the votes are actually counted, and so on -- it doesn't seem to be turning out that way.
Yet there is a sense in which the election is indeed a referendum, but of a different kind. Voters are, in effect, being asked to deliver a verdict on the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society, on Social Security, Medicare and, yes, Obamacare, which represents an extension of that legacy. Will they vote for politicians who want to replace Medicare with Vouchercare, who denounce Social Security as ''collectivist'' (as Paul Ryan once did), who dismiss those who turn to social insurance programs as people unwilling to take responsibility for their lives? 
If the polls are any indication, the result of that referendum will be a clear reassertion of support for the safety net, and a clear rejection of politicians who want to return us to the Gilded Age. But here's the question: Will that election result be honored?
I ask that question because we already know what Mr. Obama will face if re-elected: a clamor from Beltway insiders demanding that he immediately return to his failed political strategy of 2011, in which he made a Grand Bargain over the budget deficit his overriding priority. Now is the time, he'll be told, to fix America's entitlement problem once and for all. There will be calls -- as there were at the time of the Democratic National Convention -- for him to officially endorse Simpson-Bowles, the budget proposal issued by the co-chairmen of his deficit commission (although never accepted by the commission as a whole).
And Mr. Obama should just say no, for three reasons.
First, despite years of dire warnings from people like, well, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, we are not facing any kind of fiscal crisis. Indeed, U.S. borrowing costs are at historic lows, with investors actually willing to pay the government for the privilege of owning inflation-protected bonds. So reducing the budget deficit just isn't the top priority for America at the moment; creating jobs is. For now, the administration's political capital should be devoted to passing something like last year's American Jobs Act and providing effective mortgage debt relief.
Second, contrary to Beltway conventional wisdom, America does not have an ''entitlements problem.'' Mainly, it has a health cost problem, private as well as public, which must be addressed (and which the Affordable Care Act at least starts to address). It's true that there's also, even aside from health care, a gap between the services we're promising and the taxes we're collecting -- but to call that gap an ''entitlements'' issue is already to accept the very right-wing frame that voters appear to be in the process of rejecting.
Finally, despite the bizarre reverence it inspires in Beltway insiders -- the same people, by the way, who assured us that Paul Ryan was a brave truth-teller -- the fact is that Simpson-Bowles is a really bad plan, one that would undermine some key pieces of our safety net. And if a re-elected president were to endorse it, he would be betraying the trust of the voters who returned him to office.
Consider, in particular, the proposal to raise the Social Security retirement age, supposedly to reflect rising life expectancy. This is an idea Washington loves -- but it's also totally at odds with the reality of an America in which rising inequality is reflected not just in the quality of life but in its duration. For while average life expectancy has indeed risen, that increase is confined to the relatively well-off and well-educated -- the very people who need Social Security least. Meanwhile, life expectancy is actually falling for a substantial part of the nation.
Now, there's no mystery about why Simpson-Bowles looks the way it does. It was put together in a political environment in which progressives, and even supporters of the safety net as we know it, were very much on the defensive -- an environment in which conservatives were presumed to be in the ascendant, and in which bipartisanship was effectively defined as the effort to broker deals between the center-right and the hard right.
Barring an upset, however, that environment will come to an end on Nov. 6. This election is, as I said, shaping up as a referendum on our social insurance system, and it looks as if Mr. Obama will emerge with a clear mandate for preserving and extending that system. It would be a terrible mistake, both politically and for the nation's future, for him to let himself be talked into snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

HEADLINE: Mr. Sulzberger, Publisher and Projectionist

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
In 1995, at the funeral of the extraordinary journalist James Reston, I watched Arthur Ochs Sulzberger of The New York Times escort Katharine Graham of The Washington Post up the long aisle of the National Cathedral in Washington. I was struck by their grace and dignity, by how symbolic they were of great journalism, and by how much our profession owed to the man who had published The Times for nearly 30 years. 
Mr. Sulzberger had just eulogized Mr. Reston as a man whose ''impact on The Times was profound and lasting.'' He added: ''He was a star at The New York Times, and like a star, he may twinkle, but his light will never fade.''
The same was true of the man known to the humblest and highest of his Times family as Punch. His star shines at The Times, in the Pulitzer Prize citations that line a hallway on our 15th floor, in the row of framed editorial cartoons about the Pentagon Papers outside the Page 1 conference room, in the men and women who work every day on every floor of the building -- in the newsroom, the editorial department, the Web site, the business departments that keep the paper strong even in difficult economic times.
Many Times journalists grew up professionally under Punch's leadership. For me, it was literal. My father, A. M. Rosenthal, edited The Times for nearly 20 years and worked at the paper for many more. My first memories of Punch are from when I was 7, but I know I met him earlier.
He was a mythic figure in our house -- the man who defied the orders of the White House and the threat of jail to publish the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the war in Vietnam that revealed the lies told about the war. And that was hardly the only crisis, journalistic and financial, through which he protected and steered The Times.
My father was not prone to worship, but he worshiped Arthur Sulzberger.
Some of my sweetest memories of him were the weekends when we visited his family's estate, Hillandale, in Connecticut. One night I spent an incredible hour talking to his mother, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, whose father had bought the failing Times in 1896, determined to produce high-quality, dispassionate journalism at a time when newspapers were openly partisan. I wandered around the edges of poolside parties where the guests, my father assured me, were very important people. They served great fried chicken.
But most fondly, I remember the nights when Punch would screen a film in his small theater. The publisher of what I was quite certain was the best newspaper that ever existed seemed to take as much boyish delight in the ritual as I did.

HEADLINE: Payroll Tax Rise For 160 Million Is Likely In 2013

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Regardless of who wins the presidential election in November or what compromises Congress strikes in the lame-duck session to keep the economy from automatic tax increases and spending cuts, 160 million American wage earners will probably see their tax bills jump after Jan. 1.
That is when the temporary payroll tax holiday ends. Its expiration means less income in families' pocketbooks -- the tax increase would be about $95 billion in 2013 alone -- at a time when the economy is little better than it was when the White House reached a deal on the tax break last year.
Independent analysts say that the expiration of the tax cut could shave as much as a percentage point off economic output in 2013, and cost the economy as many as one million jobs. That is because the typical American family had $1,000 in additional income from the lower tax.
But there is still little desire to make an extension part of the negotiations that are under way to avert the huge tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, that will start in January without a deal. For example, without any action, the Bush-era tax cuts will expire and the military and other domestic spending programs will be reduced. 
''This has to be a temporary tax cut,'' said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee this year and voicing the view of many in the White House and on Capitol Hill. ''I don't see any reason to consider supporting its extension.''
The White House has not pushed for an extension. ''We'll evaluate the question of whether we need to extend it at the end of the year when we're looking at a whole range of issues,'' Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters last month.
The original point of the payroll tax holiday was to stimulate consumer spending and aid middle-income households. But now Congress needs the money as it struggles with vast deficits and believes the economy can withstand the expiration.
Many Republicans vehemently opposed its passage last year, as it would divert money from the Social Security program. Many Democrats fervently supported it last year but show no such enthusiasm now. Nancy Pelosi of California, the top House Democrat, has told reporters she thinks it should expire.
Support is lacking for two main reasons. First, both Democrats and Republicans would rather focus on the broader political and economic issue of the fate of the Bush-era income tax cuts. These cuts, too, were initially meant to be temporary, but are now deeply entrenched in the tax code and central to the budget battle.
Second, though the economy has not become significantly stronger over the past year and the tax increases in addition to spending cuts coming next year could push the country into a recession, independent economists say that the economy could shoulder the payroll tax increase without undue harm.
Moody's Analytics, for instance, estimates that expiration of the payroll tax holiday would shave 0.6 percentage point off economic growth, adjusted for inflation, in 2013 -- and that the economy could safely stomach government spending cuts and tax increases totaling up to 1.5 percentage points of economic output.
Still, expiration of the payroll tax cut will increase the taxes of millions of middle-class families.
The fragile state of the recovery and the frustratingly slow growth of the economy have heightened the stakes for the end-of-year negotiations. Economists estimate that if Congress fails to forestall or unwind the spending cuts and tax increases due to take effect next year, the hit could send country back into a recession.
The Federal Reserve currently estimates that the economy will grow 2.5 to 3 percent next year, and that the unemployment rate will be 7.6 to 7.9 percent, still painfully high.
The uncertainty in the United States is ''currently a threat,'' said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, pressing Congress last week to avoid the cliff. ''It's not a threat just for the United States of America. It's a threat for the global economy.''
Some economists have pushed for an extension of the payroll tax holiday to help support the recovery -- or for its replacement with other measures to help the millions of low-income working families whose taxes will rise when it expires.
The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington-based research group, for instance, has said that the payroll tax cut has a stronger stimulative effect on the economy than many other tax cuts because the working households that receive it tend to spend the money rather than save it. Thus, it estimates that the tax cut's expiration could erase 0.9 percent of economic output and put up to a million jobs at risk.
It recommends replacing the payroll tax cut with infrastructure spending or fiscal aid to states, as a form of support for the recovery in the short term that would not have harmful long-term budget effects.
Some conservative economists have pressed for its extension as well, arguing that no Americans should have their taxes go up next year.
''Obama and Congress both need to hear this alarm clock, wake up, and get busy avoiding a payroll tax hike insult to the middle class's injuries of stagnant wages and high unemployment,'' wrote J. D. Foster, a fiscal specialist at the right-of-center Heritage Foundation.
The payroll tax holiday this year has reduced workers' tax on wages up to $110,100 to 4.2 percent from 6.2 percent. In 2012 that translated into a $700 tax cut for a person making $35,000 a year and a $2,202 tax cut for workers making $110,100 and up.
Last winter, the White House pushed a resistant Congress hard for an extension, arguing it was needed to support the flagging recovery. The White House set up a campaign for Americans to send in stories about what they would do with the extra $40 in their paychecks, and denounced Republicans as not wanting to aid the middle class.
''For the typical American family, it is a big deal. It means $40 extra in their paycheck. And that $40 helps to pay the rent, the groceries, the rising cost of gas,'' President Obama said, standing with some of the families who had sent in stories.
The other provisions at stake in the fiscal cliff negotiations overshadow the payroll tax cut.
The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that according to current law, the federal deficit would fall by more than half a trillion dollars from the 2012 fiscal year to the 2013 fiscal year. The expiration of the Bush tax cuts and other provisions would reduce the deficit by $221 billion.

HEADLINE: Waiting for an Arab Spring of Ideas

BYLINE: By TARIQ RAMADAN. 
Tariq Ramadan, professor of contemporary Islamic studies at Oxford University, is the author, most recently, of ''Islam and the Arab Awakening.''

 BODY:
London
DURING a recent visit to the United States, I was asked by intellectuals and journalists: Were we misled, during the Arab awakening, into thinking that Muslims could actually embrace democratic ideals?
The short answer is no. Participants in the recent violent demonstrations over an Islamophobic video were a tiny minority. Their violence was unacceptable. They do not represent the millions of Muslims who have taken to the streets since 2010 in a disciplined, nonviolent manner to bring down dictatorships.
Many Americans were nonetheless shocked by the chaos and bloodshed across Muslim countries, believing that they had come generously to the aid of the Arab peoples during the uprisings. But Arabs, and Muslims in general, have a longer memory and a broader view. Their mistrust is fueled by America's decades-long support for dictators who accommodated its economic and security interests; by the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan; by the humiliating treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay; and by America's seemingly permanent and unconditional support for Israel.
The United States and its European allies would be well advised to examine why Muslims are seething. Withdrawing from Afghanistan, respecting United Nations resolutions and treaty obligations with regard to Palestine, calling back the killer drones and winding up the ''war on terror'' would be excellent places to start. 
However, the time has come to stop blaming the West for the colonialism and imperialism of the past. Muslim-majority societies must jettison their historic posture as victims and accept that they are empowered actors, as millions of Arabs demonstrated last year by coming out into the streets and changing the course of history.
The timeworn dichotomy of ''Islam versus the West'' is giving way to an era of multipolar relations. The world's economic center of gravity is shifting eastward. But the growing prominence of China, India and Russia, and of emerging powers like Brazil, South Africa and Turkey, does not automatically guarantee more justice and more democracy. Some Muslims are too quick to rejoice at the decline of American power. They seem unaware that what might replace it could well lead to a regression in social and human rights and to new forms of international dependency.
The Arab peoples, like those throughout Latin America, Africa and Asia, cannot, and do not want to, disregard the cultural and religious traditions that have long defined and nurtured them. As they pursue values like freedom, justice, equality, autonomy and pluralism, and new models of democracy and of international relations, they need to draw on Islamic traditions. Islam can be a fertile ground for political creativity -- and not an obstacle to progress, as Orientalist thinkers in the West have so often claimed.
The Arab world, and Muslim-majority societies, need not only political uprisings, but also a thoroughgoing intellectual revolution from within that will open the door to economic change; to spiritual, religious, cultural and artistic liberation; and to the empowerment of women. The task is not an easy one.
A struggle for political and religious authority is taking place in these societies. There are deep divisions among Sunnis -- traditionalists, secularists, reformers, Sufi mystics -- and also between Sunnis and Shiites.
At the moment, Arab thought has been hindered by a barren ideological construct that pits secularists against Islamists, making it impossible for either to indulge in in-depth reflection about the intellectual limitations that afflict both of them.
Westernized secular elites, for all their talk of democracy and human rights, often are carrying over former colonial agendas and are deeply disconnected from the people they claim to represent. Or if they aren't -- like some grass-roots movements on the left -- their influence is marginal at best. Some have collaborated with dictators, accepted cronyism or benefited from official corruption. Others have remained close to the inner circles of the military (as in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria and Iraq). By standing against any overlapping of religion and politics, they have put forward a vision of democratization that is incoherent and disconnected from Islamic memories and traditions.
The Islamists have legitimacy, having paid a heavy price in opposing dictatorships for decades. They have made electoral gains in Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia by adapting to the shifts in power brought about by the protesters and cyberactivists. Yet they are facing contradictory expectations: they must remain faithful to their Islamic credentials while facing foreign pressure with regard to democratic processes, economic policies and relations with Israel. No figure embodies these contradictions more than Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's new president, who tried last week to forcefully rebut President Obama's absolute defense of free speech at the United Nations. But calling for limits on offensive speech is no solution. We don't need more laws. We need courageous scholars and intellectuals who are willing to discuss topics their fellow Muslims don't want to hear: their failings, their tendency to play the victim, the need to take responsibility for their actions. Only that sort of leadership will halt the tide of religious populism and emotionally driven blindness of the masses.
While the example of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., is interesting, it cannot be a reference for the entire Middle East. Turkey has a unique history; its challenges are not the same as those of the Arab world. The Arab Islamists, even as they celebrate their electoral successes, may well be entering a far more sensitive period of their history. They may lose the Islamic credibility they had as opposition forces, or be obliged to change and adapt so much that their political program is abandoned. Winning might be the beginning of losing.
Meanwhile, Salafi and Wahhabi groups with literalist interpretations of Islam have become more visible and politicized over the last five years. Having for decades refused political participation -- equating democracy with kufr (rejection of Islam) -- they are now slowly engaging in politics.
Some of these groups (known as salafi jihadists) have turned to violent radicalism. Others, financed by Islamic institutions in Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf oil monarchies like Qatar and Bahrain -- supposed allies of the United States -- have entered mainstream politics, where they promote a religious, anti-democratic populism that plays on emotions, demonizes the West (especially America) and actively undermines the struggle for democratic reform. There is a danger that the model of Afghanistan -- where in the 1980s the Taliban, supported by the Saudi and American governments, became the main force of resistance to Russian domination -- may be repeating itself.
There can be no true democracy in the Middle East without a profound restructuring of economic priorities, which in turn can come about only by combating corruption, limiting the prerogatives of the military, and, above all, reconsidering economic relations with other countries and the gross inequalities of wealth and income within Muslim countries. The emergence of a dynamic civil society is a precondition of success. Concern for free and critical thought must take the form of educational policies to build schools and universities, revise outdated curriculums and enable women to study, work and become financially independent.
The Arab world has shaken itself out of its lethargy after decades of apparent resignation and silence. But the uprisings do not yet amount to a revolution. The Arab world must confront its historical demons and tackle its infirmities and its contradictions: when it turns to the task, the awakening will truly have begun.

HEADLINE: 'North Dakota Nice' Plays Well in Senate Race

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
MINOT, N.D. -- Heidi Heitkamp, a Democratic Senate candidate, called Leonard Rademacher a few weeks ago looking for his vote, but Mr. Rademacher, a 74-year-old retiree, was feeling ill, so Ms. Heitkamp called him back.
''I said: 'Heidi, save your breath. I'm voting for you,' '' Mr. Rademacher recalled, marveling at her personal attention. ''I don't necessarily agree with her, but I trust her.''
Gary Volk backed Ms. Heitkamp, a former state attorney general, after she sat for four hours on a slab of concrete next to what was once his house, listening to his struggles to recover from catastrophic flooding last year. Larry Windus's mind was made up by an encounter with her opponent, Representative Rick Berg, a Republican, that ended with the candidate turning his back on him.
''He's not very personable,'' said Mr. Windus, 55, a dishwasher at Charlie's Main Street Cafe here. 
Senate Republicans considered the state in their column when Senator Kent Conrad, a veteran Democrat, announced his retirement last year. But with shoe leather, calibrated attacks and likability -- an intangible that goes far in North Dakota -- Ms. Heitkamp has made this a real fight. Though North Dakota is deeply conservative and is on no one's presidential map as a question mark, this race could be one of the biggest surprises of the 2012 contests. And, like all close races this year, it could help decide control of the Senate.
Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee conceded in its most recent attack ad here that Ms. Heitkamp is making headway. ''Heidi Heitkamp: You might like her, but on the issues she's wrong for North Dakota,'' it said.
The contest -- the state's first competitive one since 1986 and probably its nastiest in modern history -- features two very different politicians with very different styles: the rumpled Democrat against the well-turned-out Republican, the longtime denizen of state government against the affluent businessman. Ms. Heitkamp hugs her way through a room. Mr. Berg approached a table of women in Fargo on Wednesday and then sheepishly backed off, saying: ''We won't bug you. We'll just keep going.''
Ms. Heitkamp sees the Senate as a platform to help North Dakotans, with air service, veterans' health care, flood control, wind energy production and agricultural assistance. Mr. Berg wants North Dakota to help the nation.
''We've gone from a state that has kind of been in the bottom half of the country in terms of our economics and business to really the envy of the nation,'' he said at Butler Industries, a heavy-equipment dealer in Fargo that is booming along with North Dakota's energy and agriculture sectors. ''My passion is taking what we've done in North Dakota -- if you will, the North Dakota way -- and applying it nationally. If we do that, we can reignite America's economic engine.''
Ms. Heitkamp, surveying the slow rebuilding after the flooding in Minot, offered a different sentiment. ''You stand here, and you say this should not be,'' she said.
In short, the campaign is a contest between North Dakota Nice and the national strategy of the Republican Party.
''Everyone's pretty likable,'' Mr. Berg said with a shrug. ''The issue is not about a personality contest. This whole thing kind of boils down to, do you want someone who's going to fight against President Obama.''
Tight Senate races in Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts and North Dakota all feature one candidate who must count on voters going one way in the presidential race and another down the ballot to prevail. But in North Dakota, voters have been splitting their tickets for decades. The seat up for grabs here has been in Democratic hands for 52 years. Only once in that span, in 1964, has the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate.
But Republicans figured that those ticket-splitting days were over after the 2010 elections, when Mr. Berg defeated Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat, and Byron L. Dorgan, a popular Democratic senator, stepped down and saw the seat go to John Hoeven, a Republican who was the governor at the time. Then Mr. Conrad passed on a re-election bid this year, opening the door to an all-Republican Congressional delegation.
Yet analysts and party strategists say Ms. Heitkamp can win. She lost her last statewide campaign, in 2000, by virtual forfeit when she left the campaign trail in the governor's race to battle breast cancer. Sympathies linger.
''North Dakota is Republican, but we've had Democratic representatives for years,'' said Gordon Troxel, 76, a Minot resident who supports Ms. Heitkamp. ''That's just the way the state is.''
But Mr. Obama may yet prove to be a hurdle too high.
''The older gals are all agreeing: Heidi Heitkamp is a nice person,'' said Michael Ward, a Berg supporter. ''She fought cancer and all that. We like her,'' he added. ''But she supports Obama. That always comes up next. I don't think you can find many fans of Obama here.''
The victor in November may well be the candidate who best captures the mood of the state. Mr. Berg sees its 3 percent unemployment rate, an agriculture sector that has weathered the summer drought better than perhaps any other state in the middle of the country and a rapidly growing energy industry as a model for the nation.
A former majority leader in the legislature, Mr. Berg said the state faced a crossroads in 2002 with a proposal to pay North Dakotans to stay in the state. He opposed the measure, instead pushing through the leanest budget in memory and holding the line on taxes. Regulatory changes gave legislators the final word before new rules went into force, and competing energy interests like oil, coal and wind were harmonized under a single legislative committee.
From the Senate, he said, such successes could be replicated if the Republicans could take charge.
Ms. Heitkamp is more focused on what she sees as the struggles that remain. Soaring housing prices in the oil-rich western half of the state are squeezing residents. An influx of outsiders has brought crime and disquiet. And as national Republicans press their agenda of smaller government and balanced budgets, some basic protections have been lost.
The House's failure to pass a farm bill amid deep Republican divisions has left North Dakota's farmers uncertain, with crop insurance and price supports up in the air. The imminent expiration of a production tax credit for wind energy prompted a Grand Forks wind turbine manufacturer, LM Wind Power, to announce on Wednesday the layoffs of 345 manufacturing employees, administrative staff members, temporary workers and contractors.
''Rick Berg talks in a way that's very general: the deficit, over-regulation, Obamacare -- those are the three pillars of his campaign, mixed in with Obama, Obama, Obama,'' Ms. Heitkamp said. ''I fundamentally believe we need to get partisanship out of governance if we're going to get anything done.''
Mr. Berg says North Dakotans have a pragmatic sensibility when it comes to Washington. As he toured Butler Industries, he asked employees about the biggest challenges the company faces, hinting strongly at the answers: regulatory uncertainty, the president's health care law, the threat of tax increases.
''Well, right now, until the farm bill is passed, we definitely have some uncertainty in the agriculture market,'' said Twylah Blotsky, the company's eastern North Dakota operations manager.
Jay Kostelecky, its production support manager, came up with the recently signed highway law, which House Republican leaders struggled to pass and which covers federal infrastructure assistance for only two years, not the customary five or six. Mr. Kostelecky said Congress needed to include provisions that favor local and state contractors over the larger companies flooding North Dakota.
''I understand free enterprise and that stuff,'' he said. ''But the residents of North Dakota, they're the ones getting pushed out.''
Mr. Berg stuck to his themes. ''There's a thousand issues out there,'' he said, ''but if we can't fix these big problems, it changes the future for our kids.''

HEADLINE: Using Fame to Shine a Spotlight on the Suffering

BYLINE: By ED BARK. 
Ed Bark, a former television critic for The Dallas Morning News, is now proprietor of the television Web site unclebarky.com.

 BODY:
No network, including PBS, is above using celebrities as audience bait in the interests of making a difficult documentary subject a little more commercial.
And George Clooney lays it right out there in his introduction to ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide,'' which features six well-known ''actress-advocates.''
''The celebrity involvement may be able to amplify the story. That's all,'' he says. ''There are a lot more people that know who Diane Lane is or that know who Meg Ryan is than know Nick Kristof.'' Well, he has a point. 
Nicholas D. Kristof, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn, a former foreign correspondent for The Times and now an investment banking executive, wrote the book of the same title from which this production, running Monday and Tuesday nights on PBS stations, takes its lead. It's beautifully filmed, alternately heartbreaking and inspiring -- and more than a little preachy at times with a recurring collection of talking heads bridging the film's six actress-assisted journeys.
At least two of these additional advocates -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gloria Steinem -- also are more famous than Mr. Kristof. No harm in that.
Mr. Kristof is the dogged but unflappably genial reporter in the field. Ms. WuDunn stays stateside to underscore the points made by her husband's trips to some of the most oppressive countries in terms of basic women's rights.
In Ms. WuDunn and Mrs. Clinton's view the stakes couldn't be higher. ''The role and rights of women -- their freedom and equality and dignity -- is the unfinished business of the 21st century,'' Mrs. Clinton asserts.
Presented under PBS's ''Independent Lens'' banner, ''Half the Sky'' accentuates its subjectivity throughout the four hours. But it's hard to fault Mr. Kristof's effusive praise of the freedom fighters he introduces to Ms. Ryan, Ms. Lane, America Ferrera, Olivia Wilde, Eva Mendes and Gabrielle Union.
For the first segment, on rampant gender-based violence in Sierra Leone, he brings together Ms. Mendes and Amie Kandeh, director of the Rainbo Center. It's a place where women can take refuge and get help in pressing charges against their abusers.
The 14-year-old Fulamutu is one of the few willing to detail what she says happened to her at the hands of a pastor. ''I was afraid to tell my parents because they would beat me,'' she says.
Mr. Kristof briefly wonders about the propriety of a reporter getting involved in tracking down the pastor. But he decides there would be no embarrassment in bringing a rapist to justice.
The pastor emphatically denies any wrongdoing, while the authorities and Fulamutu's family are not of a mind to press matters. So with a heavy heart and a sense of frustration, ''Half the Sky'' moves on to sex trafficking in Cambodia, where Ms. Ryan declines to join Mr. Kristof and others on a brothel raid. She just doesn't have ''the danger gene,'' she explains to the camera. Her reluctance is understandable. But this also distances Ms. Ryan from the plight at hand. Even so, the segment soars on the strength of Somana, a teenager whose eye was gouged out by a brothel owner before she was rescued by Somaly Mam and taken to her rehabilitation center. Somana is now following in the footsteps of Ms. Mam, who says, ''My dream is to see my girls become me.''
On Night 2, Mr. Kristof and Ms. Lane journey to Somaliland for a segment on female genital cutting, a traditional practice that Edna Adan, founder of a maternity hospital, calls ''painful, unwanted, undesirable and uncalled-for.'' Severe complications in childbirth are often the result, and Ms. Lane is shocked to learn that one of the practitioners performs 10 to 12 cuttings a day as her only source of income.
''This is a capitalist venture,'' Ms. Lane says. ''Call a spade a spade.''
''Half the Sky'' keeps hope afloat with a look at economic empowerment in Kenya. Its inspirational force is Rebecca Lolosoli, who runs an all-women's village where the inhabitants make their own livings, many of them by stringing beads. And it's quite a sight to see Ms. Wilde joyously dancing with the women to what she learns is ''The Vagina Song.''
''Half the Sky'' can't be called entertaining television. But it is thoroughly edifying, handsomely produced and buoyed by brave, resilient people fighting for basic equality. Amie Kandeh, Somaly Mam, Rebecca Lolosoli and others are the real stars. The name-brand actresses they meet serve their purpose. But they've all since moved on.
Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide
On PBS stations Monday and Tuesday nights at 9 (check local listings).
Produced by Show of Force LLC and Fugitive Films in association with the Independent Television Service. Inspired by the book by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn; directed by Maro Chermayeff; Ms. Chermayeff, Mikaela Beardsley, Jamie Gordon and Jeff Dupre, executive producers; Joshua Bennett, producer; introduced by George Clooney.

HEADLINE: Millions Are Facing Food Crisis in Yemen as Global Prices Rise, U.N. Agency Says

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen (Reuters) -- Nearly half of Yemenis go to bed hungry as political instability compounds a surge in global food and fuel prices, giving Yemen the world's third-highest rate of child malnutrition, the World Food Program said Sunday. 
Yemen has been in turmoil since the revolt last year against Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had ruled for more than three decades. Already weak state control in outlying regions broke down as the army split into pro- and anti-Saleh factions and Al Qaeda militants occupied some areas.
The country has to import most of its food needs because of a paucity of arable land, and the rise in food and fuel prices has hit it badly, a World Food Program spokesman, Barry Came, said.
''Five million people, or 22 percent of the population, can't feed themselves or buy enough to feed themselves,'' Mr. Came said. ''These are mostly landless laborers, so they don't grow their own food, and with high food prices they can't buy it either.''
''There is another 5 million who are being really hard hit by high food prices and on the edge of being food insecure,'' he said. ''So 10 million people in this country go to bed hungry every night.''
The number of people receiving daily food rations from the United Nations agency has risen to more than 3.8 million from 1.2 million in January, but poor infrastructure and fear of kidnappings have complicated the logistics of providing food aid.
''They are really hit by fuel and food price rises,'' Mr. Came said, ''but there's also political instability, conflict, terrorist activity and huge population displacement. Without political security and stability you can't solve the problem.''
Thirteen percent of children were now acutely malnourished as a result of the political and economic strains of the past year, giving Yemen, which has a population of 24 million, the third-highest rate of child malnutrition in the world, Mr. Came said.
Mr. Saleh was forced to stand down in February after more than 2,000 people had died. Mr. Came said that there were now 500,000 internally displaced Yemenis after the fight with militants in the south and Mr. Saleh's 2009-10 war against Shiite rebels.
International donors pledged $1.46 billion in aid to the country at a meeting in New York on Thursday. The donors, including China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States, as well as Gulf Arab states, had already promised $6.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Fostering Tech Talent in Schools

BYLINE: By NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- Leandre Nsabi, a senior at Rainier Beach High School here, received some bluntly practical advice from an instructor recently.
''My teacher said there's a lot of money to be made in computer science,'' Leandre said. ''It could be really helpful in the future.''
That teacher, Steven Edouard, knows a few things about the subject. When he is not volunteering as a computer science instructor four days a week, Mr. Edouard works at Microsoft. He is one of 110 engineers from high-tech companies who are part of a Microsoft program aimed at getting high school students hooked on computer science, so they go on to pursue careers in the field.
In doing so, Microsoft is taking an unusual approach to tackling a shortage of computer science graduates -- one of the most serious issues facing the technology industry, and a broader challenge for the nation's economy. 
There are likely to be 150,000 computing jobs opening up each year through 2020, according to an analysis of federal forecasts by the Association for Computing Machinery, a professional society for computing researchers. But despite the hoopla around start-up celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, fewer than 40,000 American students received bachelor's degrees in computer science during 2010, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates. And the wider job market remains weak.
''People can't get jobs, and we have jobs that can't be filled,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel who oversees its philanthropic efforts, said in a recent interview.
Big technology companies have complained for years about a dearth of technical talent, a problem they have tried to solve by lobbying for looser immigration rules to accommodate more foreign engineers and sponsoring tech competitions to encourage student interest in the industry. Google, for one, holds a programming summer camp for incoming ninth graders and underwrites an effort called CS4HS, in which high school teachers sharpen their computer science skills in workshops at local universities.
But Microsoft is sending its employees to the front lines, encouraging them to commit to teaching a high school computer science class for a full school year. Its engineers, who earn a small stipend for their classroom time, are in at least two hourlong classes a week and sometimes as many as five. Schools arrange the classes for first thing in the day to avoid interfering with the schedules of the engineers, who often do not arrive at Microsoft until the late morning.
The program started as a grass-roots effort by Kevin Wang, a Microsoft engineer with a master's degree in education from Harvard.
In 2009, he began volunteering as a computer science teacher at a Seattle public high school on his way to work. After executives at Microsoft caught wind of what he was doing, they put financial support behind the effort -- which is known as Technology Education and Literacy in Schools, or Teals -- and let Mr. Wang run it full time.
The program is now in 22 schools in the Seattle area and has expanded to more than a dozen other schools in Washington, Utah, North Dakota, California and other states this academic year. Microsoft wants other big technology companies to back the effort so it can broaden the number of outside engineers involved.
This year, only 19 of the 110 teachers in the program are not Microsoft employees. In some cases, the program has thrown together volunteers from companies that spend a lot of their time beating each other up in the marketplace.
''I think education and bringing more people into the field is something all technology companies agree on,'' said Alyssa Caulley, a Google software engineer, who, along with a Microsoft volunteer, is teaching a computer science class at Woodside High School in Woodside, Calif.
While computer science can be an intimidating subject, Microsoft has sought to connect it to the technologies most students use in their everyday lives. At Rainier Beach High recently, Peli de Halleux, a Microsoft software engineer, taught a class on making software for mobile phones.
The students buried their faces in the phones, supplied by Microsoft. They were asked to create programs that performed simple functions, like playing a random song when the phones were shaken.
Leandre, who took Mr. de Halleux's mobile programming class last year and is in Mr. Edouard's Advanced Placement computer science class this year, proudly showed off a simple game he had created, Sun Collector, in which players tilt the phone to dodge black balls and hit big yellow ones.
''I never really understood what was behind these games,'' he said. ''Once you start getting it, it's pretty easy to understand.''
One of the most alarming trends for the technology industry has been students' declining interest in computer science over the last decade.
While the number of bachelor's degrees granted in computer science has been growing for the last several years, 2010's figure, the most recent available, was still 33 percent lower than at the peak in 2004, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Student interest in the field began to fade after the dot-com implosion a decade ago. It has picked up again in recent years, but slowly.
Most educators believe that for students to be excited about computer science, it is critical to introduce them to it at an early age. Yet support for the subject at cash-short K-12 schools has faded. In almost every state, computer science is taught as an elective, rather than a core requirement.
The percentage of graduates who earned credits in high school computer science classes fell to 19 percent in 2009 from 25 percent in 1990, making it the only subject among science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses to experience such a drop, according to a report by the Education Department.
Those numbers are all the more surprising considering how attached teenagers are to their smartphones, tablet computers and Facebook accounts. But that fascination in most cases is with social communications and media, rather than the technology itself. Today's easy-to-use gadgets have also concealed programming tools from users that were once far more prominent in computers.
Finding capable computer science teachers is also hard. Few other industries are as good as the technology business in its ability to divert would-be educators into far more lucrative corporate jobs. Mr. Edouard graduated from the University of Florida in 2011 and considered enlisting in Teach for America, but he also had multiple offers from technology employers.
''In today's day and age, with so many college loans, it's tough to go into teaching,'' he said.
One of the biggest concerns about Microsoft's effort is that most of its volunteers have little teaching experience. To comply with district licensing requirements and to help engineers with classroom challenges like managing unruly teenagers, a professional teacher is also in the room during lessons. One of the program's tenets is that Microsoft engineers need to teach the teachers, alongside students, so that those instructors can eventually run an engaging computer science class on their own.
''We are taking the kids farther than I could do,'' said Michael Braun, a teacher at Rainier Beach High who is working with Microsoft volunteers.
There are still hiccups, including tensions between some of the professional teachers and the Microsoft engineers assigned to work with them, according to several people involved in the program, who did not want to be named for fear of seeming critical of Microsoft.
Sarah Filman, a program manager at Microsoft, completed the intensive summer training that the company offers volunteers, preparing a lengthy PowerPoint presentation for the class she taught at a Seattle high school last year. ''That's the Microsoft way,'' she said.
But as soon as she dimmed the lights in her classroom at the start of the year, her students had trouble focusing on the slide show, forcing Ms. Filman to change her methods. ''I had to throw away a lot of what I had done,'' she said.
For students in the Seattle area, Microsoft tries to drum up excitement in technology by organizing field trips to its campus and discussing the lucrative careers that await them. The students from Rainier Beach High who visited Microsoft last year were buzzing about their trips for days afterward.
''To me, that was an 'aha' moment,'' said Dwane Chappelle, the principal of Rainier Beach High. ''I said, we've got to find a way to get more kids involved.''
Mr. Wang, the program's founder, said a professional from the tech industry who stands at the head of a class for a full year can be a powerful role model. ''Kids can see themselves in their shoes,'' Mr. Wang said. After all, he added, ''their chances of going to college and majoring in computer science are exponentially better than getting into the N.F.L.''

HEADLINE: The Year of the Cooperative

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Cooperatives are growing in number, particularly in the agricultural sector, offering members an opportunity to shape the policies that run their businesses, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
We live in a competitive world. Yet much of our competition is team-based, requiring cooperation among team members. The biologist Edward O. Wilson describes the resulting tensions as a central dilemma facing all social species - humans as well as ants.
Economists haven't quite caught up with the implications. Further, they haven't quite caught on to the reality that cooperative enterprises play an enormously important role in our economic system, one that is likely to grow in decades to come.
Whether set up as worker-owned businesses, consumer memberships, financial institutions or marketing/distribution networks, co-ops pursue more complex goals than maximizing profit. They often put a high priority on democracy, education and the sustainable development of their communities.

Since 1930, cooperative enthusiasts have proclaimed October National Cooperative Month to help publicize their efforts. This year, the United Nations proclaimed the International Year of Cooperatives. The month that begins today promises a grand cooperative convergence, with a number of important events scheduled worldwide.
From Oct. 6 to 11, the city of Quebec will play host to an International Summit of Cooperatives, informally described as the "Davos of the Cooperative Movement," a reference to the annual gathering of the global elite officially known as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
In 2011, the membership and entrance fee for the Davos meeting was $71,000. Registration for the 2012 International Summit on Cooperatives is $1,300. The conference program reveals a lineup clearly aimed at the international business community. The list of sponsors is topped by the Canadian government and features many big names, including Microsoft, I.B.M., Google, McKinsey, Ernst & Young and Deloitte.
The summit Web site challenges the common assumption that co-ops can't grow out of small neighborhood niches, contending that the 300 largest cooperatives worldwide (including the famous worker-owned Spanish manufacturing concern Mondragon) generate total revenue equal to $1.6 trillion, "an economic power equivalent to the world's ninth-largest economy in 2008."
The summit also offers a cooperative leadership training program, particularly significant since most business/management programs give this topic short shrift. The only institution in North America offering a master's of management specifically for cooperatives and credit unions is St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Cooperative businesses seem to be expanding, perhaps because of disillusionment with more conventional business models and growing interest in a more do-it-yourself economy.
Whether they ever become a significant competitive threat to the Davos elite, cooperatives are likely to remain a mainstay of global food production. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, sponsoring more October celebrations, notes that agricultural cooperatives account for a large share of dairy, coffee and cotton production in several countries.
Even in the United States, known for its huge agribusiness corporations, cooperatives account for 80 percent of dairy production. And they are moving into the ice cream sector.
In 1999, several former Baskin-Robbins franchisees who were cut loose by the parent company decided to form their own franchise operation, the Texas-based KaleidoScoops cooperative. They offer their owner-members relatively low start-up costs along with the opportunity to shape company policy.
I e-mailed them last week to ask how they plan to celebrate National Cooperative Month. Greg Ziolkowski, the president, reported that they are planning a members' convention in Dallas to go over financials, marketing plans and new ideas.
Cooperatively scooped ice cream seems like an idea that should make both humans and ants very happy. I hope they'll be scooping some at the international summit.

HEADLINE: A Simple Place to Start: Your Net Worth

BYLINE: CARL RICHARDS


HIGHLIGHT: If you're ready to make changes in your financial life, start by figuring out the difference between what you owe and what you own. 

 BODY:
 Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at BAM Advisor Services. His book, "The Behavior Gap," was published this year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog.
The world is a crazy place. We hear reports that say the economy is getting better. Next month, we hear that things don't look so good. It feels like a tug-of-war, and we're caught in the middle. Looking around, you may feel like the only thing you have any hope of controlling is your financial situation. So you want to make some changes and put a framework around your financial future.
But there's so much information! Credit card statements, mortgage payments, insurance renewals, student loan bills and every other piece of financial data about your life can be overwhelming. It's incredibly easy to throw up your hands and say, "I don't know where to start."
The best place to start is with your current reality. Seems obvious, right? But if it's so obvious, then why haven't we done it?

        
It can be painful. The reason you're looking to change things is because something isn't working. That something may be incredibly personal, like how you talk about money with your spouse. So we avoid our current reality and tell ourselves things will get better tomorrow.
        
There are a million other things to do. We're all busy. Thinking about what's right and wrong with your current reality probably doesn't make anyone's Top Ten list.
But if you find yourself in a situation where you're ready to make a change, the best place to start is at the beginning by creating a personal balance sheet. Your goal is to discover where you stand financially right now.
You don't need a fancy spreadsheet or even a computer for this exercise. Just grab a blank piece of paper and a pen. Then draw a line down the middle.
On the left side, list all your assets in detail. Bank accounts, equity in your home (that is not meant to be a joke), investment portfolio. For every asset, list it and its value.
On the right side, list all your liabilities. Credit card debt, mortgage, school loans. Again, get specific and list the actual amounts of each liability.
If you don't know, call your bank, credit card company or your adviser. In this exercise, guessing isn't allowed, so ask the questions and get the real numbers on paper.
Then, add up all your assets and subtract all your liabilities. You now have your net worth.
What does it look like? If you're not happy with the number you see, you have two choices that will probably involve some hard work:

        
Increase your assets
        
Decrease your liabilities
If you're wondering why I suggest starting with something so simple, it's because I keep crossing paths with people who don't know how their assets compare to their liabilities. And the reality is that if you don't know where you stand today, then how will you ever figure out where you want to be tomorrow?
So the next time you think you don't know where to start, ask the question, "What does my current reality look like?" Once you know where you stand, then you can make an honest assessment of your options and what comes next.

HEADLINE: New York Has Disproportionate Number of Residents in Shelters, Report Finds

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: The population of state and city residents in homeless shelters is high compared with the overall population, according to a Census Bureau report released last week. 

 BODY:
For two-and-a-half years after she was evicted from her apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Ellen O'Shea lived with her young daughter in a shelter for homeless families. 
"On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10 - the worst," Ms. O'Shea, 50, recalled. Among other indignities, she said, she was bitten by a rat.
Ms. O'Shea left work as a telephone solicitor after suffering a heart attack in 2004. While surviving on food stamps and public assistance payments, she saved enough from her monthly $605 supplemental security income check to finally find another Brooklyn apartment with her 8-year-old daughter last June with help from the shelter's housing specialist. 
A lack of affordable housing is one reason that New York's homeless population is breaking records. And the population of state residents in homeless shelters is also high compared with the overall population, according to a Census Bureau report released last week. 
New York State residents, who represent about 6 percent of the nation's population, comprised about 17 percent of homeless people living in emergency and transitional housing in the country in 2010, the bureau said. State residents make up one in four of the homeless people under age 18 and one in five women living in shelters in the United States, the bureau's analysis found.
New York City residents, who make up less than 4 percent of the nation's population, accounted for 14.1 percent of the nation's shelter population, according to the bureau.
Even that figure appears to have been understated. It did not include people living outside on streets and sidewalks. Moreover, the federal estimate was lower than the city's own count. The bureau placed the shelter population in 2010 at just under 30,000; the city's count was about 38,000, plus more than 3,000 living on the streets and in the subway that January. By July 2012, it was more than 45,000.
 "Despite several earnest measures by the Census Bureau, the federal effort to enumerate the homeless population in the national census remains inadequate," said Brendan Kearns, a researcher with the National Coalition for the Homeless.
 Patrick Markee, a policy analyst with the city's Coalition for the Homeless, attributed the soaring number of homeless to a combination of increasing poverty and high housing costs. 
"The gap is wider here and has been widening over the last 10 years," Mr. Markee said. "More and more families are priced out of housing, and there's not enough affordable housing assistance to help families move out of shelters." 
Another reason, cited by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group supported by organized labor, is that housing foreclosure rates in metropolitan areas in the state are higher than for the nation as a whole.
City officials saw a silver lining, of sorts, in the census figures.
 "New York State guarantees shelter to those in need, and in New York City, we work hard to move those who are on the streets into shelter," said Seth Diamond, the city's homeless services commissioner. "That's why New York City has one of the lowest rates of street homelessness in the country - and far lower than most other major cities." 
City officials also pointed out that some other states do not provide shelter to the extent that New York does.
 The Census Bureau found that New York State had the biggest shelter population, at more than 36,000. New York had the third highest percentage of children under 18, nearly 30 percent of its shelter population, trailing Minnesota and Hawaii.
 The bureau also broke down the shelter population by county, although in New York City that reflects not only where homeless people are from, but also where they are sheltered. The list was topped by Bronx County (8,990), New York (8,496), Los Angeles (8,492) and Kings (8,409).

HEADLINE: Chris Economaki, Forever on the Move

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: Jerry Garrett remembers the editor and broadcaster, a frequent travel companion, who died on Friday at age 91. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- For many years, I used to travel in the same circles as Chris Economaki, the veteran automotive writer and broadcaster who died on Friday at age 91.
In 1982, we found ourselves in Seville, Spain, testing a new car. We also found time to take in a bullfight, sample the region's food and drink and get haircuts at a real barber of Seville. It was a long, multiday trip, and when it was over, we flew back to the United States together, changing planes in Madrid.
"You won't make your connection," a ticket agent told us when we arrived at Madrid's sprawling Barajas airport.
"Whaddya mean?" Economaki demanded, in that piercingly direct voice that he deployed in countless radio and television broadcasts. "We got an hour."
"You won't make it," the agent persisted. "It's a huge airport, and your flight is way on the other side." The agent wanted to rebook us on the next flight -- the next day.
"I've gotta get home today; I have a newspaper to publish," he said, a reference to his editorship of the National Speed Sport News. He was already in his fourth decade holding that post. "If the plane's still here, we'll make it," he said. "Let's go."
I was 34, fit and accustomed to running through airports to make flights. Economaki was rumpled, gray and doughy. In his early 60s, he was already wearing his pants cinched up almost under his armpits. We were each carrying two suitcases.
By the time I grabbed my bags, Economaki was already 30 feet ahead. We ran and ran. But it became apparent very quickly that we really did have a long way to go.
Having caught up, I expected to make it, but I worried about Economaki, who was huffing and gasping. He was already known back then as the dean of motoring writers, and I did not want him to expire while trying to keep pace. It would have made for a very bad headline.
But I need not have worried. As I tired, Economaki began to pull away from me. I got my second wind when I finally snagged a baggage cart and threw our luggage on. Economaki thanked me but hardly broke stride.
We made the plane. I think I slept most of the way home. Economaki, I learned later, spent a good portion of the flight regaling passengers and the flight attendants with many of his justly famous stories, which invariably included anecdotes about famous drivers, great cars and legendary races. He had decades of tales to tell, going back to the '30s when he was a mere newsboy, hawking the latest edition on some street corner, in a paddock or a grandstand.
The old man's stamina was quite amazing, a trait about him that stuck with me, as I worked with him many more times through the years.
He was fond of recalling the time we were working as pit reporters on some live, televised race. When Ken Squier, the announcer, called Economaki in for a comment about a recently completed pit stop, Economaki was indisposed in a Porta-Potty. The old pro never faltered, beginning his response while still in the loo and finishing it as he exited.
Though he said he raced only once, when he was 16, he could drive with the determination of a professional. Running late for a charter flight leaving from a private airport in Canada, I drove nose to tail for miles with an Indy car driver, only to notice in our rear-view mirrors that Economaki, in a rental car, had caught us. He only failed to pass because he missed the last turn into the airfield's parking lot and nearly hit a tree for all the dust kicked up in our turn.
But the old man (like the character actor Walter Brennan, he seemed old even when he was young) was unshakeable. He could keep up with anyone, night and day, in just about any endeavor, and then manage somehow to publish Speed Sport every week in whatever few hours were left on the clock.
Economaki lived life that way for 60 years or more. Though nobody lives forever, he often lived life as if he thought he would. He got to 91, probably good enough to outlast almost anyone who tries to keep up.

The average annual number of times Americans visit medical providers has been falling over the last decade, according to a new report from the Census Bureau. But their overall spending on health care is still rising.
Among Americans 18 to 64 years old, the average person visited medical providers 3.9 times in 2010, compared to 4.8 times in 2001.
Both healthy Americans and less healthy Americans reported going to the doctor less frequently in 2010 than they did in 2001:
Visits to the doctor and other medical providers may be falling, but health spending is still substantially higher today than it was a decade ago, according to the Labor Department's Consumer Expenditure Survey.
The typical household (including residents of all ages) spent $3,313 on health care in 2011, compared to $2,771 in 2001, after adjusting for inflation.
Health care spending has generally been rising even as total household spending has stagnated or fallen in recent years. As a result, health care spending is eating up a larger share of total household budgets than it used to. As of 2011, the typical American household spent 6.7 percent of its total expenditures on health care.
Almost every category of health care spending has been rising.
The average American household spent $768 on medical services last year, an increase of 3.1 percent from the year before. It also spent $1,922 on health insurance, an increase of 1.8 percent from the year before; and $134 on medical supplies, up 9.2 percent from the year before.
Annual household spending on prescription and nonprescription drugs fell 2.3 percent, however, to $489.
Spending growth on health insurance is slower than that for some other health care categories, but the base was so large to begin with that health insurance is accounting for a growing percentage of the typical household's total health care spending. In other words, a bigger share of households' health care spending is going through insurance companies as opposed to coming from co-payments and other out-of-pocket spending.

HEADLINE: Feeling the Pressure to Drink for Work

BYLINE: DOUGLAS QUENQUA


HIGHLIGHT: For professionals who abstain from alcohol, it can sometimes seem harder to get ahead if you're not willing to throw one back. 

 BODY:
As an ad-sales executive with Forbes magazine, Terry Lavin worked hard to earn his reputation as a dependable drinking buddy.
"I just basically rented space at P. J. Clarke's," he said, referring to the Midtown Manhattan watering hole. "I was always the last to leave, always had a cocktail in my hand."
In a business built on likability, the role helped him succeed. Until 2010, when he decided to give his body a break and quit drinking for six months. His health got better; his business did not.
"I would call guys I was friendly with, guys who had their hands on big ad budgets, to see if they wanted to go to happy hour or get something to eat," he recalled, "And they'd say: 'Are you drinking? No? Don't worry about it.' "
So much for the benefits of the sober life.
Even as three-martini lunches and whiskey-fueled staff meetings become harder to find outside of cable TV, plenty of American business rituals continue to revolve around alcohol. Whether it's courting a client, sketching out a deal or simply proving you're a team player, quaffing a round of beers is arguably more vital to many jobs than nailing a round of golf.
For professionals who abstain from alcohol - for health, religion, recovery or simple preference - it can sometimes seem harder to get ahead if you're not willing to throw one back.
"You're expected to drink, and drinking is part of what you do, and there's a little bit of circumspection if you say you don't do it," said Link Christin, director of a special treatment program for legal professionals started last year by Hazelden, a network of alcohol- and drug-rehabilitation centers based in Minnesota. "If you say you don't drink, you have to deal with the suspicion that you can't play the game."
To find that attitude in action, look no further than this year's presidential campaign. As a part of his pitch to voters that Mitt Romney, a teetotaler Mormon, is different from most Americans, President Obama has made a conspicuous display of his own regular-guy fondness for beer.
"Yesterday I went to the State Fair, and I had a pork chop and a beer," Mr. Obama boasted to an Iowa crowd in August the day after he closed down a beer kiosk so he could buy brews for himself and 10 other fairgoers. "And it was good. Today I just had a beer. I didn't get the pork chop. But the beer was good, too." The crowd rewarded him with chants of "Four more beers!"
When the public demanded that Mr. Obama release his recipes for home brews after he shared a bottle of one with a coffee shop patron in Knoxville, Iowa, the White House milked the moment by first demanding 25,000 signatures on a petition. (The White House eventually relented, releasing two recipes after just 12,000 signatures.)
It's hardly a new tactic among politicians. Edward M. Kennedy complained about the lack of alcohol in Jimmy Carter's White House as he prepared to challenge the president in the 1980 primaries. And it has become a pollsters' truism in recent years that voters choose the candidate they'd rather have a beer with. (The most recent nondrinker to take the White House, George W. Bush, at least made sure he was occasionally photographed holding a nonalcoholic O'Doul's.)
For less public figures, the notion that people who don't drink can't perform in business - or, worse, are somehow untrustworthy - can impede professional progress.
"There is a perception almost that you're impotent," said one nondrinker, an editor at a liquor-focused lifestyle magazine who asked not to be identified because many of his co-workers don't know he recently entered a 12-step program.
Professional disadvantages to sobriety range from the literal - the editor had to decline a potential promotion because it would have involved wine tasting - to subtle.
"I regularly turn down lunches and dinners with industry people that I would have jumped at in the past," the editor said. "I just can't go to dinner with a winemaker and tell him: 'No, thank you. I'm not tasting those.' "
One hardly has to work directly with alcohol to experience this. On Wall Street, where a "models and bottles" lifestyle prevails, those who don't drink "complain that they can't close a deal, can't even get into early negotiations because they won't engage in drinking behaviors," said John Crepsac, a New York City therapist who counsels Wall Street workers in recovery.
Social scientists refer to it as "social capital," the amount of economic potential to be harnessed from one's capacity to fit in. 
"There were times I knew the guys were going out with customers that could help advance my career," said one nondrinking Wall Street trader who asked to remain anonymous because his employer doesn't allow staff members to talk to the media, "but it was just unspoken: 'Yeah, we won't invite him 'cause we'll probably get up to some drinking and he won't partake, so what's the point?' "
Of course, sobriety and success are not mutually exclusive. Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Larry Ellison are all lifetime abstainers. Whether or not he wins, Mr. Romney hasn't lacked for success, either.
And sober women might actually benefit from an old double standard. "Men are still expected to get together and go wild, but in some ways it's frowned upon if the woman engages in it," Dr. Crepsac said, noting that few of his female patients have complained that sobriety hurt their careers. "There are plenty of things for which women are discriminated against in the workplace, but this isn't one of them."
Still, research supports the idea that nondrinkers have a harder time climbing the corporate ladder. Multiple studies have shown that moderate drinkers earn more money than those who don't drink, though heavy drinkers earn less than moderate drinkers.
That pressure to perform can sometimes cause professionals in recovery to backslide. This is one reason that Hazelden created a support group especially for lawyers who are trying to stay sober.
"The pressure to bring in business at legal firms, to be a rainmaker, is greater than ever," said Mr. Christin, a former litigation lawyer and a recovered alcoholic. When someone must choose between supporting his or her family and having a glass of wine, it can be tough to stay the course, he said.
Teetotalers tend to develop strategies for socializing professionally without alcohol. Some will order a drink and simply leave it alone; others use humor to deflect unwanted attention. "I tell people I'm pregnant," said the Wall Street trader (a man).
Mr. Lavin, who is on leave from ad sales to write a book, advises asking for your drink in deceiving glassware. "People are much calmer if you're drinking a seltzer water out of a rocks glass," he said.
And there is justice to be had. Joe McKinsey, a former mortgage executive who opened a rehab clinic for executives in East Hampton, N.Y., after his own recovery, said it had taken only a few months of being sober at his old job to go from a target of ridicule to a confidant for those in trouble.
"Eventually you get people buttonholing you, asking, 'Do you think I have a problem?' " he said. "I became the go-to guy if you needed to have a private talk."

HEADLINE: The Tax Side of the Fiscal Cliff

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A study from the Tax Policy Center says Americans face federal tax increases of more than half a trillion dollars if current laws are allowed to lapse at the end of the year. 

 BODY:
Come January, if Congress fails to act, sweeping federal tax increases will hit in what is not at all affectionately nicknamed in Washington "taxmageddon." 
How big are those federal tax increases? The respected Tax Policy Center is out with a full analysis of the math, and estimates the impact at more than half a trillion dollars next year alone. 
In the words of Eric Toder, one of the report's authors, "It's just a huge, huge number." The paper is full of such numbers. About 9 in 10 Americans would see their tax bills go up. The average household would pay $3,500 more. The typical middle-income household would pay $2,000 more. An average household in the top 1 percent would pay $120,000 more. The average federal tax rate would climb a whopping 5 percentage points. Americans would have 6.2 percent less after-tax income. 
The analysis walks through the pending tax increases. The payroll tax holiday goes away, raising taxes on America's 160 million wage earners. New provisions from the Affordable Care Act bump up taxes on the investment income of high-income households, and the Bush tax cuts for capital gains and dividends expire. The Bush-era income tax cuts end as well, with the top rate climbing to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. Without adjustment, the alternative minimum tax affects millions more taxpayers. Tax credits enacted in the stimulus go away. The estate tax jumps. It goes on and on. 
The Tax Policy Center's analysis shows that the tax increases would be painful for everyone, rich and poor. 
The very wealthy would have the biggest hit, with the top 1 percent of earners seeing their average federal tax rate climb by seven percentage points. The single biggest tax increase would be on dividend earnings, with the tax rate increasing by 20 percentage points. 
But the poor would not go unscathed, either. For households in the lowest income quintile, earning less than $20,113 a year, the average federal tax rate would climb 3.7 percentage points, with taxes increasing $412 on average. That works out to about $8 a week.
"For us, it's lunch," said Roberton Williams, a study co-author. "For other people, it's dinner and lunch and breakfast that day."
Moreover, many low-income families, particularly those with children, would end up paying much more, because of changes like the halving of the child tax credit. 
Of course, members of the administration and Congress are already hard at work behind closed doors, aiming to stave off some of the tax increases and spending cuts due by law - the "fiscal cliff," as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, calls it.
The study helpfully ranks the tax increases from those most likely to happen (the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and the new Affordable Care Act taxes) to those least likely to happen (the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for lower-income earners and of the alternative minimum tax patch).

HEADLINE: More Money Than They Know What to Do With

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Private equity executives, after spending the last several years largely on the sidelines amid the economic uncertainty, have begun to be anxious that they may need to go on a shopping spree. 

 BODY:
It is a $1 trillion game: Use It or Lose It.
The private equity world is sitting on that 13-figure sum. It's what the industry calls dry powder. If they don't spend their cash pile snapping up acquisitions soon, they may have to return it to their investors.
Nearly $200 billion from funds raised in 2007 and 2008 alone needs to be spent in the next 12 months or it must be given back.
 Private equity executives, after spending the last several years largely on the sidelines amid the economic uncertainty - often proclaiming "patience" as an explanation - have begun to be anxious that they may need to go on a shopping spree. At least two major private equity firms, according to two executives involved in the discussions, have held internal strategy sessions in recent weeks about how to approach the looming deadline.
Some private equity firms have put the word out to Wall Street banks that they want to go "elephant hunting" - seeking big deals worth as much as $10 billion - and are willing to pay a special bounty for bringing them acquisition targets.
At least one firm has gone so far as to begin contemplating asking its investors, which include the nation's largest pension funds, to extend the deadline for the money to be spent in return for certain concessions on fees. (Of course, they don't return the fees that have been collected thus far).
"The clock is ticking loudly for these funds," Hugh MacArthur, the head of Bain & Company's private equity practice, wrote as the lead author of a report on the state of the industry.
So the race is on.
But, of course, there is a problem: "Burning off the aging dry powder will likely result in too much capital chasing too few deals throughout 2012," according to Mr. MacArthur.
That means it is possible we could see a series of bad deals with even worse returns.
Already, private equity firms have been quietly spending lots of cash. In the third quarter alone, private equity firms in the United States burned through $45 billion, up from $17.1 billion in the previous quarter, according to Capital IQ, which tracks deals data. Carlyle Group, which had its initial public offering in May, has been the busiest firm this year: it has done 11 deals worth almost $12 billion.
Acquisition prices are also likely to balloon because of "lots of firms bidding for the same obvious deals," Alastair Gibbons, a senior partner at Bridgepoint Capital, told Triago, a fund-raising services firm that publishes a widely read quarterly newsletter. "Since there is near record dry powder globally, it's entirely plausible that we'll see increasingly overcrowded bidding processes."
Richard Peterson, an analyst for S&P Capital IQ's Global Markets Intelligence group, said that private equity firms are already paying multiples of Ebitda - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - of 10.6 this year, up from 10.3 last year. It's worth remembering that many of the most successful deals in the private equity industry were bought for six to eight times Ebitda, he said.
He noted, however, that since firms were able to borrow at unheard-of low rates today "it may give them more confidence to pay a little bit more."
Perhaps in a sign of desperation, many private equity firms have been increasingly engaged in a game of "hot potato" with one firm selling a business to another - known as a secondary deal. Mr. Peterson said that at the current pace, the industry was expected to spend a record-breaking $22.3 billion this year simply buying companies from each other rather than buying businesses from the public markets or from private owners outside the private equity industry.
Mr. Peterson also raised a question that is often being whispered about but rarely said aloud: "A lot of these firms are publicly traded now. So to what degree are the transactions being driven by earnings objectives?"
Many of the big private equity firms - Apollo Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group, among them - are public. And for the first time, it is possible that the interests of the public shareholders could diverge from the interests of the investors in the buyout funds, at least in the short term.
If the private equity firms don't spend the money that they have already raised, it is unlikely they will be able to raise even more in coming years. And increasingly, the private equity firms have become dependent on the management fees not just to keep the lights on but to expand their businesses into other areas, in part to diversify, which has been part of the pitch to public investors. The biggest firms have become asset gatherers.
"In a nutshell, 95 percent of funds would be affected and see a big drop in fee income based on not investing all of the committed capital," according to Tim Friedman, director of North America for Preqin, which tracks private equity fund-raising and deals. He said that he did not expect firms to do deals simply "for the sake of it," but he also cautioned that the firms were "under a lot of pressure."
So keep an eye out for megadeal headlines - and whether they command the same prices when the companies are sold.
An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated the amount of money that private equity firms would have to return to investors if it is not invested in the next 12 months. It is $200 billion, not $200 million.

HEADLINE: You've Got 15 Minutes. What Are You Going to Talk About?

BYLINE: TARA MULHOLLAND


HIGHLIGHT: A literary salon spreads from London to Paris and now to New York. 

 BODY:
PARIS -'' In the future,'' Andy Warhol immortally said in 1968, ''everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.''
Fast-forward 44 years and a group called 5x15 has added an interesting twist to this idea: Take five people who are already famous, or at least renowned in their field, and get them to talk to a live audience for 15 minutes on a subject of their choice. 
On Monday, 5x15 will open its first New York edition with the guests Amanda Foreman, Philip Gourevitch, Peter Godwin, Andrew Roberts, Paul Muldoon and Siri Hustvedt all speaking at the Players Club beginning at 7 p.m.
The concept was founded in London in 2010 by the British editor and writer Rosie Boycott; her daughter, the journalist Daisy Leitch; and the Irish-Canadian arts entrepreneur Eleanor O'Keeffe, who co-directed the Jaipur Literary Festival and was a founder of the Palestine Festival of Literature. With stellar lineups and events in trendy spots, it rapidly became a success on what The Telegraph dubbed ''the modern salon circuit.''
The program now has events almost every week in London. Guests in October include the author Philip Pullman and the comic book author Neil Gaiman, the restaurateur Oliver Peyton and the comedian Jo Brand. (Some videos of past events can be seenhere. 
5x15 opened a Paris branch last year, run by the French actress Clémence Poésy (''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' and current playing opposite Douglas Hodge in ''Cyrano'' on Broadway) and held at the designer Agnès b.'s art space in the 10th Arrondissement. Guests have included the artist, graphic novelist and filmmaker Marjane Satrapi and the actress Dominique Blanc, which you can watch here. 
Perhaps the success of the strict 15-minute time limit is linked to our (apparently) decreasing attention spans. But it also allows speakers to try out some fairly wacky subjects, without the fear that the audience will get bored. (Topics can include anything from global economics to why a particular speaker loves his or her job). 
It is also refreshing to get away from the creepily cookied suggestions of sites like Amazon.com (Liked this? Then you might like...) At the most recent Paris event in May, the collector Jean-Luc Boutel converted me to the charms of vintage sci-fi book covers. Might I have stumbled across this niche one day on the Net? Probably not.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: About That Replacement Ref

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: The top 50 start-ups, cold-calling strategies, cash flow concerns - and what would you do to revive Myspace? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 Economy: What Fiscal Cliff? 
A new survey finds chief financial officers less optimistic about economic growth. Brad Plumer explains why fears of a fiscal cliff are not hurting the economy, and Jared Bernstein reveals important new research on a fiscal cliff issue. Defense contractors brace for federal budget cuts. Economic advisers to President Obama and Mitt Romney squabble. Zachary A. Goldfarb says that under Ben Bernanke the Federal Reserve has become more open and forceful. The chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank anticipates that the economy will "gain momentum over the next few years." A new book tries to help entrepreneurs reignite the economy. A bacon shortage threatens the world.
 The Data: A Seven-Month High 
Manufacturing growth improves in Texas and the central Atlantic region. Home prices notch their biggest gains in seven years. Consumer confidence rises to a seven-month high, and consumers step up their spending. But new home sales fall slightly and orders for durable goods plunge. And revised gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2012.
 Finance: Could It Get Any Worse for B. of A.? 
A new Visa study says cash flow concerns top the list of small-business worries. One of the biggest lenders to small businesses will soon be on the auction block. Even when consumers are comfortable using new payment technologies, studies show they sometimes prefer paying cash. Here's why used car prices are rising. The replacement ref who made that controversial calllast Monday is a vice president for small business at Bank of America. Did Iran attack our banks (and lose its sense of humor)?
 Start-Ups: A Start-Up That Helps Start-Ups 
Tim Ferriss explains Y Combinator's contribution to the start-up scene. This is a start-up that helps start-ups. A solar panel start-up will tap a $197 million loan guarantee. Amazon may be getting into the wine business - and it's also lending money to small businesses. A San Francisco start-up offers scooter rentals. The Wall Street Journal names the top 50 start-ups.
 Selling: Replace Your Reps 
Jill Konrath suggests cold-calling strategies. Matthew Bellows explains how small companies can stand out when selling to big companies: "Showing your prospects the characteristics that set your company apart is key to moving the conversation beyond a checklist comparison." To sell well, John Jantsch says, you must tell stories. Laura Spencer has some advice for dealing with tire-kickers and other bad clients. Lars Lofgren explains why you should replace your sales representatives with ambassadors.
 Marketing: Are You a Jerk? 
These are the top cities in America for social-media-savvy small businesses. Jessica Levko says there are 10 signs that you're a social media jerk, including: "You're attached to your smartphone." A show with Martin Sheen explains how small businesses can use social media to find new customers. These are the most important local business directories for search engine optimization. A new Facebook service facilitates the creation of "couponlike" promotions. Erica Ayotte explains how to use Instagram to promote your business. These are five types of images that will enhance your online marketing. A few entrepreneurs share their promotional swag secrets. Annette Du Bois thinks your marketing may be a turnoff. Here's a case study on how a clothing company lifted its sales 205 percent with daily deal e-mails. This is what a Las Vegas casino can teach you about marketing. These are the five most effective business-to-business word-of-mouth marketing techniques.
 Around the Country: Hipster Neighborhoods
Friday is Manufacturing Day, and the United States unveils a "Make It in America" contest. HLN introduces a new weekday series about "Making It In America." Nissan invites "Edisons in training" to win a $50,000 grant (as well as a brand new 2013 Altima). FedEx introduces a small-business grant competition. Brooklyn booms as record rents drive construction. These are America's hippest hipster neighborhoods. New York's first chief digital officer discusses how she achieved 80 percent of the goals laid out in her "digital road map." A supply chain management firm wins an award for small business from the Air Traffic Control Association. A cash mob hits a small business in San Antonio.

 Your People: Happier and Healthier
Norm Brodsky says it's cost of goods sold that determines whether you can afford another employee: "Once you know your gross margin, it's easy to figure out the new sales you'll need in order to break even on the addition of another employee to the payroll. You simply add up all the new costs associated with that new person - salary, benefits, extra phone usage, travel and entertainment, whatever - and divide by your gross margin."

 Red Tape: On Taxes and Cheating 
A workplace pregnancy bill is introduced in the Senate. Clint Stretch discusses taxes and cheating: "The I.R.S. estimates that in 2006 alone, the Treasury missed out on $385 billion in revenue due under the current tax law from a combination of underreporting of income, overstatement of deductions or other benefits, or nonpayment of taxes owed. To put that in perspective, increased revenue of $385 billion annually likely would be enough to make the Bush tax cuts permanent and to permanently patch the alternative minimum tax." The Small Business Administration wants to help entrepreneurs over the age of 50. Thomas P. Hanrahan suggests 10 safeguards against consumer lawsuits, including: "The more variety there is in how you promote, the harder it is for a class-action plaintiff to prove that every consumer was taken in by the same misleading message."

 The Week's Bests 
 Jeet Banerjee says that when finding a business idea there's nothing wrong with imitating: "Some of the greatest business ideas have been imitations of others in different ways. If a certain solution has a large market share and not enough competition, you can definitely create a successful business. ... If you find a business with a solid business model, feel free to implement their model into other industries. Many ideas are so strong that they have the ability to work in different niches with just a bit of fine tuning."
 Brett Martin explains how to avoid being cheated by a contractor: "Know who's on the job site. You might sign a contract and make payments with a person who isn't doing all of the work. Ask upfront if your crew will subcontract parts of the job to somebody else. If so, do the same research into that person's business as you did for the general contractor. It's awkward to have a perfect stranger show up on your doorstep ready to swing a hammer, but beyond that, the balance between contractors and subs can lead to some of the biggest headaches on a big project - delays, incorrect installations, damage to finished work and all sides blaming the others for errors while no one takes accountability."

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Microsoft Sends Engineers Back to High School

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: This fall, 110 engineers from high-tech companies are teaching computer science classes as part of a Microsoft program aimed at getting high school students excited about the field, Nick Wingfield reports in Monday's New York Times. 

 BODY:
This fall, 110 engineers from high-tech companies are teaching computer science classes as part of a Microsoft program aimed at getting high school students excited about the field, in Monday's New York Times.
In doing so, Microsoft is taking an unusual approach to tackling a shortage of computer science graduates - one of the most serious issues facing the technology industry, and a broader challenge for the nation's economy.
There are likely to be 150,000 computing jobs opening up each year through 2020, according to an analysis of federal forecasts by the Association for Computing Machinery, a professional society for computing researchers. But despite the hoopla around start-up celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, fewer than 14,000 American students received undergraduate degrees in computer science last year, the Computing Research Association estimates. And the wider job market remains weak.
"People can't get jobs, and we have jobs that can't be filled," Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel who oversees its philanthropic efforts, said in a recent interview.
Microsoft is sending its employees to the front lines, encouraging them to commit to teaching a high school computer science class for a full school year. This year, only 19 of the 110 teachers in the program are not Microsoft employees. In some cases, the program has thrown together volunteers from companies that spend a lot of their time beating each other up in the marketplace.
"I think education and bringing more people into the field is something all technology companies agree on," said Alyssa Caulley, a Google software engineer, who, along with a Microsoft volunteer, is teaching a computer science class at Woodside High School in Woodside, Calif.

HEADLINE: Glencore-Xstrata, Not Quite a Done Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Now that Xstrata's board has backed Glencore International's bid, it's up to shareholders to decide. | Barron's makes a bullish case for Goldman Sachs. | Leon Cooperman takes aim at President Obama's rhetoric in a widely circulated letter. | David Rubenstein at Duke University, his alma mater. 

 BODY:
Glencore-Xstrata, Not Quite a Done Deal | Now that Xstrata's board has backed Glencore International's revised bid, it's up to shareholders to decide. In an effort to remove potential stumbling blocks, Xstrata's board has given shareholders three options when they vote in November: support both the merger and retention bonuses for important executives; back the deal without the bonuses; or oppose both. Some big investors had opposed the pay packages as "too extravagant," writes DealBook. Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund, holds a crucial vote - and has not seemed as concerned with the pay packages.
Early reviews of the plan have been less than glowing. The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column takes the board to task for waiting until the deadline to make its decision, writing, "the best that can be said of its efforts is better late than never." 
Will Goldman Shine? | Barron's makes a bullish case for Goldman Sachs in its cover story this week, predicting that the firm's stock price could rise at least 25 percent within a year. Though Goldman currently trades below its book value, Barron's says fears about new regulations and a weak market may be overblown: "The company maintains an abiding leadership position in most of its activities, and is financially sturdier and less burdened by irrational competition than it was a half-decade ago."
Still, Goldman is not immune to the forces haunting its rivals. As The Financial Times puts it: "The banks are struggling to identify a new cash cow that grazes between the new rules. The equivalent of the junk bonds of the 1980s or the credit derivatives of the 1990s has not been discovered."
Billionaires vs. Obama | Leon Cooperman, the billionaire founder of Omega Advisors, is among the Wall Street leaders who are disappointed with how President Obama has treated wealthy Americans. In a widely circulated letter detailed by The New Yorker, Mr. Cooperman took aim at the president's rhetoric: "To frame the debate as one of rich-and-entitled versus poor-and-dispossessed is to both miss the point and further inflame an already incendiary environment."
Some on Wall Street are making preparations for what might happen if the president is re-elected. Given the campaign rhetoric, private equity bosses in particular are concerned that some favorable tax policies may disappear. Many firms have been "introducing general clauses into partnership agreements that would give them power to change the terms if there was any change in the tax regime," according to The Financial Times.
On the Agenda | Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is set to appear on CNBC on Monday afternoon. Mark Zuckerberg is meeting Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia. Ben S. Bernanke is at the Economic Club of Indiana at 12:30 p.m. to give a speech called, "Five Questions about the Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy." Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate for Senate, is debating her Republican opponent, Senator Scott Brown, at 7 p.m. at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.
The Value Investing Congress, a two-day event featuring some prominent speakers, begins Monday at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. William Ackman, Whitney Tilson and Barry Rosenstein are among those scheduled to speak on Monday. The municipal bond summit from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association is being held Monday at the Conrad New York hotel.
Kraft Foods plans to spin off its North American grocery division at 5 p.m. The snack foods company that will be created is being rebranded Mondelez International, a name that is supposed to refer to the words for "world" and "delicious" in various romance language.
The Cost of Helping Spanish Banks | We know how bad it is, at least for now. According to a report published on Friday, Spanish banks may need about $76.4 billion in additional capital. That number came in below the $128.8 billion in bailout money Spain had negotiated from other countries.
Not surprising, the banks' troubles will put even more strain on the government. On Saturday, the Spanish government noted that aid to banks would increase its budget deficit to about 7.4 percent of gross domestic product this year, above its target of 6.3 percent, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Still, Spain is unwilling to cut the golden nest eggs. The New York Times writes that pensions are the biggest line item in the budget, at nearly 40 percent of public spending.
As if anyone thought running a country was easy, the Greek prime minister had this to say about the recent pressures in an interview with The New York Times: "This is the toughest job in the world. It's just pain."
David Rubenstein Goes Back to College | The Carlyle Group co-founder spoke at Duke University, his alma mater, on Friday, saying:
"While a student here, I was sure that I had not adequately repaid Duke's faith in me. I was not a great academic star; a student government leader; a fraternity officer - I was never even invited to join a fraternity. And I was certainly no varsity athlete, or even an intramural athlete - I managed to be cut from an intramural basketball team with only four other players on the team." His comments make you wonder: So what exactly did Mr. Rubenstein do in college?

HEADLINE: Glencore-Xstrata, Not Quite a Done Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Now that Xstrata's board has backed Glencore International's bid, it's up to shareholders to decide. | Barron's makes a bullish case for Goldman Sachs. | Leon Cooperman takes aim at President Obama's rhetoric in a widely circulated letter. | David Rubenstein at Duke University, his alma mater. 

 BODY:
Glencore-Xstrata, Not Quite a Done Deal | Now that Xstrata's board has backed Glencore International's revised bid, it's up to shareholders to decide. In an effort to remove potential stumbling blocks, Xstrata's board has given shareholders three options when they vote in November: support both the merger and retention bonuses for important executives; back the deal without the bonuses; or oppose both. Some big investors had opposed the pay packages as "too extravagant," writes DealBook. Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund, holds a crucial vote - and has not seemed as concerned with the pay packages.
Early reviews of the plan have been less than glowing. The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column takes the board to task for waiting until the deadline to make its decision, writing, "the best that can be said of its efforts is better late than never." 
Will Goldman Shine? | Barron's makes a bullish case for Goldman Sachs in its cover story this week, predicting that the firm's stock price could rise at least 25 percent within a year. Though Goldman currently trades below its book value, Barron's says fears about new regulations and a weak market may be overblown: "The company maintains an abiding leadership position in most of its activities, and is financially sturdier and less burdened by irrational competition than it was a half-decade ago."
Still, Goldman is not immune to the forces haunting its rivals. As The Financial Times puts it: "The banks are struggling to identify a new cash cow that grazes between the new rules. The equivalent of the junk bonds of the 1980s or the credit derivatives of the 1990s has not been discovered."
Billionaires vs. Obama | Leon Cooperman, the billionaire founder of Omega Advisors, is among the Wall Street leaders who are disappointed with how President Obama has treated wealthy Americans. In a widely circulated letter detailed by The New Yorker, Mr. Cooperman took aim at the president's rhetoric: "To frame the debate as one of rich-and-entitled versus poor-and-dispossessed is to both miss the point and further inflame an already incendiary environment."
Some on Wall Street are making preparations for what might happen if the president is re-elected. Given the campaign rhetoric, private equity bosses in particular are concerned that some favorable tax policies may disappear. Many firms have been "introducing general clauses into partnership agreements that would give them power to change the terms if there was any change in the tax regime," according to The Financial Times.
On the Agenda | Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is set to appear on CNBC on Monday afternoon. Mark Zuckerberg is meeting Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia. Ben S. Bernanke is at the Economic Club of Indiana at 12:30 p.m. to give a speech called, "Five Questions about the Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy." Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate for Senate, is debating her Republican opponent, Senator Scott Brown, at 7 p.m. at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.
The Value Investing Congress, a two-day event featuring some prominent speakers, begins Monday at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. William Ackman, Whitney Tilson and Barry Rosenstein are among those scheduled to speak on Monday. The municipal bond summit from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association is being held Monday at the Conrad New York hotel.
Kraft Foods plans to spin off its North American grocery division at 5 p.m. The snack foods company that will be created is being rebranded Mondelez International, a name that is supposed to refer to the words for "world" and "delicious" in various romance language.
The Cost of Helping Spanish Banks | We know how bad it is, at least for now. According to a report published on Friday, Spanish banks may need about $76.4 billion in additional capital. That number came in below the $128.8 billion in bailout money Spain had negotiated from other countries.
Not surprising, the banks' troubles will put even more strain on the government. On Saturday, the Spanish government noted that aid to banks would increase its budget deficit to about 7.4 percent of gross domestic product this year, above its target of 6.3 percent, The Wall Street Journal reports.
Still, Spain is unwilling to cut the golden nest eggs. The New York Times writes that pensions are the biggest line item in the budget, at nearly 40 percent of public spending.
As if anyone thought running a country was easy, the Greek prime minister had this to say about the recent pressures in an interview with The New York Times: "This is the toughest job in the world. It's just pain."
David Rubenstein Goes Back to College | The Carlyle Group co-founder spoke at Duke University, his alma mater, on Friday, saying:
"While a student here, I was sure that I had not adequately repaid Duke's faith in me. I was not a great academic star; a student government leader; a fraternity officer - I was never even invited to join a fraternity. And I was certainly no varsity athlete, or even an intramural athlete - I managed to be cut from an intramural basketball team with only four other players on the team." His comments make you wonder: So what exactly did Mr. Rubenstein do in college?

HEADLINE: 'New' Vermont Is Liberal, but 'Old' Vermont Is Still There

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: A migration of urban Northeastern professionals to Vermont in the 1960s and '70s helped flip the state to Democratic from Republican in recent national elections. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it's changing. Here is a look at Vermont, the Green Mountain State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Bertram Johnson, an associate professor of political science at Middlebury College, and Garrison Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont. 
Vermont is a quirky state, politically speaking. It was President Obama's second-best state in 2008, behind only his home-state of Hawaii. But Vermont is also the most rural state and the second whitest, normally strong predictors of Republican leanings.
Moreover, Vermont was once among the most reliably Republican states. It favored the G.O.P. presidential candidate in every election from 1856 to 1960, the longest one-party streak of any state, Mr. Nelson said. Vermont elected all Republican governors from 1854 to 1963. 
Vermont's political landscape began to change in the 1960s and 1970s. City dwellers from nearby states like Massachusetts and New York began fleeing struggling metropolises like Boston and New York City. Heading north, these migrants had a choice of where to settle, and some self-sorting took place.
More conservatives tended to choose New Hampshire, attracted to its low taxes and "Live Free or Die" ethos. Vermont, where cows outnumbered people before 1963, tended to attract young, left-leaning and outdoors-loving professionals, both Mr. Nelson and Mr. Johnson said. 
The overall effect on both states was to make them more politically competitive. In Vermont, the state's first Democratic governor in over 100 years, Philip H. Hoff, who served from 1963-69, helped his party to maker further gains, Mr. Nelson said. (Vermont would take a little longer to elect Democrats in presidential races). 
In 1970, as the migration into Vermont got going, the state passed a law, Act 250 (PDF), to limit development. That, in turn, attracted more environmental-minded migrants. 
Vermont's population had been stagnant for decades, but with the influx of "new Vermonters" the state began to grow. When the migration began, Vermont's population was below 400,000, small enough so that an influx of people could really affect the state's politics. More than 625,000 people live in Vermont today, and residents born elsewhere are part of the state's fabric. Vermont's current governor, Peter Shumlin, is the first native governor in almost 40 years.
The newcomers "changed the state," Mr. Nelson said.
Vermont today is among the greenest states, and green industries are a major part of the state's economy.
But the "old" Vermont never really went away. There's now something of a split between new, highly educated and left-leaning Vermonters and old, less-educated and more fiscally conservative Vermonters.
In presidential elections, there is only a little regional variation in how Vermont votes. Like elsewhere in New England and the Northeast, Republican voters in Vermont tend to be socially moderate, and they have little affection for national Republicans. Mr. Obama won every county in 2008, all but one of them with at least 60 percent of the vote. He also won 247 out of the state's 251 cities and towns, according to the Almanac of American Politics. 
In state-level races, however, Republican candidates can still compete under the right circumstances. Vermont had a Republican governor, Jim Douglas, as recently as 2010. In the contest to succeed Mr. Douglas, Republican Brian Dubie lost by two percentage points to Mr. Shumlin.
The Democratic strongholds in Vermont start with Burlington in the northwest, Brattleboro in the southeast and Bennington in the southwest, Mr. Johnson said. There's also smaller pockets of Democratic strength in central Vermont towns like Montpelier.
Burlington, the state's biggest city, has developed a high-tech and green economy. Burlington has also grown increasingly diverse, partly because it's a Refugee Resettlement city.
Republican-leaning areas include Rutland County, the Barre area, some northern suburbs of Burlington and the Northeast Kingdom.
The Kingdom, as it is known locally, is the most consistently conservative part of the state. It is made up of the three most northeastern counties: Essex, Caledonia and Orleans. The Kingdom is poorer and less populated than most of Vermont. Essex County is the only county Mr. Obama won in 2008 by less than 20 percentage points. 
 The Bellwether: Windsor County 
Like clockwork, Windsor County has been just one percentage point more Democratic-leaning than Vermont in each of the last three presidential elections.
The rural parts of Windsor County are conservative. But Woodstock, the county seat (known as a "shire town" in Vermont), is a tourist destination and has attracted more left-leaning new Vermonters.
"Windsor in many ways exemplifies the contrast between "old" and "new" Vermont," Mr. Johnson said.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is a 100 percent favorite in Vermont, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, and it is again projected to be his best state behind Hawaii.
Vermont is very likely to remain overwhelmingly blue in presidential elections for the foreseeable future. The real question is whether Republicans will remain competitive in state-level races. States that split tickets are becoming increasingly rare as party politics is nationalized. In Vermont, however, Republicans have a few advantages in remaining relevant.
First, although Vermont is liberal, particularly on social issues, it also has substantial strains of libertarianism and fiscal conservatism.
Second, there's no party registration in Vermont, and the state holds open primaries. Accordingly, party identification is a weaker bond in Vermont than in many other states.
Finally, Vermont is small, in area and population. Retail politicking can swing a lot of voters. "Socially moderate, personable Republican governors can still do well," Mr. Nelson said.
Still, the trend in most other states has been away from ticket splitting, and there is the potential for a "growing and solidifying allegiance to the national Democratic Party" in Vermont, Mr. Johnson said.

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Tax Evasion

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: He refuses to share the details of his tax proposal with voters. 

 BODY:
"Republicans and Democrats have junked up the tax code with so many giveaways and special-interest tax breaks."
That was Paul Ryan on Fox News Sunday, making it sound easy to find junky tax breaks to eliminate, in order to pay for the 20 percent tax cut he and Mitt Romney have proposed. You'd think if the tax code were such a cornucopia of giveaways, Mr. Ryan might reach in and pull one out for public examination. Just one deduction he'd be willing to eliminate.
But Mr. Ryan apparently had a busy schedule yesterday, because he said he didn't have time to provide the public with even a crumb of a detail.


"It would take me too long to go through all of that," he told Chris Wallace, who made an earnest but futile attempt to pin down Mr. Ryan. That's about the same level of respect for the public's intelligence that Mr. Romney paid last month on Meet the Press, when he also refused to name a single loophole he would close. When asked for the specifics, he answered in his own special, dizzying way.
"The specifics are these, which is, those principles I described are the heart of my policy," he said.
If Mr. Romney tries that kind of sputtering obfuscation at the debate on Wednesday, even his best spinners won't be able to help him. All but the most ideological voters have learned to be skeptical of politicians who claim that the most clearly monumental tasks - like rewriting the tax code - will be easy.
That's the core of the ticket's pitch: An economic turnaround can come with a snap of the fingers, unaccompanied by hard choices. Mr. Ryan had plenty of time to sell that message, and even appeared to have done some math.
"Look, our pro-growth tax reform, it cuts tax rates by 20 percent, higher take-home pay for middle class, pro-growth economic policy," Mr. Ryan said. "That right there creates about 7 million jobs."
Seven million - isn't that specific enough for you? Except it's an entirely invented figure premised on the idea that slashing taxes magically produces growth-which ignores the fact that President George W. Bush's cuts failed to achieve that result.
Mr. Wallace asked how much all these tax cuts would cost, and Mr. Ryan responded: nothing. The cuts will be free, "revenue neutral," offset by eliminating all those terrible breaks he had no time to list. (Mr. Bush, at least, admitted his tax cuts would cost at least $1.3 trillion.)
Mr. Ryan blithely dismisses the experts who say he can't keep his "revenue neutral" pledge because there aren't enough deductions to eliminate. He'll have a harder time ignoring a Heritage Foundation study that actually gives examples of the deductions at stake, including the tax-free status of interest on cash-value life insurance and municipal bonds. Making that interest taxable would raise $45 billion a year for the treasury, but would madden the insurance lobby and every city in the country that relies on municipal bonds to raise money.
The campaign has apparently decided it is better to insult a large group of voters by not providing specific information than it is to infuriate smaller groups with actual proposals. The poll numbers give a pretty good indication of how that strategy is working out.

HEADLINE: Barry Commoner's Uncommon Life

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Barry Commoner, a force for nature, dies at 95. 

 BODY:
Perhaps the most surprising detail in the fine New York Times obituary of Barry Commoner, who died on Sunday at age 95, was that "he was so shy at James Madison High School that he was referred to a speech correction class." Commoner went on to a career at the nexus of science, advocacy, economics, environmentalism and politics in which it would be impossible to find any hint of shyness. Consider that he ran for the presidency against Ronald Reagan (and Jimmy Carter), but also aggressively debated other activist-scientists whose views on population and development strayed from his -- most notably Paul Ehrlich of "Population Bomb" fame.
In reflecting on Commoner's work and philosophy, I sifted and found an informative 2007 interview with the historian Michael Egan, the author of "Barry Commoner and the Science of Survival: The Remaking of American Environmentalism," in which Egan, now at McMaster University, said this: 
He should be in any top five list of American environmental leaders, up there with Rachel Carson, Aldo Leopold, John Muir, and Alice Hamilton. It may be heretical to say it, but I think he's a more important figure in American environmentalism than Rachel Carson, if only because of the range of issues he addressed and the methods he brought to his activism. Over his career, Commoner worked on nuclear fallout, pesticides, water contamination, air pollution, toxic metals, the petrochemical industry, population, energy and nuclear power, urban waste disposal, dioxin, recycling, and all manner of other environmental issues. To Commoner, these were not individual problems but rather parts of the same problem: American production choices were flawed. We developed synthetic chemicals because they were cheap without thinking about their health and environmental consequences. As a result, big petrochemical companies got rich by externalizing the real costs of their products. We pick up the tab for the dirty skies and waters, not the polluters. Commoner pointed this out and worked with a number of community and labor groups on community and occupational health problems. I think he understood-much earlier than most-that environmental problems were really social problems and needed to be recognized as such.
I encourage you to read the full Times obituary. An important section focuses on Commoner's four informal rules of ecology, which were simple enough that the were once fare for T-shirts:
- Everything Is Connected to Everything Else.
- Everything Must Go Somewhere.
- Nature Knows Best.
- There Is No Such Thing as a Free Lunch.
But don't miss the fascinating "Last Word" video interview with Commoner, which was recorded in 2006 (these Times interviews are conducted with the understanding that they will not be aired until after the interviewee has died). 
I was honored earlier this year to be invited to deliver the inaugural Barry Commoner Environmental Lecture at Marymount Manhattan College, particularly because I was able to spend some time with him afterwards, talking on all manner of issues. I value that time more than ever now.

HEADLINE: At a Romney Home, the View From the Curb

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: The sanitation worker, Richard Hayes, is interviewed saying, "We're kind of like the invisible people. He doesn't realize, you know, the service we provide." 

 BODY:
In a new Web video, one of the nation's most politically active unions - the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees - takes a slap at Mitt Romney and his "47 percent remarks" by a sanitation worker whose route, it says, includes Mr. Romney's oceanfront home in La Jolla, Calif.
The sanitation worker, Richard Hayes, is interviewed and says: "We're kind of like the invisible people. He doesn't realize, you know, the service we provide."
Mr. Hayes then says he lifts 15 to 16 tons of garbage a day. "When I'm 55, 60 years old, I know my body's going to be breaking down," he says. "Mitt Romney doesn't care about that."
The video then shows quote from Mr. Romney's 47 percent remarks in big letters: "And so my job is not to worry about these people."
In recent days, the Romney campaign has shown an ad in which Mr. Romney, repeatedly using the word "compassionate," vows to go to bat for America's middle class, saying he will accomplish more for working Americans - will do more to create jobs and reduce unemployment - than President Obama has in his nearly four years in office.
Mr. Romney has said that his "47 percent" comments were "inelegant" and that his campaign is "about the 100 percent of America."
Ryan Williams, a Romney campaign spokesman, attacked the video and said Mr. Romney would promote pro-growth politics that would create economic opportunity for every American.
"It's not surprising that a liberal special interest group is trying to distract from President Obama's failed agenda with dishonest political attacks," Mr. Williams said. "President Obama has consistently sided with union bosses over middle class workers by supporting big government policies that have killed jobs."
 The union's "Meet Richard Hayes" video is one of several that Afscme is running that juxtapose interviews of workers in and around the La Jolla-San Diego area with Mr. Romney's dismissive remarks about the 47 percent.
Lee Saunders, president of the union, has said it will spend close to $100 million in this year's campaign, with most going to Democrats.
In releasing the Web videos, Mr. Saunders said in a statement: "Mitt Romney says his job is not to care about nearly half of America. Whatever your political stripe, no one should be so disregarding, dismissive, and disrespectful of half of the country. So we wanted to put a face on the hard working men and woman who Mitt relies on for public services."

HEADLINE: The Math on the Romney-Ryan Tax Plan

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Ryan told an interviewer that the Republican tax plan would be "revenue neutral" but said he didn't have time to explain the math. It is difficult to make it add up. 

 BODY:
On Fox News Sunday, Paul Ryan said that he didn't have time to explain the math behind his tax proposal. Fortunately I have a few minutes to spare, so I thought I'd pitch in.
Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney have proposed a tax plan that would lower everyone's tax rates by 20 percent. On Sunday, Mr. Ryan was asked to explain how the proposal can be revenue neutral -- that is, not reduce the total amount of tax revenues collected -- given this condition of substantially lower tax rates. He mentioned ending tax deductions starting with "people at the higher end" and broadening the tax base, and finally declared:
 ... it would take me too long to go through all of the math, but let me say it this way. You can lower tax rates by 20 percent across the board by closing loopholes and still have preferences for the middle class for things like charitable deductions, for home purchases, for health care.
There's a reason why it would take too long -- infinitely long, you could say -- to go through the math that holds this policy proposal together: because math will never hold this particular policy proposal together.
You cannot lower tax rates as much as Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan propose to do and keep all the existing tax expenditures for middle class Americans and still end up with the same total amount of tax revenue.
As the Tax Policy Centerdemonstrated, cutting individual income tax rates by 20 percent from today's levels would reduce tax burdens by $251 billion per year (in 2015) among households with income above $200,000.
If you leave preferential tax rates for savings and investing (e.g., long-term capital gains and dividends) untouched, as Mr. Romney has said he would do, that leaves only $165 billion of available tax expenditures that can be eliminated from this same group of high-income earners once their marginal tax rates fall.
That means there's an $86 billion shortfall -- the difference between $251 billion in tax cuts and $165 billion in potential tax increases on this high-income group -- that needs to be accounted for somewhere.
By process of elimination that somewhere must be the rest of the population, the 95 percent of households earning less than about $200,000 annually.
The taxes for this group, which Mr. Romney has called "middle income," would have to go up. The only ways to get the taxes collected from this group to go up would be to raise their rates (which Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have already ruled out) and/or eliminate the major tax preferences they enjoy.
It's arithmetically possible to achieve some subset of the main principles that the Romney-Ryan tax plan aims for: cutting current marginal income tax rates by 20 percent; preserving/enhancing incentives for saving and investment; eliminating the alternative minimum tax; eliminating the estate tax; maintaining revenue neutrality; and not raising the tax burden on the middle class.
But not all of those principles can coexist so long as basic arithmetic survives.

HEADLINE: Ordinary Lies, Damn Lies and the Debates

BYLINE: ADAM CLYMER


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Mitt Romney will be tempted to use the themes that their pollsters have found effective, whether they are true or false. 

 BODY:
Consumer warning: The claims you hear in Wednesday night's presidential debate may be hazardous, if not to your health, then to your relationship to reality.
In a campaign that features some of the most dishonest television ads in history, President Obama and Mitt Romney have been more circumspect about what comes out of their mouths than what is shown before or after they identify themselves and say "and I approve this message." But they will be tempted to use the themes their pollsters have found effective. That may be especially true for Romney, knowing that he is trailing. A huge television audience provides what is perhaps his last best chance to change things.
Even if they restrain themselves and don't parrot their most thoroughly debunked ads, those themes will come up. Romney may not repeat his ad's false charge about welfare that "Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check." If welfare comes up at all, Obama or the moderator, Jim Lehrer, is likely to cite that ad against Romney, and his practice has been to defend his worst ads when challenged.
That is Obama's way, too, with a rare exception. Last week, speaking to the AARP, he played fact-checker to his own campaign. He conceded that its ad (and his own words), claiming that Paul Ryan's Medicare plan would force seniors to pay $6,400 extra, was outdated because Mr. Ryan has modified it since last year. Of course Obama did not go as far as to say that the Romney-Ryan campaign now says future seniors could still get traditional Medicare at no additional cost.
These and other claims, offering far more precision about what the other guy would do wrong than specifics about a candidate's own plans are likely to fill Wednesday's air. Last week three of this campaign's most authoritative fact-checkers - Jim Drinkard of the Associated Press, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post and Bill Adair of The Tampa Bay Times's PolitiFact.com - gathered at the National Press Club in Washington to forecast how the candidates would try to mislead us Wednesday.
Drinkard said he thought Obama would say that he could finance domestic programs with savings from ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - a claim he made in this year's State of the Union address and his acceptance speech. The flaw, Drinkard pointed out, is that ending wars does not leave a pile of money, just a slightly smaller increase in debt going forward.
Romney, he said, would probably use some variation of his debunked claim that Obama has been apologizing for America abroad. Obama, like his predecessors, has said the United States had made mistakes, Drinkard noted. And contrary to Romney's most recent claims, no statement from Obama or his administration offered any sympathy to the men who attacked and killed the American ambassador and three other diplomats in Benghazi.
Kessler expected to hear Obama recycle the $6,400 cost claim on Medicare. Romney, he said, was likely to renew his assertion that Obama cut $700 billion from Medicare. That "cut" is a hoped-for reduction in the future growth of the program. When Republicans like Newt Gingrich were proposing to curb the growth of entitlements in the '90s, they insisted those were not "cuts."
Adair thought Romney would make the welfare argument and Obama would call his opponent a threat to Medicare.
Accuracy hardly figures in the expectations of the impact of the debate. It is instead widely seen as a chance for Romney, the challenger, to stand up next to an incumbent president and show himself as "presidential," like Ronald Reagan in 1980. Contrarily, remember how Al Gore's sighs during his first debate with George W. Bush hurt him in 2000.
Indeed Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, weighed in at the press club with research showing that debates, misleading statements or not, hardly change any votes. But, she said, they do educate the public about candidates' positions, so once they know who won, they have a clearer idea of what to expect from a new president.
A recent nationwide poll by the center showed the public still has a lot of education ahead because:

        
Only 23 percent knew that payroll taxes have decreased since Obama became president.
        
Only 25 percent knew that it was untrue to say Romney had ever asked for a government bailout to help Bain Capital.
        
Only 31 percent knew it was untrue to say Romney planned to eliminate Pell grants to low-income college students.
        
But 54 percent knew it was untrue that Obama had dropped all work requirements for welfare.
        
And 79 percent knew that the unemployment rate has been over 8 percent for more than a year.
The Annenberg Center, which sponsored the event, has been working to promote fact-checking by local television stations, especially of the ads which come from outside groups, not from candidates, and which the stations are not legally obligated to run (although they can charge higher rates for them). She reported that respondents to the poll who visited fact-checking sites or news sites to examine campaign claims were significantly more likely to answer factual questions like those above correctly.
But misleading or downright false claims rarely hurt the perpetrator. It's only when a candidate acquires a reputation for lying or exaggerating that it matters. It happened to Gore in 2000, when the press unfairly seized on his artlessly phrased but accurate claim that in Congress he had been a leader in fighting for funding for what became the Internet. He never said he "invented" the Internet, but that became a damaging press shorthand, recalled whenever he said something else that could be challenged factually.
My own experience as a formal fact-checking reporter was limited, but it supports the idea that verification or contradiction may enlighten a few readers or viewers but does not change votes.
I covered President Carter's debate with Reagan in 1980. The next day I wrote that it produced "almost as many contradictions of fact as disputes over policy." The phrase, "contradictions of fact," was 1980 New York Times-speak for "falsehoods" or "lies."
I wrote that those "contradictions were scattered, like sample ballots on a windy Election Day, throughout the transcript," and often touched on issues that mattered. The article went through many of them. There was Reagan's false denial that he had ever said nuclear non-proliferation, a Carter touchstone, was not "any of our business." There was Carter's claim that Reagan favored voluntary Social Security, a position Reagan had advocated in 1964 but thereafter only said should be studied. And so on.
The article closed on a note that seems relevant today:
For weeks the Carter forces have argued that, in a debate with Mr. Reagan, the president would show himself in much better command of detail. He may have done so, particularly in regard to Mr. Reagan's record. But it is far from clear that the national television audience, estimated at up to 120 million people, was more impressed by detailed arguments, with lots of numbers, than by the relaxed manner and the ability to shrug off an attack that Mr. Reagan regularly displayed.
I know Jim Lehrer has more suggestions for questions than he could ask in a week, let alone 90 minutes. But it might be worthwhile to test the candidates' ability to shrug off questions about their lying ads, and see if their manner remains as calm as Reagan's was in 1980.
 An earlier version of this article misstated Richard Nixon's political position in 1960; he was the incumbent vice president, not the incumbent president. 
Adam Clymer was a reporter and editor for The Times for 26 years. He retired as the Washington correspondent in 2003.

HEADLINE: Teaching With the Presidential Debates

BYLINE: MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: We provide teachers with several ways to use the presidential debates as an effective tool for teaching and learning. 

 BODY:
 Update | Oct. 24, 2012 
We invite students to comment on each of the three presidential debates via our Student Opinion questions:

        
"What Is Your Reaction to the First Presidential Debate?"
        
The Second Presidential Debate: Your Predictions and Reactions
        
What Are Your Reactions to the Final Presidential Debate, and Predictions for Nov. 6?
President Obama and Mitt Romney will meet face to face onstage on Wednesday in the first presidential debate of election 2012, and the event provides teachers with one of the best opportunities to engage students with this year's election. 
Debates offer the potential for suspense and can be a departure from the carefully tailored campaign messages because they happen live, onstage and in real time with millions of people watching - something that even less politically-minded students can appreciate. 
For starters, you can ask your students to watch the debates. If you're looking to go further than that, we have several suggestions on how you can use the debates as an effective teaching and learning tool.
Update: Here is a summary of how The Times will cover the debates - before, during and after. And, here are some Times articles analyzing the first debate:

        
News Analysis | A Clash of Philosophies
        
Obama and Romney, in First Debate, Spar Over Fixing the Economy
        
Interactive Replay | The First Presidential Debate
 1. Invite Student Reaction With Our Special Student Opinion Question: 
On the afternoon of Oct. 3, we'll post an open-ended Student Opinion question that asks students, What was your reaction to the first presidential debate? Invite them to post comments, observations and insights on our blog during the debate itself, during class on Thursday, or anytime thereafter. 
Not only will this offer students a chance to formulate their thoughts for others to read, it will also help them see what students around the country are thinking. 
 2. View Memorable Moments in Debate History: 
The Times video "Presidential Debate Moments" provides a brief history of televised presidential debates, including how they took a 16-year hiatus between 1960 and 1976, and how they since have become a mainstay of the election cycle. 
You can watch the video with your class and then discuss: Do you think the presidential debates are an important part of the election cycle? Do you think debates provide voters with useful information, either about the character or politics of a candidate, that they cannot get (or cannot get as easily) from other media? 
 3. Keep Score: 
When students watch the debate, you might want to have them keep an eye out for memorable moments or game-changing zingers or slip-ups. The debate scorecard (PDF) from Lynn University is one way for students to keep track of who they think wins or loses the debate. 
Or, brainstorm with your students what they will be looking for during the debates, and create your own class scorecard or BINGO sheet (PDF). (Related: our Midterm Election Bingo sheet and lesson plan.)
 4. Shift Outcomes? 
Read and discuss the article "Debates Can Shift a Race's Outcome, but It's Not Easy." You may also want to watch the seven video clips embedded in The Guardian article "The Best Presidential Debate Moments: A Video History" that capture pivotal moments in debate history. [Update: The Times has a video compilation of twelve memorable moments from past debates.] 
You can ask students: Do you think a debate can make a difference in the election outcome? What are some examples from past debates? What can you imagine could happen during this debate that might have an effect on voter opinion? 
 5. Debate the Issues: 
In our four-part Election Unit, we explain how to prepare students for their own classroom debate about election issues. Students research where the candidates stand on important issues in this election using Web sites like ProCon.org. Then they hold their own classroom debate. 
Half the class could be President Obama and the other half Mitt Romney. Or, if that feels too unwieldy for your class, the class could be divided further, with some students representing Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney, the moderator and the audience. Alternatively, students could take turns representing the candidate for each question. We provide additional instructions and ideas for guiding students through issue research and holding a class debate in our post "Election Unit, Part 2: What Are the Issues?"
 6. Give Advice: 
Give students a chance to offer advice to the candidates. Ask students what they would want to see or hear from the candidates in order for them to change their opinion. Or, if they have already made up their minds about which candidate they prefer, ask what would they would like to see their candidate say or do to best win over voters. 
Your class can read "Debate Advice From the Beltway" to hear what strategists from both sides are saying about what the candidates should do during the debates. 
 7. Consider Youth Activism: 
The last time a woman moderated a presidential debate was in 1992, and three teenagers in New Jersey organized a campaign earlier this year to make sure that at least one of this year's presidential debates has a female moderator. Watch the Times video of Jodi Kantor interviewing the three high school girls above with your class or read the related article. Then, read the follow-up article "Gender Split for Debate Moderators" and ask for students' responses. 
If you're interested in going further, students can look at the girls' original online petition on Change.org, and you can ask what petition they would like to write to make a positive change in the world.
 8. Play With Expectations: 
In the days leading up to the presidential debates, both campaigns are lowering expectations for their candidates while simultaneously praising their opponent's skills. Why? Read "The Debate Expectations Dance" and discuss: Do you think this is an effective campaign strategy? Do you find it odd that the candidates are praising their opponents? Have you ever played down expectations in their own life, either for a test, in sports or some other aspect of life? 
Update: Some humorous takes on the theme of "lowering expectations" can be found on "The Daily Show" ("Democalypse 2012 - Negate Expectations - The Presidential Debates") and in Op-Ed columnist Frank Bruni's recent "Trembling Before Mitt."
 9. Debate the Debates: 
Do televised debates get at real issues or are they about one-liners and face makeup? PBS has a feature called "Debating Our Destiny," and the Web site asks questions about whether the debates are "helpful or useless" and "cosmetics versus substance." 
The site links to interviews with George Bush and Bill Clinton, who provide opposing viewpoints about the value of the presidential debates. Students can read the interviews and then watch Wednesday's debate before holding their own in-class debate about whether the debates are worthwhile. Alternatively, they can write an essay about the value of televised debates. 
How are you planning to use the presidential debates with your students? If you have additional ideas, please share them in your comments below.

HEADLINE: Right-Wing Party Is Growing Rapidly As Greece Simmers

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
ATHENS -- The video, which went viral in Greece last month, shows about 40 burly men, led by Giorgos Germenis, a lawmaker with the right-wing Golden Dawn party, marching through a night market in the town of Rafina demanding that dark-skinned merchants show permits.
Some do, and they are left alone. But the action quickly picks up, as the men, wearing black T-shirts with the party's name, destroy a stall with clubs and scatter the merchandise. ''We saw a few illegal immigrants selling their wares,'' Mr. Germenis says in the video. ''We did what Golden Dawn has to do. And now we're going to church to pay our respects to the Madonna.''
Just a few months ago, the name Golden Dawn was something to be whispered in Greece.
But three months after the extremist right-wing group won an electoral foothold in Parliament, talk of Golden Dawn seems to be on everybody's lips. 
In cafes, taxis and bars, Greeks across the political spectrum are discussing the palpable surge in Golden Dawn's popularity, which has risen in recent political polls even as the group steps up a campaign of vigilantism and attacks against immigrants.
The poll gains come amid growing disenchantment over rising illegal immigration, and with the government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, which is being forced by its international lenders to push through $15 billion in additional, highly unpopular, austerity measures. If Greece were to hold new elections soon, Golden Dawn could emerge as the third-largest party in Parliament, behind Mr. Samaras's New Democracy and the left-wing Syriza. Currently, Golden Dawn is the fifth largest, with 18 out of 300 seats.
''We have a major socioeconomic crisis in which several hundred thousand Greeks are losing ground,'' said Nikos Demertzis, a professor of political sociology at the University of Athens. ''And you have a rising number of immigrants in Greece, many illegal. This is creating a volcanic situation where all the classic parameters for the flourishing of a far-right force like Golden Dawn are present.''
Golden Dawn's tactics are similar to ones it used before parliamentary elections in June. Preying on fears that immigrants are worsening crime rates and economic hardship, the group has been stepping up attacks against immigrants, many of whom are legal citizens, with the police frequently standing by. It is also trying to expand its reach with the Greek diaspora.
The group recently opened an office in New York, announcing its presence with a sleek Web site depicting a stylized Swastika against a darkened Manhattan skyline. The Web site was disabled by hackers less than a day later and remains down, and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association condemned the group's outreach, saying that ''fascism has no place in the United States.''
Golden Dawn has also established an outpost in Australia, where Greeks have been emigrating by the thousands to escape the crisis in their homeland.
The group is still far from being a major threat to Mr. Samaras's party, or to his fragile three-party coalition government. Most Greeks express alarm at the group's rise, and anti-fascist organizations in Athens are continuing efforts neighborhood by neighborhood to counter its increased vigilantism.
Yet, rising political and social discontent is rich fodder for Golden Dawn as it tries to cultivate a larger base. These days, it is not uncommon for conversations to evolve into laments about the ineffectiveness of Mr. Samaras's government, before a mention of Golden Dawn's rise in the polls slips in.
''People have no faith in the political system,'' said Dimitris Kaklamanos, 41, a worker at a Shell gas station in the town of Piraeus, on the outskirts of Athens.
Mr. Kaklamanos said he had long voted for Pasok, the Socialist party, but grew disillusioned with corruption and the ineptitude of its politicians. Now, he feels attracted to Golden Dawn, he said, whose popularity he expects to continue to rise, especially as the group replaces police and government services in poor areas where the state has almost ceased to function.
Other political parties ''know that Golden Dawn is gaining power and they see that as a threat,'' Mr. Kaklamanos said. ''But Golden Dawn are the only ones out there demonstrating they care about the Greek people.''
He cited food and clothing drives conducted by the group across a widening area of Athens, as well as protections it extends to vulnerable Greeks in neighborhoods where crime has surged in tandem with illegal immigration.
Kaiti Lazarou, 55, the owner of a newspaper and cigarette kiosk in Piraeus, agreed. ''I myself have gotten food and potatoes from them in Syntagma Square,'' she said. ''I would not be surprised if they become the government one day, and why shouldn't they? They protect the Greeks, while Samaras and the government are out of touch with the people.''
In an interview last week, Mr. Samaras said that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants fleeing hardship in Africa, South Asia and now Syria were creating ''major distress'' in Greece, which they use as a gateway to the European Union after entering through Turkey. He appealed to Greece's European partners to modify immigration accords so that other countries could take on a greater share of Greece's immigration burden.
With more than 1.5 million immigrants in a country of about 11 million, ''this is creating extremism'' that feeds the popularity of Golden Dawn, Mr. Samaras said. Outlawing the group could backfire by fueling their popularity, he added.
Mr. Demertzis, the University of Athens professor, said Golden Dawn was effective because it did more than just utter political platitudes. Its members ''do their propaganda through deeds, exactly the same way that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt does, or Hezbollah in Lebanon.''
In Golden Dawn's case, the most high-profile activities center on anti-immigrant campaigns, like the one documented in the video, depicted as the actions of good Samaritans.
In another raid, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the town of Missolonghi, Greek shopkeepers shout at Golden Dawn members as they walk through a fruit and vegetable market kicking over stands loaded with produce. The raid was led by another Golden Dawn lawmaker, Costas Barbarousis. ''These tactics were used in the dictatorship!'' one woman cries.
After the episodes, Golden Dawn lawmakers were barred from receiving the protection of the police, who human rights groups say are increasingly looking the other way when confronted with evidence of violence by Golden Dawn sympathizers, with some officers seeming more sympathetic to them than to their victims. Mr. Samaras played down concerns that the Greek police were sympathetic to the group. ''I'm very happy with the way they've done their job,'' he said in the interview.
Justice Minister Antonis Roupakiotis condemned the Golden Dawn attacks, saying they created ''conditions for the growth of neo-fascist practices in the country.'' He added that his ministry would consider tougher penalties for racist violence. New Democracy, Pasok and independent Greeks also condemned the attacks.
But such talk may only go so far.
''It's the current government that brought more power to Golden Dawn because the people are angry at what the government is doing,'' said Iakovos Zorzios, 73, a retiree whose pension has been cut as part of Greece's austerity measures.
''How can we not be angry when the government cuts our earnings so much?'' said Mr. Zorzios, who is bracing for yet another reduction in the latest austerity plan forged this week. ''How can they expect us not to support Golden Dawn?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Karzai Could Make Himself a Hero

BYLINE: By JIM MARSHALL. 
Jim Marshall, a former United States representative from Georgia, is the president of the United States Institute of Peace.

 BODY:
Washington
EVERY four years Americans are reminded that presidential politics is raw, nasty and rough-and-tumble. We yearn for the time to pass quickly, for the votes to be cast, for the sniping to end, for life to return to normal. For Afghans, things are starkly and sadly different.
During my latest visit to Afghanistan, a few weeks ago, I spoke with government officials, tribal leaders, intellectuals and ordinary citizens. Nearly all worried that too little time remained to properly prepare for a presidential election by the spring of 2014, and they feared that if the election is seen as illegitimate, it could start a civil war. Their fears are rooted in Afghanistan's history, and they make sense today. Afghanistan is still a fractured country, divided principally among four main ethnic groups, each of which speaks a different language; in addition, it is split among urban and rural interests, modernizing and traditional attitudes, and various political groups that churn these differences. 
President Hamid Karzai was re-elected in a flawed election in 2009, as was the current Parliament in 2010. A peaceful, democratic transfer of power would be a first for a modern Afghan chief executive: six were deposed between 1973 and 1992, and of those, five were killed.
Yet there are reasons to hope for a viable election, if election preparations accelerate immediately. Despite the significant electoral fraud in past elections, Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission is gaining experience and showing increasing competence. With assistance from the international community, and if politicians allow it to do its job, it can do the technical work required to deliver fair elections.
But only one politician can truly assure the commission's independence and success: Hamid Karzai. He is a courageous man with whom I have met several times, although not on this last trip. He cannot seek re-election, and so he stands in a perfect position now to secure his place in Afghan history by insuring that future elections will be more fair and credible than past ones have been. The decisions Mr. Karzai makes now, including his appointments of electoral commissioners and his deference to the commission's work, will be the last and truest test of his statesmanship. As a politician and a citizen, he will have every right to campaign for his preferred candidate. But as the country's chief executive, he has a duty to act now to ensure a fair election whose results are broadly accepted. So he should consult with opposition figures on the naming of the next electoral commissioners, and appoint a commission that is widely perceived to be balanced and impartial. That would show an early and decisive commitment to a truly democratic election.
As for the United States, its current policy is, correctly, to insist on a fair electoral process without taking sides in the contest. But that goal must be pursued more urgently. The Afghans I spoke to felt strongly that the United States should already be pressing the government and the international community for a final plan for fair elections; it should also provide the necessary support to guarantee its execution.
The Afghans I spoke to acknowledged that strong American pressure might be denounced as interference with Afghanistan's sovereign rights. But for the vast majority of Afghans, they argued, anything less than forceful, visible American leadership would be viewed as tacit United States support for an electoral process that gives unfair advantages to some ethnic groups or individuals. ''Existential stakes trump niceties,'' said one Afghan political activist, noting that the United States and its allies are currently responsible for the major part of Afghanistan's security and economy.
The options facing Afghanistan and its allies are stark. Unless a credible election legitimizes a successor to Mr. Karzai, Afghanistan's fragile political order will most likely implode, followed by the disintegration of its security forces, a renewal of harsh civil war and the resurgence of Taliban forces. These threats explain why both the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed by the Afghan and United States governments in May and the Mutual Accountability Framework agreed upon by Afghanistan and numerous donors in Tokyo in July made clear that future aid for Afghanistan will depend upon successful elections and improved democratic governance. Under those agreements, rigging the elections or failing to hold them would almost certainly lead to sharp reductions in foreign aid, which could in turn wreak havoc with Afghanistan's economy and add to political instability and armed conflict.
A great deal of technical work will have to be done, in not much time, to correct serious problems with the voter registry and to assure both security and a level political playing field. Mostly, what Afghans need now is forceful leadership from their president to let them fairly choose his successor. Given Afghanistan's history, such an achievement would be heroic. Mr. Karzai should be that hero.

HEADLINE: List of Global Brands Keeps Coke on Top, And Apple Jumps Up

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS Advertising Week 2012 continues in New York, a widely discussed topic is how to generate measurable business results for the brands sold by marketers. Coincidentally, a study to be released on Tuesday addresses the value of powerful brands -- and the problems of brands whose value is diminishing.
The study is the 13th annual Best Global Brands report from Interbrand, a brand consulting company owned by the Omnicom Group. The report ranks what it deems the 100 most valuable brands on criteria that include financial performance, the role the brand plays in influencing the choices made by consumers and the brand's ability to help its parent's earnings. 
Such measures ought to attract more attention on Madison Avenue, Christine Fruechte, president and chief executive at Colle & McVoy, an agency owned by MDC Partners, said during an Advertising Week panel on Monday.
''When we put together advertising programs, we're constantly keeping in mind how to add shareholder value,'' Ms. Fruechte said. ''We want to have a tangible impact on the client's business or services.''
Ms. Fruechte cited as an example a client, the Caribou Coffee Company, whose stock, she said, has risen to more than $18 a share from $1.17 when the agency began its work.
Although Caribou Coffee is not listed in the 2012 report, many of the ranked brands are known for dedicating time and corporate treasure to continually, if not continuously, trying to improve the results of their advertising. Case in point is the brand that ranked No. 1 on the list for the 13th consecutive year, Coca-Cola. Interbrand estimated its brand value at $77.8 billion, up 8 percent from the 2011 report.
''We remain very humble that we're in that top spot,'' said Joseph V. Tripodi, executive vice president and chief marketing and commercial officer at the Coca-Cola Company. Mr. Tripodi has spoken frequently about how increasing the effectiveness of ads will help the company increase its revenue to $200 billion in 2020, from $95 billion in 2008.
Although ''nothing lasts forever,'' Mr. Tripodi said of the streak, the company will strive to keep the Coke brand relevant through innovations in how it engages with consumers. For instance, he said, on Facebook Coca-Cola has more likes, 51.98 million, than any other brand.
''A lot of staying relevant is not being afraid to take risks or do different things,'' Mr. Tripodi said. ''It's less about what you sell and more about what you stand for as a brand and company.''
Despite the status quo atop the list, eight of the remaining top nine brands changed ranks from last year, Interbrand reported, including Apple, which rose to No. 2 from No. 8, and Samsung, which rose to No. 9 from No. 17.
Also, two brands dropped out of the top 10: Disney, which fell to No. 13 from No. 9 last year, and Hewlett-Packard, which fell to No. 15 from No. 10.
''Brands like Apple and Samsung set the pace'' for the 2012 report, said Jez Frampton, global chief executive at Interbrand, which is dominated by strong performances by technology companies. Indeed, of the top 10 brands, five are in technology: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel and Samsung.
(Interbrand considers I.B.M., also in the top 10, a business services brand rather than a technology brand. With it included, six of the top 10 would be technology brands.)
''Technology companies are doing so well because they're showing real understand of human beings'' as they ''change the way we live our lives,'' Mr. Frampton said.
''It's irony, a group of technology companies showing the way how to be human,'' he added.
Another prominent technology company, Facebook, entered the list for the first time, at No. 69. Facebook was among six new entrants; the others are Pampers (34), Prada (84), Kia (87), Ralph Lauren (91) and MasterCard (94).
''It's very flattering for us to be part of it,'' said David Lauren, executive vice president for advertising, marketing and corporate communications at the Ralph Lauren Corporation. ''It's always nice to be recognized.''
Some brands from the 2011 report are absent from this year's list. One is Barclays, which was in 79th place last year; Mr. Frampton attributed the departure to the ''adverse effects'' of the accusations that Barclays had tried to fix key interest rates for its own benefit.
Several brands that were ranked lower on the 2012 list compared with last year's have also been suffering setbacks. Among them are BlackBerry, which tumbled to 93 from 56; Goldman Sachs, which declined to 48 from 38; and Nokia, which dropped to 19 from 14.
Conversely, several brands in the top 100 took noticeable steps up. They include, in addition to Apple and Samsung, Amazon, which climbed to 20 from 26, and Nissan, which rose to 73 from 90.
''It's by far the most significant leap we've had,'' said Andy Palmer, executive vice president for marketing and planning at the Nissan Motor Company. ''It's the ultimate external proof point that we're doing the right things as a brand.''
Among those things, Mr. Palmer said, is that ''we've become a heck of a lot better at telling stories,'' as this year, ''for the first time in our 80-year history, we created a global brand campaign'' for Nissan.
He also cited advertising efforts like a Nissan channel on YouTube with ''one new story every single day of the year,'' he said, an app with about 54,000 downloads and Twitter feeds for models like the Nissan Leaf as well as for regions like Nissan USA.

HEADLINE: American Express Says It Will Refund $85 Million

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
American Express will reimburse $85 million to about 250,000 customers to resolve accusations that the company violated federal law in its marketing, billing and debt collection practices, the company and the government said Monday.
The settlement is the latest in a series of enforcement actions that federal and state regulators have brought against some of the nation's largest financial institutions for problems in their credit card businesses. In each of the cases, regulators have exposed critical flaws in how the banks monitor vendors that perform central business functions.
The multiagency investigation of American Express included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. They discovered violations of consumer protection laws between 2003 and this year that started ''from the moment a consumer shopped for a card to the moment the consumer got a phone call about long overdue debt,'' Richard Cordray, the director of the consumer protection bureau, said in a statement. 
To win customers for its Blue Sky travel reward credit card program, the lender sometimes offered customers a misleading promotion. Some customers thought they would receive a $300 reward, but that never materialized, the regulators said.
In doling out credit, they said, American Express also discriminated against applicants based on their age. The company also duped consumers into paying off stale credit card debt with the promise of improving their credit score, the investigators said; in fact, regulators found, American Express was not reporting the payments to the credit bureaus at all.
The action was directed at the two main bank subsidiaries of American Express, Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB, which are both based in Utah and issue credit cards. Also singled out was American Express Travel Related Services Company, which provides support and marketing for the banking units.
American Express customers should expect refunds by March 2013, regulators said. The company also agreed to pay $27.5 million in fines to the regulators.
American Express, long known for its aspirational cards and wealthier customer base, said it had outlined plans to address each of the violations and ''cooperated fully'' with regulators. The company is the country's biggest credit card issuer by purchase volume. Last year, the lender had revenue of $30 billion, up 9 percent from a year earlier.
The move against the bank is part of a broader push by federal and state regulators to protect consumers from illegal credit card and debt collection practices as millions of Americans struggle to pay their bills in a floundering economy.
So far this year, the newly minted Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has leveled enforcement actions against Capital One and Discover Financial over sales tactics. Last week, Discover agreed to pay $200 million to more than 3.5 million cardholders who bought credit protection services over the phone, and $14 million in civil penalties to banking regulators. Through those actions alone, the bureau has forced credit card companies to give refunds to more than five million customers.
In each of the three cases, the regulators found that the companies failed to monitor so-called third-party vendors. In the action against Capital One, for example, the consumer bureau took aim at a company that used high-pressure marketing tactics to persuade consumers to buy expensive and largely unnecessary products presented as a way to protect them from identity theft and hardships like unemployment or disability.
In the latest move against American Express, federal regulators said that ''all violations'' aside from the credit discrimination ''are attributed to deficient management oversight of the bank's service providers.''
Problems at American Express surfaced in February 2011 during an examination of Centurion Bank, and soon the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was delving into similar issues at the other two American Express units.
Particularly vexing, consumer advocates said, were the bank's debt collection practices. Appealing to consumers who wanted to clean up their credit scores, a crucial metric that is used beyond the lending arena to sometimes even determine employment eligibility, American Express told customers that those scores would improve if they paid off old debts.
Despite those promises, regulators found, American Express never reported those payments to the credit agencies. Many of the debts were so old that they no longer marred the credit reports at all.
Regulators accused American Express of ''deficient'' compliance systems. As a result, some bank employees who pitched credit cards were not given adequate training or information about all the applicable federal laws.
Adding to a deficit in oversight, regulators found, was turnover in Centurion bank's chief compliance officer. Regulators said that position ''turned over frequently,'' undermining the compliance monitoring.
American Express has so far dodged censure for its payment protection plans, which were at the center of the consumer agency's actions against Capital One and Discover. The company said it stopped marketing those services earlier this year and is cooperating with regulators.
Such products have drawn the ire of state attorneys general who have said that they prey on customers' fears, particularly those who are anxious about a persistent recession. Typically, the products promise to forgive or trim the debts of card holders in the event they lose their jobs, become disabled or die.
In a statement, American Express said it was ''continuing its own internal reviews and is also cooperating with regulators in their ongoing regulatory examination of add-on products in accordance with an industrywide review.''
Monday's enforcement action was ''intended as a message to all entities,'' said Kent Markus, assistant director of enforcement for the consumer bureau. ''There are consequences for violating the law.''
Under the deal with regulators, American Express must halt the deceptive practices and set up independent auditors to ensure that its practices comply with consumer protection laws.
The fines and customer refunds will be paid, for the most part, by reserves established in previous quarters, American Express said.

HEADLINE: New Director Is Outrunning His Hard Luck

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Despite its unusual title, the movie ''3, 2, 1 ... Frankie Go Boom'' seemed doomed to go unnoticed. A marquee actor dropped out of an important role at the last minute. The Sundance Film Festival rejected it. Some audio equipment malfunctioned during a viewing for potential distributors, and all of the hoped-for major buyers subsequently passed.
Frankie go thud. 
But this comedy, written and directed by Jordan Roberts, kept beating the odds. After that actor balked at playing a transvestite -- Mr. Roberts won't say who it was -- Ron Perlman of ''Hellboy'' and ''Sons of Anarchy'' fame agreed to pinch hit, delivering a you've-got-to-see-this-to-believe-it marketing hook. South by Southwest gave the movie a chance to be seen on the festival circuit last March.
Mr. Roberts even ended up turning down a distribution offer from a major studio: by that time, he had already secured a theatrical release for his film.
Perhaps ''Frankie Go Boom,'' now available on video on demand and arriving in theaters for a limited run on Oct. 12, just has good karma. Mr. Roberts, a novice director but one of Hollywood's most sought-after writers and script doctors, is the sort of good guy who isn't supposed to exist in the belly of show business.
He refused the big studio offer, for instance, because he had already made a handshake deal for distribution and marketing with a tiny company called Variance Films. (Universal Pictures, however, will handle foreign release and DVD and TV sales.) Rather than trying to sweet talk an investor into writing a check, Mr. Roberts, 54, also broke one of moviedom's cardinal rules and spent his own money -- about $500,000 -- to make his movie.
''It wasn't just strength of character,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''Paying for it myself gave me total control.'' He added, ''Whether I am a colossal idiot remains to be seen, although my wife has already made up her mind.''
A silly farce, ''Frankie Go Boom'' stars Chris O'Dowd (''Bridesmaids'') as a recovering drug addict who secretly videotapes his brother having sex -- or at least trying to -- and posts the footage online. Mr. Perlman plays Phyllis, a butch transvestite and Internet whiz. Chris Noth, wearing only a jock strap in one lengthy scene, appears as a cocaine-addicted exercise fanatic. Comedians like Nora Dunn and Whitney Cummings have supporting roles. Some of the actors worked for sharply cut rates.
''It was a delicious opportunity to go hog wild,'' said Mr. Noth, who is primarily known for playing more buttoned-down characters. ''I just decided to take a deep breath and let it all hang out.''
Filmed in Los Angeles over 20 days, ''Frankie Go Boom'' in many ways resulted from Mr. Roberts's first experience as a writer-director in 2004. It did not go well. His film, ''Around the Bend,'' a heartfelt drama starring Christopher Walken, was pummeled by critics and took in a grand total of $193,637 at the North American box office. Mr. Roberts took the flop personally, and was left feeling artistically impotent.
''I was completely unprepared for public ridicule, the possibility that critics would shred me, and I went into a deep creative funk,'' he said. ''It was hard to bring my toys out and play again.''
The Hollywood grind was wearing on Mr. Roberts in other ways. He was quite successful, compared with most screenwriters, having written or contributed writing to about 45 scripts sold to studios. But, as is typical in the movie business, almost all of the screenplays died before making it to production.
''It's deeply disturbing to create so much work that never gets seen,'' he said.
Script doctoring -- tackling a specific structure or character problem behind the scenes -- left him feeling unfulfilled; it's great if your work helps deliver a hit, but you don't get any credit. Mr. Roberts declined to discuss his script doctoring work, saying he was contractually prohibited, citing union rules; talent agents have mentioned the 2002 crime drama ''Road to Perdition'' and this year's ''Dolphin Tale'' as two on which he worked.
''There are three things that distinguish him as a writer,'' said Mark Gill, a veteran film executive who has worked with Mr. Roberts on various projects. ''He can write heart, which is not easy. He is surprisingly good at collaborating. And he's three times as fast as any writer I've ever worked with.''
Mr. Roberts, who can come across as stubborn and a bit defensive about past affronts but also has a strong Pollyanna streak, does have one big hit that is public: ''March of the Penguins.'' He wrote the narration for the American version of that 2005 French documentary, which took in $91 million, after adjusting for inflation.
Still, at the end of the day, it was just ''somebody else's nonfiction film about arctic water fowl,'' he said.
So Mr. Roberts decided to give writing and directing his own movie another whirl, drawing on his family for inspiration, particularly his two brothers. One was a heroin addict who died 30 years ago and formed the basis for Mr. O'Dowd's character, ''a crazed lunatic with a giant heart,'' as Mr. Roberts put it. ''I also had a brother who is now my sister,'' he said. ''She transitioned five or six years ago, and Ron Perlman plays her.''
He continued: ''Sadly, Ron almost never gets asked to perform in pantyhose. But we changed that. My lasting contribution to cinema!''

HEADLINE: James E. Burke, 87, Dies; Candid Ex-Chief of J.&J.

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
James E. Burke, whose leadership of Johnson & Johnson during the Tylenol poisonings in the 1980s is regarded as a textbook example of how to handle a public relations crisis, died on Friday at a health care facility near New Brunswick, N.J. He was 87. His death was confirmed by his son, James.
As Johnson & Johnson's chairman and chief executive from 1976 until his retirement in 1989, Mr. Burke oversaw a vast expansion of the company, which now sells a variety of products like baby shampoo, prescription drugs and artificial hips. Sales tripled to $9 billion a year, and the company began doing business in many more countries. 
But Mr. Burke is best known for his handling of the Tylenol crisis in 1982, when seven people in the Chicago area died after taking capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol that had been laced with cyanide. In 1986, another poisoned capsule killed a woman in Yonkers. The crimes have never been solved.
The company spent more than $100 million recalling 32 million bottles of Tylenol capsules from store shelves in 1982, and even more on another recall in 1986. And Mr. Burke placed himself before news cameras and apologized.
In a news conference in 1986 announcing that Johnson & Johnson would stop selling its over-the-counter products in capsules, which could be tampered with, and switch to solid caplets, a reporter asked if Mr. Burke was sorry the company had not acted sooner. ''Yes, indeed I am,'' he said.
''That taught corporations a lesson about candor,'' John F. Welch Jr., the former chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said on Monday in a telephone interview. ''It was a huge legacy to leave: When you have a problem, deal with it openly, up front.''
Those who knew Mr. Burke said he thrived on lively debate and sought opinions wherever he went. Three days into the first Tylenol poisonings in 1982, he traveled to Vermont to visit his son for parents' weekend at Middlebury College. His son said he had assumed that his father would be too busy to make the trip, but Mr. Burke insisted and took eight of his son's friends out to dinner.
''He sat and he asked each one of them, 'If you were me, what would you do?' '' James Burke, who is an independent film producer, recalled on Monday. ''He asked everybody he could think of what would be the right thing to do, and then took what made sense to him and his values.''
Within months in 1982, Johnson & Johnson had returned Tylenol to the market in new, tamper-resistant packaging -- the scare prompted Congress to pass antitampering legislation -- and it took just one more year before the company recovered its position as the top-selling over-the-counter pain reliever.
James Edward Burke was born in Rutland, Vt., on Feb. 28, 1925, a son of James and Mary Barnett Burke. He grew up in Slingerlands, N.Y., a small town outside Albany.
During World War II, Mr. Burke was an ensign in the Navy. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1947 from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., and continued on to Harvard Business School, graduating in 1949.
After a stint as a sales representative for Procter & Gamble, Mr. Burke went to work at Johnson & Johnson in 1953 as a product director.
Over the next two decades, Mr. Burke took on increasingly important roles as a marketing executive on the consumer side of the company's business. He became vice president of marketing in 1964. In 1973, he became president of Johnson & Johnson, and three years later he was named chairman and chief executive.
After his retirement, Mr. Burke became chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a position he held until 2005. He also served on the boards of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Carnegie Institution of Washington and on the Chairman's Council of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
In 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded Mr. Burke the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, for his business leadership and his antidrug efforts.
Mr. Burke was a longtime resident of Princeton, N.J. Besides his son, he is survived by his wife of 31 years, Didi; a daughter, Clo Burke; a sister, Phyllis Burke Davis; and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Romney Expands Focus Beyond the Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and ASHLEY PARKER; Michael Barbaro and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
From the start, Mitt Romney's campaign was premised on the belief that the economy's struggles would make President Obama politically vulnerable. Grim economic statistics, the assumption went, would make Mr. Romney's argument for him.
There is little evidence that the strategy is working, at least not to the degree that Mr. Romney had hoped. Polls show voters growing somewhat more optimistic, and increasingly willing to trust the president as much as they do Mr. Romney on jobs and the economy. 
With the race now in the home stretch and the debates starting on Wednesday, Mr. Romney's campaign appears to be shifting course, abandoning its hope of making the election a simple referendum on Mr. Obama's jobs record.
Instead, Mr. Romney intends to hit the White House with a series of arguments -- on energy, health care, taxes, spending and a more direct attack on Mr. Obama's foreign policy record.
Some top aides at Mr. Romney's campaign headquarters in Boston fear their simple message has become muddled. One suggested last week that Mr. Obama's campaign motto, ''Forward,'' has been more effective -- easy to understand, easy to remember and easy to say -- than Mr. Romney's ''Believe in America'' slogan.
But advisers say Mr. Romney is armed with a litany of arguments for his face-off with Mr. Obama in Denver this week. And in television advertisements and speeches in the days ahead, the campaign plans to frame the election as a critical choice for voters.
In one effort to move beyond the economic argument, Mr. Romney accused Mr. Obama of major foreign policy failures in an opinion article published on Monday in The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Romney said the president had allowed the nation's influence to atrophy by ''stepping away'' from its allies.
''Amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them,'' Mr. Romney wrote. ''We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or our allies. And that's dangerous.''
The Republican campaign also hopes to seize on concerns about the nation's growing debt amid polling that suggests Mr. Romney still retains a sizable edge over the president regarding who will rein in spending in Washington.
''Our message is very clear, which is we cannot afford four more years like the last four years, and we need a real recovery,'' Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, said after briefing reporters on Monday morning. ''Whether it's job creation, health care, energy or debt, the message is we cannot afford four more years like the last four years. We know this resonates with voters.''
Democrats have been trying all along to turn the 2012 race into a ''choice'' election between the policies and personalities of both candidates, so that the single focus is not the economy. And while it is too soon to know if the Republicans' multipronged strategy will hurt Mr. Obama, the election is now being fought on the president's preferred ground.
''They had no choice but to move on to our playing field,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''When they go to the choice argument, they are stuck.''
When Mr. Romney announced his candidacy in the summer of 2011, his top advisers -- in particular his senior strategist, Stuart Stevens -- repeatedly said they believed that the country's economic woes would keep voter attention focused squarely on the president. Mr. Romney embraced that approach from the beginning with a YouTube video announcing his candidacy in which he said, ''President Obama's policies have failed.''
Mr. Romney has seized on weak job numbers to argue that Mr. Obama has been unable to repair the economy, and on Friday the federal government will issue its report for September, including an updated unemployment estimate.
But polls suggest that the economic argument has not worked as Mr. Romney had hoped. A CNN/ORC International poll, conducted Sept. 28 to Sept. 30 and released on Monday, showed the candidates tied on the question of who would best handle the economy. Other polls indicate that voters increasingly believe the country is headed in the right direction.
After the political conventions, Mr. Romney's campaign had planned to use a new slogan to highlight the president's economic failures: ''This isn't what a recovery looks like.'' The phrase was used a few times, but appears to have faded as the campaign has embraced a broader message.
Aides stress that Mr. Romney will continue to press the economic case against the president. But rather than focusing on Mr. Obama, they plan to stress that voters need to make a choice between two men with different visions of the world. In the briefing with reporters on Monday, aides used the word ''choice'' more than a dozen times.
Aides said their warnings about ''another four years'' will provide the campaign with an opportunity to demonstrate that Mr. Romney is the better choice and has a better plan for America when it comes to the economy, foreign policy, health care and energy.
''It's important for us to lay out the important contrast, the important choice these voters face, on the issues they care about,'' said Kevin Madden, a spokesman and senior adviser to the Republican campaign.

HEADLINE: Doctor Visits Dropping, New Census Figures Show

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Americans of working age are going to the doctor less frequently than they were 10 years ago, according to a new report by the Census Bureau.
In 2010, people age 18 to 64 made an average of 3.9 visits to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, down from 4.8 visits in 2001, said the report, which was released on Monday. 
The precise reasons for the decline were unclear, said Brett O'Hara, an official at the Census Bureau and a co-author of the report. But the changing demographics of the American population most likely had something to do with it.
As baby boomers retire, for example, they leave a working-age population that is on average younger and that tends to use less health care. Still, that is likely to be only a small part of the explanation, as the baby boomers began to move into retirement only at the end of the report's period, about two years ago.
Another possible reason for the decline in doctor visits, Mr. O'Hara said, is that the share of uninsured working-age people has expanded over the past decade. People without insurance are less likely to visit a doctor, said the report, which was based on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, a long-running survey of more than 80,000 households. The share of working-age Americans without health insurance was 21.8 percent in 2010, according to the Census Bureau, up from 17 percent in 2001.
The report measures the years before 2010, when a provision in the Affordable Care Act began allowing young adults to stay on their parents insurance policies until age 26. That change has helped stem the rise in the uninsured.
People lacking insurance were far less likely to go to doctors. Just 24 percent of the uninsured went to a doctor at least once in 2010, compared with 72 percent of the general population of working age adults, the report found.
The share of doctors visits by uninsured adults was low, Mr. O'Hara said, despite the safety net that is supposed to help them get medical care, like as federally financed community health centers and hospitals with charity care.
But even for those with insurance, costs have increased, with deductibles and premiums rising far faster than inflation, and many have cut back on doctor visits, said Kathleen Stoll, director of health policy at Families USA, a nonprofit health care research and advocacy group.
''Many are thinking twice before going to a physician,'' she said.
Still, about two-thirds of Americans reported being in good or excellent health, the report said, compared with about one-third that reported being in fair or poor health. The report also showed the sharp difference in medical usage by income. Nearly 40 percent of people in poverty did not visit a doctor in 2010, compared with 19 percent of people from higher income levels.
Hispanics were the least likely to seek medical care, with 42 percent reporting not having visited a doctor at all in 2010. Among whites, the share was 23 percent and among blacks it was 30 percent.

HEADLINE: Senate Leaders See Path To Advert Mandatory Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders are closing in on a path for dealing with the ''fiscal cliff'' facing the country in January, opting to try to use a postelection session of Congress to reach agreement on a comprehensive deficit reduction deal rather than a short-term solution.
Senate Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on the details, and House Republicans continue to resist any discussion of tax increases. But lawmakers and aides say that a bipartisan group of senators is coalescing around an ambitious three-step process to avert a series of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts. 
First, senators would come to an agreement on a deficit reduction target -- likely to be around $4 trillion over 10 years -- to be reached through revenue raised by an overhaul of the tax code, savings from changes to social programs like Medicare and Social Security, and cuts to federal programs. Once the framework is approved, lawmakers would vote on expedited instructions to relevant Congressional committees to draft the details over six months to a year.
If those efforts failed, another plan would take effect, probably a close derivative of the proposal by President Obama's fiscal commission led by Erskine B. Bowles, the Clinton White House chief of staff, and former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, a Republican. Those recommendations included changes to Social Security, broad cuts in federal programs and actions that would lower tax rates over all but eliminate or pare enough deductions and credits to yield as much as $2 trillion in additional revenue.
Finally, they would vote to put off the automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, and tax increases scheduled to hit all at once in January -- but with some deficit reduction down payment to signal how serious Congress is.
Mr. Obama has said he would not allow Congress to simply pass a new law to override the $1 trillion in automatic cuts agreed to in the Budget Control Act of 2011, but senators said they believed the White House would go along with a deal that locks in as much as four times those savings in exchange for canceling the automatic cuts.
With both sides awaiting the outcome of the election, negotiators will not even try to determine how much money would come from the three components until after the voting, when, presumably, the victorious side would emerge with new leverage.
''A lot of what happens and when it happens depends on the outcome of the election,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
House Republicans, favored to retain control regardless of the presidential and Senate results, have not been part of the Senate talks so far and could be difficult to sway to back a package with significant new revenue even if it wins bipartisan Senate support.
Democratic leaders are already signaling a major stumbling block: they will accept no deal that extends Bush-era tax cuts for the rich, even for six months.
''President Obama has clearly stated he will not extend the Bush tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, and I fully support his position,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said in a statement. ''Americans are sick and tired of simply kicking the can down the road and avoiding our nation's financial issues.''
Other senators, like Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, have counseled a more incremental approach to head off mandatory deep military cuts next year. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, had suggested finding enough savings for a six-month delay on taxes and cuts to give negotiators more time.
But Mr. McConnell compared the government to a ship sinking under the weight of Medicare and Social Security and said that temporarily holding off the automatic budget cuts and tax increases would not avert a disaster.
''Even if we rearrange the chairs, fix the tax thing, fix the sequester, the ship's still going down,'' he said in an interview. ''I want to deal with it altogether. The next best opportunity is the end of the year.''
With their party leaders's encouragement, Senators Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, and Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, have begun talks on legislative language to lock a deficit reduction framework into law.
And pressure for a deal continues to grow. On Monday, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center released a new study estimating that if nothing is done, the expiration of all the Bush-era tax cuts would raise taxes by more than $500 billion next year alone, an average increase of $3,500 per household. Middle-income families, it said, would see taxes rise by an average of almost $2,000.
Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, said figures like those and forecasts anticipating a recession if nothing is done have prompted some consideration for postponing any tax increases or spending cuts for a year. But he said lawmakers want to lock in action on the deficit now.
''You have to have the framework of a plan,'' he said. ''We need to find something that's going to make us come to the table and put our fiscal house in order.''
The two parties will have only weeks to reach an agreement between Election Day and Dec. 31, and they remain far apart on some fundamental issues besides tax cuts for the wealthy. House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio says he will not accept any deal that raises tax rates or ''decouples'' the Bush-era tax rates by extending some but allowing others to expire.
Senators have also failed to agree on a mechanism to enforce a deficit reduction plan. Mr. Durbin has suggested that if Congress cannot agree on changes to the tax code, entitlements and spending in six months, the automatic spending cuts and tax increases should go into effect.
But the bipartisan group of senators says that medicine has already proved too tough to swallow. Instead, the backstop should be an acceptable deficit reduction program like Simpson-Bowles.
''The idea is to put in place an end product upfront that is already fairly agreeable,'' said a Senate official familiar with the plans. ''You'd basically be giving Congress six months to improve upon it.''
After so many false starts, even those involved in the talks are reluctant to express much optimism.
Mr. McConnell and other Republicans said only the president could make a deal happen.
''I encourage all these discussions,'' he said. ''They're all good. But we need the president, whoever that is, to not be a bystander like this president, to step up to the plate, and do three things: make the deal, deliver the members of his party and sign the bill.''

HEADLINE: Saw an Earth at Risk and Let the World Know

BYLINE: By DANIEL LEWIS

 BODY:
Barry Commoner, a founder of modern ecology and one of its most provocative thinkers and mobilizers in making environmentalism a people's political cause, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 95 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
His wife, Lisa Feiner, confirmed his death.
Dr. Commoner was a leader among a generation of scientist-activists who recognized the toxic consequences of America's post-World War II technology boom, and one of the first to stir the national debate over the public's right to comprehend the risks and make decisions about them.
Raised in Brooklyn during the Depression and trained as a biologist at Columbia and Harvard, he came armed with a combination of scientific expertise and leftist zeal. His work on the global effects of radioactive fallout, which included documenting concentrations of strontium 90 in the baby teeth of thousands of children, contributed materially to the adoption of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963.
From there it was a natural progression to a range of environmental and social issues that kept him happily in the limelight as a speaker and an author through the 1960s and '70s, and led to a wobbly run for president in 1980. 
In 1970, the year of the first Earth Day, Time magazine put Dr. Commoner on its cover and called him the Paul Revere of Ecology. He was by no means the only one sounding alarms; the movement was well under way by then, building on the impact of Rachel Carson's book ''Silent Spring'' in 1962 and the work of many others. But he was arguably the most peripatetic in his efforts to draw public attention to environmental dangers.
(The same issue of Time noted that President Richard M. Nixon had already signed on. In his State of the Union address that January, he said, ''The great question of the '70s is, shall we surrender to our surroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land and to our water?'' And he followed through: Among other steps, the Environmental Protection Agency was established in December 1970.)
Dr. Commoner was an imposing professorial figure, with a strong face, heavy eyeglasses, black eyebrows and a thick head of hair that gradually turned pure white. He was much in demand as a speaker and a debater, especially on college campuses, where he helped supply a generation of activists with a framework that made the science of ecology accessible.
His four informal rules of ecology were catchy enough to print on a T-shirt and take to the street: Everything is connected to everything else. Everything must go somewhere. Nature knows best. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
Although the rules were plain enough, the thinking behind them required leaps of faith. Dr. Commoner's overarching concern was not ecology as such but rather a radical ideal of social justice in which everything was indeed connected to everything else. Like some other left-leaning dissenters of his time, he believed that environmental pollution, war, and racial and sexual inequality needed to be addressed as related issues of a central problem.
A Critic of Capitalism
Having been grounded, as an undergraduate, in Marxist theory, he saw his main target as capitalist ''systems of production'' in industry, agriculture, energy and transportation that emphasized profits and technological progress with little regard for consequences: greenhouse gases, nonbiodegradable materials, and synthetic fertilizers and toxic wastes that leached into the water supply.
He insisted that the planet's future depended on industry's learning not to make messes in the first place, rather than on trying to clean them up. It followed, by his logic, that scientists in the service of industry could not merely invent some new process or product and then wash their hands of moral responsibility for the side effects. He was a lasting opponent of nuclear power because of its radioactive waste; he scorned the idea of pollution credit swaps because, after all, he said, an industry would have to be fouling the environment in the first place to be rewarded by such a program.
In a ''Last Word'' interview with The New York Times in 2006, videotaped to accompany this obituary online, Dr. Commoner elaborated on his holistic views and lamented the inability of society to connect the dots among its multitude of challenges, calling it ''an unfortunate feature of political development in this country.''
Noting the success of movements that had promoted civil rights, sexual equality, organized labor, environmentalism and an end to the war in Vietnam, he said one might think that ''if they would only get together, they could remake the country.'' But, he added, that has not happened.
Then he said: ''I don't believe in environmentalism as the solution to anything. What I believe is that environmentalism illuminates the things that need to be done to solve all of the problems together. For example, if you're going to revise the productive system to make cars or anything else in such a way as to suit the environmental necessities, at the same time why not see to it that women earn as much as men for the same work?''
Dr. Commoner's diagnoses and prescriptions sometimes put him at odds with other environmental leaders. He is rightly remembered as an important figure in the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, a nationwide teach-in conceived by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, and he himself regarded the observance as historically important. But Earth Day also illustrated the growing factionalization of a movement in which ''environmentalism'' comprised a number of agendas, all competing for attention and money, and could mean anything from ending the Vietnam War to growing one's own cabbages.
That was the context for the rift between Dr. Commoner and advocates of population control, who saw environmental degradation as a byproduct of overpopulation. They had become a force on the strength of Paul R. Ehrlich's huge best seller ''The Population Bomb.'' Conservationist groups like the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation were strong supporters of Dr. Ehrlich's views.
Dr. Commoner took aim at the ''neo-Malthusians,'' as he called those who, like the English scholar Thomas Malthus, foresaw perils in population growth. In a panel discussion with Dr. Ehrlich in 1970, he said it was ''a cop-out of the worst kind'' to say that ''none of our pollution problems can be solved without getting at population first.''
He elaborated in his best-known book, ''The Closing Circle,'' published the next year. Reducing population, Dr. Commoner wrote, was ''equivalent to attempting to save a leaking ship by lightening the load and forcing passengers overboard.''
''One is constrained to ask if there isn't something radically wrong with the ship.''
In the science establishment, Dr. Commoner's standing was ambiguous. Along with eminent figures of the postwar years like the chemist Linus Pauling and the anthropologist Margaret Mead, he was concerned that the integrity of American science had been compromised -- first by the government's emphasis on supporting physics at the expense of other fields during the development of nuclear weapons, and second by the growing privatization of research, in which pure science took a back seat to projects that held short-range promise of marketable technologies.
It was a concern remarkably similar to that of the distinctly unradical Dwight D. Eisenhower, who warned of the dangerous power of ''the military-industrial complex'' as he was leaving the presidency. But although Dr. Commoner had a record of achievement as a cellular biologist and founding director of the government-financed Center for the Biology of Natural Systems, he was seen primarily as the advocate for a politics that relatively few considered practicable or even desirable. Among other positions, he advocated forgiveness of all third world debt, which he said would decrease poverty and despair and thus act as a natural curb on population growth.
His platform did not get him very far in the 1980 presidential race, which he entered as the head of his own Citizens' Party. He won only about 234,000 votes as Ronald Reagan swept to victory. Dr. Commoner himself conceded that he would not have made a very good president. Still, he was angry that the questions he had raised had generated so little interest.
His own favorite moment of the campaign, he recalled many years later, was when a reporter in Albuquerque asked, ''Dr. Commoner, are you a serious candidate, or are you just running on the issues?''
Barry Commoner was born on May 28, 1917, in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. His parents, the former Goldie Yarmolinsky and Isidore Commoner, were Jewish immigrants from Russia, his father a tailor until he went blind. (The original family name, Comenar, was Anglicized at the suggestion of an uncle of Barry's, Avrahm Yarmolinsky, chief of the Slavonic department at the New York Public Library.)
Young Barry grew up at a time when it was possible to be both a tough street kid and a studious sort. He spent hours in Prospect Park collecting bits of nature, which he took home to inspect under a microscope that Uncle Avrahm had given him.
He was so shy at James Madison High School that he was referred to a speech correction class, and after graduation he set out on the track of a quiet academic career. With money earned from odd jobs, he put himself through Columbia, earning honors in his major, zoology; election to Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi; and a B.A. degree in 1937, at 20. He went on to do graduate work at Harvard, where he got a Ph.D. in cellular biology. He taught for two years at Queens College and served in the Naval Air Corps in World War II, rising to lieutenant. In 1947 he joined the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis.
Role in Nuclear Test Ban
Parallel to his life as a public figure, Dr. Commoner had a reputation as a brilliant teacher and a painstaking researcher into viruses, cell metabolism and the effects of radiation on living tissue. A research team he led was the first to show that abnormal free radicals -- groups of molecules with unpaired electrons -- might be the earliest indicator of cancer in laboratory rats.
He found his political voice when he encountered the indifference of government authorities to the high levels of strontium 90 in the atmosphere from atomic tests. Quite simply, he said in an interview with The Chicago Tribune in 1993, ''The Atomic Energy Commission turned me into an environmentalist.''
He helped organize the St. Louis Committee for Nuclear Information in 1958, and was eventually its president. Dr. Commoner told Scientific American years later that the committee's task ''was to explain to the public -- first in St. Louis and then nationally -- how splitting a few pounds of atoms could turn something as mild as milk into a devastating global poison.''
''At about that time,'' he continued, ''several of us met with Linus Pauling in St. Louis and together drafted the petition, eventually signed by thousands of scientists worldwide.'' The petition was part of the scientific underpinning for President John F. Kennedy's proposal of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 -- ''the first of continuing international actions to fully cage the nuclear beast,'' Dr. Commoner said.
As the founding director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems in St. Louis, he led a staff drawn from many disciplines in investigating, among other things, lead poisoning in slums, the ecology of ghetto rats, the economics of conventional versus organic farming, and the pollution of rivers by fertilizer leaching.
Dr. Commoner moved the center from St. Louis to Queens College in 1981. He remained in the thick of things, helping to set up New York City's trash recycling program and defending it against critics like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had declared the recycling law irresponsible.
In 2000, at 82, Dr. Commoner gave up the center's directorship to concentrate on new research projects, including work on the effects of genetically altering organisms.
Waning Influence
By then he was no longer getting anything like the attention he had enjoyed in earlier times. Some experts had begun to think that his view of the planet, as a place harmoniously balanced by the trial and error of long evolution, left out too much complexity and too much potential for the unexpected.
Stephen Jay Gould, the Harvard paleontologist and evolutionary biologist, reviewing Dr. Commoner's book ''Making Peace With the Planet'' for The Times in 1990, said that it ''suffers the commonest of unkind fates: to be so self-evidently true and just that we pass it by as a twice-told tale.''
''Although he has been branded by many as a maverick,'' Dr. Gould added, ''I regard him as right and compassionate on nearly every major issue.''
Dr. Commoner married Ms. Feiner in 1980. He is also survived by two children, Lucy Commoner and Frederic, by his first wife, the former Gloria Gordon; and one granddaughter.
Dr. Commoner practiced what he preached. In his personal habits he was as frugal as a Yankee farmer, and as common-sensical. He drove or took taxis if the route by public transit took him far out of his way. On the other hand, he saw no need to waste electricity by ironing his shirts.
And when a Times writer once asked his Queens College office to mail some material, it arrived in an old brown envelope with the crossed-out return address of the botany department at Washington University -- where he had last worked 19 years earlier.

HEADLINE: Misconduct Widespread in Retracted Science Papers, Study Finds

BYLINE: By CARL ZIMMER

 BODY:
Last year the journal Nature reported an alarming increase in the number of retractions of scientific papers -- a tenfold rise in the previous decade, to more than 300 a year across the scientific literature.
Other studies have suggested that most of these retractions resulted from honest errors. But a deeper analysis of retractions, being published this week, challenges that comforting assumption.
In the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, two scientists and a medical communications consultant analyzed 2,047 retracted papers in the biomedical and life sciences. They found that misconduct was the reason for three-quarters of the retractions for which they could determine the cause. 
''We found that the problem was a lot worse than we thought,'' said an author of the study, Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
Dr. Casadevall and another author, Dr. Ferric C. Fang of the University of Washington, have been outspoken critics of the current culture of science. To them, the rising rate of retractions reflects perverse incentives that drive scientists to make sloppy mistakes or even knowingly publish false data.
''We realized we would really like more hard data for what the reasons were for retractions,'' Dr. Fang said.
They began collaborating with R. Grant Steen, a medical communications consultant in Chapel Hill, N.C., who had already published a study on 10 years of retractions. Together they gathered all the retraction notices published before May 2012 by searching PubMed, a database of scientific literature maintained by the National Library of Medicine.
''I guess our O.C.D. kicked in and we started trying to look at every paper we could look at,'' Dr. Fang said.
The researchers analyzed the reasons for retractions cited by the scientific journals. But they also looked beyond the journals for the full story.
In the mid-2000s, for example, Boris Cheskis, then a senior scientist at Wyeth Research, and his colleagues published two papers on estrogen. Later, the scientists retracted both papers, explaining that some of the data in them were ''unreliable.'' In 2010, the Office of Research Integrity at the federal Department of Health and Human Services ruled that Dr. Cheskis had engaged in misconduct, having falsified the figures.
Dr. Cheskis settled with the government. Although he neither accepted nor denied the charges, he agreed not to serve on any advisory boards for the United States Public Health Service and agreed to be supervised on any Public Health Service-financed research for two years.
Neither of the notices for the two retracted papers has been updated to reflect the finding of fraud. Dr. Cheskis could not be reached for comment.
Dr. Fang and his colleagues dug through other reports from the Office of Research Integrity, as well as newspaper articles and the blog Retraction Watch. All told, they reclassified 158 papers as fraudulent based on their extra research.
''We haven't seen this level of analysis before,'' said Dr. Ivan Oransky, an author of Retraction Watch and the executive editor at Reuters Health. ''It confirms what we suspected.''
Dr. Oransky said he expected the rise to continue in the near future. He and his co-author, Adam Marcus, have been scrambling to keep up with new cases of fraud.
In July, for example, the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists reported that Dr. Yoshitaka Fujii had falsified data in 172 papers. Most of those papers have yet to be officially retracted. ''They're headed for the fraud pile,'' Dr. Oransky said.
Dr. Benjamin G. Druss, a professor of health policy of Emory University, said he found the statistics in the paper to be sound but added that they ''need to be kept in perspective.'' Only about one in 10,000 papers in PubMed have been officially retracted, he noted. By contrast, 112,908 papers have had published corrections.
Dr. Casadevall disagreed. ''It convinces me more that we have a problem in science,'' he said.
While the fraudulent papers may be relatively few, he went on, their rapid increase is a sign of a winner-take-all culture in which getting a paper published in a major journal can be the difference between heading a lab and facing unemployment. ''Some fraction of people are starting to cheat,'' he said.
Better policing techniques, like plagiarism-detecting software, might help slow the rise in misconduct, Dr. Casadevall said, but the most important thing the scientific community can do is change its culture.
''I don't think this problem is going to go away as long as you have this disproportionate system of rewards,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Queens, An Oasis Neglected By the City

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
She is not one of New York's Grande Dame parks, those Olmstead beauties with Victorian park houses, manicured lawns, rolling hills and forest glades. She lacks the high-stepping strut of Central Park and the hipster slouch of Prospect Park.
And she has no Daddy Warbucks conservancy to shower her in gilt and so pay for a revitalizing face-lift. 
Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is a homely beauty, a many-acre stepchild of two World's Fairs, stepping gingerly between noisy highways and stadiums and a polluted bay. All she possesses are a handsome Unisphere, a Hall of Science, a zoo, an art museum and tens of thousands of immigrant New Yorkers who pour out of the densely packed streets of Corona, Elmhurst, Flushing and Jackson Heights to run across her soccer fields, seek shade under her still-adolescent trees and stroll, bike and roller skate around her lakes.
Ask Olaris Gutierrez of Corona if her two children play in this park and she laughs.
''Of course! All the time.''
Is it crowded?
Her eyes widen. ''So crowded! On weekends, your elbows touch other elbows.''
Now this park faces threats from the city that should care for her. The Bloomberg administration has in mind multiple insults. In pursuit of its Xanadu dream for Willets Point, it wants to let the owners of the Mets and the Related Companies build a huge shopping mall on the park's western end, which admittedly is nothing more than a vast parking lot now.
They are intent on letting the United States Tennis Association put up new parking lots and new roads. And, most perilous, city officials seem intent on letting Major League Soccer build a 25,000-seat stadium not on the park's edge, but at its very core.
It's as if Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in distorted homage to ''Men in Black,'' wanted to park a flying saucer here, obliterating soccer fields and a pond.
It is a fact of 21st-century life that the upstairs/downstairs class divide applies with great force to New York City's parks. To ride your bike from Brooklyn Bridge Park to Battery Park to Hudson River Park, and perhaps stop and take a stroll on the High Line, is to experience New York as Paris, beautifully kept parks with gardeners and omnipresent officers.
To ride out to the Shore Park by the Verrazano Bridge and east to Marine Park or to bike up to the city's largest park Pelham Bay is often to bounce along roads as rutted as any in backwoods Vermont. I walked Flushing Meadows-Corona Park with Donovan Finn, a passionate 41-year-old resident of Jackson Heights and a professor of environmental studies at Stony Brook University. He pointed out lawns scarred by hardscrabble patches of dirt, soccer goal posts rusting, and the Fountain of the Planets surrounded by acres of asphalt.
We walked beneath a stand of adolescent sycamores that would be destroyed by the tennis center. We came to a stop by the soccer fields, crowded on this weekday, which would disappear during years of construction.
''This is where my 3 ½-year-old son runs around the fountain,'' he said. ''This is our park. Why is it O.K. to do this to us?''
City officials hint at bags of cash for this plain beauty of a park; perhaps the soccer stadium could provide it with a revenue stream. The league might eventually rebuild even prettier fields. Maybe, perhaps, could be, some day.
Why have mayors not demanded that the United States Tennis Association and the taxpayer-subsidized New York Mets pay fees to this much-abused park? And would the mayor, whose mansion is steps from Central Park, conceive of asking the worthies on the Central Park Conservancy to underwrite its operations by placing a professional soccer stadium in Sheep Meadow?
To ask is to know the answer. More than a few residents of Manhattan had made clear they did not favor placing this stadium along the Hudson River.
Four years ago, the parks department released a strategic plan for Flushing Meadows. It is a dispatch from a different, green-edged age of Bloomberg. It ''re-envisions'' a ''new greener landscape'' with less pavement, cleaned-up lakes and a spectacular Fountain of Industry edged by lawns and playgrounds. And it suggests that the city force baseball owners and tennis barons to ante up their fair share of fees.
To read this report is to feel that surge of optimism when New Yorkers dream grandly of public spaces. As the former mayor of Bogotá, Colombia, Enrique Peñalosa, a champion of parks across the globe, once said: Public space is for living, kissing and playing. ''Its value can't be measured with economics or mathematics; it must be felt with the soul.''
No hint of such vision was on offer last week in a crowded public school auditorium, where the Economic Development Corporation came to solicit comment on its plan for the shopping mall. A city interpreter began by standing and explaining in Spanish to a vastly Latino crowd that it would offer no simultaneous translation into Spanish.
But, he noted brightly, you are welcome to use the agency's Spanish language Web site.
Ms. Gutierrez sat in that audience, desperate to hold to what's left of her children's shrinking park. She fears a done deal.
''Why does the mayor come to Queens with this idea?'' she asked. ''People in Queens, we need good jobs, vacations, sick days and parks. We need beautiful, beautiful parks -- just like people everywhere in this city.''

HEADLINE: Eric J. Hobsbawm, Marxist Historian, Dies at 95

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Eric J. Hobsbawm, whose three-volume economic history of the rise of industrial capitalism established him as Britain's pre-eminent Marxist historian, died on Monday in London. He was 95.
The cause was pneumonia, said his daughter, Julia Hobsbawm.
Mr. Hobsbawm, the leading light in a group of historians within the British Communist Party that included Christopher Hill, E. P. Thompson and Raymond Williams, helped recast the traditional understanding of history as a series of great events orchestrated by great men. Instead, he focused on labor movements in the 19th century and what he called the ''pre-political'' resistance of bandits, millenarians and urban rioters in early capitalist societies.
His masterwork remains his incisive and often eloquent survey of the period he referred to as ''the long 19th century,'' which he analyzed in three volumes: ''The Age of Revolution: 1789-1848,'' ''The Age of Capital: 1848-1875'' and ''The Age of Empire: 1874-1914.'' To this trilogy he appended a coda in 1994, ''The Age of Extremes,'' published in the United States with the subtitle ''A History of the World, 1914-1991.'' 
''Eric J. Hobsbawm was a brilliant historian in the great English tradition of narrative history,'' Tony Judt, a professor of history at New York University, wrote in an e-mail in 2008, two years before he died. ''On everything he touched he wrote much better, had usually read much more, and had a broader and subtler understanding than his more fashionable emulators. If he had not been a lifelong Communist he would be remembered simply as one of the great historians of the 20th century.''
Unlike many of his comrades, Mr. Hobsbawm, who lived in London, stuck with the Communist Party after the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and the Czech reform movement in 1968. He eventually let his party membership lapse about the time the Berlin Wall fell and the Eastern bloc disintegrated in 1989.
''I didn't want to break with the tradition that was my life and with what I thought when I first got into it,'' he told The New York Times in 2003. ''I still think it was a great cause, the emancipation of humanity. Maybe we got into it the wrong way, maybe we backed the wrong horse, but you have to be in that race, or else human life isn't worth living.''
Eric John Hobsbawm was born in 1917 in Alexandria, Egypt, where a confused clerk at the British consulate misspelled the last name of his father, Leopold Percy Hobsbaum, an unsuccessful merchant from the East End of London. His mother, Nelly Grün, was Austrian, and after World War I ended, the family, which was Jewish, settled in Vienna. The Hobsbawms were struggling to make ends meet when, in 1929, Eric's father dropped dead on his own doorstep, probably of a heart attack. Two years later Nelly died of lung disease, and her son was shipped off to live with relatives in Berlin.
In the waning months of the Weimar Republic, Mr. Hobsbawm, a gifted student, became a passionate Communist and a true believer in the Bolshevik Revolution. ''The dream of the October Revolution is still there somewhere inside me, as deleted texts are still waiting to be recovered by experts, somewhere on the hard disks of computers,'' he wrote in ''Interesting Times,'' a memoir published in 2003.
Mr. Hobsbawm, a cool introvert, found exhilaration and fellowship in the radical politics of the street in Germany. As a member of a Communist student organization, he slipped party fliers under apartment doors in the weeks after Hitler's appointment as chancellor and at one point concealed an illegal duplicating machine under his bed. Within weeks, however, he was sent to Britain to live with yet another set of relatives.
Forbidden by his uncle to join either the Communist Party or the Labour Party (which Mr. Hobsbawm hoped to subvert from within), he concentrated on his studies at St. Marylebone Grammar School in London and won a scholarship to Cambridge. There he joined the Communist Party in 1936, edited the weekly journal Granta and accepted an invitation to joint the elite, informal society of intellectuals known as the Apostles.
''It was an invitation that hardly any Cambridge undergraduate was likely to refuse, since even revolutionaries like to be in a suitable tradition,'' he wrote in ''Interesting Times.'' He described himself as a ''Tory communist,'' unsympathetic to the politics of personal liberation that marked the 1960s.
Mr. Hobsbawm graduated from King's College with highest honors in 1939 and went on to earn a master's degree in 1942 and a doctorate in 1951, writing his dissertation on the Fabian Society. In 1943 he married Muriel Seaman, a civil servant and fellow Communist. That marriage ended in divorce in 1950. In 1962 he married Marlene Schwarz, who survives him. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his son Andrew; another son, Joss Bennathan; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
Mr. Hobsbawm served in the British Army from 1939 to 1946, a period he later called the most unhappy of his life. Excluded from any meaningful job by his politics, he languished on the sidelines in Britain as others waged the great armed struggle against fascism. ''I did nothing of significance in it,'' he wrote of the war, ''and was not asked to.''
He began teaching history at Birkbeck College in the University of London in 1947, and from 1949 to 1955 he was a history fellow at King's College.
Mr. Hobsbawm and his colleagues in the Historians' Study Group of the Communist Party established labor history as an important field of study and in 1952 created an influential journal, Past and Present, as a home base.
The rich dividends from this new approach to writing history were apparent in works like ''Primitive Rebels: Studies in Archaic Forms of Social Movement in the 19th and 20th Centuries,'' ''Laboring Men: Studies in the History of Labor'' and ''Industry and Empire,'' the companion volume to Christopher Hill's ''Reformation to Industrial Revolution.''
During this period, Mr. Hobsbawm also wrote jazz criticism for The New Statesman and Nation under the pseudonym Francis Newton, a sly reference to the jazz trumpeter Frankie Newton, an avowed Communist. His jazz writing led to a book, ''The Jazz Scene,'' published in 1959.
If his political allegiances stymied his professional advancement, as he argued in his memoir, honors and recognition eventually came his way. At the University of London, he was finally promoted to a readership in 1959 and was named professor of economic and social history in 1970. After retiring in 1982 he taught at Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University and the New School for Social Research in Manhattan.
The accolades for works like his ''Age of'' trilogy led to membership in learned societies and honorary degrees, but to the end of his life the Communist militant coexisted uneasily with the professional historian.
Not until his 80s, in ''The Age of Extremes,'' did Mr. Hobsbawm dare turn to the century whose horrific events had shaped his politics. The book was an anguished reckoning with a period he had avoided as a historian because, as he wrote in his memoir, ''given the strong official Party and Soviet views about the 20th century, one could not write about anything later than 1917 without the strong likelihood of being denounced as a political heretic.''
Mr. Hobsbawm continued to write well into his 90s, appearing frequently in The New York Review of Books and other periodicals. His ''How to Change the World: Tales of Marx and Marxism'' was published last year, and ''Fractured Times,'' a collection of essays on 20th-century culture and society, is scheduled to be published by Little, Brown in Britain in March 2013.
Although increasingly on the defensive, and quite willing to say that the great Communist experiment had not only failed but had been doomed from the start, Mr. Hobsbawm refused to recant or, many critics complained, to face up to the human misery it had created. ''Historical understanding is what I'm after, not agreement, approval, or sympathy,'' he wrote in his memoir.
In 1994, he shocked viewers when, in an interview with Michael Ignatieff on the BBC, he said that the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens under Stalin would have been worth it if a genuine Communist society had been the result.
''The greatest price he will pay is to be remembered not as Eric J. Hobsbawm the historian but as Eric J. Hobsbawm the unrepentant Communist historian,'' Mr. Judt said. ''It's unfair and it's a pity, but that is the cross he will bear.''

HEADLINE: In China and Japan, Economic Troubles Persist

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Two of the largest economies in the world, China and Japan, presented fresh data on Monday that underscored the persistent economic drag on the global economy despite the efforts of policy makers and central bankers around the world.
In China, an official gauge of manufacturing activity remained below the key level that separates contraction from expansion in September, as manufacturers continued to face sluggish demand both abroad and at home. 
The purchasing managers' index, released by the Chinese statistics office, came in at 49.8 -- an improvement from the 49.2 recorded in August that appears to indicate that conditions are at least stabilizing after several months of declines.
But the reading still disappointed many analysts, who had expected it to nudge above 50.
The figure, analysts at ANZ said in a note, suggested ''a continued weakness in the economy'' and confirmed ''our view that the policies implemented so far have failed to arrest a cyclical downturn.''
Chinese policy makers have sought to inject more momentum into the flagging economy for about a year by encouraging more bank lending, cutting interest rates and accelerating infrastructure approvals.
In recent months, however, these efforts have focused on localized, incremental steps, with policy makers apparently wary of fanning an investment binge and property price jump of the kind that followed the mammoth stimulus program announced in late 2008.
In Japan, meanwhile, a closely watched survey showed the mood among big manufacturers had worsened in the past three months.
The Tankan report , produced by the Bank of Japan every quarter, showed an index measuring large manufacturers' assessments of business conditions had fallen to -3 from -1 in the previous survey. Although the figure was not as bad as feared, the outlook for the three months ending in December also stood at -3, signaling that large manufacturers see little prospect of imminent improvement.
As in China, the export-dependent Japanese economy is feeling the impact of feeble demand from Europe and the United States.
A euro zone manufacturing purchasing managers index on Monday spotlighted the extent to which the drawn-out debt crisis and the savings measures introduced by many governments have cut into growth. The index for September was 46.1, according to Markit Economics, and although that was an improvement from August, it was below the 50 mark that separates contraction and expansion for the 14th month in a row.
Many Asian economies have weathered the global financial and European debt crises relatively well, thanks in part to the fact that their own increasingly affluent populations have become powerful sources of demand.
Still, Europe and the United States remain major destinations for Asian goods, and weakening demand in those regions, combined with the slowdown in China's once red-hot economy, has inevitably taken a toll on export sectors and stock markets around the region.
In Taiwan, one of the more export dependent economies in Asia, a purchasing managers index produced by HSBC slipped to 45.6 in September, a nine-month low.
A similar index for India, also released on Monday, remained unchanged from the previous month, at 52.8, but economists at HSBC cautioned that ''global headwinds, the lagged effects of monetary tightening, and slow progress on structural reforms in recent years are holding down manufacturing growth.''
And in South Korea exports in September slipped 1.8 percent from last year, data published on Monday showed. That data was better than expected, but nonetheless showed that the global drags continue to weigh.
With a mature economy and a static population, Japan has been one of the weakest performers in the region.
Moreover, Japanese exporters are feeling the pinch of the strong yen, which has aggravated the overseas demand weakness by making Japanese goods more expensive for consumers abroad. The Japanese currency was trading at around ¥78 to the U.S. dollar on Monday. In August 2008, shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, $1 bought ¥110.
More recently, the tensions with China over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea have hurt trade with China.
Japanese car makers like Toyota and Nissan have cut back production in China after anti-Japan protests that closed dealerships in that country, for example, and Japan Air Lines is reducing flights between Japan and China this month.
The full impact has not been reflected in the Tankan report, Kiyoko Katahira, an analyst at Societe Generale in Tokyo, wrote in a note, as the tensions only became an issue after Sept. 14. Most of the companies surveyed in the report had already submitted their responses by that date.
''Therefore,'' she added, ''the real business sentiment could turn out to be worse than what it appears in the survey result.''
Policy makers and central bankers in Japan have sought to shore up the economy.
In its latest effort, the Bank of Japan last month announced it would beef up an asset-purchasing and loan program, a move aimed at adding to bank reserves and driving down the cost of lending.
Many analysts, however, said that still fell short of what was needed to head off a slowdown of the Japanese economy.
''There is little the BoJ can do about the external environment, which is likely to stay tough well into next year,'' Michael Taylor, an economist at Lombard Street Research, wrote in a note over the weekend.
Domestic resilience, he added, ''may not be sufficient to prevent falling industrial production and exports from dragging the economy back into contraction in Q3.''
Gross domestic product for the April-to-June quarter grew at an annual rate of just 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, according to Japanese government data released in September, a far slower pace than initially estimated.
In China, meanwhile, more determined policy support may come after next month's once-in-a-decade leadership transition.
''Monetary easing and fiscal policy implementation could accelerate following the 18th National Congress of Chinese Communist Party,'' the analysts at ANZ wrote. ''We view that the overall policy tone will remain consistent, while some pro-growth policies could be rolled out.

HEADLINE: An Unforgettable Victory, Though Some Would Like To

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
MEDINAH, Ill. -- Stupendous comeback or stupefying collapse? Surely some potent blend of both was required to produce this latest Ryder Cup suitable for downloading or deleting (you know which camp you are in).
In Europe and to a much lesser degree in the United States, they are already calling what happened here ''El Milagro de Medinah,'' or ''The Miracle at Medinah.''
The label is likely to stick. Alliteration is tough to resist, and the term captures the wide-eyed spirit of the European team's Champagne-soaked reaction to its 14 ½ to 13 ½ comeback victory over the United States.
It also dovetails with the team's collective sense that some higher force was at work as they played for the memory of the former European star and captain Seve Ballesteros, who died of a brain tumor last year. 
''Seve, Seve, Seve, Seve, Seve,'' said European player Justin Rose on the 18th green in the heady, delirious moments after victory. ''Oh my goodness. Oh my God. I mean we're in shock. We wanted to believe. We really wanted to believe, but we weren't under any illusions about how hard it was going to be. Four points back on a golf course made for them.''
True enough. But what happened at Medinah was no miracle even if a bit of alchemy was involved. The Europeans, after all, have dominated the modern era of the Ryder Cup and have now won five of the last six competitions and seven of the last nine. This was clearly the most surprising of their many victories as they rallied from a 6-10 deficit on the final day on the road. But it was also the latest example of the Ryder Cup's continuing capacity to transform certain European golfers, for the space of a three-day weekend, into pressure-proof world beaters.
Men like Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, never capable of winning a major title, turned into steely-eyed closers with the Cup for inspiration. It happened again in Medinah as Ian Poulter and Rose, neither of whom has won a major championship, produced the kind of brilliance for their team that they have yet to produce on their own.
''Major winner! Major winner!'' was the taunt from the crowd as Poulter came out to play his singles match Sunday against Webb Simpson, the reigning United States Open champion.
That might have unsettled more bashful characters, but with Poulter, it was throwing chum in the water. This was the same man who, on Saturday morning, decided to upstage the showboating American Bubba Watson on the first tee by calling for the thousands of fans to cheerwhile he was hitting his tee shot, just as Watson had done the previous morning and was about to do again.
Golf may never be quite the same (we'll see about Watson, who lost the opening singles match on Sunday to Luke Donald to start the European train rolling).
Rose later holed a 40-foot putt on No. 17 as he rallied to beat Phil Mickelson. Martin Kaymer rolled in the Cup-clinching 5-foot putt to beat Stricker, making it even though he was thinking about the short putt that his fellow German and longtime mentor, Bernhard Langer, missed to lose the 1991 Ryder Cup in the United States.
But there can be no doubt that Poulter, a 36-year-old with the working-class English accent and spiky coiffure, was the catalyst in chief. He is based in Florida and, like many of his European teammates, plays much of his golf on the more lucrative PGA Tour in the United States. But he clearly still gets a perpetual thrill out of foiling Americans, including Simpson on Sunday.
Poulter won all four of his matches at Medinah, his body quaking and his eyes bulging after birdies to such a degree that one feared he might eventually require medical attention.
''It's a passion I have,'' said Poulter, who has a 12-3 Ryder Cup record. ''It's a passion I've seen at the Ryder Cup for years and years as a kid growing up, and it's something that comes from within.''
So much so that his teammates joked that they had changed the European team selection policy, which currently has 10 men qualifying and 2 selected by the captain.
''We have actually revised the qualification for next time,'' Lee Westwood said. ''It's nine spots, two picks and Poults.''
Whatever happens in 2014 in Gleneagles, Scotland, Jose Maria Olazabal did well to use one of his captain's picks here on Poulter. There is an exaggerated cult of the captain in Ryder Cup: the players, after all, are the ones out there making and missing the putts and the tee shots across the lake. But in the final balance, Olazabal not only got lucky, he also played his cards more adroitly than Davis Love III.
The Americans had team spirit aplenty, best exemplified by the fact that they did better in pairings than on their own at Medinah. But a certain edge was missing from the American effort Sunday and perhaps a certain degree of communication, too. On the 18th, the Americans kept miscalculating the green's ability to hold approach shots and misreading the break of the same sorts of putts.
Love had four captain's picks to Olazabal's two. Though Love clearly got one right by choosing the big-driving Dustin Johnson, who went 3-0, his other three wild cards struggled. Jim Furyk, Steve Stricker, Brandt Snedeker were a combined 2-8 in Medinah and all lost in singles, with the 42-year-old Furyk and 45-year-old Stricker looking older than their years as they tightened up on the critical, closing holes Sunday.
The Ryder Cup can be a brutal business, but it is also brisk business as evidenced by the 77 corporate chalets that were rented at Medinah. The shelves at the massive merchandise tent were as empty on Sunday night as a supermarket's before a hurricane.
But the event remains a much bigger deal in Britain than it does in the United States. It is also a much bigger deal to the European Tour, which is increasingly reliant on the revenue and the wider interest the Ryder Cup generates. The tour has suffered from Europe's economic difficulties (four Spanish tournaments have been cancelled this year) and from its star players' increased affinity for Florida's climate and tax policies.
''The Ryder Cup is the focus of the tour,'' said George O'Grady, chief executive of the European Tour. ''It is a catalyst, the glue almost that binds it together. And what happened on Sunday will help our long-term strength in Europe and will further inspire a generation of young Europeans who may now think that golf is the way forward when they choose a sport.''
Interest in the United States remains passionate but limited. On a Sunday dominated by the N.F.L., 4.1 million American households watched the Ryder Cup on television. That was the best rating here since 6.3 million households watched in 1999, when the American players were the ones giddy with the bromance of it all after rallying to win from a 6-10 deficit.
Love, Furyk, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods were all on that team. This time, they got to experience the flipside as did Olazabal, Westwood, Sergio Garcia and Paul Lawrie, the 43-year-old from Scotland who has only played in two Ryder Cups (1999 and 2012).
''Brookline was just one of the worst experiences of my life,'' Lawrie said. ''You're 10-6 ahead and play so well, and they come back at you and obviously today is the opposite. To win it for Jose, I can't tell you what that means to all the players.''
But Olazabal, a proud and emotional man, did find the words to tell his players what it meant to him. ''All men die but not all men live,'' he said to them at the closing ceremony. ''And you made me feel alive again this week.''
Many a team effort has been dedicated to the memory of the departed, but Olazabal -- Ballesteros's friend, compatriot and longtime Ryder Cup partner -- took the linkage to an unusual level by putting Ballesteros's silhouette on golf bags and shirt sleeves and weaving him into his public and private speeches.
It seemed to make a difference Sunday. Rose, for one, said he looked down at his sleeve for inspiration and reassurance on the 18th hole.
The Europeans still could have, probably should have, lost. Of course. Instead, they have another warm Ryder Cup memory to fire up future Montgomeries and Poulters. On Sunday night, after the ceremonies and the interviews, Olazabal sat in a golf cart at Medinah in the dark with the Ryder Cup still securely in his grip.

HEADLINE: The Foreign Policy Divide

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
LONDON -- China is a status quo power. It preaches dialogue, noninterference and the sanctity of national sovereignty because it does not want major global disruptions to its pursuit of the economic growth essential to political stability and full development by midcentury.
Russia is also a status quo power -- the status quo of 30 years ago, that is. Under President Vladimir Putin, it wants to turn back the clock and restore the world to a place dominated by two superpowers going mano a mano. It has been prepared to watch thousands of Syrians die in order to demonstrate it still wields a big stick. 
Europe is a status-seeking power, undermined by the crisis of the euro and the democratic deficit in its institutions, bereft of the idealism that once drove the pursuit of European unity, and represented by a ''president'' nobody has heard of. There is only one serious politician left in Europe. Her name is Angela Merkel.
And what of the United States? An election that was supposed to be about domestic policy but has produced little clarity in that regard (perhaps the debates will help) has demonstrated a stark divide on foreign policy.
In the vision of President Barack Obama, America is now in the status-management business: being realistic about its power the better to exercise and preserve it. As for Mitt Romney, he belongs to Putin's school of foreign policy. The status quo he believes in is that of three decades ago. In this regard he is a closet Russian even as he denounces Moscow.
And so, for Romney, Russia is ''without question our number one geopolitical foe,'' just like during the Cold War. He is ''guided by one overwhelming conviction and passion: this century must be an American century,'' like the century that saw the Cold War.
In the name of U.S. domination, America needs to throw its weight around, maintaining or increasing Pentagon budgets, refusing to talk to the Taliban, confronting China, giving Israel a green light to attack Iran, and generally being unabashed about U.S. might.
It seems the devastating cost of America's post-9/11 wars has not dawned on Romney; nor has what they say about a world where U.S. power is unrivaled but insufficient for the United States to impose its will.
Romney's vision, like Putin's, is pure nostalgia. It imagines a world that is gone. Of course the clarion call of American greatness can be a distraction from economic difficulty, but Americans have grown wary of adventure.
Obama has been accused by Republicans of being in the business of ''managing decline.'' A better way to look at his foreign policy is one of managing the preservation of U.S. power in an interconnected world where the rapid growth is not in the West, where the national debt is a ticking bomb, and where the U.S. edge over other powers is diminishing.
He has extracted the United States from a costly war (Iraq); set a date for departure from Afghanistan; adopted a low-cost means to kill terrorists (drone attacks); rid America of the specter of Osama bin Laden; restrained Israel from attacking Iran and so starting a disastrous third Western war in a Muslim country in a decade; sought ways to work with Russia and China; put European allies in lead roles in Libya; and generally looked not to hard power but the American soft power represented most visibly by Twitter, Facebook, Google and Apple.
Obama has made big mistakes in Afghanistan, refused to spell out the drone doctrine when he owes an explanation, and was behind the curve in Iran during the uprising of 2009. His response to the killing last month of four Americans in Libya, including the U.S. ambassador, was also too muted.
But overall he has adjusted American foreign policy to a changing world. Nowhere is that change more dramatic than in the Middle East where the old U.S. policy -- support for dictators in the name of preserving stability, stopping jihadists and maintaining the flow of oil -- proved bankrupt, a form of American hypocrisy that only fed Salafist rage.
To his credit, Obama has supported the transitions in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and elsewhere. In the end it has to be in America's strategic interest to support societies that are not breeding the frustrations that turn young people into anti-Western killers. It has to be in America's interest to have Islamic parties like the Muslim Brotherhood dealing with Islamic extremism: The lessons of power will prove sobering.
The bumper sticker of the Arab Spring is: ''It's Egypt, stupid.'' If the most populous Arab state by far can develop into a democratic friend of the West, that will amount to a strategic breakthrough.
So Obama is right to be pushing for an immediate $450 million cash infusion for Egypt. And the Republican resistance to that -- a leading Republican lawmaker, Representative Kay Granger of Texas, has said she won't support it while Romney seems to see all Arabs as dangerous or backward -- demonstrates their weird adherence to the Putin school: the status quo at any cost, circa 1982.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate at Record 11.4% in Euro Zone, Suggesting Deepening Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and RAPHAEL MINDER; David Jolly reported from Paris and Raphael Minder from Madrid. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Unemployment in the euro zone hovered at a record 11.4 percent in August, according to data released on Monday, underscoring the pain inflicted by the slowing world economy and the financial problems plaguing many of the countries that share the euro.
Unemployment in the 17 nations that use the euro was at 11.4 percent in August, according to Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union. The agency also revised the figures for June and July to 11.4 percent, up from the previously reported 11.3 percent, which was a record level for the region since the introduction of the euro in 1999. 
The jobless numbers, which compare with the August rate of 8.1 percent in the United States, suggest that Europe's recession is deepening despite the continued efforts of policy makers and finance ministers to cure the region's malaise.
Unemployment in Greece and Spain, currently the euro zone's most economically troubled members, reached euro-era highs. And as both countries move ahead with plans for even tougher austerity budgets -- Greece to appease its international creditors, Spain to potentially clear the path for European aid -- their job outlooks could worsen further.
Greece had an unemployment rate of 24.4 percent in June, the latest month for which data were available. Spain still had the region's highest jobless rate, at 25.1 percent, and an even bigger problem among young people. Nearly 53 percent of Spaniards younger than 25 were classified as unemployed in August.
''Youth unemployment, especially if prolonged, threatens to harm the self-esteem and economic potential of young people now and in the future,'' Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in a statement on Monday after the release of joblessness figures.
''This could also pose a serious threat to social cohesion and increase the risk of political extremism,'' he said. ''E.U. institutions and governments, businesses and social partners at all levels need to do all they can to avoid a 'lost generation,' which would be an economic and social disaster.''
Reinforcing the dismal data, the Markit Economics purchasing managers' index on Monday confirmed an initial report showing that euro zone industrial production declined in September for a seventh consecutive month.
Jennifer McKeown, an economist with Capital Economics in London, noted in a report that while the economic strain was being felt most heavily at the ''periphery'' of the euro zone, in places like Spain and Portugal, ''the situation is bad in the core, too,'' with the French jobless rate at 10.6 percent. Last week, the French government said the number of jobless people had passed three million for the first time since 1999.
The data Monday ''suggest that the industrial sector is experiencing a sharp downturn,'' Ms. McKeown wrote, ''and with unemployment at a record high, the outlook for the consumer sector is gloomy, too.'' She estimated that the gross domestic product of the euro zone would shrink 2.5 percent next year.
Visiting Madrid on Monday, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for monetary affairs, said Europe stood ''ready and willing'' to act in response to a possible bailout request from Spain.
Mr. Rehn met on Monday with the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, but refused to speculate afterward whether the Spanish government would be pushed into asking for more European help to meet its debt financing obligations.
Still, Mr. Rehn urged Madrid to make further efforts to overhaul its economy, saying that ''Spain must continue the reform of its pensions system,'' as well as align the retirement age more closely to longer life spans.
Mr. Rehn's visit came after the Spanish government last week presented a budget for 2013 that would include additional spending cuts. Spain had also released an independent assessment of its troubled banking sector, estimating that the biggest Spanish banks would need as much as 59.3 billion euros ($76.5 billion) in additional capital.
In June, euro zone finance ministers agreed to make available as much as 100 billion euros to help prop up Spanish banks. Spanish officials indicated late last week that they might soon request about 40 billion euros of that money.
Since early September, Mr. Rajoy has been weighing whether to tap into a new bond-buying program announced by the European Central Bank. His hesitancy stems from concerns that European lenders would require Madrid to make even deeper cuts than those foreseen in his latest budget proposal.
His plan for 2013 estimates debt interest payments of 38.6 billion euros next year, almost 10 billion euros more than what was budgeted for 2012, and underlining the extent to which Madrid faces borrowing costs that many economists consider to be unsustainable.
So far, Mr. Rajoy seems intent on buying time, hoping that Spain's borrowing costs remain relatively stable in the debt markets. That could enable his government to delay or avoid asking for help from the central bank bond-buying program, whose main purpose would be to help keep a lid on the interest rates that investors demand to hold Spanish debt.
Madrid's release of the 2013 budget last week seems to have temporarily eased pressure on Spain's 10-year bond yield, or interest rate. After cresting above 6 percent at one point last week, on Monday it was trading at 5.83 percent.
But Spain's debt challenges are not likely to go away soon. In addition to the budget problems of the central government, 17 regional governments are also struggling to meet deficit targets.

HEADLINE: A Storage Solution Is in the Air

BYLINE: By ERICA GIES

 BODY:
PARIS -- Renewable energy sources like wind and solar have a problem: When the wind stops or it is night, they stop generating power. That drawback has focused minds on the question of how to store electricity generated by intermittent sources.
The global market for energy storage services could be worth as much as $31.5 billion in 2017, according to Brian Warshay, an analyst at Lux Research, a consulting firm based in Boston.
The ultimate goal of grid operators is to match the power they deliver to the needs of their customers. Utilities have traditionally increased production from gas-fired power plants when needed to smooth supply and demand, but energy storage systems could, in theory, do the job more quickly and cleanly. Depending on where the storage is situated, it could also reduce the need for new transmission lines.
With increased interest has come investment: Venture capitalists and governments are funding research into batteries, pumped hydroelectricity, flywheels and compressed air. 
Battery technologies have received much of this attention, but compressed air is also moving forward.
In an ideal storage system, all the energy put in can be extracted later. When air is compressed, however, the work that goes into compression produces heat as a side effect. In early compression storage systems -- technically known as diabatic -- this heat has been lost into their surroundings, making them less efficient.
Current experimental systems aim to be more efficient by retaining or recovering the heat. Some, known as isothermal, use a coolant to absorb it, keeping the air at a near constant temperature. The coolant, stored separately, is tapped later to give back the energy through a heat exchange system. Others, known as adiabatic, allow the temperature of the compressed air to rise and fall, using the air, when hot, to warm heat storage units that retain energy within the system.
SustainX, based in Seabrook, New Hampshire, is set to build a pilot isothermal plant capable of storing and releasing up to two megawatts of power, making it the largest demonstration of the technology to date. At the same time, a German consortium is planning a truly grid-scale project -- initially up 90 megawatts -- based on the adiabatic approach.
Isothermal and adiabatic are terms from thermodynamics that promise perfect efficiency, with no energy loss. In practice, each system must make compromises that lower the efficiency rate to 50 to 70 percent.
SustainX's facility, a follow-up to a 40-kilowatt demonstration plant, is funded partly by a $5.4 million U.S. government grant under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and partly by venture capital. Richard Brody, the company's vice president of business development, said it could start test operations by next June, though it would have only an hour or two of storage capacity and would not initially be intended to supply power to the grid. ''Its goal will be to validate and demonstrate the technology to our engineering team and to customers,'' he said.
Both SustainX and the German consortium are seeking to improve on the diabatic technology used in existing utility-scale facilities in Huntorf, Germany, and McIntosh, Alabama. In these systems, the operators use surplus power from the grid when demand is low to pump air at high pressure into underground salt caverns, expelling the byproduct heat into the atmosphere. When energy is needed on the grid, the air is released and reheated by burning gas before being sent through turbines to generate electricity.
In the SustainX isothermal process, a fine mist of water is used as the coolant. When grid power is needed, the compressed air is passed back through the heated water to recover the stored energy before being fed to the turbines.
A venture capital-funded start-up, LightSail Energy in Berkeley, California, has built two prototypes using similar technology -- both LightSail and SustainX use specially built containers rather than underground caverns to store compressed air.
Meanwhile, General Compression in Newton, Massachusetts, is working on a near-isothermal system using salt cavern storage, like the early diabatic systems. General Compression and its partner ConocoPhillips are developing a project in western Texas.
Mr. Warshay, who has written a review of SustainX, said he expected that the project would provide valuable data. ''Because it's D.O.E.-funded, they will have to publish their performance data, which will help the industry as a whole understand the technology's capabilities,'' he said, referring to the U.S. Department of Energy. And because the technology is built with off-the-shelf components, the market will be able to estimate its cost, he added.
The German consortium, meanwhile, is seeking to develop a related adiabatic technology in which the temperature of the compressed air would be allowed to vary within a range of 600 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius, or 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat generated by the compression process would be stored in large, ceramic-filled concrete pressure vessels. A first planned prototype plant would have a capacity of up to 90 megawatts.
The consortium, called Adele -- the German acronym for adiabatic compressed air energy storage -- includes the power utility RWE, the construction and engineering contractor Züblin, the German Aerospace Center and the U.S. conglomerate General Electric. It is currently negotiating for German government funding and hopes to have the demonstration plant operational by 2019.
Like the older diabatic plants, Adele would use salt cavern compressed air storage -- its planners are focusing on a suitable site near Stassfurt, a city in the state of Sachsen-Anhalt -- but the consortium says the addition of the ceramic-concrete heat storage units should raise the efficiency of the whole system to above 60 percent.
An advantage that SustainX and LightSail have over Adele is that their technologies are not site-specific. They can be placed wherever they are needed: next to a wind farm, for example, or a factory that generates its own power.
But they are also more costly: Roland Marquardt, research and development manager for RWE Power on the Adele project, said pressurized air storage cannot be done more cheaply than by using Adele's large-scale process.
The growing percentage of renewable generation in the electricity system, particularly in Germany, requires thinking big, he said. ''Three-digit-megawatt scale is what we are looking for to have significant impact,'' Mr. Marquardt said.
Still, he added, the future will likely offer different roles for different technologies.
Mr. Brody of SustainX warned that given the low price of natural gas in the United States currently and policy frameworks that are not creating strong incentives, ''it will be very difficult for any storage technology to compete in conventional applications.''
SustainX is therefore eyeing other markets, where fossil fuel prices and policy incentives are more conducive to economic success. The company also plans to target more creative applications.
''We see substantial value, both in the United States and in other markets, where grids are facing constraints that cannot be addressed through traditional generation or T and D assets,'' he said, referring to costly investments in transmission and distribution lines.

HEADLINE: Hydrogen Fuels Autorickshaws and Dreams of Cleaner Air

BYLINE: By AMY YEE

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Across India, small three-wheeled autorickshaws ferry people and goods from place to place, with tens of thousands in Delhi alone buzzing and chugging through the traffic alongside buses, cars, taxis, trucks and motorbikes.
In January, the world's first hydrogen-powered autorickshaws took to the road on the grounds of Pragati Maidan, the sprawling exposition center on the capital's east side.
The 15 blue buggies, retrofitted autorickshaws that previously used a conventional power source, still give the same noisy, windswept ride -- and on a recent jaunt a driver reflexively leaning on the horn proudly produced the same ear-splitting bleat heard across India. 
Yet there are critical differences. The tailpipe emits water vapor, heat and scarcely any other emissions.
The body is adapted to carry a tank of hydrogen gas; the motor and its injection system have been modified, and an electronic control system has been installed, developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi.
Still, they refuel at a filling station in much the same way as ordinary autorickshaws fueled by compressed natural gas, hooking up to pumps and hoses with special nozzles.
Hydrogen energy for transportation is in its early infancy, but many hope these autorickshaws are a step toward reduced reliance on fossil fuels in developing countries, where exhaust-belching vehicles contribute to air pollution.
Clean, efficient and naturally abundant, hydrogen has the potential to ''facilitate the transition to a low-carbon energy future, in a similar way that oil and the internal combustion engine displaced coal and the steam engine,'' said the International Center for Hydrogen Energy Technologies, a project of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the Turkish government.
There is also the promise of energy security. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Energy, ''hydrogen offers the long-term potential for an energy system that produces near-zero emissions and is based on domestically available resources.''
Delhi's hydrogen autorickshaws are the result of a three-year project involving a bevy of partners, including the U.N. development agency, which funded half of the more than $1 million cost. In-kind contributions came from partners including the Indian automaker Mahindra, which supplied the autorickshaws, and Air Products, an energy company based in Pennsylvania that provided a hydrogen re-fueling station at the expo center and technical expertise.
Though the initial fleet is modest, as many as a million hydrogen vehicles could be on India's roads by 2020, said Bibek Bandopadhyaya, an adviser to the Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
That goal seems highly ambitious, given the challenges to scaling up the technology worldwide, let alone in bureaucratic India. Still, given its pressing energy demands -- driven by economic growth, rising vehicle numbers and worsening air pollution -- India is exploring all options for alternative and renewable energy, though with varying degrees of success.
The need for clean energy is pressing in India, where big cities are shrouded in choking pollution. India ranked 125 out of 132 countries surveyed for the 2012 Environmental Performance Index from Yale and Columbia Universities in the United States, which measures air pollution and other indicators. The country was the world's third-largest producer of greenhouse emissions last year.
Hydrogen is considered a sort of holy grail of fuel, but there are substantial challenges to its development.
''Hydrogen and fuel cell cars would be a revolution, and revolutions need strong drivers. There aren't strong drivers yet, though if petroleum prices rise high enough, there may be,'' said John Heywood, an emeritus professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in internal combustion engines.
The biggest hurdles to expansion are access to enough hydrogen, lack of a distribution network and high cost relative to other fuels.
While hydrogen is naturally abundant, it must be split from other elements in what are now expensive, often energy-intensive, processes.
It is made for industrial purposes like producing fertilizer or refining fuel, but is not produced for mass consumer use. There is little infrastructure to transport it and fueling stations are few.
Hydrogen also carries a stigma of danger associated with the 1937 Hindenburg airship disaster and the hydrogen bomb. Yet it is actually safer than gasoline if properly handled, said Nicolas Lymberopoulos, director of projects and programs at the U.N. agency and the Hydrogen Energy center: Lighter than air, it disperses quickly and tends to burn rather than explode, making it safer than natural gas, he said.
At the Delhi center, hydrogen autorickshaw drivers have been specially trained in safety and refueling techniques and the three-wheelers have been fitted with special sensors to detect leaks.
''The technical aspects we have sorted out,'' said L.M. Das, professor at the Center for Energy Studies at the Institute of Technology, who has been researching hydrogen for 25 years and developing the hydrogen autorickshaws for the past five. ''The main challenge is economical viability.''
Hydrogen power is commonly based on fuel cell technology, but fuel cells are impractical for developing countries because their parts are expensive and so is the pure hydrogen that they need. The Delhi experiment shows that even lowly autorickshaws can run on lower-grade hydrogen -- although they do emit some nitrogen oxide traces.
Now, it will require pollution restrictions or enforced conversion of vehicles for hydrogen to gain traction in India, Dr. Lymberopoulos said.
Hydrogen could be exempted from taxes on conventional fuels, to encourage private-sector initiatives for hydrogen vehicles and distribution and refueling facilities, he suggested.
Though modest, the pilot fleet bodes well for effective collaboration between Indian academic and industrial expertise. ''Unless academics and industry joins hands, it is difficult for technology to go to the field,'' said Dr. Das. of the technology institute.
A hydrogen autorickshaw is also a marriage of two worlds: the advanced clean energy of developed countries, and a humble but widespread mode of transport in developing ones. Thailand and Sri Lanka have also expressed interest in promoting hydrogen autorickshaws.
''Hydrogen has a role to play, not only in the developed world but also in developing economies like India,'' said Kandeh K. Yumkella, director general of the U.N. agency. It is ''not only for high-end vehicles and buses, but also down-to-earth practical applications like the rickshaws.''

HEADLINE: Old Age in China Is a Fledgling Business Opportunity

BYLINE: By ALEX FREW McMILLAN and EVELINE DANUBRATA | REUTERS

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- At the Happy Community housing development in Beijing, China's largest property developer is setting aside 24,000 square meters for active seniors to test whether this rapidly aging nation will pay for Western-style retirement living.
The company, China Vanke, thinks there is ''ample room for development'' in the senior care sector, a spokesman said, and is testing a second pilot project for seniors in the coastal city of Qingdao in addition to the 258,000-square-foot project in Beijing. It plans to open a showroom in the Chinese capital over the Lunar New Year in February.
Overseas players, including the New York-based hedge fund Fortress Investment Group and China Senior Care, backed by one of the principals of the private U.S. developer Lerner Enterprises, are also investing in elder care and retirement facilities, betting that the demographic fallout from China's one-child policy will soften traditional attitudes toward out-of-home care. 
''If you understand the Chinese culture, they're not about to abandon their old and aged parents in the nursing homes,'' Lim Cheok Peng, managing director of IHH Healthcare, one of the world's biggest publicly listed health care providers, said in an interview in Singapore. ''Ten to 20 years down the road, things may change.''
As in most East Asian societies, the elderly in China have traditionally been looked after by their children at home.
But for people born in the one-child era after 1980, that could mean caring for two parents and four grandparents by themselves. For married couples, that might be eight grandparents to handle. About 22 percent of the Chinese population will be older than 65 by 2040, up from 9 percent now.
Beijing wants to encourage investment in health care services. In January, China reclassified the sector as ''permitted'' rather than ''restricted,'' meaning overseas companies can own 100 percent of an operation in China.
But elder care does not come cheap. China Senior Care, which is building a 64-bed acute-care facility in Hangzhou, plans to charge at least 40,000 renminbi, or $6,300, per month, putting the facility far out of reach for all but the wealthiest in China.
The company paid 28 million renminbi for a site occupying 0.65 hectare, or 1.6 acres, but the process was complicated.
''As far as I know, we're the first Western company to take down a site to do a greenfield project,'' said Mark Spitalnik, the chief executive of China Senior Care, referring to construction on a previously undeveloped location.
''You really have to develop relationships with guys up and down the food chain,'' added Mr. Spitalnik, who moved to China in 1998.
The company has raised $20 million with backing from Robert Tanenbaum, a property developer with the Washington-based Lerner Enterprises who is also one of the owners of the Washington Nationals baseball team.
It plans to use that first project as a flagship to help it break into management of acute-care facilities. It also aims to raise a $100 million fund for senior-care facilities.
While the potential market is vast, investors in the sector face cultural, as well as financial and administrative, barriers.
Filial piety is a pillar of the Confucian philosophical tradition, so the thought of shuttling elderly relatives off to a nursing home remains anathema to many in China.
Yang Fengqin, an 87-year-old grandmother from the coastal city of Fuqing, in Fujian Province, has lived with one of her sons for 50 years and still heads to the market each day to buy ingredients for meals she cooks for him and a grandson.
''If I live in an old-age home, I will lose my freedom -- I want to be able to go out whenever I want,'' Ms. Yang said. Living in an old-age home ''is like living in a jail. You cannot go out,'' she said.
Ms. Yang, who receives 1,600 renminbi from the government each month, believes the elderly should be cared for by either their families or the government. She spends only about 300 renminbi on food each month and gives the rest of the money to her son.
Most people in Asia expect to support themselves in retirement, according to a survey of six countries in East and Southeast Asia. Attitudes are very different in China, where 63 percent of people believe the government should do that job and 71 percent get at least some government support, according to a survey by the Center for Strategic and International Studies sponsored by the Prudential insurance company.
The Shanghai municipal government envisions a ''90-7-3'' system, where 90 percent of the city's elderly people live with family, 7 percent visit community centers and 3 percent pay for private senior homes. The latter figure may sound modest, but Richard Brubaker, the founder of a nonprofit called Collective Responsibility, says the city actually has only half that capacity for private elder care.
Even if just 3 percent of China's population opts for private care, that still adds up in a country of 1.3 billion.
''People are just beginning to understand what gerontology means in the Chinese context,'' said Bromme Cole, a consultant who runs Hampton Hoerter, which advises companies on health care and senior care facilities.
At Cherish-Yearn, an upscale retirement community on the outskirts of Shanghai, Chairman Xi Zhiyong has invested 600 million renminbi to build 800 apartments, with a little more than 60 percent of them full. Residents buy apartments with a membership fee of 980,000 renminbi per couple and then pay an annual fee of 30,000 to 70,000 renminbi, depending on the size of the apartment, for cleaning services, activities and the help of a secretary.
Fortress, the New York hedge fund, has said it wants to invest $1 billion in senior care in China. To that end, it has formed a venture with the conglomerate Fosun Group, which has extensive property operations, to develop senior housing on the mainland. It launched its first project, Shanghai Starcastle Senior Living, in August, providing independent-living apartments as well as assisted living.
Chinese insurance companies have also started to pump money into the sector, with one, Ping An, having staked 17 billion renminbi in a retirement community in Zhejiang Province in September. That was the fourth insurance investment in retirement homes in as many months, after smaller projects from China Life in Hebei, Taikang Life in Beijing and Taiping Life in Shanghai.
Companies based in Singapore are also looking to expand.
Econ Healthcare Group, which runs nursing homes and a hospital in Singapore and Malaysia, is consulting with the government of the city of Suzhou on a retirement village with more than 300 apartments, which could be up and running by mid-2013, Executive Chairman Ong Chu Poh said.
Econ also has a project in the city of Tianjin and is looking for a local partner to build facilities in cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou.
''There are many local developers who want to come into this huge seniors' market, and they don't know how to go about it,'' Mr. Ong said.
Some early investors learned the hard way that China does not always live up to the hype.
Adam Lazar, a private equity investor, said he had sunk almost $1.5 million into his first senior-care project, but after five years only some of the planned 62 high-end villas had actually been built, and none were sold. He is now locked in a legal fight over his stake.
''To invest $100 million in senior housing is going to be challenging,'' said Mr. Lazar, the founder of Lazar Capital Management, which is based in Hong Kong. ''To invest $1 billion -- it's a pipe dream.''
Eveline Danubrata reported from Singapore.

HEADLINE: Apartments Sold Better Last Quarter, Reports Find

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
Manhattan apartment sales rose in the third quarter of 2012 to the highest level since the financial crisis began, despite low inventory, as demand and consumer confidence strengthened, according to reports that will be released by New York City's major brokerage firms on Tuesday.
Prices were essentially flat, with some reports showing slight increases and others showing no change or a slight decrease. 
But the number of Manhattan apartment sales in the third quarter rose to 2,790, up 12 percent from a year ago and the highest quarterly total since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, according to reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. The Corcoran Group reported a 17 percent jump in sales to 3,821 for the same period.
''It's all about consumer confidence coming back,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property. ''New York has so shown its true grit,'' as a place that can sustain ''almost whatever comes at it,'' she added, ''so where else to put your money?''
One agency's report, however, showed sales were down. Prudential Douglas Elliman reported sales volume dropped 5 percent from a year ago. Still, the report showed that the summer months had more momentum, with the number of homes going into contract up 4.9 percent compared with last summer.
Even as the volume of sales picked up, inventory hit a seven and a half year low with 5,847 available listings in the third quarter, down 24.3 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the Elliman report.
Low equity is keeping sellers from listing, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Prudential Douglas Elliman's report. ''Those sellers can't become buyers because of tight credit,'' Mr. Miller said. The approaching election and ''concern about the direction of the national economy'' is also contributing to sellers' hesitation to list apartments, he added.
''We're hitting a point where it's getting critical,'' Mr. Miller said, adding that if inventory continues to be tight, ''you're going to see the prices edge higher.''
Already, brokers say, apartments that are well priced are selling quickly and in some cases prompting bidding wars.
''There's lots of competition for too few apartments,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive officer of the Corcoran Group. While it is not the kind of bidding wars that were common in the heady days of 2007, she noted, many buyers are frustrated by the lack of inventory and realize that ''if they don't move quickly on new listings, they won't be there very long.''
Overall inventory is not expected to loosen up, at least in the immediate future. ''We'll see a few exciting new developments hit the market in the next few months,'' Ms. Liebman said, ''but not enough really to move the needle.''
The inventory pipeline should start to pick up more significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, she noted. For now, as she put it, ''It's a good market, it's just the inventory is terrible.''
While the market's recovery in previous quarters was driven by luxury sales, the latest activity was weighted toward smaller apartments and first-time buyers taking advantage of low mortgage rates.
''The lower end is coming into fruition now,'' said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which showed in its report that one-bedroom apartments accounted for the bulk of the third-quarter sales at 37.8 percent.
The rise in one-bedroom sales pulled the market's median price down 2.3 percent in the third quarter, to $890,000, according to Elliman. The Corcoran Group said the median price was even from both last quarter and last year at $850,000, while reports by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showed an increase of 2 percent from last year to $865,525.
At the high end of the market, the average price dropped 4 percent to $1,377,630, as the sales pace slowed, according to Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property. The number of apartments selling for $5 million or more were down 12 percent from the third quarter of 2011, and sales of apartments for $20 million or more fell to three from seven in the same period.

HEADLINE: In Business, Nondrinking Can Be a Costly Expense

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
As an ad-sales executive with Forbes magazine, Terry Lavin worked hard to earn his reputation as a dependable drinking buddy.
"I just basically rented space at P. J. Clarke's," he said, referring to the Midtown Manhattan watering hole. "I was always the last to leave, always had a cocktail in my hand."
In a business built on likability, the role helped him succeed. Until 2010, when he decided to give his body a break and quit drinking for six months. His health got better; his business did not.
"I would call guys I was friendly with, guys who had their hands on big ad budgets, to see if they wanted to go to happy hour or get something to eat," he recalled, "And they'd say: 'Are you drinking? No? Don't worry about it.' " 
So much for the benefits of the sober life.
Even as three-martini lunches and whiskey-fueled staff meetings become harder to find outside of cable TV, plenty of American business rituals continue to revolve around alcohol. Whether it's courting a client, sketching out a deal or simply proving you're a team player, quaffing a round of beers is arguably more vital to many jobs than nailing a round of golf.
For professionals who abstain from alcohol - for health, religion, recovery or simple preference - it can sometimes seem harder to get ahead if you're not willing to throw one back.
"You're expected to drink, and drinking is part of what you do, and there's a little bit of circumspection if you say you don't do it," said Link Christin, director of a special treatment program for legal professionals started last year by Hazelden, a network of alcohol- and drug-rehabilitation centers based in Minnesota. "If you say you don't drink, you have to deal with the suspicion that you can't play the game."
To find that attitude in action, look no further than this year's presidential campaign. As a part of his pitch to voters that Mitt Romney, a teetotaler Mormon, is different from most Americans, President Obama has made a conspicuous display of his own regular-guy fondness for beer.
"Yesterday I went to the State Fair, and I had a pork chop and a beer," Mr. Obama boasted to an Iowa crowd in August the day after he closed down a beer kiosk so he could buy brews for himself and 10 other fairgoers. "And it was good. Today I just had a beer. I didn't get the pork chop. But the beer was good, too." The crowd rewarded him with chants of "Four more beers!"
When the public demanded that Mr. Obama release his recipes for home brews after he shared a bottle of one with a coffee shop patron in Knoxville, Iowa, the White House milked the moment by first demanding 25,000 signatures on a petition. (The White House eventually relented, releasing two recipes after just 12,000 signatures.)
It's hardly a new tactic among politicians. Edward M. Kennedy complained about the lack of alcohol in Jimmy Carter's White House as he prepared to challenge the president in the 1980 primaries. And it has become a pollsters' truism in recent years that voters choose the candidate they'd rather have a beer with. (The most recent nondrinker to take the White House, George W. Bush, at least made sure he was occasionally photographed holding a nonalcoholic O'Doul's.)
For less public figures, the notion that people who don't drink can't perform in business - or, worse, are somehow untrustworthy - can impede professional progress.
"There is a perception almost that you're impotent," said one nondrinker, an editor at a liquor-focused lifestyle magazine who asked not to be identified because many of his co-workers don't know he recently entered a 12-step program.
Professional disadvantages to sobriety range from the literal - the editor had to decline a potential promotion because it would have involved wine tasting - to subtle.
"I regularly turn down lunches and dinners with industry people that I would have jumped at in the past," the editor said. "I just can't go to dinner with a winemaker and tell him: 'No, thank you. I'm not tasting those.' "
One hardly has to work directly with alcohol to experience this. On Wall Street, where a "models and bottles" lifestyle prevails, those who don't drink "complain that they can't close a deal, can't even get into early negotiations because they won't engage in drinking behaviors," said John Crepsac, a New York City therapist who counsels Wall Street workers in recovery.
Social scientists refer to it as "social capital," the amount of economic potential to be harnessed from one's capacity to fit in.
"There were times I knew the guys were going out with customers that could help advance my career," said one nondrinking Wall Street trader who asked to remain anonymous because his employer doesn't allow staff members to talk to the media, "but it was just unspoken: 'Yeah, we won't invite him 'cause we'll probably get up to some drinking and he won't partake, so what's the point?' "
Of course, sobriety and success are not mutually exclusive. Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Larry Ellison are all lifetime abstainers. Whether or not he wins, Mr. Romney hasn't lacked for success, either.
And sober women might actually benefit from an old double standard. "Men are still expected to get together and go wild, but in some ways it's frowned upon if the woman engages in it," Dr. Crepsac said, noting that few of his female patients have complained that sobriety hurt their careers. "There are plenty of things for which women are discriminated against in the workplace, but this isn't one of them."
Still, research supports the idea that nondrinkers have a harder time climbing the corporate ladder. Multiple studies have shown that moderate drinkers earn more money than those who don't drink, though heavy drinkers earn less than moderate drinkers.
That pressure to perform can sometimes cause professionals in recovery to backslide. This is one reason that Hazelden created a support group especially for lawyers who are trying to stay sober.
"The pressure to bring in business at legal firms, to be a rainmaker, is greater than ever," said Mr. Christin, a former litigation lawyer and a recovered alcoholic. When someone must choose between supporting his or her family and having a glass of wine, it can be tough to stay the course, he said.
Teetotalers tend to develop strategies for socializing professionally without alcohol. Some will order a drink and simply leave it alone; others use humor to deflect unwanted attention. "I tell people I'm pregnant," said the Wall Street trader (a man).
Mr. Lavin, who is on leave from ad sales to write a book, advises asking for your drink in deceiving glassware. "People are much calmer if you're drinking a seltzer water out of a rocks glass," he said.
And there is justice to be had. Joe McKinsey, a former mortgage executive who opened a rehab clinic for executives in East Hampton, N.Y., after his own recovery, said it had taken only a few months of being sober at his old job to go from a target of ridicule to a confidant for those in trouble.
"Eventually you get people buttonholing you, asking, 'Do you think I have a problem?' " he said. "I became the go-to guy if you needed to have a private talk."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Diseases From Animals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Quammen raised an often overlooked but vitally important public health issue in ''Anticipating the Next Pandemic'' (Sunday Review, Sept. 23): the threat from zoonotic diseases, which develop in animals and spread to humans. 
Mr. Quammen makes a well-founded prediction that a zoonotic virus will be the next ''big one'' -- a pandemic that costs heavily in lives and economic losses. He addresses the importance of monitoring both domestic and international sources of zoonotic diseases.
This is significant because zoonotic diseases are most likely to originate where humans come into contact with species already well known to us: bats, rodents, primates, chickens, to name a few.
Mr. Quammen identifies research as one of the best safeguards against pandemics developing near and far. As director of a program at the United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) to enhance zoonotic disease detection and form response strategies, I welcomed the validation of our efforts from a knowledgeable source.

HEADLINE: Visas for Top Graduates: A View From Capitol Hill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Visas for Scientists, With a Catch'' (editorial, Sept. 27), you claim that there is a catch with the STEM Jobs Act, which I sponsored, but you are simply fishing for opposition. 
According to a recent poll, three in four likely voters think that we should allow the top foreign graduates of American universities with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math -- known as STEM fields -- to remain in the United States. And that's exactly what the STEM Jobs Act does.
Gallup recently reported that four out of five Americans also do not want to see higher levels of immigration. That's why the STEM Jobs Act eliminates the fraud-ridden diversity visa program and reallocates these visas to those who could help make us more competitive in the global economy.
We should eliminate the diversity visa lottery because it bases our immigration system on the luck of the draw by selecting people at random to receive green cards. No family ties to the United States or strong skill set are required to be eligible. And former State Department officials and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office have found the lottery to be an open invitation to fraud and a jackpot for terrorists.
The United States has the most generous legal immigration system in the world; we admit more than one million legal immigrants each year. We should maintain this generosity, but we need to make our immigration system smarter by allowing the best and brightest foreign graduates to stay here.
Unfortunately, some Democrats voted to send the best and brightest foreign graduates back home to work for our global competitors. Their vote against this bill is a vote against economic growth and job creation.
LAMAR SMITH Washington, Sept. 27, 2012
The writer, a Republican from Texas, is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

HEADLINE: Theater Shooting Survivor Makes an Appeal on Guns

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

 BODY:
Stephen Barton was supposed to spend the fall teaching English in Russia on a Fulbright fellowship. But shortly after midnight on July 20, a gunman in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., derailed those plans.
Still recovering from the wounds he sustained when the gunman opened fire that night, killing 12 and injuring dozens more, Mr. Barton has decided to devote his energies this fall to something entirely different: Trying to get the presidential candidates to address the touchy issue of guns and gun violence.
In a television advertisement to begin airing on Monday, Mr. Barton, seated in an empty movie theater, tells viewers that despite the injuries from 25 shotgun pellets that embedded themselves in his face and neck, he was lucky. 
"In the next four years, 48,000 Americans won't be so lucky, because they'll be murdered with guns in the next president's term, enough to fill over 200 theaters," Mr. Barton, 22, says in the advertisement. "So when you watch the presidential debates, ask yourself, 'Who has a plan to stop gun violence?'"
The advertisement will appear in Colorado and on cable stations in Washington and other cities across the country, said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bipartisan coalition of more than 725 mayors that is sponsoring the ad as part of its "Demand a Plan" campaign.
After the shooting spree in Aurora, both presidential candidates offered their condolences to the victims and their families. President Obama traveled to Aurora to visit the injured. Mitt Romney said, "Our hearts break with the sadness of this unspeakable tragedy."
But any discussion of how to prevent gun violence has been noticeably absent in presidential campaigns that have focused on the economy and foreign policy issues.
Both candidates have backed gun control measures in the past, Mr. Obama as a legislator and Mr. Romney as governor of Massachusetts, where he raised the fee for gun licenses and signed a ban on assault weapons.
But at a time when national surveys show waning support among Americans for tougher gun laws and when politicians who broach the issue face swift attack by the National Rifle Association and other gun groups, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have instead stressed their support for Second Amendment rights.
Mr. Barton, who graduated from Syracuse University in May and had stopped in Aurora for a few days while on a cross-country bicycle trip, said that before the shooting, he had followed the presidential campaign from a distance.
But what happened that night at the theater made it much more personal.
"I couldn't sit back and be just frustrated at the direction of the discourse or the lack of discourse," he said. "I guess I just felt some responsibility."
He deferred his Fulbright fellowship and, through contacts in Washington, signed up with the mayors' coalition, where he will spend the year working on gun control issues.
"We have this giant shooting and it's really sad that we can't even have a discussion about it," he said. "Really, more than anything, we just want to candidates to start talking about it in a way that's beyond just condolences."
And if the advertisement fails to convince the candidates, he added, "At least it might convince regular American citizens to think about it."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths GALLAGHER, JOHN W

 BODY:
GALLAGHER--John W. Age 87, of Stratford, CT, died Thursday, September 27, 2012, at his home. Born March 22, 1925 in Concord, Massachusetts, he was the son of the late John J. and Ethel F. O'Brien Gallagher. He had lived in Stratford since 1995. He was a member of St. Mark Roman Catholic Church of Stratford. 
Mr. Gallagher served honorably in two wars. As a First Lieutenant Navigator and Radar Bombardier in the Army Air Forces, he flew missions in both the European and Asiatic Pacific Theaters in World War II. Released from active duty at war's end, he remained in the Army Air Forces Reserve and went to college. In October, 1950, shortly after U.S. entry into the Korean War, he was recalled to active duty in the Air Force. He attended Advanced Pilot Training, became a Fighter Pilot, and was promoted to Captain. During training, in San Antonio, he met Julia Elizabeth (Betty) Tuttle. In September, 1952, he and Betty began what would be a 58-year marriage. He was released from duty for the final time in December, 1952. After his first release from active duty, Mr. Gallagher attended Harvard College, graduating in 1949. After his second, he attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design, attaining a Master of Architecture Degree in 1957. Mr. Gallagher was a member of the American Institute of Architects and was a Registered Architect in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas. He began his architectural career as a Designer at Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, in New York City (1957-1959). He then moved his family to Dallas, Texas, where he was a Project Architect at Harrell and Hamilton (1959-1963). Then he started the partnership, Gallagher and Bishop Architects, in Dallas (1963-1965), working also a Visiting Lecturer in Design at Texas A&M University. He then moved his family back to the Northeast, to become Partner in the firm, Hoberman and Wasserman, Architects, in New York City (1965-1974). He then briefly worked on his own, then joined Norman Hoberman in Greenwich, Connecticut, forming Hoberman and Gallagher, Architects and a number of other firms, including: Spaces (with Betty Gallagher), a space planning and interior design firm; Greenwich Development Partnership, a development firm specializing in elderly housing; and GDP Management, a property management firm. From very early on, Mr. Gallagher was a soulful and devoted pianist, playing piano and accordion in professional bands as a child and young adult. While an architectural partner in New York City, he attended advanced piano classes at The Julliard School. Mr. Gallagher lived with his family in Stamford, Connecticut from 1966 to 1995, when he retired and moved to the Oronoque Village community in Stratford. While in Stamford, he was an Assistant Scout Master at Troop 3 for several years. He often contributed his time and skills to community organizations. Most recently, he volunteered at the Bishop Wicke Health Center, playing the piano on Sundays for residents there. For various spans of his life, he enjoyed skiing, squash, tennis, and golf, and was a member of The Side Show, a golfing group at Oronoque. Mr. Gallagher was predeceased by his wife Betty, a son Robert, and his sister Ruth G. Bush. He is survived by two sons, David B. Gallagher of Austin, TX, and John E. Gallagher of Norwalk, CT; by John E.'s wife, Rocio; by four grandchildren, Julia, John, George, and Laura Gallagher, all of Norwalk, CT; and by a number of nephews, nieces, and cousins, all of whom will remember him very fondly. Friends may call from 4 to 7pm on Wednesday, October 3, at the William R. McDonald Funeral Home, 2591 Main Street, Stratford, CT. Friends are invited to a Funeral Mass of Christian Burial on Thursday, October 4, at 10am, at St. Mark Roman Catholic Church, 500 Wigwam Lane, Stratford, CT. Reception will follow at the Oronoque Country Club. Interment with full military honors will be private. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to hospice, to the American Red Cross, to the Brookwood Community (Brookshire, Texas), or to a charity of individual choice.

HEADLINE: Exit Polls Indicate Voters in Georgia Are Turning Against President's Party

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Olesya Vartanyan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TBILISI, Georgia -- Exit polls in Georgia's hotly contested parliamentary race suggested on Monday that a party backed by the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili has edged out the party headed by Georgia's larger-than-life president, Mikheil Saakashvili.
A poll by Edison Research broadcast on Georgian television showed that Georgian Dream, Mr. Ivanishvili's party, had probably won more than half of the popular vote. This result is a sobering verdict on Mr. Saakashvili and his ruling team, who took power in the peaceful Rose Revolution nine years ago. 
The shift will have a practical effect because next year Georgia's Parliament will take on many powers that now rest with the president, according to recent changes to the Constitution. But Mr. Saakashvili's party may retain a majority of parliamentary seats because half the seats are allocated in individual races, rather than by overall party vote.
In his years in office, Mr. Saakashvili has restyled Georgia as a bastion of resistance to Russian influence and a laboratory for free-market economic policy.
He faced no formidable challenges until the emergence last year of Mr. Ivanishvili, a reclusive philanthropist who has spent years spreading his Russian-earned billions around Georgia's countryside. Mr. Ivanishvili has tapped into long-simmering grievances over poverty and the heavy-handed ruling style of Mr. Saakashvili and his team.
It was a remarkable upset. After the exit polls were released, cars flying Georgian Dream flags screamed down the central artery here, and thousands gathered in Freedom Square. Temur Butikashvili, 52, a filmmaker, said it was the first time Georgia had changed its leadership through an election.
''We have done what all our ancestors aspired to. We have calmly, quietly transferred power,'' Mr. Butikashvili said.
Of Mr. Saakashvili, he said: ''We had great hopes when he came in. He studied in America; we thought he had an American mentality. But he turned from a democrat into an autocrat. He turned into an authoritarian.''
With Monday's election, many felt the country was headed for a reckoning. Georgia has a history of chaotic power struggles -- the first and second post-Soviet presidents left office before the end of their terms to avoid deepening civil unrest -- and Mr. Ivanishvili's supporters have warned that they will take to the streets rather than accept vote counts that they consider fraudulent.
Both sides had grounds to declare victory, but big questions loom. Venomous attacks have marked the campaign, and it is hard to imagine the two leaders collaborating for the remaining year that remains of Mr. Saakashvili's presidency.
The breakdown of parliamentary seats will be disputed. Even without a popular majority, Mr. Saakashvili's governing party may still command more than half of the 150 seats in Parliament because under Georgia's complex election rules, 73 are single-mandate, meaning they go to individual candidates who receive the most votes. A party with 76 or more seats will have a chance to elect a prime minister.
But more conclusive final results will not be in until Tuesday, and the outcome remains in doubt. Early Tuesday, Mr. Ivanishvili declared that according to his exit polls, his party had won 100 seats.
But a leader of the governing party, David Darchiashvili, said his side had at least two-thirds, adding that, ''I am confident this majority will be enough to elect our own prime minister.''
One of the major differences between Mr. Ivanishvili and Mr. Saakashvili is on Russia; Mr. Ivanishvili has criticized the president for his open hostility toward Russia and suggested that if he takes power, he will take a more conciliatory line and Russian markets will reopen to Georgian produce, wine and mineral water, providing an economic lift. Meanwhile, Mr. Saakashvili has accused his opponent of being a front for the Kremlin.
There was palpable tension on Monday in the village of Karaleti, where identical concrete houses hold hundreds of families displaced from their land by the 2008 war with Russia.
When activists from Mr. Ivanishvili's party visited over the summer, they were hounded out of town by residents shouting and waving sticks. Dato Chulkhadze, 38, lounged with a group of brawny men in T-shirts opposite Karaleti's polling station on Monday, recalling the episode with satisfaction.
''People started to shout, 'You are Russian, you are Russian,' and they had no answer -- even a small child knows they are on Russia's side,'' said Mr. Chulkhadze. Asked about Mr. Ivanishvili's changes, he said, ''I pray to God nothing like this will happen. If it happens, the Russians will return.''
But several residents approached a reporter quietly to say that support for Mr. Ivanishvili was higher than it appeared, except people were afraid to say so publicly. One woman, who would not give her name, said she was voting for Mr. Ivanishvili because ''we should not be afraid when we talk.''
The vote is under extreme scrutiny, and many are waiting for Tuesday's assessments from 1,400 international observers. In this opposition stronghold, some voters were so alert for fraud that they brought their own pens to make sure they were not given invisible ink. Lawrence Sheets, a South Caucasus specialist with the International Crisis Group, said he was tired but relieved that Monday had passed in relative calm.
''Everyone's been very tired -- it's been a year of this rhetoric and poisonous stuff -- but in the end if it doesn't end in something really unstable, which we feared, it's a positive step for the country,'' he said. ''What other post-Soviet country has had this kind of process?''

HEADLINE: Surprise Grants Transforming 23 More Lives

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Natalia Almada, a 37-year-old filmmaker in Mexico City; Raj Chetty, a 33-year-old public economist who teaches at Harvard; and Eric A. Coleman, a 47-year-old physician in Denver, have now become connected, part of an eclectic group whose lives were recently, and irrevocably, changed with a single telephone call.
The three were among the 23 MacArthur Fellows for 2012, whose names were revealed Monday afternoon, ahead of the official announcement scheduled for 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. The fellowships from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, awards that can't be applied for, are the stuff of fantasy. Besides the imprimatur of outstanding achievement, they come with a no-strings-attached $100,000 a year for five years. 
The 13 men and 10 women named fellows this year range in age from 31 to 66 and, as in years past, are a diverse group. They include an astronomer, a stringed instrument bow maker, two photographers and a marine ecologist. This year the boldface names belong to writers and musicians: Junot Díaz, 43, the writer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Chris Thile, 31, a mandolinist and composer in New York City; David Finkel 56, a Washington Post reporter; Dinaw Mengestu, 34, a novelist and journalist in Washington; and Claire Chase, 34, a flutist and arts entrepreneur in Brooklyn.
''You usually have to apply for something, and it's a lot of work,'' said Ms. Almada, a citizen of Mexico and the United States. ''It's such freedom to think I can count on something. It's huge. It's validating.''
Ms. Almada's films have been shown around the world, including on public television stations in this country and at museums and international film festivals. She is known for not relying on conventional techniques, like interviews with experts or even a linear timeline.
Her 2001 thesis film at the Rhode Island School of Design, ''All Water Has a Perfect Memory,'' is an experimental short exploring the impact on her family of the drowning death of her older sister at age 2 ½. Ms. Almada plumbed her own biography again -- she is the great-granddaughter of Plutarco Elías Calles, a former president of Mexico -- for her 2009 film ''El General,'' about Mr. Calles. Like ''All Water'' it is a meditation on the complexity of memory.
''Notions of objectivity and subjectivity are getting questioned more and more,'' she said of the world of documentary filmmaking. She said that as a female filmmaker in a mostly male world, ''it makes a difference'' in the conversations that unfold when she picks up her camera.
Like Ms. Almada, Mr. Chetty also found early success. He was a tenured professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, by the age of 27. He was born in New Delhi; his high-achieving family came to Milwaukee when he was 9. His two older sisters are college professors, his mother is a pediatric pulmonologist, and his father is an economist.
He was having lunch with his mother when the MacArthur phone call came. ''She was very excited,'' he said. ''She was happy that we moved here, and things turned out so well.''
Mr. Chetty took part in two studies that have made headlines because they sought to quantify the value of good teachers. One released this year, conducted with economists at Harvard and Columbia, tracked one million students in a large urban school district over 20 years and calculated that replacing an average teacher with an excellent one would raise a single classroom's lifetime earnings by about $1.4 million. Good teachers who lifted standardized test scores also had students less likely to become teenage parents and more likely to attend a good college, among other positive results.
''I'm motivated to ask these questions about why some students have good outcomes and some do not by reading the paper or observing the real world,'' Mr. Chetty said. ''At a broad level government policies can impact people's lives, but we often don't have the scientific evidence.''
He is already immersed in his next project, which explores what factors allow children to move up the economic ladder, relative to their parents.
Dr. Coleman, a geriatrician and professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is director of the Care Transitions Program, which trains nurses and social workers to help patients and their caregivers manage issues like medication use and organizing appointments. The impetus behind starting the program was the constant stream of stories about patients discharged from hospitals only to be readmitted in short order. A recent study estimated that 20 percent of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals are readmitted within 30 days because of lapses of communication among patients and various health care providers. ''We liken the discharge experience to a drive-by shooting,'' Dr. Coleman said.
Hundreds of hospitals and community agencies across the country and abroad have adopted the intervention, which has been shown to reduce the likelihood of readmission by 20 to 50 percent.
The other winners in the sciences this year are: Maria Chudnovsky, 35, a mathematician at Columbia University; Olivier Guyon; 36, an optical physicist and astronomer at the University of Arizona in Tucson; Elissa Hallem, 34, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles; Sarkis Mazmanian, 39, a medical microbiologist at the California Institute of Technology; Terry Plank, 48 a geochemist at Columbia University; Nancy Rabalais, 62, a marine ecologist at Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium; Daniel Spielman, 42, a computer scientist at Yale; Melody Swartz, 43, a bioengineer at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland; and Benjamin Warf, 54, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Children's Hospital Boston.
And the other winners in the arts are: Uta Barth, 54 a conceptual photographer in Los Angeles; Maurice Lim Miller, 66, a social services innovator in Oakland, Calif; Dylan C. Penningroth 41, a historian at Northwestern University; Laura Poitras, 48, a documentary filmmaker in New York City; Benoît Rolland, 58, a stringed instrument bow maker in Boston; and An-My Lê, 52, a photographer at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.

HEADLINE: More Money Than They Know What To Do With

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
It is a $1 trillion game: Use It or Lose It.
The private equity world is sitting on that 13-figure sum. It's what the industry calls dry powder. If they don't spend their cash pile snapping up acquisitions soon, they may have to return it to their investors.
Nearly $200 billion from funds raised in 2007 and 2008 alone needs to be spent in the next 12 months or it must be given back. 
Private equity executives, after spending the last several years largely on the sidelines amid the economic uncertainty - often proclaiming "patience" as an explanation - have begun to be anxious that they may need to go on a shopping spree. At least two major private equity firms, according to two executives involved in the discussions, have held internal strategy sessions in recent weeks about how to approach the looming deadline.
Some private equity firms have put the word out to Wall Street banks that they want to go "elephant hunting" - seeking big deals worth as much as $10 billion - and are willing to pay a special bounty for bringing them acquisition targets.
At least one firm has gone so far as to begin contemplating asking its investors, which include the nation's largest pension funds, to extend the deadline for the money to be spent in return for certain concessions on fees. (Of course, they don't return the fees that have been collected thus far).
"The clock is ticking loudly for these funds," Hugh MacArthur, the head of Bain & Company's private equity practice, wrote as the lead author of a report on the state of the industry.
So the race is on.
But, of course, there is a problem: "Burning off the aging dry powder will likely result in too much capital chasing too few deals throughout 2012," according to Mr. MacArthur.
That means it is possible we could see a series of bad deals with even worse returns.
Already, private equity firms have been quietly spending lots of cash. In the third quarter alone, private equity firms in the United States burned through $45 billion, up from $17.1 billion in the previous quarter, according to Capital IQ, which tracks deals data. Carlyle Group, which had its initial public offering in May, has been the busiest firm this year: it has done 11 deals worth almost $12 billion.
Acquisition prices are also likely to balloon because of "lots of firms bidding for the same obvious deals," Alastair Gibbons, a senior partner at Bridgepoint Capital, told Triago, a fund-raising services firm that publishes a widely read quarterly newsletter. "Since there is near record dry powder globally, it's entirely plausible that we'll see increasingly overcrowded bidding processes."
Richard Peterson, an analyst for S&P Capital IQ's Global Markets Intelligence group, said that private equity firms are already paying multiples of Ebitda - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - of 10.6 this year, up from 10.3 last year. It's worth remembering that many of the most successful deals in the private equity industry were bought for six to eight times Ebitda, he said.
He noted, however, that since firms were able to borrow at unheard-of low rates today "it may give them more confidence to pay a little bit more."
Perhaps in a sign of desperation, many private equity firms have been increasingly engaged in a game of "hot potato" with one firm selling a business to another - known as a secondary deal. Mr. Peterson said that at the current pace, the industry was expected to spend a record-breaking $22.3 billion this year simply buying companies from each other rather than buying businesses from the public markets or from private owners outside the private equity industry.
Mr. Peterson also raised a question that is often being whispered about but rarely said aloud: "A lot of these firms are publicly traded now. So to what degree are the transactions being driven by earnings objectives?"
Many of the big private equity firms - Apollo Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group, among them - are public. And for the first time, it is possible that the interests of the public shareholders could diverge from the interests of the investors in the buyout funds, at least in the short term.
If the private equity firms don't spend the money that they have already raised, it is unlikely they will be able to raise even more in coming years. And increasingly, the private equity firms have become dependent on the management fees not just to keep the lights on but to expand their businesses into other areas, in part to diversify, which has been part of the pitch to public investors. The biggest firms have become asset gatherers.
"In a nutshell, 95 percent of funds would be affected and see a big drop in fee income based on not investing all of the committed capital," according to Tim Friedman, director of North America for Preqin, which tracks private equity fund-raising and deals. He said that he did not expect firms to do deals simply "for the sake of it," but he also cautioned that the firms were "under a lot of pressure."
So keep an eye out for megadeal headlines - and whether they command the same prices when the companies are sold.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Surviving the Lockout

BYLINE: By GERALD NARCISO

 BODY:
VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Inside a tiny ice rink in this city's suburbs, one of the N.H.L.'s most promising young talents was playing in a weekly recreation hockey league.
On this particular night -- Sept. 22, the seventh day of the N.H.L. lockout -- more than 150 fans packed the Langley Twin Rinks to see the newest member of the Fraser Valley Wireless Ice: Evander Kane, a forward for the Winnipeg Jets.
Dressed in a sky blue jersey featuring the Fraser Valley Wireless logo, Kane did not disappoint. He had two goals and an assist in the Ice's 10-9 win over the Old Milwaukee Hurricanes. 
''He plays just like he would in the National Hockey League,'' said Jeff Bandura, the manager for the Adult Safe Hockey League in Langley, British Columbia. ''He's certainly a standout, but he's not out there showboating.''
Kane, 21, said the league, which is full of former local college and high school stars, was ''not as bad as people think.''
''There are people who can play,'' he said. ''But at the same time, it's obviously not the N.H.L.''
Like many involved with the N.H.L., Kane is awaiting a resolution to the lockout of its roughly 700 players, now into its third week. Negotiations resume Tuesday, but the league and the N.H.L. players' association remain far apart on how to split annual revenue. Opening night was supposed to be Oct. 11, but if no deal is reached, the N.H.L. is expected to begin canceling regular-season games later this week.
Around Vancouver, fans approached Kane on a daily basis, asking him when he thought the lockout would end. His typical response: ''Your guess is as good as mine.''
A professional since he was 15, Kane was drafted fourth over all in the 2009 N.H.L. entry draft by the Atlanta Thrashers, who relocated to Winnipeg before the 2011-12 season. At 6 feet 2 inches and 200 pounds, Kane, who was named after the boxer Evander Holyfield, is reminiscent of a young Mark Messier with his blend of finesse, athleticism and power.
Kane amassed career bests in goals (30) and assists (27) last season, his third in the N.H.L. Despite speculation that he might depart to a larger market, Kane signed a six-year, $31.5 million extension with the Jets just before the lockout began. When he will see the first check of that deal remains to be seen.
''It's definitely weird to not be in training camp right now,'' Kane said. ''For me, it's been a little bit too long for my liking not to be playing in the N.H.L.
''You get a little bored sometimes.''
To combat that, Kane trained around his native Vancouver and killed time any way he could. A week ago, he made the three-hour drive to Seattle with a friend to watch the ''Monday Night Football'' game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers that was decided by a controversial last-second touchdown. Kane posted photographs on Twitter, even mocking the replacement officials' call.
Kane said the lockout had a positive side -- ''if you want to go catch football games or go on weekend trips, which is, you know, kind of fun.''
''But at the same time, you got to act like the season could start tomorrow,'' he said. ''So you got to stay in shape.''
Six days a week, Kane had been in the weight room with his father, Perry, who is a boxing trainer. On Thursday, when the league canceled the remainder of the preseason schedule, Kane was on a tennis court, engaged in a spirited, late-morning match with a friend.
It was evident Kane could handle a racket. His arsenal included pinpoint aces and crafty backhand shots. He playfully talked trash to his opponent -- before, during and after their match.
''It's not so much for training -- it's more for fun,'' Kane said. ''But it's a good workout for sure.''
Anticipating a lockout, Kane prepared for an extended period without income. His agent, Craig Oster, set him up with a financial adviser, who helped Kane manage and save much of the $900,000 he made last season. Kane rents a three-bedroom condominium in Winnipeg and an apartment in downtown Vancouver, where he spends his off-season. He has also stuck to a set budget each month.
''There is a lot of education that is involved,'' said Oster, who spoke of ''making sure that our players do understand how to save, how to invest and also understand the cycle of their earnings.''
With endorsement contracts with Bauer Performance Sports and EA Sports, Kane will still earn income whether there is a season or not, although parts of his endorsement deals are prorated depending on statistics and games played.
''I think with the kind of money that most guys in the league make, you're pretty comfortable and you can survive for a good chunk of time,'' Kane said. ''But at the same time, it's not always all about money. You want to play, and you feel bad for the fans -- especially the fans in Winnipeg. Hockey is a livelihood, and it's something that they take pride in.''
It took less than two weeks of unemployment for Kane to realize he needed a real game -- and a real paycheck. On Friday, he agreed to a deal with Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League, and he was on a plane to Europe on Saturday. More than 70 N.H.L. players have signed contracts overseas since the lockout started Sept. 15, with stars like Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin and Pavel Datsyuk currently playing in the K.H.L. Dinamo Minsk, which also signed the Nashville Predators goalie Pekka Rinne, has games Tuesday and Thursday.
One week after attending that ''Monday Night Football'' game in Seattle, Kane was announcing his arrival in his new home.
''Landed in Minsk to a large amount media,'' he wrote on his Twitter feed. ''They love their hockey here. Can't wait to play!!''

HEADLINE: Q & A with N.A.S.L. Commissioner David Downs

BYLINE: CESAR DIAZ


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with David Downs, commissioner of the North American Soccer League. 

 BODY:
The eight-team North American Soccer League has reached the semifinal round of the playoffs as it looks ahead to next season.
Last week, league officials were in Edmonton, Alberta, trying to drum up local support for a stadium for a new team, F.C. Edmonton. The reborn New York Cosmos last week announced they would be playing their home games at Hofstra University in suburban New York City. 
This year, the league that is the de facto second division in the United States, one rung below Major League Soccer, has shown growth on and off the field. Attendance showed a modest increase powered primarily by the impressive debut of the San Antonio Scorpions who averaged 9,176 a game. 
Over the weekend, Fort Lauderdale and Minnesota each advanced to the home-and-home semifinal round. The semifinal winners advance to the title game and play for the Soccer Bowl trophy.
The N.A.S.L. is overseen by David Downs, who is in his second season as commissioner, with a big assist from Traffic U.S.A. (which owns several clubs). Note also that it was Traffic, which is based in Brazil, that engineered the TV deal with Concacaf that sent the rights to U.S. away World Cup qualifiers to the new beIn Sports network. Downs, a former executive at Univision and the former executive director of the U.S. bid committee for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, recently spoke with the Goal blog.
 Q. 
 What has the success of the San Antonio Scorpions meant for the N.A.S.L.? 
 A. 
They've been fantastic. With the Montreal Impact graduating to M.L.S., we faced a major task of showing growth in attendance this season. San Antonio has been such a successful first-year team both on and off the field; they really established the model for not only teams committed to coming to our league but also for anyone who's considering coming into our league. They showed that it can be done and how it can be done. 
 Q. 
 Can you explain next season's split-season format? 
 A. 
It's a system that works for us on different levels. It's not unrealistic because many countries throughout the world have adopted this model, especially in Latin America. 
Point 1: We think that by going from a long single regular season with playoffs that six out of eight teams advance to a split-season format, the champion of each season is highly rewarding because they will face each other in a single playoff round. By switching formats, we put a far greater emphasis on the importance of regular-season games. 
Point 2: By having a strategic break, essentially in July, we synced our schedule with the international transfer window. So our teams have the option to utilize that break to try to bring in some key players who can come in and change their fate in the second half. Or they can use that break to schedule international friendlies or go on tour themselves. 
This is a business and one of the downsides of our playoff structure is that there's no revenue for the visiting team in the quarterfinal round. Even though a team may have clinched a playoff spot, it's an additional expense because of the traveling and accommodations behind it. 
By replacing a month of playoff games, there's no longer the uncertainty as to who would participate and how much advance notice they would get for the games they were in. With a split-formation format, teams are able to budget and make the necessary accommodations. We believe it's a positive step in the direction of the league and it's the reason why our board was unanimous in adopting the split-season format. 
 Q. 
 Do you foresee a working relationship with Major League Soccer? Or are the models too different? 
 A. 
We've had plenty of on-and-off discussions with M.L.S.. To be honest, I can't give you a specific number. I've had great relations with M.L.S. headquarters in both my capacity as president of Univision Sports buying M.L.S. rights and more recent when I was executive director of the World Cup Bid where M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber was on my board and our offices was on the same floor. 
We've had a very open dialogue. You know, their goals and message and priorities for player development may be a little different than ours. I still believe that there ought to be a way that our league can help serve and make players better in the United States, especially players in M.L.S. who are not getting league playing time. I think those guys would be better off if they played in our league. I keep hoping that there's a way that an agreement can be made where it's beneficial to them and beneficial for us. 
I would also tell you that we would never have an agreement if we felt it would demean the quality of our league. Our owners are not in this because they want to be considered a minor league. Our owners are in this because they want to offer the highest quality professional soccer available in person in the markets they're serving. They want to say to their fans, 'Come out and see the highest level of professional soccer in person and enjoy the experience.'
And not necessarily dwell on the fact that under our sanctioning we're Division 2, USL Pro is Division 3 and M.L.S. is Division 1. The bottom line that we're on top of the soccer pyramid in each of the markets we serve and that's a good thing. 
 Q. 
 What is current relationship between the N.A.S.L. and Traffic Sports? 
 A. 
The relationship with Traffic Sports USA is fine. They're still one of our most important league owners and happily behind the success of the league 100 percent. Along with owning the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, they're partial owners of the Carolina RailHawks and Atlanta Silverbacks. They're now in the process of trying to get investors to purchase their ownership from Atlanta and Carolina. They have no interest in having multiple ownerships nor would the league prefer for that to be the case. 
 Q. 
 With the New York Cosmos joining the N.A.S.L. next season, what kind of impact do you think they will have considering what the San Antonio Scorpions have accomplished this season? 
 A. 
Given the reaction from their brand name and past success, they'll fare pretty well. I don't dare predict specific numbers about their attendance would be like. I think they'll do well and it's tremendously important for our league that they made this decision. 
It's not only adding the presence of the New York media market, it's adding a global brand name to our N.A.S.L. family which is very appropriate since they originated from the N.A.S.L. And we're bringing some very sophisticated and well0financed owners to sit around the boardroom table and discuss our strategic vision. For all those reasons, it's a tremendous thing for us and we can't wait to get them on the field. 
 Q. 
 Knowing that the Cosmos have been clear about wanting to join M.L.S., what is your current arrangement with them? 
 A. 
Without giving you specific details, what I will say is that we have a multiyear commitment with them. The deal does recognize that there may be a moment in time when they would make the jump to M.L.S. We are O.K. with that, but at the same time it's my job and the league's job to make sure their experience in the N.A.S.L. is so great that they wouldn't want to or couldn't afford to move to M.L.S.
 Q. 
 Does the N.A.S.L. play a role in assisting expansion teams in assembling a squad and securing a site for their home matches? 
 A. 
Our league office is certainly in the business in educating everybody of the best practices, sharing information and lending our political support. It depends on the needs of each team. Take San Antonio for example, they're building their stadium for next year. That's entirely their project. 
 Q. 
 What are the future plans of the N.A.S.L. when it comes to expansion, investors and TV deals? 
 A. 
First thing first ... from an expansion standpoint, it has already had that desired effect. A number of interested parties, who might have been on the fence about being part of the N.A.S.L., have reached out to us because they are now interested in being part of the league. So that's been great and I think you'll be hearing from us before the end of the year of a couple of announcements about expansion teams for 2014 and 2015. 
As far as TV contracts go, we have had the ability to get on television but we have chosen not to. We felt it wouldn't be the best use of our money. So as an option, we stream online all our games free of charge for our fans. As far as next year goes, we'll explore our options again.
In general with expansion, we hope hope to have 18 to 20 teams by 2018. We're looking to push farther out west and maybe a couple of cities in the Midwest. There are a number of top-25 markets in the United States that aren't represented by a professional soccer team. 
We believe it's an obvious marriage to join the N.A.S.L., especially as the price is going up and the number of opportunities getting more and more limited to joining M.L.S. Not every market can afford to support a team at the level of economics of M.L.S. which at the moment is higher than ours.

HEADLINE: Regulator Urges Appeal of Dodd-Frank Court Ruling

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: After a recent court decision overturned limits on speculative trading, Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, slammed the judicial ruling as "deeply flawed" and vulnerable to appeal. 

 BODY:
After a recent court decision overturned limits on speculative trading, a financial regulator on Tuesday slammed the judicial ruling as "deeply flawed" and vulnerable to appeal. 
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, called for his agency to challenge the ruling handed down last week by a federal judge in Washington. The decision tossed out the agency's new so-called position limits rule, which took aim at speculative Wall Street trading tied to soaring energy prices. 
"Position limits are simply too important," Mr. Chilton said in prepared remarks for a speech in Rome at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters. 
Position limits would cap the number of derivatives contracts a trader can hold on 28 commodities, including energy products like oil and natural gas. The rule, Mr. Chilton and other supporters say, would protect consumers from speculative commodities trading. Some studies link speculative trading to inflated prices at the gas pump and the grocery store. 
The rule is rooted in the Dodd-Frank act, the financial regulatory overhaul passed in response to the financial crisis. When the C.F.T.C. adopted the limits last fall, it did so in the face of significant Wall Street opposition. 
In December, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association sued the agency over its rule. The Wall Street trade groups pointed to the fine print of Dodd-Frank, saying the law leaves it to regulators to enforce position limits only "as appropriate."
The agency had a different interpretation, saying that lawmakers gave it no choice but to impose position limits. The "appropriate" requirement, the agency argued, refers to setting position limits at a reasonable level. 
"They knew limits were urgent and important," Mr. Chilton said, referring to the lawmakers who passed Dodd-Frank in 2010. "That means we set the limit levels correctly."
The status of the rule is unclear. Judge Robert L. Wilkins of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the C.F.T.C.'s plan, sending it back to the agency for "further proceedings."
But in a statement last week, the agency hinted it would plow ahead with the rule. 
"I believe it is critically important that these position limits be established as Congress required," the agency's chairman, Gary Gensler, said in the statement. "I am disappointed by today's ruling, and we are considering ways to proceed."
One route could lead the agency to appeal to the The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. Chilton also urged the agency to seek court approval for enforcing position limits, until the regulator has exhausted its options. The limits were supposed to take effect later this month.
But the agency's chances with the appeals court are spotty. The court has been unfriendly to financial regulators in the past, throwing out Securities and Exchange Commission rules six times in seven years.
Mr. Chilton suggested a contingency plan: appease Mr. Wilkins. 
"We should start drafting yet another rule proposal to address any concerns the court had," he said. "I am confident we can do so."

HEADLINE: Free Advice From Financial Planners in October

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Four nonprofit groups are sponsoring free one-on-one sessions with financial planners in two dozen cities. 

 BODY:
Four nonprofit groups are sponsoring a freebie that might come in handy if you're looking to get your financial life on track: financial planning sessions in two dozen cities during October.
The groups are billing the sessions as free, "no strings attached," one-on-one meetings with financial professionals - mostly certified financial planners, but also other members of the Financial Planning Association. The planners are volunteering their time and will not distribute business cards or sell financial products or services, according to the organizers.
The groups sponsoring the third annual "Financial Planning Days" events include the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, the Financial Planning Association, the Foundation for Financial Planning and the United States Conference of Mayors.
In one-on-one meetings, the financial planners can help answer questions on budgeting, managing credit, getting out of debt, income taxes, homeownership, handling mortgage foreclosures, paying for college, estate planning, insurance and other topics.
Most locations will also offer free workshops on various personal finance topics, like taxes and retirement.
The events begin this week on Thursday and Friday in Miami. The next round occurs Saturday in Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Huntington Beach, Calif.; Newark; Oakland, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; and San Diego. The events will be held in other cities later in the month; for a complete list of locations, cities and dates, see www.financialplanningdays.org.
You canregister onlinein advance by clicking on the city where you want to attend, or by calling, toll free, 1-877-861-7826. You can also walk in and register on the day of the event, but preference is given to those who pre-register.
Participants do not have to bring anything, but organizers suggest they might want to bring relevant financial documents and a list of questions to make the most of their time.

HEADLINE: The Intangible Costs of Bankruptcies

BYLINE: STEPHEN J. LUBBEN


HIGHLIGHT: Indirect costs of a company's financial distress, which are more abstract, have not been studied enough. 

 BODY:
Financial distress has a cost. Creditors would say I've just stated the obvious.
In most cases, the borrower incurs the cost in the form of higher interest rates and fees up front, although unanticipated costs, and costs imposed on tort victims, are created by those creditors.
The costs of corporate bankruptcy or reorganization are often considered to encompass two concepts. First, there are the direct costs, composed chiefly of the professionals fees associated with reorganization. But they also include other lesser costs, like court filing fees and, in the United States, quarterly fees due to the United States Trustee's office.
Academics,including myself, examine these costs a lot, in part because they are easy to study. They are spelled out in precise dollars.
In addition, there are indirect costs of a company's financial distress, which are more abstract, like lost revenue, lost opportunities and lost good will. 
Some of these costs may be of concern to the company's stakeholders, but not to policy makers if, for example, financial distress simply results in the shifting of sales from the distressed firm to a competitor firm - unless the competitor is abroad.
American Airlines, whose parent company filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2011, is incurring those costs right now in a public way.
Seats are loose, bloggers are complaining, and pilots are (understandably) unwilling to cut the company any breaks, since the company wants to cut the costs of pilots.
A recent paper in The Journal of Financial Economics shows that these sorts of indirect costs are incurred for years before the company formally defaults. Rather than a sudden, Lehman-style collapse, the authors say that it is far more common for firms to experience a slow erosion of value.
This finding has a lot of important implications. First of all, it suggests that academics may be focusing too narrowly on fees. Chapter 11 professional fees are sensational - the media loves to talk about thehigh-priced lawyers that help companies go broke - but they don't seem to be an important part of the cost here.
And if most of the cost is incurred long before bankruptcy, then we may need to reform the Chapter 11 portion of the bankruptcy code in a way that will allow those costs to be cut sooner.
Of course, management always expects that the turnaround that will help it avoid bankruptcy is just around the corner.
Often it's called terminal optimism.

HEADLINE: Drop in Emissions Not a Trend Set in Stone, Study Says

BYLINE: EMMA BRYCE


HIGHLIGHT: A new report suggests that the recent decline in emissions is unlikely to continue without substantial changes in production and consumption practices. 

 BODY:
A report released today by Climate Central asks a provocative question: Can United States carbon emissions keep falling?
This comes with the year 2050 in mind, by which time climate scientists have said there needs to be a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if the worst impacts of climate change are to be avoided. The report by Eric D. Larson from the Energy Systems Analysis Group at Princeton shows that American carbon emissions have dropped by nearly 9 percent since 2005.
The downward trend comes largely as a result of the recession, increased use of natural gas and solar and wind power, and advancements in energy-saving technologies. But the study suggests that the downward trend won't continue.
Once the economy rebounds, the recession's restrictive impact on carbon emissions will probably fall away, the report suggests. A stronger economy means greater demand for energy - and when 80 percent of the country's energy comes from fossil fuels, carbon emissions will probably spike again. Then add in a rising population, which will draw yet more energy. The author says optimistic projections for the future based on the current 9 percent decrease in carbon emissions forget to take these factors into account.
It does list some possible ways to substantially reduce emissions, but that will require a sea change from current consumption practices. One of the report's suggestions for more emissions reduction is to increase the proportion of electricity derived from natural gas to 44 percent from the current 29 percent over all by 2035, and at the same time, decrease the influence of coal. Others involve fitting coal-fired power plants with carbon capture and storage capabilities and relying on renewables like wind and solar energy to generate 31 percent of electricity by 2035.
Even the author says it's a tall order, but an attainable one.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Offshore

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
Mitt Romney's tax returns show that offshore arrangements made through his former company, Bain Capital, used tax-avoidance strategies that have enhanced his income, Michael Luo and Mike McIntire report. Other offshore arrangements also enabled his individual retirement account to avoid taxes and may have reduced his personal income tax bills.

        
After Mr. Romney called for the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act, which expanded the government's whistle-blower program in the financial services industry, President Obama's re-election campaign has receivedgenerous donationsfrom lawyers who have reaped multimillion-dollar rewards from taking on the cases of those who have stepped forward to point out wrongdoing, Eric Lipton reports.

        
Aballot measurein California would prohibit both corporations and labor unions from donating to candidates, but the corporate provision is far less stringent than the one aimed at unions, Adam Nagourney reports. Labor leaders see the measure as the biggest threat they have faced in a year of nationwide challenges to diminish their power.

        
Looking ahead to the post-election session of Congress, Senate leaders are working on a framework for a comprehensive long-term approach to reducing the deficit rather than a short-term solution, Jonathan Weisman reports. While such an agreement would avert a series of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate remain far apart on the details of how the process would work, while House Republicans continue to resist any discussion of tax increases.

        
Mr. Romney's campaign seems to be shifting course, choosing not to focus solely on the nation's economic struggles and instead drawing a sharper distinction between his platform and the president's, Michael D. Shear and Ashley Parker report.

        
Moderating a presidential debate, a role that once stood as a crowning and coveted journalistic achievement, is now subject to partisan rancor in a hyperpoliticized climate, Jeremy W. Peters writes. Moderators have been deemed fair game for criticism before they have asked even a single question.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Task Force Takes Aim at JPMorgan

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase is facing fresh claims related to Bear Stearns. | You can have too much money, at least if you're a private equity firm. | The S.E.C. and high-frequency trading. | Bain Capital's offshore arrangements limited Romney's tax bill -- and increased his income. 

 BODY:
Mortgage Task Force Targets JPMorgan | Those financial crisis deals just keep coming back to haunt banks. Last week, Bank of America settled a lawsuit over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Now, JPMorgan Chase is facing fresh claims related to Bear Stearns.
The federal task force formed to investigate mortgage fraud has sued Bear Stearns and its lending unit, EMC Mortgage, the first case brought by the federal group, The New York Times reports. The civil lawsuit, according to The Times, cites "a broad pattern of misconduct in the packaging and sale of mortgage securities during the housing boom."
The accusations are hardly new. A JPMorgan spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti, called them "recycled claims." But others, like Gerald H. Silk, a lawyer at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, welcomed the lawsuit. "The government's action represents a complete validation of the cases brought by investors," Mr. Silk said.
The government announced the resolution of another case on Monday: American Express agreed to refund $85 million to about 250,000 customers to settle accusations that it violated federal law in its marketing, billing and debt collection, The New York Times reports. The settlement is another milestone for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recently reached a similar pact with Discover Financial Services, and also took action against Capital One over the summer.
Too Much Dry Powder | You can have too much money, at least if you are a private equity firm. The industry is sitting on a collective $1 trillion - money that investors may demand back if it's not used soon, writes Andrew Ross Sorkin in the DealBook column. The so-called dry powder could signal a surge of deal-making, if firms can find the right prey. Mr. Sorkin writes: "Some private equity firms have put the word out to Wall Street banks that they want to go 'elephant hunting' - seeking big deals worth as much as $10 billion - and are willing to pay a special bounty for bringing them acquisition targets." Of course, it could also signal a spate of bad deal-making as firms chase acquisitions.
Still, the industry keeps trying to drum up more money. Private equity firms amassed more than $64 billion from investors in the third quarter, 10 percent more than in the period a year earlier, Reuters reports, citing data from the research firm Preqin.
High-Frequency Trading Under a Microscope | How can we prevent blowups when high-speed traders rule the stock market? The Securities and Exchange Commission will discuss the issue at a conference on Tuesday in Washington. Among the panelists is Chris Isaacson, chief operating officer of BATS Global Markets. Though many are pushing for new rules for high-frequency trading, there is little agreement on what exactly those rules should be. The author Roger Lowenstein proposes in a column in The New York Times that "intraday trades should be taxed at 50 percent. And 'investments' that mature in 60 seconds should be regarded as, in effect, electronic errors - with any profit going to the government."
On the Agenda | Day two of the Value Investing Congress features David Einhorn at 10:30 a.m. At past conferences, Mr. Einhorn, the Greenlight Capital president, has showcased short-selling ideas, which have been known to move stocks. The subject of a recent New Yorker article, Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors, is on CNBC at 12:30 p.m. Larry Ellison, the Oracle chief executive, is on CNBC at 4:05.
Lawyers for Kazuo Okada, the ousted shareholder of Wynn Resorts, are appearing in a Nevada court on Tuesday to try to overturn the forced redemption of Mr. Okada's stake.
Bain Capital's Offshore Havens | They are the gifts that keep on giving. Bain Capital's offshore arrangements - which are "woven" into the fabric of the private equity firm's deal-making - not only limited Mitt Romney's tax bill, they also increased his income, according to The New York Times: "Some of the offshore entities enabled Bain-owned companies to sidestep certain taxes, increasing returns for Mr. Romney and other investors. Others helped Bain attract foreign investors and nonprofit institutions by insulating them from taxes, again augmenting Mr. Romney's bottom line, since he shared in management fees based on the size of each Bain fund."
Law Firms Woo Start-Up Clients | Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the half-century-old law firm, is trying to be hip and cool. The firm's new office in San Francisco has the look and feel of a start-up, part of a broader strategy to attract young technology companies to its fold, writes DealBook's Evelyn M. Rusli. Wilson Sonsini and its rivals are "offering free services, cozying up to incubators and writing blogs" in an effort to secure business that could pay off big down the road.
Merrill Looking to Pounce on Morgan Stanley | Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit is looking to poach brokers from the newly rebranded Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, The Wall Street Journal reports. The most sought-after financial advisers could make at least $1.5 million upfront plus deferred compensation for jumping ship, according to The Journal, which cites unidentified people familiar with Merrill's recruiting. Merrill Lynch, the newspaper says, is "pushing to capitalize on technological and reputational blows at Morgan Stanley."

Too Much Dry Powder | You can have too much money, at least if you are a private equity firm. The industry is sitting on a collective $1 trillion - money that investors may demand back if it's not used soon, writes Andrew Ross Sorkin in the DealBook column. The so-called dry powder could signal a surge of deal-making, if firms can find the right prey. Mr. Sorkin writes: "Some private equity firms have put the word out to Wall Street banks that they want to go 'elephant hunting' - seeking big deals worth as much as $10 billion - and are willing to pay a special bounty for bringing them acquisition targets." Of course, it could also signal a spate of bad deal-making as firms chase acquisitions.
Still, the industry keeps trying to drum up more money. Private equity firms amassed more than $64 billion from investors in the third quarter, 10 percent more than in the period a year earlier, Reuters reports, citing data from the research firm Preqin.
High-Frequency Trading Under a Microscope | How can we prevent blowups when high-speed traders rule the stock market? The Securities and Exchange Commission will discuss the issue at a conference on Tuesday in Washington. Among the panelists is Chris Isaacson, chief operating officer of BATS Global Markets. Though many are pushing for new rules for high-frequency trading, there is little agreement on what exactly those rules should be. The author Roger Lowenstein proposes in a column in The New York Times that "intraday trades should be taxed at 50 percent. And 'investments' that mature in 60 seconds should be regarded as, in effect, electronic errors - with any profit going to the government."
On the Agenda | Day two of the Value Investing Congress features David Einhorn at 10:30 a.m. At past conferences, Mr. Einhorn, the Greenlight Capital president, has showcased short-selling ideas, which have been known to move stocks. The subject of a recent New Yorker article, Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors, is on CNBC at 12:30 p.m. Larry Ellison, the Oracle chief executive, is on CNBC at 4:05.
Lawyers for Kazuo Okada, the ousted shareholder of Wynn Resorts, are appearing in a Nevada court on Tuesday to try to overturn the forced redemption of Mr. Okada's stake.
Bain Capital's Offshore Havens | They are the gifts that keep on giving. Bain Capital's offshore arrangements - which are "woven" into the fabric of the private equity firm's deal-making - not only limited Mitt Romney's tax bill, they also increased his income, according to The New York Times: "Some of the offshore entities enabled Bain-owned companies to sidestep certain taxes, increasing returns for Mr. Romney and other investors. Others helped Bain attract foreign investors and nonprofit institutions by insulating them from taxes, again augmenting Mr. Romney's bottom line, since he shared in management fees based on the size of each Bain fund."
Law Firms Woo Start-Up Clients | Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the half-century-old law firm, is trying to be hip and cool. The firm's new office in San Francisco has the look and feel of a start-up, part of a broader strategy to attract young technology companies to its fold, writes DealBook's Evelyn M. Rusli. Wilson Sonsini and its rivals are "offering free services, cozying up to incubators and writing blogs" in an effort to secure business that could pay off big down the road.
Merrill Looking to Pounce on Morgan Stanley | Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit is looking to poach brokers from the newly rebranded Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, The Wall Street Journal reports. The most sought-after financial advisers could make at least $1.5 million upfront plus deferred compensation for jumping ship, according to The Journal, which cites unidentified people familiar with Merrill's recruiting. Merrill Lynch, the newspaper says, is "pushing to capitalize on technological and reputational blows at Morgan Stanley."

HEADLINE: Thiel Fund Leads Investment in Brazilian Start-Up

BYLINE: VINOD SREEHARSHA


HIGHLIGHT: Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures Management has made its first foray in Brazil, leading an investment in an e-commerce start-up that is trying to shake up the traditional furniture market here and take on an established retailer recently acquired by the Carlyle Group. 

 BODY:
SÃO PAULO, Brazil - Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures Management has made its first foray in Brazil, leading an investment in an e-commerce start-up that is trying to shake up the traditional furniture market here and take on an established retailer recently acquired by the Carlyle Group. 
Oppa, a design and furniture e-commerce company based in São Paulo, recently closed on $10.47 million in financing, according to securities filings. Mr. Thiel's Valar led the round. 
Oppa was founded by Max Reichel, a German expatriate. A former McKinsey consultant with an M.B.A. from Harvard, Mr. Reichel is trying to bridge e-commerce with design, selling products the company itself creates while also expanding opportunities for designers. 
Founded last year, the company initially raised $2.36 million, according to filings. Monashees Capital, based in São Paulo, Kaszek Ventures and Thrive Capital invested in that round. They also joined the recent one led by Valar, according to Mr. Reichel. 
Representatives of Valar, which for now appears to invest Mr. Thiel's own capital, first visited Brazil in March, according to a partner, Andrew McCormack, and have since made four or five more visits. 
Mr. McCormack said he first met Mr. Reichel in March at a Founders Forum event in Rio de Janeiro, and was drawn to his "very dogged determination" and what Mr. McCormack called typical founders' experiences - including maxing out his credit card and crashing on his friend's couch while getting started. 
Even with the new investment, Mr. Reichel still has his work cut out for him. The giant brick-and-mortar furniture retailer Tok & Stok recently sold 60 percent of the company to the Carlyle Group for about $347 million.
Tok & Stok has been slow to migrate online, but once Brazilian regulatory authorities approve the deal, the company plans to "pay more attention" to e-commerce, said Daniel Sterenberg, a director with Carlyle's buyout team for Latin America.
"We want to focus and invest more in Tok & Stok's online channel as part of our growth plans," Mr. Sterenberg said. 
Other retailers are likely to do the same. 
While Oppa is Valar's first Brazilian investment, Mr. Thiel has indirectly made at least one other, investing in 2010 in the first institutional fund of Felicis Ventures. That fund, based in Palo Alto, Calif., invested in two financing rounds for Baby, an e-commerce site for baby products based in São Paulo. 
Given Brazil's high taxes, vexing regulations and pro-labor laws, at first glance the country would appear to be an unusual market for Mr. Thiel, who is an avowed libertarian. Brazil was No. 48 in the latest World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness ranking, behind Estonia, Panama and the Czech Republic. That was a slight improvement from 2011, when it was No. 53. 
Still, Mr. McCormack said that if Valar put too much weight on regulatory factors and macroeconomic risks, the firm would be forced to rule out too many companies and countries. 
"Even though Brazil has many layers of government, among the BRICs it is quite a good place to do business," he said, referring to Brazil, Russia, India and China.

HEADLINE: Revisiting President Obama's Small-Business Tax Cut Claims

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A reader asks whether the Obama administration really has cut small-business taxes 18 times. 

 BODY:
This summer, the number 18 has crept into President Obama's campaign speeches -- as in, "We've cut taxes for small businesses 18 times." (That's from a speech in Melbourne, Fla., last month.) The first lady, Michelle Obama, mentions it, too. And, of course, it came up frequently at the Democratic National Convention a few weeks ago, where it caught the attention of a regular You're The Boss commenter who calls himself Einstein. (No, not that Einstein.)
"Which small businesses had their taxes cut?" Einsteinrecently asked. "Hate to be skeptical but I know a lot of small-business owners and independent contractors and they never heard of ANY tax cuts. All this talk of helping small business from both political parties sounds like lip service. What are the facts?" 
Happy to oblige, Einstein. Back in 2010, when the administration's boast was that it had merely cut taxes 16 times, The Agenda wrote a post about it. Here are the White House's 16 "tax cuts."
From the 2009 stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, and other legislation:
 A new small-business health care tax credit.
 A tax credit for hiring unemployed workers in 2010.
 Temporary extension of bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment.
 75 percent exclusion of small-business capital gains, for stock acquired in 2009 and 2010.
 Temporary expansion of limits on small-business expensing.
 Five-year carryback of net operating losses, available through fall 2009.
 Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses to seven years, from 10, in 2009 and 2010.
 Temporary small-business estimated tax payment relief. Tax provisions in the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act (both The Agenda and the I.R.S. have published summaries):
 100 percent exclusion of small-business capital gains, for stock acquired in late 2010 and 2011.
 A further increase to the expensing limit to $500,000 for 2011 (in 2012, the limit falls to $139,000).
 A further extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation through 2010.
 A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed in 2010.
 Tax relief and simplification for cellphone deductions.
 An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs' start-up expenses in 2010.
 A five-year carry-back of general business credits in 2010.
 Lower penalties for failing to report listed (that is, abusive) tax shelters.
Since then, the president has added two more tax cuts to the list, according to a Small Business Administration spokeswoman, who supplied an update:
 Increasing bonus depreciation to 100 percent for 2011 (from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, the compromise law that keeps the Bush income tax cuts in place through this year; for 2012, bonus depreciation falls to 50 percent and then expires).
 Tax credits for hiring veterans, ranging from $2,400 to $9,600 (from the Veterans Opportunity to Work to Hire Heroes Act of 2011).
As you can see, some of these aren't tax cuts in the way many people would define them. Rather, they're tax incentives - you've got to spend money (on health insurance, a new employee or new equipment) to save money. Several are improvements or extensions of previous tax incentives. (By that score, some other measures could also be counted as tax cuts, but don't appear on the administration's list - for example, the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act further reduced the built-in gains period to five years for an asset sold in the 2011 tax year.) And, of course, most were temporary, and have already expired.
So has the president really cut taxes 18 (or more) times? We've reported - now you decide.

HEADLINE: A Campaign Without a Plan

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: An immigration shift exposes the Romney campaign's lack of strategic thinking. 

 BODY:
Yesterday, Mitt Romney finally stopped dodging a question he'd evaded for months, and stated that if elected president, he wouldn't undo the visas for younger illegal immigrants that President Obama made available by executive fiat earlier this year. It's a repositioning that's likely to be swallowed up by the coverage of tomorrow night's debate, but it's worth pausing over because of how perfectly it crystallizes the strategic ineffectiveness of the Romney campaign.
Immigration is an issue where Republican politicians are often urged to move to "the center" - that is, adopt a pro-amnesty position - in order to win over Hispanic voters alienated by anti-immigration rhetoric. At the same time, it's an issue where the more conservative, restrictionist position is often shared by a different bloc of swing voters: The kind of working class whites whose support Romney has been struggling (and struggling, and struggling) to win. There are potential political benefits, in other words, to branding yourself as the candidate of compassion toward illegal immigrants, as George W. Bush persistently did. But then again there are also potential benefits - sometimes greater ones, in my view - to taking a more restrictionist position and using the issue to portray the Democrats as beholden to their party's ethnic interest groups and out of step with blue collar Americans' concerns.
There's nothing whatsoever to be gained, however, by doing what Romney has done, which is to act evasive on a hot-button issue for months on end before finally, grudgingly, issuing a defensive quasi-endorsement of your opponent's gambit. When the White House announced its policy change, Romney could have attacked the president for bending the rule of law to suit the demands of Democratic coalition politics, or alternatively he could have embraced the DREAM Act himself to pivot away from the hard line he took during the Republican primary campaign. Either move, if finessed effectively, might have helped him with a crucial bloc of voters. But by doing neither, and basically ducking the issue until this late-in-the-game concession, he enabled the White House to reap all of the benefits of its backdoor amnesty without paying any political price at all.
You can see the same pattern in health care. Romney made a point, throughout the primary season, of standing by his Massachusetts health care plan: Indeed, Noam Scheiber has reported that one reason Stuart Stevens got the job running the campaign is that Stevens was the only consultant who promised Romney he could win the nomination without formally disavowing Romneycare. Now, I thought at the time that this was a mistake, and that Romney could have threaded the needle more effectively by disavowing parts of his health care bill while defending others. But that was the strategy they chose, and it actually worked: He won the Republican nomination without having to repudiate his signature policy accomplishment as governor.
You would think, then, that having taken this risk and succeeded, the Romney campaign would try to capitalize on their success by weaving his health care record, in some form, into their general election pitch. And every once in a while that has happened: Romney finds himself talking about health care in an interview, and he'll say something like, "don't forget - I got everybody in my state insured." But there's no consistency to this message, no policy substance that it's tied to, no sense that the people in Boston ever sat down and war-gamed out anything like a clear narrative on one of the most important domestic issues of our time. (Nor, on the other hand, has there been anything like a sustained critique of the president's health care law either.) Instead, the campaign's policy messaging seems entirely ad hoc: Now right-wing, now centrist, with no clear plan for how to actually shape the debate, rather than just reacting to it.
Running a presidential campaign and selling a consistent message isn't easy, obviously. But neither is it nearly as difficult as the Romney campaign has made it seem. You pick some issues that play well with your base, pick some issues where you want to move to the center, write a script with these choices in mind and do your best to stick to it. Of course events intervene and the script sometimes has to be rewritten. But on immigration, health care and indeed just about every topic worth mentioning, the Romney camp apparently decided that the weakness of the economy meant that they didn't need a clear script at all, and that they could get by with evasions and improvisations instead. On the evidence of current polling, they were wrong.

HEADLINE: Republicans Seize On Biden's 'Middle Class' Remark

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans said that a remark by the vice president highlights the struggles of the middle class under President Obama. 

 BODY:
A stray sentence by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday became the latest remark seized by the opposition and turned into a blistering line of attack against him. 
After Mr. Biden described the middle class as having "been buried the last four years,'' Republicans pounced, treating it as an unwitting admission of President Obama's failures.
The vice president was criticizing the Republican ticket for pursuing a tax overhaul that would raise taxes on the middle class, he said.
"How can they justify raising taxes on the middle class that's been buried the last four years?'' Mr. Biden said at a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C.
The Republican barrage came fast and furious by Twitter message, news release and campaign conference call. It began with a Twitter message from Mitt Romney's account: 
Agree with @joebiden, the middle class has been buried the last 4 years, which is why we need a change in November #CantAfford4More
- Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 2, 2012
Campaigning in Iowa, Representative Paul D. Ryan reinforced the message. "Of course the middle class has been buried,'' he said. "They're being buried by regulations; they're being buried by taxes; they're being buried by borrowing. They're being buried by the Obama administration's economic failures."
The Romney-Ryan campaign even held an afternoon press call with one of its fiercest surrogates, John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor, to drive home the theme. 
Republicans seemed to seize on the remark with special fervor, coming as it did one day before the first debate between Mr. Romney and President Obama, in which the cost of Mr. Romney's proposed tax cuts for the rich and his disparagement of 47 percent of Americans who don't pay income taxes are sure to be topics of discussion. 
In response, the Obama campaign called the attacks "desperate and out of context.'' 
"As the vice president has been saying all year and again in his remarks today, the middle class was punished by the failed Bush policies that crashed our economy,'' a spokeswoman, Lis Smith, said. 
In his North Carolina remarks, Mr. Biden was citing, as the Democrats have for months, an independent study that found that cutting tax rates by 20 percent and closing loopholes to avoid increasing the deficit, as Mr. Romney proposes, could be done only by raising taxes on households earning less than $200,000.
The audience booed. 
"No, no - all kidding aside,'' Mr. Biden said. "With all the boos - I mean, we can stop all that malarkey. Look, guys, this is deadly earnest, man. This is deadly earnest. How can they justify raising taxes on the middle class that's been buried the last four years? How in the Lord's name can they justify raising their taxes with these tax cuts?''
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan dispute the accuracy of the study, by the Tax Policy Center, and they have cited studies of their own showing their tax plan will not hit the middle class.
The maladroit sentence was the latest in a long series this year that have been yanked from context and used by the opposition, including Mr. Romney's remark that he "liked to fire people" and Mr. Obama's comment that "you didn't build that.'' 
Later in the day, Mr. Biden clarified his meaning. "The middle class was buried by the policies that Romney and Ryan have supported," he told a crowd in Asheville, N.C.

HEADLINE: In Market Rebound, a Windfall for Wall Street Executives

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: In the depths of the financial crisis, banks were encouraged to compensate executives through long-term options and stock incentives, which are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 

 BODY:
Some four years after the financial crisis, many are still feeling the ill effects. But big bank executives are not among this unfortunate group, compensation data shows.
The executives who headed financial institutions in those uncertain times of early 2009, when markets and banks were being supported by the federal government, are now in line to receive windfall compensation in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
What did they do to deserve such a reward? It's hard to justify and it goes a long way toward explaining the persistent anger toward Wall Street. And we have the government partly to blame for it.
 A large part of the reason is simply lucky timing.
In the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 and 20009, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was touching below 700, bank executives were granted millions in options and stock incentives valued at incredibly low stock prices. The banks were encouraged to offer this compensation because of the restrictions in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which in many circumstances prohibited the payment of bonuses other than in long-term restricted stock. As a result, companies awarded more equity than they otherwise would have at the time.
Since then, the stock market has returned to near the level it was before the financial crisis, making those options and stock very valuable.
To determine how large the windfall is, I asked Equilar, an executive compensation data firm, to compile the value of stock and options granted to the top five executives at each of the 18 largest American financial institutions - those that underwent stress tests in those years. (Ally Bank also received a stress test but was excluded because it was not public at the time). I also asked Equilar to determine what the packages were worth now, assuming the executives had held on to the stock and options.
It's a stupendous amount.
The top executives at those 18 financial institutions received an aggregate of $142 million in stock and options from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. It was a lot then, but these stock and options are now worth $457 million, an increase of $330 million, or 221 percent. On average, that is roughly $4 million per executive who received such compensation.
Individually, some of the gains are even more breathtaking. Take American Express and its chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault. In 2007, before the financial crisis, American Express was trading for years at $50 to $60. Then the crisis hit, and in six months the stock fell below $10 a share.
In January 2009, American Express granted its top five executives stock options with a strike price of $16.71, which Equilar values at $7.63 million. According to American Express's public disclosure, Mr. Chenault received the largest grant of 1,196,888 options.
American Express stock is now back to about $57 a share. And that equity package is up 1,097 percent and valued at $91.36 million. Mr. Chenault's option package alone is now valued at almost $50 million.
That's a nice payday. Can anyone argue that it is owed to the executive's performance rather than to a recovery in the stock market?
American Express did not respond to requests for comment.
The biggest dollar winners are the executives of Capital One. According to Equilar, the credit card company's top five executives received an incentive pay package granted in 2009 valued at $19.9 million. The package is now worth $114 million. The reason for the huge compensation package: Capital One's options were granted at a price of $18.28 during the financial crisis. . Yet, Capital One's stock price is trading at almost $60 a share, below its precrisis price of around $80.
A Capital One spokesman said that the compensation was justified because Capital One "delivered solid results in 2009." The spokesman added that Equilar's figures did not account for the fact that some Capital One executives had already exercised their options. According to Capital One, if these exercises were taken into account, the package's value would be $87 million instead, still a fantastic amount.
All told, eight of these 18 firms, including Wells Fargo and SunTrust banks, gave executive pay packages during the financial crisis that are now more than 200 percent higher in value. Four of these financial institutions - BB&T, U.S. Bancorp, Capital One and American Express - awarded pay packages that are up more than 400 percent. Almost all of this value is attributable simply to the stock market's recovery.
And some of these packages reward what frankly appears to be poor performance. The top five executives of Fifth Third Bancorp received a pay package that is now 253 percent higher in value despite Fifth Third's stock being about a third its precrisis value.
How could this happen, you may ask?
The bank executives who stood to make the most were those who were paid more in options than in stock. Options provide greater gains when the stock goes up and so are increasingly in disfavor. For example, Equilar calculates that the options granted to the Capital One executives are up 838 percent, or almost $70 million, while the stock component is up only 212 percent, or about $25 million. You won't be surprised to hear that American Express's total 2009 incentive compensation was paid all in options.
Another explanation is that many of the financial institutions did not adjust the dollar amount of their financial compensation paid that year to take into account the stock market drop. In other words, the banks paid the same dollar amounts but had to grant more options and stock to meet this number because of the low price.
If you are shaking your head, you should know that these numbers are only for the top five executives at these companies. Lower-ranked employees who received equity compensation, which is largely undisclosed, may have also received such a windfall.
Indeed, The New York Times reported in 2010 that the partners and employees of Goldman Sachs had received a substantial equity grant of 36 million stock options during the financial crisis. And of course, this excess compensation was awarded at many other, smaller banks.
Taken together, this is a sobering view of executive compensation. It shows how compensation can have little to do with performance and more with stock market movements and the luck of having options granted instead of less valuable stock. More tellingly, it also shows how the government most likely enriched financial executives by pushing banks to award more equity compensation through TARP than they otherwise would have.
The sad thing is that these executives were compensated not because of the work they did at their firms, but because of a lucky rise in the stock market. It is anything but pay for performance. And yes, if the financial crisis had not occurred, they were likely to have been much poorer otherwise. It's no wonder Main Street is still seething.
JPMorgan Chase plans to disclose part of the total losses on a bungled trade.

HEADLINE: In JPMorgan Suit, a Lack of New News

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The lawsuit filed by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of New York against JPMorgan Chase over flawed mortgage-backed securities contains little new information about Wall Street's practices. 

 BODY:
The lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against JPMorgan Chase for flawed mortgage-backed securities issued by Bear Stearns arrives a bit late in the game.
It is the first case to emerge from the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, led by Mr. Schneiderman, which was formed in January. 
Yet it contains little new information about how Wall Street bundled together several poorly underwritten subprime mortgages and sold them to investors on the promise that they were safe investments. And as a civil case, it may result in a finding of a violation, but that would come only after years of discovery and legal maneuvering.
 Indeed, the complaint filed by Mr. Schneiderman quotes information from, among other sources, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's report issued two years ago to show how mortgage underwriting standards were largely ignored by Bear Stearns.
The claimed losses from the instruments issued in 2006 and 2007 total approximately $22.5 billion. That is not insignificant but hardly makes Bear Stearns the worst offender, or a unique actor in this area.
A number of similar lawsuits have been filed claiming that Wall Street firms failed to conduct anything close to the due diligence they promised in their offering materials for securities that lost billions of dollars in value when the mortgage market collapsed.
For example, the National Credit Union Administration is pursuing claims against a number of large banks, including JPMorgan, for losses from the residential mortgage-backed securities bought by credit unions before the financial crisis, and has already settled with others for $170 million. 
A Justice Departmentpress release noted that it helped in the New York case by reviewing "more than 50 deposition transcripts taken in other litigation for significant evidence."
What sets this complaint apart is that it is not limited to just a few particular transactions. Unlike private investors who can file claims only for the specific securities they bought, Mr. Schneiderman assails the entire residential M.B.S. operation at Bear Stearns as designed to cater to the mortgage originators who supplied it with product to package than with protecting the buyers of the securities it was churning out.
The lawsuit cites the typically vulgar or callous e-mails that seem to be a staple of Wall Street's sales culture as evidence of Bear Stearns's disregard for the buyers. One internal e-mail described a securitization in scatological terms, while another sought to "close this dog" because it looked like a "going out of business sale."
The most interesting claim is not that Bear Stearns had faulty underwriting and due diligence - that is hardly a surprise as firms did their best to push out mortgage bonds while the market remained hot. It is the allegation that the firm settled claims about bad mortgages that were put into its securities by taking payments from the mortgage originators and then keeping the money for itself rather than passing it on to the securities holders. 
If true, that goes beyond just shoddy practices to something much more akin to theft by keeping payments that did not belong to the firm. 
How much money may be involved is not clear, however, and Bear Stearns's dealings with the mortgage originators might not have been improper if it accounted for the funds under the requirements of the securities offering documents.
The decision to pursue civil charges under New York's Martin Act means that the state's attorney general will not have to prove fraudulent intent, only that the firm was negligent in making any false or misleading disclosures. While easier to prove, that also indicates that the evidence to prove fraud was not strong enough to bring more serious charges. 
Like so many cases related to the financial crisis, no individuals are named in the complaint. Nor does it appear that any criminal charges will emerge this long after Bear Stearns was pushed into the arms of JPMorgan by the federal government in a transaction routinely described as a fire sale. 
Even naming JPMorgan as a defendant is a bit of a misnomer because the bank was not involved in the misconduct in securitizing questionable subprime mortgages. So any penalty that might be imposed would simply add to the costs of the merger rather than constitute any real punishment of a wrongdoer.
There is a chance the case will go to trial, but I think that likelihood is small. As a spokesman for JPMorgan stated, "We're disappointed that the New York A.G. decided to pursue its civil action without ever offering us an opportunity to rebut the claims and without developing a full record - instead relying on recycled claims already made by private plaintiffs."
Those are not really fighting words from a company that believes it has been unfairly accused. The complaint has little to do with the JPMorgan's current operations, so the case will probably settle once the two sides can come up with a suitable amount to be paid, because there are no remedial measures that would have to be put in place. And that may be all there is to the case.

HEADLINE: Ads Attack Wall Street Ties, No Matter How Flimsy

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Candidates are trying to gain an edge by linking their opponents to bailouts and banking, no matter how flimsy the connection may be. 

 BODY:
Wall Street has taken a beating this election season. Yet what is considered to be Wall Street may be surprising.
Take Keith J. Rothfus, a Republican candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania. A lawyer at a small firm, he specializes in drafting software-licensing agreements. While unglamorous, it helps pay the bills.
Among the clients he has represented is Bank of New York Mellon, which has a large presence in western Pennsylvania. Two commercials backed by Democratic groups are attacking Mr. Rothfus's relationship with his banking client.
 "Millionaire Wall Street lawyer Keith Rothfus will fit right in in Washington," said the narrator of one of the ads. The spot shows a plunging stock market and a grim-looking Mr. Rothfus entering what looks to be a bank. Over ominous music, the narrator goes on: "As a wealthy attorney, Keith Rothfus represented a Wall Street bank that received a bailout from taxpayers."
In an interview, Mr. Rothfus called the ad "deceitful, shameful and outrageous." He said that while BNY Mellon took bailout funds, his work for the company - most of which predates Bank of New York's 2006 takeover of Mellon Financial of Pittsburgh - had no connection to the financial crisis.
"I'm a Stanwix Street lawyer, not a Wall Street lawyer," Mr. Rothfus said, referring to his firm's downtown Pittsburgh address. "I visited Wall Street once, in 1980, as a tourist at the New York Stock Exchange. If I'm a Wall Street lawyer, then the 7,500 people that work for Mellon bank in western Pennsylvania are fast-money traders who charter private jets to the Hamptons on weekends."
As campaigns enter their final month, a number of candidates are flooding the airwaves with advertisements demonizing Wall Street. From the presidential race to local Congressional contests, from Montana to New Mexico, candidates - both Democrats and Republicans - are relentlessly attacking their opponents by linking them to bankers and bailouts, no matter how tenuous the connection.
"Candidates are bashing each other over the heads for being in Wall Street's back pocket," said Elizabeth Wilner of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. "Wall Street is this campaign season's punching bag, and it's bipartisan and it's escalating."
In the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis, Heather A. Wilson, then a Republican congresswoman from New Mexico, voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which provided rescue funds to banks. Four years later, Ms. Wilson - a former Air Force officer - is running for the United States Senate. An opponent's ad assails what it characterizes as her deep ties to Wall Street.
"As a congresswoman from New Mexico, it wasn't Heather Wilson's job to represent Wall Street banks," said the narrator in a spot paid for by a liberal super PAC. The ad shows a series of dark, shadowy Manhattan office towers - those of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. "But she voted time and again to give them special tax breaks, and then voted to bail them out."
In Montana, the incumbent, Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat, is facing a fierce challenge from the state's sole congressman, Denny Rehberg. Mr. Tester, who has received substantial money from executives in the financial industry, has boasted in television spots that he "opposed all of those Wall Street bailouts." Mr. Rehberg also voted against the bank bailout. So instead of focusing on TARP, ads pummel Mr. Rehberg for his longtime support for privatizing Social Security - in other words, putting retirement funds in the hands of Wall Street money managers.
One of the ads features the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and an electronic ticker showing shares in a nose dive. The narration features voices of market commentators: "A wild ride on Wall Street ... the biggest point drop ... a precipitous fall ... these guys have been gambling ... gambling ... bad bets ... they didn't know when to back away. A gamble. That's Congressman Denny Rehberg's plan for Social Security."
Josh Mandel, the Republican Ohio state treasurer running for United State Senate as a Washington outsider, has an ad that goes after members of Congress on both sides of the aisle for supporting the bailout.
"Every Democrat and every Republican who took our tax dollars and used them to bail out Wall Street banks was dead wrong," Mr. Mandel says in the spot, speaking in an angry tone to a group of factory workers. "It was fiscally irresponsible. It was morally wrong."
The presidential candidates have also criticized one another for their Wall Street ties. Ads for President Obama have homed in on Mr. Romney's leadership of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he started. By focusing on private equity - a specific pocket of the financial industry - Mr. Obama has largely avoided a broader critique of Wall Street, where he has raised millions of dollars. On Monday, the Obama campaign announced a new ad that links Bain to a company outsourced American jobs.
Republicans, meanwhile, depict Mr. Obama as a pawn of the financial services industry. One advertisement from the conservative organization American Future Fund titled "Obama's Wall Street" highlights Mr. Obama's vote in favor of TARP when he was a United States senator running for president and says that his cabinet is full of financiers. Another, called "Justice for Sale," suggests that campaign contributions from the banking industry explain why the administration has not prosecuted more executives relating to their conduct during the financial crisis.
"Under Obama, Wall Street keeps winning, and Obama keeps taking their cash," the narrator says. "Tell Obama to stop protecting his Wall Street donors."
Mr. Rothfus, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania, is locked in a tight race with his opponent, the Democratic incumbent Mark S. Critz. He has countered the attack ads with humorous "Keith Rothfus is a regular guy" 30-second spots. In one, he is shown gardening in his modest front yard, driving his kids around town and repairing his daughter's bicycle.
In response, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees has produced an ad that starts, "Regular guy? Hardly. Keith Rothfus is a millionaire attorney for a Wall Street bank." Banner headlines of the BNY Mellon's $3 billion bailout run across the screen.
Mr. Rothfus, who lives in Sewickley, Pa., with his wife and six children, has worked as a corporate lawyer since graduating from Notre Dame Law School in 1980. For the last 15 years he has practiced on and off at Yukevich, Marchetti, Liekar & Zangrilli, a 12-lawyer firm. He earned about $125,000 last year. His assignments for BNY Mellon constitute a tiny portion of his overall practice, which focuses on small- and medium-size businesses.
"I've never done anything close to securities work for Mellon, never came close to those C.D.O.'s," said Mr. Rothfus, referring to collateralized debt obligations, the complex mortgage instruments that contributed to the near collapse of the financial system. "I've never even done an I.P.O."
Spokesmen for organizations behind the attack ads against Mr. Rothfus - the Democratic House Majority PAC and Afscme - said that they stood behind the ads.
Despite Mr. Rothfus's modest salary - top Wall Street lawyers earn substantial seven-figure salaries - the millionaire epithet is accurate. That comes courtesy of his wife, the daughter of a successful Pittsburgh businessman. Based on his most recent financial disclosure, Mr. Rothfus's total assets, including those of his wife, range from $5.1 million to $13.9 million.
With clean-cut looks and wire-rimmed glasses, Mr. Rothfus does look the part of a button-down Wall Street lawyer. But he is quick to point out that he favors Brooks Brothers off-the-rack suits instead of the bespoke variety and prefers Land's End neckwear to Hermès ties.
"There were certain individuals on Wall Street who were reckless and betrayed our trust," he said. "But I wasn't one of them."

HEADLINE: What Mitt Should Tell the 47 Percent

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: On taxes, health care and Medicare reform, Romney should strike a more populist note. 

 BODY:
Going into Wednesday's debate, there's one poll number that Mitt Romney should be most worried about. It's not the tracking polls, or the RealClearPolitics polling average, or any of the usual measurements. It's the percentage of Americans who believe that his policies will favor the rich over the poor and the middle class.
In the latest New York Times/CBS poll, nearly 60 percent of respondents in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania said that Romney's plans would mostly help the wealthy. Less than ten percent said the same of President Obama.
A tour of coal-mining country in southern Ohio by the Atlantic's Molly Ball produced some vivid anecdotes that illustrate this data. "Those opposed to Obama cited various reasons," she wrote, "from disappointment to anger to being convinced he's a Muslim. But the impressions of Romney were remarkably consistent: He's for the rich."
Journalists have even found working class voters who believe that Obama is a secret Muslim and intend to vote for him anyway, because - as one Virginian put it - "at least he wasn't brought up filthy rich."
This assumption - that the wealthy Republican candidate is inevitably a candidate for the wealthy as well - is a big part of what's been killing Romney's campaign. Because of the president's advantages with minority voters and younger voters, Romney has always needed to perform well with economically-anxious whites - and above all with non-college-educated white voters across the Midwest.
Instead, he's underperforming. He's winning white working class voters in the South but only breaking even with them elsewhere, sometimes up, sometimes down. He's losing blue-collar white women, who often lean Republican, by wide margins in the swing states. These are groups that have taken an economic beating under President Obama - who have been "buried," as Joe Biden acknowledged at a campaign stop in North Carolina this week, by bad job numbers and declining incomes. But they haven't broken for Romney, because he hasn't found a way to reassure them that he isn't just the candidate of people like himself - and then because his infamous "47 percent" comment confirmed their worst fears about his candidacy.
A smarter Republican campaign would have recognized early that this would be Romney's biggest problem, and showed a more populist side from the beginning. As I've argued before, Romney could have embraced the assistance for underwater homeowners sketched out by his own economic adviser, Glenn Hubbard, or the break-up-the-big-banks reform championed by the American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukis, or the family-friendly tax reform promoted by National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru.
Maybe the time for such creativity has passed. But even within the conventionally conservative policy framework that Romney has adopted, and within the constraints of a prime-time debate, there's room to offer hard-strapped Americans more than just the promise of further sacrifice to come.
Here are some examples of what Romney might say tonight, if reassuring working class voters were actually his most important goal. On taxes, for instance, his argument should go something like this:
My goal is lower rates across the board, so that all Americans can keep more of their paycheck every month. But let me make this promise now: Whatever shape tax reform ultimately takes, under my administration, no middle or working class American will pay a penny more in taxes than they do today. Not a penny more. And to prove that I'm serious about protecting working families, tonight I'm calling for a four-year extension of the payroll tax cut, so that Americans don't have to worry about seeing their tax bills go up an average of $1000 when the cut expires next year. President Obama hasn't taken a position on this issue, because he doesn't mind if your taxes go up so long as he gets to spend the money. But if I'm president, I'll protect your paychecks, and stop this tax increase in its tracks.
On health care, Romney could say something like this:
We're going to repeal Obamacare: It taxes too much, cuts Medicare too deeply, pours more money into a broken system and piles on regulations that will keep driving costs up and up and up. But tonight I want to speak to Americans who don't have health insurance, or struggle to pay for it, and make this pledge: Under my administration, you will not be forgotten. I promise to create a tax credit, worth thousands of dollars, to help people who don't get insurance through their employers. I promise to expand high-risk pools where people with pre-existing conditions could get coverage more cheaply than they do today. When I was governor of Massachusetts, we cut the number of uninsured by more than half. Tonight, I'm setting the same goal as president - and we don't need a government takeover of health care to do it.
On Medicare reform, he could say this:
The reality is that Medicare is going broke, putting our promise to our parents and grandparents at risk, and the Obama White House hasn't done anything about it. If you want your Medicare to suddenly disappear in five or ten years time, then by all means, vote for the president. But if you want the program saved, I promise to do exactly that. Not by cutting benefits for existing seniors, the way this president has done. Not by putting a team of bureaucrats in charge of figuring out who gets treatment and who doesn't, as he wants to do. But first, by asking wealthy Americans - the Warren Buffetts and Bill Gateses and others like them - to put a little more money toward their medical care, so that everyone else's costs don't have to rise. And second, by getting insurers to bid against one another to drive the cost of Medicare down, so that you can get the same benefits at a lower price. Let me be clear: If my plan doesn't work, the government will be on the hook, not seniors. Nobody, I repeat nobody, will be left without coverage. But I believe that it will work - and doing nothing, as the president prefers, is simply not an option.
Is there some flimflam in these promises? Of course - but not any more than presidential candidates often offer. Do they clash with some of the statements Romney has already made? Here and there, but not in impossibly dramatic ways.
Would these words, or others like them, change the way a skeptical public thinks about Romney's priorities? At this late date, they might well not. But better to try and fail than to go down to defeat without even trying at all.

HEADLINE: Spanish Prisoners

BYLINE: By RICARD GONZÁLEZ and JAUME CLOTET. 
Ricard González is the former Washington correspondent for El Mundo and the Catalan magazine El Temps. Jaume Clotet is a novelist and former political editor of the Catalan newspaper Avui.

 BODY:
ON Sept. 11, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona calling for Catalonia's independence from Spain. Artur Mas, the Catalan prime minister, reacted by dissolving the regional Parliament and calling for elections on Nov. 25, which will likely strengthen his party's position. Catalonia's Parliament, which represents an autonomous region the size of Belgium in Spain's northeast corner, has overwhelmingly supported holding a referendum on independence despite the Spanish Constitution's ban on secession. So in addition to its economic woes, Spain now faces a deep constitutional crisis.
History can follow a capricious path, sometimes meandering slowly for decades only to accelerate abruptly and take a vertiginous turn. The immediate cause of Catalonia's sudden outbreak of secessionist fever is so-called fiscal looting. The region accounts for about one-fourth of Spain's exports. But for every euro Catalans pay in taxes, only 57 cents is spent in the region. Before taxes, Catalonia is the fourth richest of Spain's 17 autonomous regions. After taxes, it drops to ninth -- a form of forced redistribution unparalleled in contemporary Europe. 
For a society suffering the acute pain of budget cuts and a deep recession, the burden of fiscal transfers, which cripple the Catalan economy's ability to compete globally, is unacceptable. Unable to draw on its own tax base, the Catalan government recently went through the humiliation of being forced to ask Madrid for a bailout. Americans know well that an unfair taxation system can easily ignite calls for independence.
But money isn't the only cause of secessionist sentiment. We Catalans have long been attached to our distinct identity and never accepted the loss of national sovereignty after being defeated by the Spanish monarchy in 1714. For three centuries, Catalonia has striven to regain its independence. Most attempts to establish a state were put down by force. The ''Catalan question'' was a major catalyst of the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, and Gen. Francisco Franco's dictatorship harshly repressed Catalan culture.
At the core of Catalonia's unique identity is the Catalan language, which is distinct from Spanish. Since the re-establishment of Spain's democracy in 1977 and Catalonia's autonomy in 1979, Catalan has been revived in the region's schools. However, a recent ruling by Spain's Constitutional Court threatens this policy. To most Catalans, our language is a red line. If the current system of autonomy can't guarantee protection of it, independence is the only solution.
The independence movement is not driven by hatred of Spain. Catalan nationalism is civic and cultural, unlike the ethnic nationalism that has so often plagued Europe. Indeed, most of the two million Spaniards who migrated to Catalonia in the 1960s and '70s are today fully integrated and many of them have embraced secessionist ideals.
The growth of the secessionist movement is also a reaction to a renewed wave of Spanish nationalism. When Catalonia passed a more far-reaching autonomy law in 2006, some political parties and media outlets unleashed a fierce anti-Catalan campaign that included a boycott of Catalan products. This campaign caused an emotional rift, and many Catalans concluded that only independence would protect them. Once mutual trust was lost, other possible solutions, like a federal state, lost their appeal. The fact that the Spanish government is now seeking to curb the powers of autonomous regions by blaming them for the economic crisis doesn't help.
Opponents of secession often argue that Catalan independence doesn't make sense in a globalized world where state sovereignty is progressively being eroded. However, the opposite is true: it has never made more sense -- at least for small European nations. Europe's common market and its increasing move toward greater political union enhances the viability of small countries. Small states are more competitive and tend to react faster to global economic challenges. Catalonia has a population of just over 7.5 million. Twelve current European Union members, including Ireland and Denmark, have smaller populations.
Although secession sounds drastic, it doesn't need to be. The European Union's internal borders are already blurred and its citizens cross them in order to travel, work and emigrate without visas. Spaniards and Catalans would continue to be members of a community of nations, and the most important economic and cultural links would be preserved.
Unfortunately, the Catalan demands for self-determination have so far been met with threats and contempt by the Spanish government. This attitude differs starkly from that of the British prime minister, David Cameron, who has been negotiating with Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, over a scheduled 2014 referendum on Scottish secession from the United Kingdom.
Spain's Constitution may not permit regions to secede, but the principles of democracy and justice necessitate finding a political solution to Catalonia's demands. In a world where deep-seated national grievances often lead to violence, Catalans offer the example that peaceful change is possible. Denying Catalans the right to self-determination would be an affront to the democratic ideals that Spain, and Europe, claim to embrace.

HEADLINE: Obama Camp Outspending Romney On TV Ads

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEREMY W. PETERS; Jim Rutenberg reported from Denver, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.

 BODY:
DENVER -- For every five commercials Mitt Romney and his allies ran here in this vital swing state in the last two weeks of September, President Obama and Democrats ran seven, accusing Mr. Romney of having a ''tough luck'' attitude toward the middle class and asserting that Mr. Obama has brought the economy back from the brink.
In Florida, the disparity was greater. The number of pro-Obama ads outnumbered pro-Romney ads by almost 50 percent -- some 13,000 of them accusing Mr. Romney of outsourcing jobs to China, trying to gut Medicare and hiding his tax returns from the public. 
The story was the same in most of most of the other battlegrounds. In Ohio and in Iowa, in Norfolk, Va., and on the Boston stations that feed New Hampshire, Mr. Obama out-advertised his rival after the parties' nominating conventions, according to data compiled by the political advertising monitoring firm Kantar Media/CMAG.
Mr. Obama's continued advantage on the airwaves, which counters Democratic predictions that he would be far outgunned by Mr. Romney and his allied ''super PACS'' by now, may help explain why polls in most of the competitive states have shifted in his direction over the last month.
On top of the problems Mr. Romney created for himself with his ''47 percent'' comments, Mr. Obama's ad onslaught appears to have helped the president gain an advantage on issues like Medicare while eating into what had seemed be Mr. Romney's advantage on the economy. It also drove home the image of Mr. Romney as out of touch with the middle class that Democrats spent all summer advancing.
While pressing his advantage on broadcast television, Mr. Obama has spent large amounts to put his message in front of women who watch soap operas and talk shows like ''The View,'' and in front of the young viewers who watch shows like ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.''
And on cable, where Mr. Obama ran commercials unopposed for most of the year -- and where even now he is regularly on twice the number of channels as Mr. Romney -- he has put his commercials in front of the men who watch ESPN and the African-Americans who watch BET.
The dynamic in the political air wars has led to worry among Republican strategists outside the campaign that Mr. Romney's team has simply been outmatched by Mr. Obama's in its approach to advertising and the way it goes about buying ad time on television.
Unlike the Obama campaign, which uses a large outside time-buying firm with about two dozen people working on the account, the Romney campaign, in an effort to save money, buys time with what is effectively an in-house operation that has at times seemed to rest on the shoulders of a single deputy, several people who have dealt with it say.
Mr. Romney's aides dismissed the notion, saying that they have the people they need but that many of their advertising decisions were forced by a temporary lack of money.
It is unclear is how lasting Mr. Obama's advantage will be. Mr. Romney's campaign has bet heavily on the idea that it can sway voters in the closing weeks of the race. After holding back after its convention at the end of August, it is now planning much heavier spending after the first debate on Wednesday. Already, the campaign has been quietly increasing its ad spending, with a new $1 million advertising purchase in Iowa, a $2 million purchase in Nevada and several new reservations on cable.
''With the money that Governor Romney's been able to raise -- with Ryan raising it too -- we're able to get a more even footing with them in terms of ad buys, and that will help in the long term,'' said Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney.
To further help, the conservative group American Crossroads said on Tuesday it would put an additional $11 million into ads in swing states in coming weeks.
But, members of both parties said, the question will be whether the late surge in Republican advertising will be enough to undo the damage to Mr. Romney's standing from the early barrage of commercials from Mr. Obama and his supporting super PAC, Priorities USA Action.
Mr. Obama's campaign believed all along that it was essential to try to define Mr. Romney early, in part because early voting means many voters will cast their ballots weeks before the campaign concludes.
''The cash advantage over the summer was huge -- it had a huge impact for them,'' Mr. Gillespie said of Mr. Obama's team.
All told, from the moment Mr. Romney emerged as the likely Republican nominee in April through most of September, Mr. Obama ran nearly triple the number of commercials he did, according to Kantar, about 347,000, nearly 270,000 negative. Mr. Romney ran about 121,000, more than 99,000 of them negative.
Outside groups have gone a long way toward making up the difference. When those groups are taken into account, the Democrats ran 35,000 more commercials than Republicans.
The two exceptions for Mr. Romney have been North Carolina, the swing state where Mr. Romney has performed best, and Wisconsin, which several outside groups hope to turn in Mr. Romney's favor.
Commercial counts are a better guide to the advertising war than sheer dollars. Democrats say that Republicans have spent more on advertisements than they have since April 1, $351 million to $303 million. But presidential campaigns can buy ads at lower rates than outside political groups can. The Obama campaign also saved money by reserving time far in advance, securing lower rates.
Still, not all ads have the same impact. A single Super Bowl ad can reach more people than dozens of late-night commercials.
But a look at the advertising purchases of the campaigns and the super PACS shows that Mr. Obama and the Democrats outstripping their opponents at various times of day, including in prime time, in various markets.

HEADLINE: A Buddha, Full of Air, Sits Serenely On the Waves

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
The 10-foot-high inflatable Buddha sat on a wooden lily pad in a cove of the East River, bobbing gently back and forth on the ripples of the tide.
On a late September day, its translucent plastic skin glittered with the changing patterns of sunlight and clouds. The stone lighthouse of Roosevelt Island and the steel and glass towers of Manhattan rose in the distance.
When a gust of wind came, the Buddha sculpture strained at the ropes that secured it to its floating platform. Its broad face and rounded body tilted skyward, and drops of water cascaded from its lap. But when the breeze stilled, so did the Buddha, riding out the changes with cross-legged equanimity. 
From the rocky shoreline, a steady trickle of dog walkers, tourists, workers on their breaks and other visitors paused to watch the Buddha ride the tide.
Many said the Buddha artwork, ''Floating Echo,'' seemed to intensify the sense of peace they regularly found at the Socrates Sculpture Park, a four-and-a-half-acre patch of trees and grass on an industrial stretch of Long Island City, Queens. ''The Buddha, he's just chilling, you know, just chilling out there, thinking,'' said Brandon Polanco, 25, a filmmaker who was stretching on the grass after a run. He had taken a photo of the Buddha sculpture in which it shone like a crystal against the skyline.
''In the background, you see the whole entire city, and he's just quietly sitting on the water,'' Mr. Polanco said. ''It puts some perspective on things.''
As a public park run by a nonprofit corporation, the Socrates Sculpture Park regularly hosts playful, provocative outdoor art displays that change with the seasons. ''Floating Echo,'' by Chang-Jin Lee, a Korean-born visual artist who lives in New York City, is part of an exhibition by emerging artists. The show's debut was on Sept. 9, and it will remain, if it survives the weather, until March.
Religion is often, like economics or culture, a subject of the public art at the park, said John Hatfield, the park's executive director. A short walk from the Buddha, for example, was a statue of the Virgin Mary made of birdseed; it changes each day with the pecks of twittering sparrows. ''Religion is a part of our lives, and therefore it's a part of what artists are sometimes interested in exploring, philosophically, politically, spiritually,'' Mr. Hatfield said.
''Floating Echo'' works on several levels, he said. It invites reflection on Buddhist ideas of tranquillity and detachment, as it comes alive on the waves, while remaining in balance. Yet on another level, it is a kitsch object. ''After all, it is an inflated, plastic balloon,'' he said. The Buddha as kitsch is everywhere, he added -- in bodegas, in garden ornaments. ''Why is that O.K.?'' he said. Is there something about Buddhist philosophy, he wondered, that makes that ''perfectly fine''?
Because the sculpture has not gotten much notice, most people who come to the small park are not expecting, when they come down a gentle slope toward the river, to see it there. Many react by taking photos, which they promptly post to Instagram or Twitter. Some try to adjust their own pace to try to be like the sculpture itself, going with the flow amid the chaos of the city.
Taeko Shioiri, 37, a Buddhist from Japan who was flying kites in the park with her two sons, said that while she saw ''Floating Echo'' as an artistic object, ''for really religious people, maybe it could be a little bit provocative.''
But for Kissor Sherpa, 50, a Buddhist from Nepal, it seemed to bring personal delight. He had dropped by the park on Saturday afternoon carrying a heavy bag from his shift working at a local gym. While other visitors snapped photographs, he stood reverentially for several minutes, surprised to see the Buddha there, and smiled deeply when asked for his opinion. Buddhist temples are often in remote areas, he noted. ''So this place is good.''
Religious or not, people did find themselves reflecting on spiritual themes as they watched the Buddha. Haesang Cho, 26, a graphic designer who identified herself as Catholic, said she found herself wondering if her God and the Buddha were one. She spent several moments in dialogue with the sculpture, she said. ''I was asking, 'What kind of message do you want to give me?' ''
Nina Svensen, 31, brought her parents, who were visiting from Denmark, to see the sculpture -- and she was simply glad it was still intact.
''We didn't think it would survive this long,'' she said. ''We were here on the 9th of September, and we thought for sure someone would have punctured it by now.''

HEADLINE: Our Next Stop, Governor: Another Development Site Helped by Your Policies

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
SYRACUSE -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo studied the rendering for a new office building as he stood inside a bioscience center that is itself not yet completed. At a nearby hospital, he reviewed plans for its expansion while surrounded by construction workers and nursing students. And then he examined a model for a mixed-use project that is intended to revitalize the local Inner Harbor, a reclaimed inland port located in a former industrial area. Mr. Cuomo, visiting central New York on Tuesday, looked at times like an architecture graduate student, at others a Chamber of Commerce cheerleader, as he dropped by four development sites in Syracuse, joined by a large entourage of cabinet members, local officials and reporters. The visit was the first of 10 planned trips around the state in which the governor intends to highlight projects that illustrate his economic development strategy, but which some critics have suggested are simply a centralized form of pork.
Like other governors first elected during the economic downturn, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has focused much of his administration's energy on job creation. He has chosen to distribute funds via competitive ''regional councils'' -- panels of local officials and academic and business leaders that vie with their counterparts in other regions to receive grant money from the state. 
''Why? Because people like to win,'' Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday. ''Why else? Because people don't like to lose.''
The regional council system is modeled after the Empowerment Zones created during the Clinton administration, in which Mr. Cuomo served as housing secretary. There are 10 councils around the state, and central New York won the largest package of grants and tax credits last year -- $103.7 million for 74 projects.
''If you want to grow the economy, you can't do it from Albany,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''You have to recognize the variations in the state's economy from region to region, and you have to develop that economy from that region.''
Local officials are buying into the concept.
''The state does things a whole new way, and it's been a lot better for us here in central New York,'' said Joanne M. Mahoney, a Republican who serves as the Onondaga County executive.
Ms. Mahoney said her goal was ''to show the governor that we have real results, we have cranes in the sky.''
The Cuomo administration is planning to award an additional $762 million in financing and tax credits in December; after showing Mr. Cuomo around, the central New York council presented a group of state officials and outside experts with its proposal for a slice of that pie.
The success of the economic development strategy will take time to measure -- New York's unemployment rate is 9.1 percent. But Mr. Cuomo's tour was intended in part to demonstrate the number of projects that have been brought to life on his watch, and to allow for some encouragement of local officials.
Mr. Cuomo's visit began at the bioscience incubator, a $23 million project that the state awarded $2 million last year. In a laboratory there, the governor observed a demonstration of a sealant for concrete that cures nearly instantly when exposed to ultraviolet light -- ideal, he was told, for repairing cracks in manholes.
Then he boarded a city bus that had been borrowed for his visit -- ''Welcome Gov. Cuomo,'' its digital sign read -- and took a seat in front next to Nancy Cantor, the chancellor of Syracuse University and a co-chairwoman of central New York's council.
Cuomo cabinet officials squeezed into the rows behind the governor, lined up like schoolchildren on a field trip, though in business suits. The other co-chairman of the council, Robert M. Simpson, the president of the CenterState Corporation for Economic Opportunity, a business group, stood in front with a microphone and served as tour guide.
As the bus navigated around orange construction barrels, Mr. Simpson pointed out sights along the way -- to the right, Syracuse Stage, which is seeking $500,000 in state financing for renovations; to the left, a brick armory that was turned into student housing.
Mr. Cuomo debarked outside St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, which received $2.5 million from the state last year for its expansion project. He greeted a row of construction workers and nursing students, pausing at one point to inspect a young woman's stethoscope.
After looking at renderings of the expansion, Mr. Cuomo posed for a group photograph with an enthusiastic crowd of nursing students, some of whom hunched over in front, sorority-style. ''He looked way too happy in that picture,'' Assemblyman William B. Magnarelli, a Syracuse Democrat, joked.
Later, after stopping by the Inner Harbor, Mr. Cuomo visited a downtown block where four historic brick buildings were being renovated. Standing across the street, Mr. Cuomo pronounced the tour ''a very impressive morning.'' His question-and-answer session had a welcome sound track: the whump, whump, whump of hammering from construction workers.

HEADLINE: In Stock Market Rebound, a Windfall for Wall St. Executives

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Some four years after the financial crisis, many are still feeling the ill effects. But big bank executives are not among this unfortunate group, compensation data shows.
The executives who headed financial institutions in those uncertain times of early 2009, when markets and banks were being supported by the federal government, are now in line to receive windfall compensation in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
What did they do to deserve such a reward? It's hard to justify and it goes a long way toward explaining the persistent anger toward Wall Street. And we have the government partly to blame for it.
A large part of the reason is simply lucky timing. 
In the depths of the financial crisis in 2008 and 20009, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was touching below 700, bank executives were granted millions in options and stock incentives valued at incredibly low stock prices. The banks were encouraged to offer this compensation because of the restrictions in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which in many circumstances prohibited the payment of bonuses other than in long-term restricted stock. As a result, companies awarded more equity than they otherwise would have at the time.
Since then, the stock market has returned to near the level it was before the financial crisis, making those options and stock very valuable.
To determine how large the windfall is, I asked Equilar, an executive compensation data firm, to compile the value of stock and options granted to the top five executives at each of the 18 largest American financial institutions - those that underwent stress tests in those years. (Ally Bank also received a stress test but was excluded because it was not public at the time). I also asked Equilar to determine what the packages were worth now, assuming the executives had held on to the stock and options.
It's a stupendous amount.
The top executives at those 18 financial institutions received an aggregate of $142 million in stock and options from July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009. It was a lot then, but these stock and options are now worth $457 million, an increase of $330 million, or 221 percent. On average, that is roughly $4 million per executive who received such compensation.
Individually, some of the gains are even more breathtaking. Take American Express and its chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault. In 2007, before the financial crisis, American Express was trading for years at $50 to $60. Then the crisis hit, and in six months the stock fell below $10 a share.
In January 2009, American Express granted its top five executives stock options with a strike price of $16.71, which Equilar values at $7.63 million. According to American Express's public disclosure, Mr. Chenault received the largest grant of 1,196,888 options.
American Express stock is now back to about $57 a share. And that equity package is up 1,097 percent and valued at $91.36 million. Mr. Chenault's option package alone is now valued at almost $50 million.
That's a nice payday. Can anyone argue that it is owed to the executive's performance rather than to a recovery in the stock market?
American Express did not respond to requests for comment.
The biggest dollar winners are the executives of Capital One. According to Equilar, the credit card company's top five executives received an incentive pay package granted in 2009 valued at $19.9 million. The package is now worth $114 million. The reason for the huge compensation package: Capital One's options were granted at a price of $18.28 during the financial crisis. . Yet, Capital One's stock price is trading at almost $60 a share, below its precrisis price of around $80.
A Capital One spokesman said that the compensation was justified because Capital One "delivered solid results in 2009." The spokesman added that Equilar's figures did not account for the fact that some Capital One executives had already exercised their options. According to Capital One, if these exercises were taken into account, the package's value would be $87 million instead, still a fantastic amount.
All told, eight of these 18 firms, including Wells Fargo and SunTrust banks, gave executive pay packages during the financial crisis that are now more than 200 percent higher in value. Four of these financial institutions - BB&T, U.S. Bancorp, Capital One and American Express - awarded pay packages that are up more than 400 percent. Almost all of this value is attributable simply to the stock market's recovery.
And some of these packages reward what frankly appears to be poor performance. The top five executives of Fifth Third Bancorp received a pay package that is now 253 percent higher in value despite Fifth Third's stock being about a third its precrisis value.
How could this happen, you may ask?
The bank executives who stood to make the most were those who were paid more in options than in stock. Options provide greater gains when the stock goes up and so are increasingly in disfavor. For example, Equilar calculates that the options granted to the Capital One executives are up 838 percent, or almost $70 million, while the stock component is up only 212 percent, or about $25 million. You won't be surprised to hear that American Express's total 2009 incentive compensation was paid all in options.
Another explanation is that many of the financial institutions did not adjust the dollar amount of their financial compensation paid that year to take into account the stock market drop. In other words, the banks paid the same dollar amounts but had to grant more options and stock to meet this number because of the low price.
If you are shaking your head, you should know that these numbers are only for the top five executives at these companies. Lower-ranked employees who received equity compensation, which is largely undisclosed, may have also received such a windfall.
Indeed, The New York Times reported in 2010 that the partners and employees of Goldman Sachs had received a substantial equity grant of 36 million stock options during the financial crisis. And of course, this excess compensation was awarded at many other, smaller banks.
Taken together, this is a sobering view of executive compensation. It shows how compensation can have little to do with performance and more with stock market movements and the luck of having options granted instead of less valuable stock. More tellingly, it also shows how the government most likely enriched financial executives by pushing banks to award more equity compensation through TARP than they otherwise would have.
The sad thing is that these executives were compensated not because of the work they did at their firms, but because of a lucky rise in the stock market. It is anything but pay for performance. And yes, if the financial crisis had not occurred, they were likely to have been much poorer otherwise. It's no wonder Main Street is still seething.
Equilar Analysis of 18 TARP Bank Equity Grants JPMorgan Chase plans to disclose part of the total losses on a bungled trade.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In 90-Minute Debate, 2 Candidates Stand On Equal Footing

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
DENVER -- President Obama will have the first word at the presidential debate. Mitt Romney will have the last word. But even before they step onto the stage and shake hands here Wednesday evening, voters across the country are already starting to have the final word.
With a little more than a month left in the race, and early voting under way in 35 states, that is the reality facing Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney as they meet for the first of three face-to-face debates. While Republicans concede time may be fading for Mr. Romney to change the dynamic of the campaign, Democrats know it has not faded yet and both men face risks -- and rewards -- for their performances. 
A presidential race between an incumbent and a challenger, which has played out for most of the year in biting television commercials and fiery speeches, suddenly narrows to a pair of candidates standing side-by-side starting at 9 p.m. Eastern time. For 90 minutes, the rivals will be essentially equal, creating what Mr. Romney's advisers believe is a critical opportunity to make a move in the race.
There will be no rigid time limits, buzzers or cheering that often threatened to turn the Republican primary debates into a recurring political game show. The debate will be divided into six segments of 15 minutes, with ample opportunity for robust exchanges and a level of specificity that both sides have often sought to avoid.
As Mr. Romney took a lunch break on Tuesday, he told reporters, ''I'm getting there,'' when asked whether he was ready for one of the biggest moments of his campaign. In Nevada, where Mr. Obama practiced for the debate, he went for a quick tour of the Hoover Dam.
Here is a look at a few things to watch -- in style and in substance -- as the debate unfolds at the University of Denver, here in the battleground state of Colorado, for the first of three encounters between the president and Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
RIVALS The two men may spend considerable time talking and thinking about each other, but they know each other only from afar. They have not appeared on the same stage in nearly eight years, when they both spoke at the winter Gridiron Dinner in 2004, a white-tie gathering that is a staple on the social calendar of official Washington.
While advisers to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney said that the two men seem to have little genuine appreciation for each other, it is unlikely their true feelings will be on display. The president, who has yet to live down an offhand remark from a debate in 2008 when he told Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton she was merely ''likable enough,'' has been warned by his aides to avoid being smug.
Mr. Romney may have a bit more latitude in this regard as he tries to show Republicans -- and undecided voters -- that he can forcefully challenge the president and regain command of the race.
TOPICS The debate is to focus on domestic issues, with a particular emphasis on the economy. There is no shortage of material, considering the national unemployment rate is at 8.1 percent.
But even though the rationale of Mr. Romney's candidacy is rooted in his business experience and his promise to revive the economy, advisers said he would try to broaden the argument against Mr. Obama's job performance by raising questions about how his administration handled the attack on a diplomatic mission last month in Libya that killed four Americans.
The challenge for both men in the debate, to be moderated by Jim Lehrer, will be to enliven the conversation with fresh details, rather than offering a line-by-line replay of the campaign so far. There are many potential flash points, including: health care (the national plan signed into law by the president and the Massachusetts law signed by Mr. Romney); the nation's fiscal crisis and solutions for reaching a comprehensive deficit reduction deal, including the willingness to raise taxes and overhauling the nation's tax code.
STAGECRAFT A coin toss determines speaking order: Mr. Obama opens and Mr. Romney closes. Their respective campaign representatives have spent days on details as small as how many family members can take the stage after the debate, a sign that almost nothing will be left to chance.
Yet the chemistry between the two candidates cannot be rehearsed and their interactions could be just as important as the answers to the debate questions. Mr. Romney has practiced being ''respectfully aggressive,'' a senior adviser said, with a goal of pleasing Republicans who believe he has been too passive. At the same time, the objective is to not turn off independent voters, women or others who may be disappointed with Mr. Obama's policies but still like him.
Mr. Romney's goal is not focused on tearing down the president, aides said, but rather to use the audience of tens of millions of American to show that he can be trusted to improve their lives.
''In my view it's not so much winning and losing -- it's about something bigger than that,'' Mr. Romney told supporters here Monday night. ''These debates are an opportunity for each of us to describe a pathway forward.''
The president, who polls show has developed a lead in several battleground states, has been instructed by aides to use humor and his wide smile to fend off attempts to be drawn into the fray. He is aiming to be confident and humble about his first term, one adviser said, in hopes of avoiding coming across as ''arrogant or dismissive.''
Both candidates will come to the debate armed with well-practiced one-liners, the moments they hope will become sound bites that will shape the narrative in the days to come. It will be telling how long they wait before starting to unload them and how they address one another from the outset of the debate.
OLD VS. NEW The general election debates, which pushed presidential campaigns into the television age a half-century ago, are now facing a new test. The rise of social media has already reshaped the race, raising questions of whether the audience will match the 52.8 million viewers who tuned into the first debate between Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain four years ago.
But this year, on the eve of the first debate, Ohio became the second battleground state on Tuesday to open its doors to early voting. And by the time the third debate takes place on Oct. 22, tens of millions of Americans will have already voted.

HEADLINE: China Needs Its Own Dream

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
On Nov. 8, China is set to hold the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party. We already know who will be the next party leader: Vice President Xi Jinping. What we don't know is what matters: Does Xi have a ''Chinese Dream'' that is different from the ''American Dream?'' Because if Xi's dream for China's emerging middle class -- 300 million people expected to grow to 800 million by 2025 -- is just like the American Dream (a big car, a big house and Big Macs for all) then we need another planet.
Spend a week in China and you'll see why. Here's a Shanghai Daily headline from Sept. 7: ''City Warned of Water Resource Shortage.'' The article said: ''Shanghai may face a shortage of water resources if the population continues to soar. ... The current capacity of the city's water supply was about 16 million tons per day, which is able to cover the demand of 26 million people. However, once the population reaches 30 million, the demand would rise to 18 million tons per day, exceeding the current capacity.'' Shanghai will hit 30 million in about seven years! 
''Success in the 'American Dream,' '' notes Peggy Liu, the founder of the Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, or Juccce, ''used to just mean a house, a family of four, and two cars, but now it's escalated to conspicuous consumption as epitomized by Kim Kardashian. China simply cannot follow that path -- or the planet will be stripped bare of natural resources to make all that the Chinese consumers want to consume.''
Liu, an M.I.T. graduate and former McKinsey consultant, argues that Chinese today are yearning to create a new national identity, one that merges traditional Chinese values, like balance, respect and flow, with its modern urban reality. She believes that the creation of a sustainable ''Chinese Dream'' that breaks the historic link between income growth and rising resource consumption could be a part of that new identity, one that could resonate around the world.
So Juccce has been working with Chinese mayors and social networks, sustainability experts and Western advertising agencies to catalyze sustainable habits in the emergent consuming class by redefining personal prosperity -- which so many more Chinese are gaining access to for the first time -- as ''more access to better products and services, not necessarily by owning them, but also by sharing -- so everyone gets a piece of a better pie.''
That means, among other things, better public transportation, better public spaces and better housing that encourages dense vertical buildings, which are more energy efficient and make shared services easier to deliver, and more e-learning and e-commerce opportunities that reduce commuting. Emphasizing access versus ownership isn't just more sustainable, it helps ease friction from the differences between rich and poor. Indeed, Juccce translates Chinese Dream as ''Harmonious and Happy Dream'' in Mandarin. (''Green'' doesn't sell in China.)
Chinese are more open to this than ever. A decade ago, the prevailing attitude was, ''Hey, you Americans got to grow dirty for 150 years. Now it is our turn.'' A couple of weeks ago, though, I took part in the opening day of Tongji University's Urban Planning and Design Institute in Shanghai and asked students whether they still felt that way. I got a very different answer. Zhou Lin, a graduate student studying energy systems, stood up and declared, with classmates nodding, ''You can politicize this issue as much as you want, but, in the end, it doesn't do us any good.'' It is not about fairness anymore, he said. It is in China's best interest to find a ''cleaner'' growth path.
To say China needs its own dream in no way excuses Americans or Europeans from redefining theirs. We all need to be rethinking how we sustain rising middle classes with rising incomes in a warming world, otherwise the convergence of warming, consuming and crowding will mean we grow ourselves to death.
China's latest five-year plan -- 2011-15 -- has set impressive sustainability goals for cutting energy and water intensity per unit of G.D.P. All of these goals are critical to the greening of China, but they are not sufficient, argues Liu. With retail sales growing 17 percent a year since 2005 and urban incomes up 150 percent in the last decade, ''the government must also have a plan to steer consumer behavior toward a sustainable path,'' adds Liu. ''But it doesn't yet.''
So Xi Jinping has two very different challenges from his predecessor. He needs to ensure that the Communist Party continues to rule -- despite awakened citizen pressure for reform -- and that requires more high growth to keep the population satisfied with party control. But he also needs to manage all the downsides of that growth -- from widening income gaps to massive rural-urban migration to choking pollution and environmental destruction. The only way to square all that is with a new Chinese Dream that marries people's expectations of prosperity with a more sustainable China. Does Xi know that, and, if he does, can he move the system fast enough? So much is riding on the answers to those questions.

HEADLINE: Georgia's President, in an Extraordinary Turn, Concedes an Election Defeat

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Olesya Vartanyan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TBILISI, Georgia -- President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia conceded defeat in parliamentary elections on Tuesday and declared himself an opposition politician, an extraordinary event in a country whose other post-Soviet leaders have left office under pressure from chanting crowds and the threat of civil war.
Mr. Saakashvili, 44, saw his presidency as a mission to wrench Georgia free of its Soviet past, which made it especially striking to see him let it go so calmly, a bronze bust of Ronald Reagan visible behind his right shoulder.
A coalition of opposition groups, called Georgian Dream, won the vote on Monday by 55.1 percent to 40.1 percent, the Central Election Commission reported on Wednesday morning, with about 96 percent of precincts reporting.
''You know well that the views of this coalition were, and still are, fundamentally unacceptable for me,'' Mr. Saakashvili said. ''There are very deep differences between us, and we believe that their views are extremely wrong. But democracy works in this way -- the Georgian people make decisions by majority. That's what we, of course, respect very much.'' 
Tbilisi, the capital, had become increasingly tense as the elections approached, and many feared that they would end in a confrontation between government forces and the throngs of voters who had coalesced around Mr. Saakashvili's challenger, the billionaire philanthropist Bidzina Ivanishvili. Both of Mr. Saakashvili's predecessors, Zviad K. Gamsakhurdia and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, left office in chaotic circumstances, hoping to avoid civil unrest.
Mr. Saakashvili's concession opens the door to another unknown. He will remain president until next year, so he will have to serve alongside Mr. Ivanishvili, who will most likely be prime minister.
An hour after Mr. Saakashvili's concession, though, Mr. Ivanishvili excoriated him at length, calling him ''the main cause of all the bad things in Georgia,'' and said the two men could not collaborate.
Mr. Ivanishvili then said Mr. Saakashvili should resign and schedule new presidential elections. ''This will be the end of his problems,'' he said at a news conference. ''This would be a good way for him to keep his image. This would be good for Georgia.''
Mr. Saakashvili's national security adviser, Giga Bokeria, went on television to make it clear that there would be no new presidential elections.
''If someone is interested in provoking a crisis, this is a very dangerous choice,'' he said. ''It is not about personalities. It is about Georgian democracy and the will of the people.''
Dozens of United States and European officials had streamed into Tbilisi to serve as consultants or observers, and on the eve of the vote it was difficult to traverse a hotel lobby without passing an American congressman. Under Mr. Saakashvili, Georgia has been the United States' staunchest ally in the post-Soviet orbit, and its capital features a statue of Mr. Reagan and a street named after former President George W. Bush. Western officials have frequently warned Mr. Saakashvili about his excesses, including when the police used rubber bullets and water cannons to disperse demonstrators in 2007.
As the election approached, American officials and other interlocutors shuttled between Mr. Ivanishvili and Mr. Saakashvili, hoping to defuse tensions in the event of a disputed vote. Representative David Dreier, Republican of California, said he quoted Winston Churchill's directive, ''In victory, magnanimity.''
''This is clearly the most competitive election in the history of the country,'' said Mr. Dreier, who led a delegation from the International Republican Institute, an American democracy-building organization. ''Let's hope that brings about a different outcome than the ones we've seen in the past -- where, basically, you grind your heel into the opposition.''
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who met with Mr. Saakashvili on Tuesday morning, said he showed ''his statesmanship, and his commitment to the democratic process, and to continuing the values that he has put in place.''
''Clearly, it was hard,'' she said. ''It's never easy to lose.''
Mr. Saakashvili made it clear in his brief remarks that his mind was on his legacy. He was just 36 when he was swept into office by the Rose Revolution, and his plans were big: disbanding the hated traffic police; instituting a zero-tolerance policy that swelled the prison population fourfold; introducing English, not Russian, as the country's second language; replacing Soviet concrete-slab construction with jaw-dropping glass buildings; and establishing Georgia as a laboratory for free-market policies.
Many of his pet projects were criticized during the campaign, which tapped into frustration over persistent poverty and unemployment, as well as weariness with a clique that had monopolized politics for eight years. In his remarks, Mr. Saakashvili dwelled on the changes that had taken place in society.
''The achievements of the Rose Revolution in the last eight years are very important not only for Georgian history -- it is one of the most important periods of Georgia's multicentury history -- but they have turned Georgia into one of the key countries for the rest of the world,'' he said. ''Therefore, I am deeply confident that ultimately, regardless of what threats these achievements may face within the nearest months or years, their eradication is impossible.''
His decision to step aside clearly resonated deeply with some Georgians.
''We have no tradition of democracy with no shooting,'' said Mikheil Sologashvili, 51. ''What we've had here is, 'You kicked me out, and I ran away.' I am so happy that I woke up after the election, and that on the second day, I heard the president say that even though he disagrees, this is the demand of democracy. For me, that is better than if someone gave me the latest model of Mercedes.''
He said it would be a great mistake for Mr. Saakashvili to leave office before his term ends next year. ''A big ship leaves big waves behind it,'' he said. ''He should not leave quickly. He should calm the waters.''
Much attention swung immediately to Mr. Ivanishvili, who is still a mysterious figure to many in the West. A central question is how close Mr. Ivanishvili will bring Georgia to Russia, the country where he earned his billions. Mr. Ivanishvili has promised to use diplomacy to ''normalize'' the country's relationship with Russia, which in 2006 closed its markets to imports of wine, fruit and bottled water, stripping many people of their livelihood.
At his news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Ivanishvili said without hesitating that he planned to bring Georgia even closer to the United States and that he, like Mr. Saakashvili, hoped to steer the country toward NATO membership.
However, he went on to inveigh against Mr. Saakashvili, deriding his trademark reforms, as well as recent projects like a plan to build a city, Lazika, on the Black Sea, and a joint construction venture with Donald J. Trump.
Ms. Shaheen, the New Hampshire senator, said she had heard little specific from Mr. Ivanishvili about how he intended to collaborate with Mr. Saakashvili. ''Georgian Dream and the opposition said they would never hold elections,'' she said of the current government. ''They said the elections would never be open and free and fair, that the people of Georgia would not be free to express their will, and, if they did, President Saakashvili would not concede and step down.
''I would point out that they were wrong on all three counts,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Europe's Banks Urged To Isolate Trading Side

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Banks in the European Union should quarantine their risky trading activities from their everyday savings and lending operations, as a way to safeguard the financial system and avoid future bailouts at taxpayers' expense, a panel of financial experts recommended Tuesday.
The recommendation, from a group led by the Bank of Finland's governor, in some ways recalls the old Glass-Steagall Act in the United States, which for decades after the 1929 stock market crash kept stock trading and other investment banking activities separate from retail lending. The U.S. restrictions were repealed in 1999, and many critics have said that the change paved the way for the sort of risk taking that eventually required Washington to bail out the country's biggest banks in 2008.
The European proposal would stop short of requiring full separation of investment banking and commercial banking into two different companies, as Glass-Steagall did. Instead, banks that engaged in risk-taking activities beyond a certain level would have to be put into a separate unit of the same company.
But the proposal is an indication of how intent many policy makers have become on responding to recent bank failures in Britain, Spain and elsewhere that have left European governments with huge debts, stymied growth and stifled the region's recovery from its lingering debt debacle. 
The report will now be pored over by the officials who commissioned it: José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and Michel Barnier, the European commissioner for financial services. It will be up to them to decide whether to start the long legislative process that could eventually result in the banking restrictions becoming law throughout the 27-nation European Union.
The Finnish bank official, Erkki Liikanen, was chairman of the panel after being assigned the task early this year by Mr. Barroso and Mr. Barnier. His group's report blamed excessive risk taking, often in trading of highly complex securities or in real estate-related lending, and excessive reliance on short-term funding, for helping create the financial crisis.
Already, though, the group's proposals have met opposition from major lenders, which want to avoid additional banking restrictions. Europe is already pushing various other reforms in banking and finance, which include requiring larger capital reserves for risk-taking parts of the business, as well as expanded powers for the European Central Bank to oversee every bank in the euro currency union.
Guido Ravoet, the chief executive of the European Banking Federation, a group of national associations representing 4,500 banks, said his members ''are concerned over the proposal to ring-fence trading activities of the bigger banks into a separate part of the banking structure.'' He said the proposal ''seems not to fully acknowledge the major regulatory changes already put in place and those still forthcoming.''
Some bankers may also take affront at the singling out of activities like trading of complex securities known as derivatives, which the panel identified as risky but that they consider integral to modern finance.
Simon Lewis, the chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, which represents the investment banking and securities industries, said, ''We do not believe that further changes to the structure of the banking industry are necessary or will contribute to Europe's economic growth.''
Mr. Barnier, the financial services commissioner, said Tuesday that he still must decide whether to proceed with legislative proposals based on the recommendations. The report will ''feed our reflections on the need for further action,'' he said.
Should things reach that stage, the European Parliament would probably become involved. Ultimately, any specific measures might need the green light from each of the Union's 27 member governments before they could take effect.
But turning the Liikanen group's idea into law would be ''very difficult because of the power of large banking groups in Europe,'' said Karel Lannoo, the chief executive of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization.
''Legal separation means separate capitalization of the different entities, which may become very expensive for large banks,'' said Mr. Lannoo, who cited Deutsche Bank of Germany and BNP Paribas of France as examples. ''Today, several larger E.U. banks already have low levels of capital. Separation of trading from retail will further weaken the capital base. This is why I expect these proposals will be resisted.''
Europe is much more vulnerable to banking crises than the United States because of the size of the financial sector in relation to the economy, said Jan Pieter Krahnen, a professor of finance at the University of Frankfurt who was a member of the Liikanen committee.
The total assets of European banks -- the amount of money they have at risk -- is equal to 350 percent of gross domestic product in the Union. In the United States, the corresponding figure is about 80 percent.
In addition, some institutions like ING in the Netherlands, HSBC in Britain or Santander in Spain have assets larger than the economies of the countries in which they are based. If they get in trouble, national governments have little choice but to bail them out at taxpayer expense. As happened in Ireland, the expense can drive government debt to perilous levels.
''The problem has a completely different dimension here than in the U.S.,'' Mr. Krahnen said at a press briefing in Frankfurt. ''A structure like this is easier to destabilize.''
Mr. Liikanen acknowledged that some members of his panel wanted to recommend far less aggressive forms of regulation, like requiring banks with investment banking units only to put extra money aside in the form of so-called capital buffers.
But Mr. Liikanen, who is a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, argued that structural changes that included splitting off investment banking would be the best way to protect the ''socially most vital parts'' of commercial banks, which include everyday deposit taking and the kinds of lending that businesses rely on to finance operations and growth.
The group included former bankers, economists, regulatory experts, and a representative from a consumer group. The release of their report, though, signals a lack of global consensus on how to change the structure of banks.
In the United States, regulators are putting the finishing touches on a rule first proposed by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, that aims to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading, or trading securities for their own accounts. Meanwhile the British government has taken up the recommendations of John Vickers, an economist, to place retail and small business deposits in separate subsidiaries.
''With the Liikanen report, there are now three proposed models for changing the structure of banks on the table,'' said Iain Coke, a financial services expert at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, a professional body. ''We are not convinced that any of these proposals have a sound basis,'' said Mr. Coke. ''It is doubtful whether it is possible to identify types of banking which are not important or are especially risky,'' he added.
But Mr. Krahnen, the committee member, said that the panel had studied the Volcker rule, and ended up doubting whether it was possible to effectively quarantine proprietary trading. The European approach is designed to be ''more surgical,'' he said.
The activities that should be separated, according to the Liikanen report, would include banks' trading of derivatives for their own accounts, and other closely linked activities. Many of the banks conducting these forms of risk taking would need to place those activities in units that were financed separately from regular commercial banking, the report said.
The separation could be carried out using a single holding company, the report said, and it would only be mandatory if the risky activities amounted to a significant share of a bank's business.
The report also recommended additional limits on how bankers should be compensated, including making the overall amount of bonuses less than what banks pay in dividends.
But Philippe Lamberts, a member of the European Parliament for the European Green Party, said the report should have also backed an absolute cap on bonuses, rather than opting for a structure that ''may seem attractive'' and ''does not address excessive pay in the banking sector.''
Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Crisis Pushes Greeks Far From Home

BYLINE: By ELIS KISS

 BODY:
ATHENS -- Austerity measures, rising unemployment, the uncertainty of its future in the European Union -- during the past five years of recession, Greece has been a fixture in global headlines.
Yet the crisis has had the unexpected effect of pushing some Greeks in the fashion world toward new countries and fresh starts.
For Christoforos Kotentos, that came in the form of Bouclier. French for shield, Bouclier is a Los Angeles-based fashion label of affordable, day-to-night knits, founded by the Cypriot investor Adonis Hadjiantonas. As the label's creative director, Mr. Kotentos has recently been overseeing the brand's first deliveries to U.S. stores. 
''I decided to take the job overnight,'' said the designer, 36, who left Athens for the U.S. West Coast in July 2011. ''Watching everything fall apart around me and people falling in depression made me want to change environment. So when I moved to L.A. I felt I could breathe and start dreaming and being creative again.''
Mr. Kotentos is searching for investment to develop his own label and is hoping that Southern California's fashion infrastructure will bolster his brand.
His fashion journey has not been unique.
Vasso Consola moved to Berlin in January. A graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology and a knitwear specialist, the 47-year-old designer and her German business partners, Daphne Georgiadis and Ekkeland Goetze, set up their company, VDE GBR, in Munich last year.
The brand is based on the ''ID'' dress, a jersey garment inspired by the ancient Greek chiton. Ms. Consola came up with the idea in 2008, when she wrapped herself in a piece of cloth before taking a catwalk bow at a fashion show in Athens.
She and her partners later turned the monochrome ID series into a handprinted collection, called ID Plus.
''The ID Plus project was a pivotal factor in my decision to leave Greece. I loved my country, but I did not recognize the country it had become,'' said Ms. Consola. ''For me, it was about starting from scratch but with experience; about knowing your strengths and weaknesses.''
The ID and ID Plus garments, which come with a how-to-wear manual, are being picked up by clients in Austria, Germany, Japan, the United States and elsewhere. The clothing is produced in a factory in the northern Greek city of Salonika; the prints are then added by Mr. Goetze in Germany.
Even before the recession, creating a successful fashion career in Greece was difficult. Financing has always been limited and difficult to get. Even in the 1970s and 1980s, when local manufacturers were producing large orders for global apparel companies, the synergies between production and local talent were scarce.
Today, ''Greek apparel brands are struggling with a very sharp drop in demand as well as significantly reduced margins on the sales that are left,'' said Vassilis Masselos, chief executive of the Greek lingerie brand NOTA, president of the Hellenic Fashion Industry Association and a former president of the International Apparel Federation. ''Purchases are limited to what is absolutely essential, with even low-priced brands suffering as a result.''
Some designers decided early on that their futures had to be abroad. Sophia Kokosalaki and Marios Schwab chose London, as did Mary Katrantzou, one of three nominees for Designer of the Year at the 2012 British Fashion Awards.
Talented Greeks who did not want to leave home had to be satisfied with ateliers and limited production. Even the establishment in 2005 of a biannual Greek fashion week, which initially attracted some interest among global and local buyers, turned to ashes as sponsors withdrew.
''Fashion was the first thing to go in Athens, long before people started losing their jobs,'' Angelos Bratis said after presenting a capsule spring-summer 2013 collection during the recent Milan Fashion Week.
Based on his fluid silhouettes and intricate handmade draping, Mr. Bratis had built a good business in the Greek capital before the crisis hit. Born in Athens in 1978, the designer spent his early years roaming around his mother's seamstress business, then enrolling at a local fashion design school and earning a master's degree at ArtEZ Institute of the Arts in Amsterdam.
His career took an exciting spin last year when he won the 2011 ''Who Is On Next?'' competition, organized by Franca Sozzani of Vogue Italia and the designer Silvia Venturini Fendi, who also heads the Rome fashion week Alta Roma.
Now based in Rome, Mr. Bratis consults for major brands and is developing his own label through a small, made-in-Italy operation that is sold in upscale stores like Degli Effetti in Rome, Amaranto Boutique in Milan and Lo Spazio in Jidda.
''I wanted a second chance; a next step in my career,'' Mr. Bratis said. ''I knew things were going to be difficult for the next few years. This tough situation gave me the incentive to be daring and start all over again.''
Even though all three designers are working abroad, it is clear that their homeland is still their inspiration.
Pythagoras is the center of Mr. Kotentos's concept for the next Christoforos Kotentos collection. And Ms. Consola says the ''negative publicity'' about her homeland has spurred her to include even more Greek elements in her work.
In the case of Mr. Bratis, his ''Polyhedra'' summer 2013 collection was built on the idea of Platonic Solids, geometry and mathematics. ''It's about lightness; it's Greek, but in a subconscious way,'' he said. ''It's part of my DNA.''

HEADLINE: A Closer Look at Assertions the 2 Sides Have Made on Economic Issues

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The first presidential debate is likely to focus on economic issues as President Obama and Mitt Romney clash over the size and role of government. Here are some topics that could come up.
DEBT Mr. Romney blames Mr. Obama for annual trillion-dollar deficits adding to what is now a $16 trillion national debt.
Nonpartisan analysts agree that Mr. Obama inherited a bad hand: the 2009 deficit was a projected $1.2 trillion when he took office because of Bush-era policies and an economic crisis that slashed tax collections and increased spending for jobless aid and other safety-net programs. He has added $1.4 trillion in stimulus spending and tax cuts, and he has continued the Bush policies that Democrats blame for the swing from surpluses to deficits: income tax cuts, a Medicare drug benefit and war operations. 
But Mr. Obama's health care law, rather than adding $1 trillion to deficits as Mr. Romney says, includes offsetting cost savings and tax increases. And Mr. Obama proposes tax increases on the wealthy and spending cuts.
Mr. Romney's deficit-reduction plans are hard to assess, given his lack of detail, and they would not fully kick in for years, but analysts say they could lead to a larger debt in the next decade than Mr. Obama's agenda would. They cite Mr. Romney's proposals for new tax cuts, an increase in military spending and a delay until 2022 in remaking Medicare.
In the end, the rate of deficit reduction could depend more on the strength of the economic recovery and long-term growth rates than on any particular policy prescription.
TAXES Mr. Obama says Mr. Romney's tax plan would cut taxes further for the wealthy and increase them for everyone else.
His charge derives from an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Mr. Romney has proposed to cut income tax rates 20 percent, but in a way that neither hurts middle-income taxpayers nor adds to deficits -- by cutting tax breaks for high-income taxpayers (but not those for their investments and savings).
The Tax Policy Center made many favorable assumptions about Mr. Romney's plan, given its lack of detail, yet said it does not add up. The analysts say he would have to cut tax breaks for the 95 percent of households with annual income under $200,000, including those for mortgage interest, health insurance and charitable giving. Families with children would pay $2,000 more on average, they said.
Mr. Romney suggested on Monday limiting deductions to $17,000 for everyone.
Mr. Romney counters that Mr. Obama has increased taxes on the middle class. His campaign cites a 61-cents-a-pack cigarette tax Mr. Obama signed in 2009 to help pay for a children's health insurance program, and the health care law, which starting in 2014 imposes a tax penalty on people who do not have insurance. But the law provides more in tax credits for households to buy coverage. And Mr. Obama has cut taxes for middle-income households and businesses in several stimulus measures.
MEDICARE Both candidates agree that the health care program for older Americans, the single-biggest contributor to projected deficits, cannot continue growing at current rates. They disagree on how, and how much, to curb it.
Mr. Romney favors shifting from the open-ended, fee-for-service Medicare program to one giving each beneficiary a fixed annual amount to buy private insurance or a Medicare option. He has not proposed what the amount of the voucherlike payments would be, so potential budget savings and impact on beneficiaries are impossible to judge. (Democrats' assertion that future beneficiaries face average annual costs of $6,400 is based on analysis of a 2011 Medicare plan from Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Ryan, has since modified that plan in ways that make the estimate outdated.)
Mr. Obama, who says Mr. Romney would ''voucherize'' the program, instead backs marginal changes, including lower payments to providers of health care like doctors and insurers. He has not specified further steps to keep Medicare solvent.
Mr. Romney's claim that Mr. Obama has taken $716 billion from Medicare benefits to pay for the health care law has been widely debunked. The cuts would affect those providing health care, not beneficiaries. The health law, in fact, expanded Medicare benefits. Mr. Ryan included identical savings in Republican budgets he passed in the House.
JOBS Both candidates favor government action to stimulate growth and job creation -- just different kinds. In the jobs bill he sent to Congress a year ago, Mr. Obama proposed temporary tax cuts but also more aid for struggling state and local governments to prevent further teacher layoffs; money for roads and other infrastructure projects; and federal investments in alternative energy, education and scientific research. Republicans blocked those proposals.
Mr. Romney instead advocates cutting tax rates permanently to increase incentives for investment and hiring. He backs deep domestic spending cuts, saying they would clear the way for private market initiatives, but says he would phase in the reductions.
While Mr. Romney says Mr. Obama ''has not created jobs,'' last week adjusted numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated for the first time a net increase in jobs in the president's term. Mr. Obama likes to count from early 2010, when monthly jobs reports started showing net growth, to claim more than five million jobs created. Mr. Romney counts from January 2009, though Mr. Obama took office at month's end. Mr. Romney says he would create 12 million jobs in four years, though government and private forecasters predict that many jobs regardless of who is president.

HEADLINE: Robert J. Manning, Former Editor of The Atlantic, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Robert J. Manning, who covered the White House as a cub reporter during the final term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, worked for the State Department under President John F. Kennedy and later became editor of The Atlantic Monthly, where he broadened the magazine's scope and readership, died on Friday in Boston. He was 92.
The cause was lymphoma, his son Brian said. 
Mr. Manning became editor in chief of The Atlantic Monthly in 1966, more than a century after the magazine was founded in Boston. (It is now called The Atlantic.) While the magazine had a rich history in cultural matters, Mr. Manning expanded its attention to current affairs, including the civil rights movement, Vietnam and the oil and economic crises of the 1970s.
''He really began the process of bringing it into the modern era,'' said James Fallows, a national correspondent for the magazine who was one of many writers, including Elizabeth Drew, Ward Just and Tracy Kidder, Mr. Manning nurtured there.
Mr. Manning got an early jump on his journalism career. He was a senior in high school in Binghamton, N.Y., when he was hired as a copy boy at The Binghamton Press. Soon he was promoted to reporter. He never bothered with college, instead taking a job with The Associated Press in Buffalo before joining the Army in 1942. He received an early honorable discharge because of nearsightedness.
''He couldn't get his gas mask on because of his glasses,'' Brian Manning said.
In April 1945, Mr. Manning was working for United Press in Washington when White House officials summoned reporters to announce Roosevelt's death in Warm Springs, Ga. By 1949, he had become a writer for Time magazine. In 1954 he wrote a cover story on Ernest Hemingway after interviewing and fishing with him in Cuba. He spent his final years with Time, from 1958 to 1960, as its London bureau chief.
In 1961, the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, hired Mr. Manning to be assistant secretary of state for public affairs in the Kennedy administration. As part of an administration that was often accused of limiting press access to information, particularly during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Mr. Manning was said to be less restrictive than other officials. In June 1963, he traveled with the president to Italy, Ireland, Britain and Germany, where Kennedy gave his ''Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech in West Berlin.
Mr. Manning joined The Atlantic Monthly in 1964 as executive editor under Edward Weeks, the editor, and succeeded him on his retirement two years later, a tumultuous time of war in Vietnam and political and cultural conflicts at home. He was proud to learn later that he had been placed on President Richard M. Nixon's enemies list.
''If you look back at the Atlantic's coverage in those days,'' Mr. Fallows said, ''I think it gives you a very good sense of America and how it was changing.''
Mr. Manning's time at The Atlantic ended in a bitter dispute with Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a real estate developer who bought the magazine in 1980. In a fight played out in court for several years, Mr. Zuckerman maintained that he had been misled about the magazine's troubled finances when he bought it, and Mr. Manning and others accused Mr. Zuckerman of reneging on the terms of the deal, including an expectation that Mr. Manning would remain at the magazine.
Mr. Manning was gone by the end of 1980. The case ended in 1987 with Mr. Zuckerman ordered to honor the original deal. In a separate settlement, he agreed to pay Mr. Manning $429,000. Mr. Zuckerman, who now owns The Daily News in New York, sold the magazine in 1999.
Mr. Manning later became editor in chief of Boston Publishing and oversaw publication of ''The Vietnam Experience,'' an illustrated 25-volume series. In 1992 he published a memoir, ''The Swamp Root Chronicle.''
Robert Joseph Manning was born on Dec. 25, 1919, in Binghamton. His first wife, the former Margaret Raymond, a former book editor of The Boston Globe, died in 1984. In 1987 he married the former Theresa Slomkowski. She survives him. Besides his son Brian, he is survived by another son, Robert, and five grandchildren. A third son, Richard, died in 2004.

HEADLINE: Despite a Volatile Day, Little Change by the End

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street markets ended little changed in a volatile session on Tuesday amid uncertainty over when Spain might apply for a bailout.
Concerns about the coming quarterly corporate reporting period, which starts in earnest next week, added to the cautious tone.
The Dow Jones industrial average was pressured by stocks closely tied to the rate of economic growth, a factor that weighed on Caterpillar and Boeing as demand from Europe, which has been drifting toward recession, has declined. 
The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, said a request for European aid was not imminent. Germany has signaled that Madrid should hold off on making its request, according to European officials.
A request for a bailout is viewed as positive for Spain and the euro because it could lower the country's borrowing costs. It also would remove another layer of uncertainty in the region's three-year-old debt crisis.
But uncertainty over the timing of the request kept investors on edge, with many selling the euro at higher levels. Another risk factor is a soon-to-be announced review of Spain's credit rating, by the rating agency Moody's, which cut the country's debt to junk status.
''The market is making this news even bigger than it really is just to make it an excuse to sell,'' said Frank Gretz, a market analyst at Wellington Shields & Company in New York.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose nearly 6 percent in the third quarter, lifted by accommodative moves by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, which market participants said would help restore flagging economic growth.
If Madrid were to seek a rescue, the European Central Bank would begin buying its bonds, a development that would help to ease nervousness among investors in the United States about the effect of the euro zone's debt crisis on the American economy.
''Until we get some kind of clarity, we should expect a lot of volatility and difficulty holding on to gains,'' said Brian Barish, president of Cambiar Investors in Denver.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended Tuesday down 32.75 points, or 0.24 percent, at 13,482.36. The S.& P. was up 1.26 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,445.75. The Nasdaq composite index was up 6.51 points, or 0.21 percent, at 3,120.04.
Weaker-than-expected results from Mosaic, a maker of fertilizer, added to worries about the third-quarter earnings period. Mosaic shares fell 3.9 percent to $55.76.
Oil and grain futures slumped for a second day on Tuesday after a weak economic outlook pressured energy prices, while a record-fast harvest and better-than-expected crop yields weighed on agricultural markets.
The dollar's retreat from last week's three-week high limited to an extent the downside for commodities. Since raw materials are mostly traded in dollars, a weakening of the currency usually leads to upward adjustments in price.
Metals markets bucked the trend in oil and grains.
The spot price of gold edged higher, ending near Monday's 11-month peak. Futures of the precious metal, traded in New York, fell in light trade.
Copper crept higher for a fourth day of gains as the dollar fell and funds bought in, although the market's upside was capped by Europe's debt crisis. Car companies reported September sales, with General Motors and the Chrysler Group posting gains while Ford Motor remained flat.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 100 2/32, and the yield was unchanged at 1.62 percent.

HEADLINE: Seven Retain Michelin's 3 Stars

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
A NEWCOMER has popped up in the 2013 edition of the Michelin red guide for New York City hotels and restaurants: Atera, the TriBeCa restaurant that opened a little more than six months ago, offering only counter seating for tasting menus by Matthew Lightner, a celebrated chef from Portland, Ore. 
The restaurant, which received two of three possible stars, is one of several with changes in the influential star rankings, which were announced Tuesday by Michelin, based in Paris.
There were no shifts in the top category, three stars, a select club with the same seven members in New York as last year: Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, Daniel, Eleven Madison Park, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Masa and Per Se.
Of the seven restaurants that received two stars, six were on last year's list: Corton, Gilt, Gordon Ramsay at the London, Marea, Momofuku Ko and Soto. Two others from the 2012 roster, SHO by Shaun Hergatt and L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, closed. A third, Kajitsu, now has only one star. The new entry, Atera, was awarded three stars (out of a possible four) by Pete Wells in a July review in The New York Times.
In addition to Kajitsu, there are 52 other one-star choices this year, up from 46 last year. Added to the list are Aquavit, Blanca, Café China, 15 East, Hakkasan, Jungsik, Lan Sheng, The NoMad and Torrisi Italian Specialties. Laut, Marc Forgione and Veritas each lost their star.
With the addition of Atera, Blanca and Torrisi Italian Specialties, the Michelin guide appears to be validating the trend toward tasting menus, which it already recognized at Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.
In total, there are 896 restaurants in the guide, up from 805 last year. The Bib Gourmand citation for menus with good value was given to 126, up from 114. There are 161 restaurants with meals under $25, an increase of 14.
With this edition of the New York guide, Michael Ellis, the new international director of the Michelin red guides, is making his American debut. Mr. Ellis, 52, who is from New York, had a career in international food, beverages and tourism before he joined Michelin in 2007.
He succeeded Jean-Luc Naret, who became head of the guides in 2003, started publishing the red guides for some American cities, and opened the rankings worldwide to more ethnic cuisines and informal restaurants. Mr. Naret also gave the conservative Michelin organization a sometimes flamboyant face.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Ellis said what was most important to him was maintaining the guides' principles and keeping them consistent from city to city. He supports the changes that Mr. Naret made. ''People have moved to more casual dining,'' he said. ''That's reflected in some of our choices. We want to concentrate on the food.''
Inspectors visit each restaurant anonymously and confer with a head inspector in each city; together they set the rankings. Mr. Ellis said that inspectors debated how to treat restaurants with only tasting menus, because ''our feeling is that people should have a choice when they dine out. But I also understand the economics these days.''
He said Michelin, which in the United States also issues guides for Chicago and San Francisco, is always considering adding new cities.

HEADLINE: At M.T.A., State Comptroller Finds Improved Fiscal Health

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
Two years after a budget shortfall prompted deep cuts in subway and bus service, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's finances have improved ''appreciably,'' according to a report the New York State comptroller's office released on Tuesday. 
The authority has benefited from ridership growth as a result of regional job gains, the report said, but remains vulnerable to the pace of the economic recovery, a looming round of collective bargaining and litigation challenging the constitutionality of its largest source of tax revenue.
''We're pleased to see some progress,'' the comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said in a phone interview. ''Obviously, as we point out, there are risks and challenges that remain.''
In July, the authority released a $13.1 billion preliminary budget for 2013, less than a week after announcing that it would expand and restore some service that was lost during the 2010 cuts.
The authority expects to generate $450 million annually from a fare increase scheduled to be put in place in March. The report noted that the authority raised fares and tolls 7.5 percent in December 2010 and planned to raise them 14 percent -- triple the expected rate of inflation -- over the next three years.
The comptroller's report also pointed out that some financing sources for future projects remained unclear. The authority could need at least $20 billion for its 2015-19 capital program to keep the system in good repair, but had yet not identified where the money would come from, the report said.
On Tuesday, Joseph J. Lhota, the authority's chairman, lauded Mr. DiNapoli's review of the financial plan, characterizing it as a ''thoughtful and thorough analysis.''
The comments stood in contrast to some of Mr. Lhota's past assessments of the comptroller's office. In July, after the office issued a report accusing the authority of giving Apple an unfair advantage in the bidding process to place a store in Grand Central Terminal, Mr. Lhota took to Twitter to assail its findings.
''Trust, honesty & accountability are building blocks of positive reputation,'' he wrote. ''Shame comptroller's staff have none of the qualities.''
The authority included in its preliminary budget some savings estimates that appeared hard to predict, including an expected $22 million in annual savings resulting from attempts to curb fare evasion on buses. The authority also expects to save $20 million annually as a result of a $1 charge it will impose on each new MetroCard purchase, a measure intended to push riders to refill cards rather than buy new ones.

HEADLINE: Stark Backdrop as President Prepares to Debate

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
HENDERSON, Nev. -- Las Vegas might seem the last place a presidential candidate would choose to spend three days of sober, nose-to-the-grindstone debate preparation. But since Sunday, President Obama has been encamped 17 miles from the neon excess of the Strip, in a palm-fringed, financially battered lakeside resort that serves as a vivid reminder of the economic distress that still threatens his hopes for re-election.
Known as Lake Las Vegas, the 3,600-acre gated complex -- which includes three golf courses, a man-made lake, a casino and two hotels, plus a replica of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence -- has the disused air of a paradise lost. Few people here seem to notice Mr. Obama's presence, but that is partly because there are so few people around. 
The complex has been in and out of bankruptcy multiple times, many of the Spanish-style houses in the residential cul-de-sacs are empty or in foreclosure, and two of the three golf courses are abandoned, their putting greens scorched to a dingy brown. A Ritz-Carlton hotel closed in May 2010 because of the gasping economy.
In its dizzying boom and bust, Lake Las Vegas epitomizes the damage done to Nevada, a state hit harder than almost any other by the housing collapse and one that Mitt Romney is fiercely contesting. Mr. Romney, who was already in Denver ahead of the debate, is sure to fault Mr. Obama, both for his housing policies and the lackluster recovery, when they face off on Wednesday.
Critics here say that Mr. Obama's policies, which emphasized limited steps to modify loans rather than a broad bailout of homeowners, did little to cushion people from a crash that saddled tens of thousands with houses worth far less than their mortgages.
''They did some things to help, but my understanding is that only about 3 to 4 percent of the homeowners who were underwater here in Las Vegas were able to take advantage of any programs,'' said Stephen P. A. Brown, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
And yet, local real estate agents say there are glimmers of hope that the worst is over for Lake Las Vegas. A billionaire hedge fund investor, John Paulson, recently bought 530 acres of land on the north shore of the lake, which he plans to develop for housing. Investors, many of them from overseas, are beginning to buy houses, which can be picked up for a fraction of what they cost at the peak of the housing bubble.
''For a while there, people were calling it a ghost town,'' said Marcy Farris, a real estate broker in Henderson. ''But we're snapping back a bit.''
Those seeds of hope amid a landscape of ruin may help explain why Mr. Obama has a decent chance to win Nevada, despite its 12.1 percent unemployment rate, the worst in the United States. The jobless rate has fallen slightly since last year, housing prices have started to rise, and residential construction has slowly picked up.
At the offices of Windermere Real Estate on the brick-lined shopping street of Lake Las Vegas, ''half the agents want to give Obama another term, and half are for Romney -- just like our entire country,'' said Robyn Yates, the broker and owner. She added, ''I'm a Republican, and I really hope Mitt Romney gets it.''
Polls show Mr. Obama with a lead of about 5 percentage points in Nevada. He has made eight trips here this year, and his choice of Las Vegas for debate preparation was hardly accidental. His aides say he is keenly aware of the human cost of the foreclosed homes that line the routes of his motorcade.
''This is one of the states that every time he comes back here, he's reminded he wants to continue find ways to help the housing market improve,'' said the campaign's press secretary, Jen Psaki. ''It is something he is impacted by deeply wherever he goes, whether it is conversations, reports, or reading the Nevada newspapers in the morning.''
Ms. Psaki said she had not talked to the president about the peculiar woes of Lake Las Vegas. In any event, Mr. Obama has had little chance to check out the desiccated golf courses. He spends most of his time in drills with his aides, consultants, and Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential contender who is standing in for Mr. Romney in mock debate sessions.
During a brief outing Monday to deliver pizzas to a campaign field office in Henderson, Mr. Obama sounded like a man who had just been released from house arrest. ''Basically, they're keeping me indoors all the time,'' the president joked to the 20 volunteers. ''It's a drag. They're making me do my homework.''
White House officials declined to say why they chose the resort, beyond Ms. Psaki's observation that ''it's a place where there's ample space and nice peace and quiet.'' Security concerns likely played a part: Mr. Obama is staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas, a secluded hotel reached by a single road. He stayed here on his last visit, though in previous trips to Las Vegas, he has stayed at Caesars Palace.
Mr. Obama has had a chilly relationship with the gambling industry since 2009 when he warned executives at companies that were receiving federal bailout funds, ''You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer's dime.'' Two of the biggest casino owners, Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn, back Mr. Romney.
But at Lake Las Vegas, where the singer Celine Dion owns a house, the talk is of a renaissance. Ms. Farris, the broker, has listed a 2,000-square-foot stucco house, which had been in foreclosure for years and was stripped clean by vandals. ''It was literally missing everything,''she said.
In 2009, she said, an investor bought the house for $129,900 in cash and fixed it up. It is now on the market for $250,000.

HEADLINE: Health Care As Income For the Poor

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
As a nation, we devote almost one-sixth of our spending to health care, twice the share of 30 years ago. Medical bills for the elderly are climbing, threatening to blow up the budget in a few decades. Politicians from both parties are consumed by how to pay for it all. Yet we cannot quite agree on how valuable government health care benefits are to Americans.
In July, the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan arbiter of the costs and consequences of government spending -- decided that we had not been valuing these benefits enough. In a report on how income and taxes are distributed across the population, it decided, for the first time, to value health benefits provided by the government at every penny they cost.
The decision stoked a long-simmering debate about how much health care is really worth to poor families who may not have enough to eat. The reclassification of health benefits added $4,600 a year to households in the bottom fifth of income. It shrank the nation's yawning income gap and muted the increase of inequality over the last three decades. And it changed the picture of what the government does for Americans. 
The reasoning behind the budget office's action seems to make lots of sense: the government spends almost $8,000 on the average Medicaid beneficiary and more than $12,000 for each person on Medicare. Why shouldn't that count as income? Without it, the recipients could not afford an essential, lifesaving service. Moreover, the budget office considers Social Security benefits as income. And that's the way it treats the health insurance provided by employers to their workers.
But not everyone thinks health care is worth that much. In particular, the Census Bureau does not include health care and other noncash benefits when computing the official poverty rate. Even its Supplemental Poverty Measure -- which was created to capture noncash sources of income, as well as all the costs faced by the poor -- sets the value of Medicare and Medicaid at zero.
That approach is not unreasonable, either. To paraphrase Timothy Smeeding, the director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: you can't eat health care. Medicaid benefits are enough to lift many people out of poverty statistically even if they don't have enough money to afford housing, utilities and food.
And the addition of those benefits could alter how we view our progress. From 2000 to 2010, government spending for each Medicare recipient rose by two-thirds after inflation. But those increases probably didn't make seniors feel wealthier, especially since their out-of-pocket expenses for medical care rose, too.
For years, the Congressional Budget Office followed the general approach of the Census Bureau: health benefits were worth only the amount that a family otherwise would have spent on doctors and other medical services -- that is, money that could be used on something else. So Medicare, Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program benefits to a family that didn't have enough money to satisfy necessities like food, shelter and utilities were valued at zero, because without the government benefits the family wouldn't spend on medical care at all.
The change in approach alters the calculation of who is living in poverty. Including these health benefits at face value raises by 25 percent the income of households in the poorest fifth of the population, to $23,300 in 2009 from $18,900 under the previous calculation. This is more than three times the average income of the poorest fifth of households before federal taxes and government benefits kick in, which in 2009 was $7,600. The gains from the new calculations are enough to vault a family of two parents and two children over the Census Bureau's official poverty line of $21,756 and to almost breach the supplemental measure's threshold of $23,854.
Because two-thirds of Medicare funds and 83 percent of Medicaid funds are spent on the poorest 40 percent of the population, the shift also narrows the nation's income gap. Under the budget office's old method, the richest fifth of American households made more than nine times the incomes of the poorest fifth, after taxes and government benefits. Under the new method, the rich take home less than 7.5 times what the poor do.
The new definition of income removes many seniors from the poorest group of Americans, as they are big consumers of Medicare. And it pushes more working families to the bottom of the income scale.
Accounting for health care this way also changes the view of what government actually accomplishes. Social scientists have noted with some dismay that taxes and government transfer payments have become less effective over the last 30 years at narrowing the income gap in American society. But including health benefits changes the outcome significantly because health care is becoming a much bigger part of government spending.
Under the budget office's old methods, taxes and government spending in 2007 narrowed the income gap by 17 percent, as measured by the Gini index, which ranges from 0 when everybody has the same income to 1 when one plutocrat hoards it all. Including all government health spending as income, the government reduced inequality by 21 percent.
The budget office's change will not settle the debate about how to value health care. Mr. Smeeding, for instance, advised against the change. He argues that the new measure ''makes the poor look better off than they really are and their improvement over time better than it was.'' The National Academy of Sciences panel that advised the Census Bureau on its new poverty measures agreed that health benefits distorted the picture of poverty.
But if you ask Jonathan Gruber, the M.I.T. economist who advised the White House on health care reform, government health benefits are being undervalued even when reported at full cost. ''I think it is likely that this is too low because folks have utility value from being insured, which goes above and beyond the cash cost of insurance,'' he wrote in an e-mail. Not counting it at all, he added, is a ''major shortcoming.''
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, advised the Congressional Budget Office to go ahead with the change. ''Our entire system of redistribution is tilted in the favor of giving the poor medical care, but we're not going to count that?'' he asked. ''That's ridiculous!''
Richard Burkhauser of Cornell University, another economist who advised the budget office to change its definition, argues that it is particularly important after the passage of President Obama's health plan, which will increase the government's footprint in health care.
Mr. Burkhauser suggests that the poverty threshold should be raised so that health benefits don't vault the poor over the line. More of the nation's income is being devoted to health care, he says, and that needs to be counted to help us decide the best way to spend our resources. We may ask why we are ''spending so much to give poor people 'Cadillac health care' and nothing else,'' he says.
The political debate about health care could change if more people in Washington adopted this view. By Mr. Burkhauser's rough calculations, provisions in the Affordable Care Act championed by President Obama would add about $750 a year to the income of people in the bottom 60 percent. Under this light, Obamacare might appear a more powerful tool to improve Americans' well-being than we thought.

HEADLINE: The Shopper as Seller

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Julie Medeiros thinks her taste in fashion is worth something. Turns out it is: about $50 a month.
Ms. Medeiros is not a style pro; her day job is at a talent agency in Manhattan. But in a little-known practice, social media shopping sites are offering payments to shoppers who post product links that drive Web traffic and sales to retailers.
In the case of Ms. Medeiros, it is the sneakers and lipstick she added to Pinterest and the night life collection she posted on the shopping site Beso.
Favorable mentions on blogs have been for sale for years. Product reviews can also be bought. Now social media sites are taking citizen marketing to a new extreme, turning anyone's Twitter message, Facebook post, Pinterest image or e-mail into a possible paid promotion. 
The shopping sites are open about the moneymaking mechanics and argue that readers no longer expect everything online to be commercial-free. But the Federal Trade Commission says the practice blurs the line between a recommendation and a paid endorsement and needs to be flagged to readers.
''It's turning word of mouth into a revenue opportunity,'' said Mary Engle, who directs the commission's division of advertising practices. ''Since they're getting compensated, in a sense, for their endorsement, then they should disclose that.''
Social media shopping sites let users select items from across the Web and share and comment on other users' selections. They don't sell anything themselves but make money by taking a cut from retailers on their sites.
Beso formally introduced a program on Tuesday that Ms. Medeiros has been trying, which pays users to send clicks to hundreds of major retailers, like Target and Gap.
''If they drop a link onto Twitter about a pair of shoes that they're dying for, or a new handbag they're coveting, and they refer users to Neiman's or whoever sells that item,'' said David Weinrot, the chief marketing officer for Shopzilla, the parent company of Beso, ''they could actually be rewarded.''
Other large social shopping sites and apps, including the Fancy and Pose, recently introduced similar programs, and Referly, a site introduced in May, is entirely based on people referring products to friends and receiving money in return. Referly says 10,000 people have already signed up. The programs are too new to evaluate their financial success, but Web marketers say consumers should expect more similar programs, in part because visitors are no longer offended by the idea.
''The economic maturity of consumers is, businesses need to make money somehow if they're going to survive -- it's so ubiquitous now that it's expected,'' said Alicia Navarro, co-founder and chief executive of Skimlinks, which automates referral links for publishers.
The sites determine who gets paid through unique links created for each participant. When someone uses a link to visit a retailer's site, or buys a product, a payment is deposited into the referring user's account. The practice is known as affiliate marketing. Bloggers already use the system and almost all major online retailers are willing to pay for traffic or purchases, Ms. Navarro said.
Links can be tracked no matter where a post occurs, meaning a Twitter message, a photo on Pinterest or a Facebook entry can all generate revenue. The social media shopping sites act as a middle man, collecting fees from the retailers and depositing payments into the users' online accounts -- after taking a cut. (Sometimes, sites cut out consumers, too. Earlier this year, Pinterest got into hot water when it quietly adjusted some users' links to become affiliate-marketing links, and seemed to be collecting all the revenue for itself. It says it has ceased using affiliate links and declined to comment on whether it would offer users fees from such links in the future.)
Beso pays users an average of 14 cents for each click they send to participating retailers, while other companies, like Pose, pay only when a purchase is associated with a link. Payments for purchases average about 5 percent of the price, Ms. Navarro said. The sites and the retailers monitor for spamlike behavior, like tons of clicks from a single I.P. address, and do not pay in those cases.
Lynsey Eaton, a Pose user who runs the blog Law of Fashion, said switching to the paid model for Pose images had made her more likely to post Pose links, and had made the service more useful. ''Instead of just making it an Instagram for fashion, it's now shoppable as well,'' she said.
The Federal Trade Commission issued guidelines in 2009 saying bloggers must disclose any paid endorsements, and recently updated them. The guidelines apply to these commission-based links, Ms. Engle of the commission's advertising division said, whether they are in a post or a 140-character Twitter post. ''They can use a hashtag and then 'ad,' and that's only three characters,'' Ms. Engle said.
But there is some disagreement about whether a Twitter post should be treated like a blogger's recommendation and about the changing expectations of financial disclosure on the Web.
Linda Goldstein, a lawyer specializing in advertising, said when the F.T.C. issued its blogger guidelines, ''consumers were much less sophisticated'' than they are today. ''Consumers are now being used to generate leads -- I don't know if that raises the same concerns as an endorsement,'' said Ms. Goldstein of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. ''You're not expressing an opinion about the product, you're sending it to someone you think might be interested.''
Twitter and Facebook policies allow individuals to post referral-based links, but both companies say users should disclose that they are getting paid.
So far, the social media companies and their users seem to be largely unaware of how the guidelines apply to them.
Dustin Rosen, chief executive of Pose, said he was not clear on whether the guidelines would apply. Beso says its users should add hashtags like #spon, for sponsored, or #paid to links, but stops short of requiring it. Ms. Eaton, the Pose user, says she follows disclosure guidelines on her blog but has not yet done so on Pose. ''I think this is so new that I haven't really honestly thought about how users perceive the fact that people are making money,'' she said.
Ms. Medeiros, who signed up for the Beso pilot program about a month ago, says she doubts that her friends will mind that she makes money from her links.
''It's extra cash for something that I like doing,'' she said. ''It's sort of rewarding to be able to make a few cents from sharing your personal life.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Teenagers Are Driving After Drinking, Study Shows

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ATLANTA (Reuters) -- The percentage of American high school students who drink and drive has dropped by more than half in two decades, in part because of tougher laws against driving under the influence of alcohol, federal health officials said on Tuesday. 
In 2011, 10.3 percent of high school students 16 and older reported drinking and driving in the previous 30 days, compared with 22.3 percent in 1991, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The agency credited the nearly 54 percent decline to stricter laws against drunken driving and restrictions on teenagers' driving privileges, like limits on the hours they may legally drive at night.
''We've seen really good progress,'' Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the centers, told reporters. ''We're moving in the right direction, but we need to keep up the momentum.''
Despite the decrease, nearly a million high school students consumed alcohol before driving last year, the report showed.
Drinking and driving among teenagers is a factor in more than 800 deaths annually, and car crashes remain the leading cause of death among people aged 16 to 19, the centers said.
For the report, the agency analyzed risk behavior data collected from thousands of high school students through national surveys and from 41 states.
In 2011, the percentage of students who reported drinking and driving in the previous 30 days ranged from a low of 4.6 percent in Utah to a high of 14.5 percent in North Dakota.
Male students 18 and older were the most likely to drink and drive, and 16-year-old female students were the least likely, it said. Eighty-five percent of high school students who reported drinking and driving in the prior month also admitted binge drinking, defined as having five or more drinks during a short time period.
The centers said another factor in the decline of teenage drinking and driving was that high school students were driving less, possibly because of higher gasoline prices and the slowdown in the economy.
From 2000 to 2010, the percentage of high school seniors who did not drive during an average week jumped to 22 percent from 15 percent, the health agency said.
Dr. Frieden said parents were vital in ensuring that rates of teen drinking and driving continue to decrease.
''Children see how their parents drive from a young age and model that behavior,'' he said. ''Parents are a key part of the equation here.''

HEADLINE: Iran's President Ties Recent Drop in Currency to U.S.-Led Sanctions

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iran's president admitted Tuesday that the American-led economic sanctions on the country were partly to blame for a breathtaking 40 percent fall in value of the Iranian currency, the rial, over the past week. He pleaded with Iranians not to exchange their money for dollars and other foreign currencies.
Speaking during a news conference broadcast live by several domestic and international Iranian news channels, the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Iran was facing a ''psychological war'' waged by the United States and aided by what he described as internal enemies. 
He said the currency's fall was caused in part by the sanctions imposed by the West over Iran's disputed nuclear program, which have prevented it from selling oil and transferring money. He also blamed a domestic band of ''22 people in three separate circles'' who with ''one phone call'' could manipulate foreign exchange trades in Iran.
One Web site, Mashregh News, reported Tuesday that Mr. Ahmadinejad had ordered the arrests of those ''disturbing the currency market.''
The fall in the currency's value has presented Iran with enormous economic risks, including the possibility of starting a severe bout of inflation, which is already high. A rising sense of economic crisis in Iran could also pose political challenges for the country's leaders.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's address was aimed at the teachers, bus drivers, businessmen and others who have been frantically converting their savings into dollars and euros at the dozens of unofficial currency-exchange shops in the center of Tehran.
''I ask you, dear people, do not change your money into foreign currency,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said, emphasizing that such moves would only help the ''enemy.''
But a fresh day of currency fluctuations played out on Tuesday, with the rial falling, then strengthening before sinking again, to settle around its Monday record low of roughly 37,000 to the dollar. The rate had been 24,600 rials per dollar as of last Monday.
Addressing the mixed emotions expressed by many Iranians, who are confused over whether to blame economic mismanagement by the government or the Western sanctions, Mr. Ahmadinejad accused the United States and ''internal enemies.''
He described the United States government as plotting to make Iranians miserable, emphasizing that the sanctions were hurting normal people instead of Iran's leaders. ''They are telling you lies, their pressures are on the people, not on the government,'' he said.
Foreign exchange supplies in the country are sufficient to quench demand, he said, and he lauded the central bank, which he said had managed to ''find ways'' around the obstacles.
''The enemies are trying to blame the economic problems on the government. No. Never. There is no economic reason for these erratic ups and downs,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said. ''I have no doubt that we will return to normal conditions.''
But he did not offer any specific solution to the crisis, and the rial's value weakened after he spoke. The reaction prompted one person who exchanges currency to predict that the rial would continue to lose value against the dollar and other currencies.
Mr. Ahmadinejad said the economic pressures on Iran caused by the sanctions would never force it to compromise on the country's uranium enrichment program, which Iranian leaders say is purely peaceful but the West suspects is a cloak for developing nuclear weapons capability. But the president repeated an earlier Iranian offer to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, if world powers would be willing to provide Iran with that grade of nuclear fuel.
''We have announced that if they give us the fuel, we will stop production,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said. ''But so far no one is prepared to do so.''
Also on Tuesday an Iranian lawmaker threatened that Iran would enrich uranium to 60 percent purity -- much closer to bomb-grade material, if talks with world powers failed.
The lawmaker, Mansour Haghighatpour, deputy head of the foreign policy and national security committee in Parliament, said Iran needed the higher enriched fuel for still-to-be-designed nuclear submarines and ships, according to Press TV, Iran state television's English language news channel.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Roots for Injured Player and Forgotten Program

BYLINE: By BRETT MICHAEL DYKES

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- In the weeks since Tulane safety Devon Walker sustained a devastating spinal injury against Tulsa, an unusual occurrence has taken place here: New Orleanians have rallied around the Tulane football program.
The team is a regular topic to be covered by the local news media. Tulane students have organized Walker-inspired rallies. Numerous hastily planned fund-raisers have resulted in considerable donations for Walker's care. Locals who rarely, if ever, give even a passing thought to Tulane football have been talking about going to games. A home game against Mississippi on Sept. 22 drew a shade under 29,000 people -- a colossal crowd by recent Tulane attendance standards -- and people all over town that day could be seen wearing T-shirts in support of Walker.
This was a stark contrast to what you would have seen in New Orleans -- home to Tulane, a private university, and its nearly 14,000 students -- on the Saturday Walker was injured. You could have spent the entire day traversing the city and not come across a single person wearing Tulane apparel. 
You would have seen plenty of football fans, mind you. There were numerous people wearing New Orleans Saints and Louisiana State Tigers apparel, and a healthy sampling wearing clothes with the logos of the Washington Redskins and the Washington Huskies -- the respective opponents for the Saints and the Tigers that weekend.
But on Sept. 8, it would have been nearly as likely to spot a Yeti strolling down Bourbon Street sipping a Sazerac from a go-cup as to have laid eyes on someone dressed in a manner designed to convey enthusiasm for the Tulane football program.
I know this because I rode a bike around the city that day casually looking for Tulane fans. I failed to spot a single one. I had not set out with the goal of seeing such a person, but after a while, the absence became conspicuous.
How did this happen? This is, after all, a program with some history behind it, a former member of the Southeastern Conference that still has more league titles (three) than five of the SEC's current members -- and that's not even including Texas A&M and Missouri, both in their first season in the conference -- despite having dropped out nearly 50 years ago.
So how did a major college football team smack in the middle of a football-mad region become such an afterthought? There are a few obvious reasons. First, Tulane hasn't had a winning season in a decade (it is 0-4 this year). Second, the majority of Tulane's student body hails from outside the New Orleans area. Holiday flights to and from the Northeast may be filled with more Tulane students than the student section at some home games.
I'm from the New Orleans area and I know more Tulane graduates from my time living in New York than from all the years I've spent in south Louisiana. And with a local economy that for years has lacked diverse employment opportunities, few Tulane graduates stick around to establish roots after they finish college, creating a phenomenon in which much of the university's alumni base resides far from campus.
In a recent interview, Tulane's athletic director, Rick Dickson, said that the ''unbelievably diverse mix of students'' was ''one of the great selling points about Tulane,'' but acknowledged that it did present challenges when trying to maintain a fan base. (There were reports that less than 1,000 people showed up for Tulane's home game with Texas-El Paso last year, a number university officials have disputed.) Dickson, in fact, had just returned from a trip to New York to speak to alumni groups and attend fund-raisers.
''I spend a lot of time up there,'' he said.
I distinctly remember encountering local residents who were die-hard Tulane fans when I was growing up. Frequently, they had not attended Tulane nor did they socialize regularly with the university's graduates. Instead, these were working-class people who, presumably fueled by the same provincialism that leads many New Orleanians to believe that everything in their ecosystem is superior to everything outside of it, were simply fiercely loyal to Tulane football. They hated L.S.U. Where else could they turn?
I thought that if I did some poking around within my network of friends and associates that I could turn up a few of these folks, but no such luck. A common response to my queries was that people used to know a Tulane loyalist -- an uncle, a colleague, someone from their neighborhood -- but that the person was now, well, dead.
Semi-exasperated, I reached out to the Tulane athletic department multiple times hoping that they could put me in touch with a die-hard fan or two, but no one ever got back to me. This leads me to believe that the local blue-collar Tulane fan I remember from my youth is either seriously endangered or extinct.
But as distressing as this sounds, a healthy amount of optimism about the future of Tulane football exists these days. For one thing, the university recently cleared the final hurdles to begin construction on a 30,000-seat on-campus stadium that will be ready for the 2014 season.
''We think it'll change the game for us a lot, and we think this is the most important and impactful way to show that we've got a stake in the ground,'' Dickson said. ''The Superdome is a magnificent facility, but it's just not conducive to college football.''
Dickson added that the university's former on-campus facility was once ''the centerpiece of football culture in New Orleans,'' something he hopes the new stadium can at least partly reclaim.
Additionally, the talent-laden inaugural recruiting class assembled by the first-year coach Curtis Johnson has generated buzz -- the first time that has happened in a while -- and 12 of the 17 recruits are products of local high schools.
According to Dickson, when Tulane takes the field in 2013, at least half of its roster spots will be filled by Louisiana athletes, the first time that has happened since the 1990s and, for Dickson, a source of hope.
''This thing is not going to turn around overnight,'' he said. ''But it's going to turn around.''
Meanwhile, Devon Walker's family spoke publicly for the first time last week, expressing gratitude for the outpouring from the community.
''It's such a humbling experience,'' Yolan Walker-Bender, Walker's sister, told the CBS affiliate in New Orleans at a fund-raiser for Devon. ''We appreciate everything that everybody has done. All the prayers. All the support.''

HEADLINE: Ads Attack Wall Street Ties, No Matter How Flimsy

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Wall Street has taken a beating this election season. Yet what is considered to be Wall Street may be surprising.
Take Keith J. Rothfus, a Republican candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania. A lawyer at a small firm, he specializes in drafting software-licensing agreements. While unglamorous, it helps pay the bills.
Among the clients he has represented is Bank of New York Mellon, which has a large presence in western Pennsylvania. Two commercials backed by Democratic groups are attacking Mr. Rothfus's relationship with his banking client.
"Millionaire Wall Street lawyer Keith Rothfus will fit right in in Washington," said the narrator of one of the ads. The spot shows a plunging stock market and a grim-looking Mr. Rothfus entering what looks to be a bank. Over ominous music, the narrator goes on: "As a wealthy attorney, Keith Rothfus represented a Wall Street bank that received a bailout from taxpayers." 
In an interview, Mr. Rothfus called the ad "deceitful, shameful and outrageous." He said that while BNY Mellon took bailout funds, his work for the company - most of which predates Bank of New York's 2006 takeover of Mellon Financial of Pittsburgh - had no connection to the financial crisis.
"I'm a Stanwix Street lawyer, not a Wall Street lawyer," Mr. Rothfus said, referring to his firm's downtown Pittsburgh address. "I visited Wall Street once, in 1980, as a tourist at the New York Stock Exchange. If I'm a Wall Street lawyer, then the 7,500 people that work for Mellon bank in western Pennsylvania are fast-money traders who charter private jets to the Hamptons on weekends."
As campaigns enter their final month, a number of candidates are flooding the airwaves with advertisements demonizing Wall Street. From the presidential race to local Congressional contests, from Montana to New Mexico, candidates - both Democrats and Republicans - are relentlessly attacking their opponents by linking them to bankers and bailouts, no matter how tenuous the connection.
"Candidates are bashing each other over the heads for being in Wall Street's back pocket," said Elizabeth Wilner of Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group. "Wall Street is this campaign season's punching bag, and it's bipartisan and it's escalating."
In the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis, Heather A. Wilson, then a Republican congresswoman from New Mexico, voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which provided rescue funds to banks. Four years later, Ms. Wilson - a former Air Force officer - is running for the United States Senate. An opponent's ad assails what it characterizes as her deep ties to Wall Street.
"As a congresswoman from New Mexico, it wasn't Heather Wilson's job to represent Wall Street banks," said the narrator in a spot paid for by a liberal super PAC. The ad shows a series of dark, shadowy Manhattan office towers - those of Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. "But she voted time and again to give them special tax breaks, and then voted to bail them out."
In Montana, the incumbent, Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat, is facing a fierce challenge from the state's sole congressman, Denny Rehberg. Mr. Tester, who has received substantial money from executives in the financial industry, has boasted in television spots that he "opposed all of those Wall Street bailouts." Mr. Rehberg also voted against the bank bailout. So instead of focusing on TARP, ads pummel Mr. Rehberg for his longtime support for privatizing Social Security - in other words, putting retirement funds in the hands of Wall Street money managers.
One of the ads features the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and an electronic ticker showing shares in a nose dive. The narration features voices of market commentators: "A wild ride on Wall Street ... the biggest point drop ... a precipitous fall ... these guys have been gambling ... gambling ... bad bets ... they didn't know when to back away. A gamble. That's Congressman Denny Rehberg's plan for Social Security."
Josh Mandel, the Republican Ohio state treasurer running for United State Senate as a Washington outsider, has an ad that goes after members of Congress on both sides of the aisle for supporting the bailout.
"Every Democrat and every Republican who took our tax dollars and used them to bail out Wall Street banks was dead wrong," Mr. Mandel says in the spot, speaking in an angry tone to a group of factory workers. "It was fiscally irresponsible. It was morally wrong."
The presidential candidates have also criticized one another for their Wall Street ties. Ads for President Obama have homed in on Mr. Romney's leadership of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he started. By focusing on private equity - a specific pocket of the financial industry - Mr. Obama has largely avoided a broader critique of Wall Street, where he has raised millions of dollars. On Monday, the Obama campaign announced a new ad that links Bain to a company outsourced American jobs.
Republicans, meanwhile, depict Mr. Obama as a pawn of the financial services industry. One advertisement from the conservative organization American Future Fund titled "Obama's Wall Street" highlights Mr. Obama's vote in favor of TARP when he was a United States senator running for president and says that his cabinet is full of financiers. Another, called "Justice for Sale," suggests that campaign contributions from the banking industry explain why the administration has not prosecuted more executives relating to their conduct during the financial crisis.
"Under Obama, Wall Street keeps winning, and Obama keeps taking their cash," the narrator says. "Tell Obama to stop protecting his Wall Street donors."
Mr. Rothfus, the Republican candidate in Pennsylvania, is locked in a tight race with his opponent, the Democratic incumbent Mark S. Critz. He has countered the attack ads with humorous "Keith Rothfus is a regular guy" 30-second spots. In one, he is shown gardening in his modest front yard, driving his kids around town and repairing his daughter's bicycle.
In response, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees has produced an ad that starts, "Regular guy? Hardly. Keith Rothfus is a millionaire attorney for a Wall Street bank." Banner headlines of the BNY Mellon's $3 billion bailout run across the screen.
Mr. Rothfus, who lives in Sewickley, Pa., with his wife and six children, has worked as a corporate lawyer since graduating from Notre Dame Law School in 1980. For the last 15 years he has practiced on and off at Yukevich, Marchetti, Liekar & Zangrilli, a 12-lawyer firm. He earned about $125,000 last year. His assignments for BNY Mellon constitute a tiny portion of his overall practice, which focuses on small- and medium-size businesses.
"I've never done anything close to securities work for Mellon, never came close to those C.D.O.'s," said Mr. Rothfus, referring to collateralized debt obligations, the complex mortgage instruments that contributed to the near collapse of the financial system. "I've never even done an I.P.O."
Spokesmen for organizations behind the attack ads against Mr. Rothfus - the Democratic House Majority PAC and Afscme - said that they stood behind the ads.
Despite Mr. Rothfus's modest salary - top Wall Street lawyers earn substantial seven-figure salaries - the millionaire epithet is accurate. That comes courtesy of his wife, the daughter of a successful Pittsburgh businessman. Based on his most recent financial disclosure, Mr. Rothfus's total assets, including those of his wife, range from $5.1 million to $13.9 million.
With clean-cut looks and wire-rimmed glasses, Mr. Rothfus does look the part of a button-down Wall Street lawyer. But he is quick to point out that he favors Brooks Brothers off-the-rack suits instead of the bespoke variety and prefers Land's End neckwear to Hermès ties.
"There were certain individuals on Wall Street who were reckless and betrayed our trust," he said. "But I wasn't one of them."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bar Soap Sheds Its Bad Image and Win New Fans

BYLINE: By ALIX STRAUSS

 BODY:
THIS year marks the 60th anniversary of Dr. Erno Laszlo's Dead Sea Mud cleansing bar. Sold at Saks since 1952, the distinctive black bar, a louche, luxurious cousin to Ivory, promises to remove impurities and exfoliate the skin while hydrating it.
Dr. Laszlo's creation is a cult favorite, but face soap in general has long had a dirty reputation in the beauty industry. Many consumers have been pushed by marketers into thinking that soap strips necessary oils and unfavorably alters the skin's pH level. Bar soap has also had a tough time competing with the overabundance of liquids, creams and foams that skin care companies offer. 
But the scorn for soap might be outdated, said Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a dermatologist in New Orleans.
''Bars of the past contained alkaline and had a pH of 9 to 10, which disrupted one's epidermal barrier,'' she said. ''Today's face bars are formulated to be nonirritating. They contain less than ten percent soap and are made with syndets, synthetic detergents that cleanses the skin. They also have a lower pH of 5.5 to 7.0, to match your normal skin's level.''
Like many other personal grooming products, face soap has gotten a makeover, shedding preservatives, chemicals and fragrance. And at a time when natural and organic are prized, bars seem to fit the bill. And besides Dr. Laszlo's bar, which is $40, they are almost all less expensive than bottled cleansers. (The Neutrogena Original Formula Facial Cleansing Bar, a drugstore favorite for its clear appearance, is less than $3.)
Kim Gillman, 45, a marketing manager who lives in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., is a devotee of Aveeno with oatmeal, sold in drugstores, and the higher-end Origins Checks and Balances.
''I feel a bar gives you better control,'' Ms. Gillman said. ''It lasts longer and it doesn't have the slimy consistency of liquid cleaners. I also like to feel the heaviness of a bar in my hand. There's something soothingly tactile about it.''
Dr. Dennis Gross, a dermatologist in New York, said: ''People now have a choice on what delivery method they prefer. Many are choosing to go back to a bar. Companies are making them because over all they are more economical, have more environmentally friendly packaging and there's a demand for it.''
One of these companies is the Britain-based Lush, which manufactures almost 600,000 pounds of solid soap a year. Sales of Fresh Farmacy face soap, which contains calamine and is packaged like cheese, are up 41 percent since last year, according to Brandi Halls, North American campaign and communications director for Lush.
''Bar soaps are hygienic because they contain no water, which is required for bacterial growth,'' Ms. Halls said. ''Liquid soaps are predominantly water, a breeding ground for bacteria, and so they require chemical preservatives.''
Though, as Lynn Fischer, director of global education at SkinCeuticals, a company that offers six bottled cleansers, pointed out: ''Bar soap can sit in a dish of dirty water and be exposed to the air. Or your hands could have bacteria on them. Then it's transferred to the soap, and that can go to your face.''
Despite such concerns, soap sales seem to be on the rise. In July, Melvita, an organic cosmetics and skin-care company, released Ultra-Gentle Face Soap, a nondrying, deep-cleaning bar. In December, Lather, another natural skin-care business known for its olive oil bar soaps, will introduce two bars: Vanilla Bean & Shea and Eucalyptus & Clay.
From July 2011 to July 2012, Ahava sold more than 8,000 bars of its Moisturizing Salt Soap, up 22 percent from the year before, according to Elana Drell-Szyfer, the chief executive officer of the company. ''That means eight additional bars of soap we sold each day this year,'' Ms. Drell-Szyfer said. ''That's a very large and surprising number for a small brand like ours, especially when it's not been an intentional focus.'' (Ahava also sells a popular Purifying Mud Soap.)
Kiss My Face has been selling face soap since the company started in 1981. Today it sells 14 times the number of bar soaps than all their other facial cleansers combined, and more bar soaps than any of the 100 products it sells, according to Jim Healy, the company's vice president for marketing.
Dr. Sarah Villafranco is an emergency physician who in 2010 developed and created Osmia Organics, an all-natural skin-care company. ''Commercial soap companies tend to manufacture and process soap in a way that decreases or removes glycerin and adds other synthetic elements to create a harder bar,'' she said, adding that some industry professionals think big companies want soap to dry your skin so you'll need their lotion to moisturize it. And liquid washes can be just as drying as bars, since many contain harsh surfactants, like sodium laureth sulfate, to lend the sudsy feeling some consumers demand.
Last month, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences questioned the use of the chemical triclosan, an ingredient found in many antibacterial cleansers. The study suggested that exposure to triclosan was linked with muscle function impairment in humans.
But some people seek out soap simply because it provides a sensual and decorative experience. At C. O. Bigelow, the 174-year-old apothecary and beauty emporium in Greenwich Village, some of the best-selling products are soaps made from silk and rice bran, and egg white and camomile flower, and a sponge made from pure vegetable fiber and Binchotan charcoal. The hardest worker of the lot, according to Ian Ginsberg, a pharmacist and the owner of the store, is Cor Soap Silver treatment, an all-natural bar that, like Laszlo's, costs $40 and promises to even out skin tone, fade sunspots, replenish lost collagen and protect from ultraviolet rays.

HEADLINE: Transcript of the First Presidential Debate

 BODY:
The following is a completed transcript of President Obama and Mitt Romney's remarks at the first presidential debate in Denver on Oct. 3, 2012.
JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness Arena at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. I'm Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour, and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.
This debate and the next three -- two presidential, one vice- presidential -- are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic issues, and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments, with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. 
Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects of questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections, and for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.
The segments, as I announced in advance, will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government, and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.
The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos, hisses -- among other noisy distracting things -- so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. (Cheers, applause.)
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.
Let's start the economy, segment one. And let's begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You have two minutes -- each of you have two minutes to start. The coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.
There are a lot of points that I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. (Laughter.) And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now, we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. (Laughter.)
You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.
Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back and housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we've been but where we're going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations that we'll be better off.
I've got a different view. I think we've got to invest in education and training. I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.
Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters, to you, which path we should take. Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess, or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says, America does best when the middle class does best? And I'm looking forward to having that debate.
MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I am pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome and also the presidential commission on these debates.
And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here -- here with me, so I -- (laughter) -- congratulations.
This is obviously a very tender topic. I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm, and she said, I've been out of work since May. Can you help me?
Ann yesterday was a rally in Denver, and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost his most recent job, and we've now just lost our home. Can you help us?
And the answer is yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path, not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That's not what I'm going to do.
My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about four million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America; crack down on China if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We're far away from that now. Number four, get us to a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business.
It's small business that creates the jobs in America. And over the last four years small-business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business, because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. I know what it takes to get small business growing again, to hire people.
Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.
Thank you.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down -- his trickle-down approach. He's -- as he said yours is.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.
First, we've got to improve our education system. And we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest-to- deal-with schools. We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another hundred thousand new math and science teachers and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.
When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.
On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production.
And oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy source of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.
So, all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code, and how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there's a difference because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts, so that's another $2 trillion, and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs on the middle-class Americans I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.
MR. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.
But first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, sure. I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high- income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.
The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're -- they're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing. The same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president, electric rates are up, food prices are up, health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family.
Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again, and I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.
But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas, and I'll just note: first, education. I agree, education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we got 47 of them housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to getting the training they need for jobs that will really help them.
The second area: taxation. We agree; we ought to bring the tax rates down, and I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.
The third area: energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and license in half. If I'm president, I'll double them. And also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.
And by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent, so we can create those jobs.
And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government. My -- my number one principle is there'll be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.
I want to underline that -- no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I -- and to do that that also means that I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes because I think it's instructive. Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. And the reason is because I believe we do best when the middle class is doing well.
And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits and then hire more workers.
Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked a -- over a hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes and he hasn't been able to identify them.
But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.
MR. LEHRER: All right.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of -- if you take those all away -- you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending. And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit -- or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit, is by burdening middle-class families.
The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that's not my analysis; that's the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well so the average person making 3 million bucks is getting a $250,000 tax break while middle- class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.
MR. LEHRER: All right. What is the difference?
MR. ROMNEY: Well --
MR. LEHRER: Let's just stay on taxes for --
MR. ROMNEY: But I -- but I -- right, right.
MR. LEHRER: OK. Yeah, just -- let's just stay on taxes for a moment.
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. Well, but -- but --
MR. LEHRER: What is the difference?
MR. ROMNEY: -- virtually every -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.
MR. LEHRER: All right, go --
MR. ROMNEY: So -- so if -- if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds 5 trillion (dollars) if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.
Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I -- I know that you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it's a popular things to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it -- (scattered laughter) -- but that -- that is not the case, all right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.
And number three, I will not, under any circumstances, raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by 3(,000 dollars) to $4,000 on -- on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there.
But let's get to the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring down the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth so we keep getting the revenue we need.
And you think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.
For me, this is about jobs.
MR. LEHRER: All right. That's where we started.
MR. ROMNEY: This is about getting jobs for the American people.
MR. LEHRER: Yeah.
Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is ''never mind.'' And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you describe, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It's -- it's math. It's arithmetic.
Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.
But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.
And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we can not only reduce the deficit, we can not only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.
And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Now, under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators. They'd be burdened.
But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. And I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.
MR. LEHRER: All right.
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point.
MR. LEHRER: Just for the -- just for the record --
MR. ROMNEY: These small businesses we're talking about --
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me. Just so everybody understands --
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.
MR. LEHRER: -- we're way over our first 15 minutes.
MR. ROMNEY: It's fun, isn't it?
MR. LEHRER: It's OK. It's great.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's OK.
MR. LEHRER: No problem. No, you don't have -- you don't have a problem, I don't have a problem, because we're still on the economy, but we're going to come back to taxes and we're going to move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.
OK, but go ahead, sir.
MR. ROMNEY: You bet.
Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half -- of all of the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.
Now, I talked to a guy who has a very small business. He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis. He has four employees.
He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes. Federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax -- it added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.
And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions -- the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way. Get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying -- (chuckles) -- more taxes. That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I -- you may want to move on to another topic, but I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for -- $7 trillion, just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.
But I think math, common sense and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.
Look, we've tried this -- we've tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We ended up moving from surplus to deficits. And it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus, and businesses did very well.
So in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans, and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.
MR. LEHRER: OK. (Inaudible) --
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word, so I'm going to take it. All right? (Chuckles.)
MR. LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the first word in the next segment.
MR. ROMNEY: Well, but -- but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word of that segment, I hope. Let me just make this comment.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Chuckles.) He can -- you can have it. He can --
MR. ROMNEY: First of all --
MR. LEHRER: That's not how it works.
MR. ROMNEY: Let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said -- (inaudible). I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.
MR. ROMNEY: Number two, let's look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. They're suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence -- look at the evidence of the last four years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've got 23 million people out of work or stop looking for work in this country.
MR. LEHRER: All right.
MR. ROMNEY: It's just -- it's -- we've got -- we got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today. Economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.
MR. LEHRER: All right. Let's talk -- we're still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question -- you each have two minutes on this -- and, Governor Romney you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this: What are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, good. I'm glad you raised that. And it's a -- it's a critical issue. I think it's not just an economic issue. I think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation. And they're going to be paying the interest and the principle all their lives. And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.
So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically there are -- there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number three is to grow the economy because if more people work in a growing economy they're paying taxes and you can get the job done that way.
The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth and you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.
What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test -- if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it. ''Obamacare'' is on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I like it.
MR. ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. (Laughter.) So I'll get rid of that. I'm sorry, Jim. I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I actually like you too. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it. That's number one.
Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to state.
Number three, I'll make government more efficient, and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.
This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The president said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by by the public as all prior presidents combined.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President. two minutes.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: When I walked in the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion dollar deficit greeting me, and we know where it came from. Two wars that were paid for on a credit card. Two tax cuts that were not paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for. And then a massive economic crisis.
And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression. But what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.
So, 77 government programs -- everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well. Eighteen government -- 18 government programs for education that were well- intentioned but weren't helping kids learn. We went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively -- more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars. Fifty billion dollars of waste taken out of the system.
And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.
Now, we all know that we've got to do more. And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit-reduction plan.
It's on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.
And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for a dollar of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.
And Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it -- in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.
Let -- let me just finish this point because you're looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination, and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that -- Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities --
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.
MR. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Sorry.
MR. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles. Will you support Simpson-Bowles?
MR. ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.
MR. LEHRER: No, I mean do you support Simpson-Bowles?
MR. ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it; and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan, (a balanced ?) --
MR. ROMNEY: But you've been -- but you've been president four years. You've been president four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion- dollar deficits.
The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt. You have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this four -- I love this idea of 4 trillion (dollars) in cuts. You've found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done.
Let me come back and say, why is that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have. Now, I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy's growing slow like this, when we're in recession you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone.
Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump -- it's not just Donald Trump you're taxing; it's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America. These small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.
Let me make one more point. And that's -- and that --
MR. LEHRER: Let's let him answer the taxes thing for a moment, OK?
MR. ROMNEY: OK.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we've had this discussion before.
MR. LEHRER: No, about the idea that in order to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He's -- he's ruled out revenue.
MR. LEHRER: That's true, right?
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK, so --
MR. LEHRER: Completely?
MR. ROMNEY: I -- look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work -- you'll never get there. You never balance the budget by raising taxes.
Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.
I don't want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work, with more money coming in because they're working.
MR. LEHRER: Yeah.
But Mr. President, you're saying in order to get it -- the job done, it's got to be balanced. You've got to have --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: If we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.
Let's talk about corporate taxes. Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The -- the oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when they're making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?
Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.
When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.
And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue.
And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.
The first two weeks, she's got them -- some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They're using textbooks that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth; that's not how America was built.
And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately we're going to have to make some decisions. And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff, and the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.
As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a -- a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is -- you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And governors are creative. There's no doubt about it. But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let's -- we -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and -- so I've got to take -- it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools to --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible.)
MR. LEHRER: Come back to Medicaid, here, yeah, yeah, right.
MR. ROMNEY: -- oil to tax breaks and companies overseas. So let's go through them one by one. First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years. Now --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: It's time to end it.
MR. ROMNEY: And -- and in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives, and you say Exxon and Mobil -- actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.
But you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive, you get that rate down to 25 percent.
But -- but don't forget, you put $90 billion -- like 50 years worth of breaks -- into solar and wind, to -- to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I -- I had a friend who said, you don't just pick the winners and losers; you pick the losers. All right? So -- so this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy-secure.
The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for getting a plant overseas. Look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.
MR. LEHRER: Let's --
MR. ROMNEY: But the -- the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.
MR. LEHRER: Let's have --
MR. ROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting --
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me.
MR. ROMNEY: -- where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.
And finally, Medicaid to states, I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year plus inflation -- inflation -- plus 1 percent. And then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.
And I remember as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors, Republican and Democrats, said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.
So let states -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.
And by the way, if a states get -- gets in trouble, why, we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them. But --
MR. LEHRER: Let's go.
MR. ROMNEY: But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance --
MR. LEHRER: Two seconds.
MR. ROMNEY: -- of our people and states, not the federal government.
MR. LEHRER: Two seconds and we're going on, still on the economy on another -- but another part of it.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.
MR. LEHRER: All right? All right, this is this is segment three, the economy, entitlements.
First answer goes to you. It's two minutes. Mr. President, do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is -- the basic structure is sound. But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver --
MR. LEHRER: Sure -- it -- you bet.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: -- of our deficits right now.
You know, my grandmother, some of you know, helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died awhile back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.
And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother. And there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.
So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long- term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money is going. Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies, by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.
And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system.
So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. But when it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.
MR. LEHRER: We'll follow up on this.
First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.
MR. ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs. And I know any time we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worst, and the answer is, neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.
But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring.
Oh, I just thought about one, and that is in fact I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security, he's not.
But on Medicare, for current retirees he's cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers, actually just going to them and saying we're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate. That's not just going after places where there's abuse, that's saying we're cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.
We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients. This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.
Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back; we're going to give a better prescription program. That's one -- that's $1 for every 15 (dollars) you've cut. They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.
I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it, but the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of ''Obamacare'' is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that he would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program. His running mate --
MR. LEHRER: And you -- and you don't support that?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't. And -- and let me explain why.
MR. ROMNEY: Again, that's for future people --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I understand.
MR. ROMNEY: -- right, not for current retirees.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: For -- for -- so if you're -- if you -- you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen, because this -- this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors, and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.
Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.
They recruit them leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist who looks at it says over time what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system, precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.
So I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own -- only my opinion. AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by 8 years. Benefits were not affected at all and ironically if you repeal ''Obamacare'' -- and I have become fond of this term, ''Obamacare'' -- (laughter) -- if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic check-ups that can keep them healthier.
And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier. And I -- I don't think that's right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.
MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment, but what is -- do you support the voucher system, Governor?
MR. ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare and the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.
MR. LEHRER: What about the vouchers?
MR. ROMNEY: So that's -- that's number one.
MR. LEHRER: OK. All right.
MR. ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young. What I'd do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan -- their choice. They get to -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That's not going to happen.
They'll have at least two plans.
And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare, or they'll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan. I -- I'd just as soon not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I'd rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people will make their own choice.
The other thing we have to do to save Medicare, we have to have the benefits high for those that are low-income, but for higher-income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That's the plan that I've put forward.
And by the way, the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's a co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill Clinton's -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff. This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative cost than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that; that's what they do. And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that, and if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is is that the money has to come from somewhere.
And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially, and that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care. Not just in Medicare and --
MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about that in a minute.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: -- but -- but overall.
MR. LEHRER: Go. OK.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And so --
MR. ROMNEY: That's -- that's a big topic. Could we -- could we stay on Medicare?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Is that a -- is that a separate topic? I'm sorry.
MR. LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to -- yeah. I want to get to it, but all I want to do is very quickly --
MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.
MR. LEHRER: -- before we leave the economy --
MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.
MR. LEHRER: No, no, no, no --
MR. ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower --
MR. LEHRER: No.
MR. ROMNEY: -- cost and without a profit.
MR. LEHRER: All right.
MR. ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase. But my experience --
MR. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.
MR. ROMNEY: My experience is the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.
MR. LEHRER: Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice, a clear choice between the two of you --
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes.
MR. LEHRER: -- on Medicare?
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.
MR. LEHRER: All right. So, to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much, and in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more? Beginning with you -- this is not a new two-minute segment -- to start, and we'll go for a few minutes and then we're going to go to health care. OK?
MR. ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. As a business person, I had to have -- I needed to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation.
At the same time, regulation can become excessive.
MR. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?
MR. ROMNEY: In some places, yes, in other places, no.
MR. LEHRER: Like where?
MR. ROMNEY: It can become out of date. And what's happened in -- with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive and it's hurt the -- it's hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd- Frank was passed, and it includes within it a number of provisions that I think have some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.
This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There's been -- 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd-Frank. So there's one example.
Here's another. In Dodd-Frank, it says that --
MR. LEHRER: You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal it and replace it. You -- we're not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there's some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for institutes --
MR. LEHRER: Well, here's a specific -- let's -- excuse me --
MR. ROMNEY: Let me mention the other one. Let's talk the --
MR. LEHRER: No, no, let's do -- right now, let's not. Let's let him respond.
MR. ROMNEY: OK.
MR. LEHRER: Let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street. You had -- loan officers were -- they were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because they're -- the folks didn't qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A-1 (ph) great investments when they weren't. But you also had banks making money hand-over-fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.
So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements. You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We're going to make sure that you've got to have a living will, so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.
In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back, every single dime, with interest.
Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate, and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation, but in the past, Governor Romney has said he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it back. And so the question is does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe.
MR. ROMNEY: (Inaudible) -- sorry, Jim. That -- that's just not -- that's just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation of Wall Street.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.
MR. ROMNEY: That -- that's why I'd have regulation. But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn't thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision, because it's killing regional and small banks. They're getting hurt.
Let me mention another regulation of Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified. That's exactly right. It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to --
MR. LEHRER: All right.
MR. ROMNEY: -- have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties. Except they didn't ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage was.
MR. LEHRER: All right.
MR. ROMNEY: It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt the housing market --
MR. LEHRER: All right --
MR. ROMNEY: -- because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.
MR. LEHRER: OK.
MR. ROMNEY: I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our businesses, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.
MR. LEHRER: All right, I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now let's move to health care, where I know there is a clear difference -- (laughter) -- and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, ''Obamacare.''
And it's a two-minute new segment, and it's -- that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You wanted repeal. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?
MR. ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me, and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance; we can't afford it. And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it -- the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And -- and we've got to deal with cost.
And unfortunately, when -- when you look at ''Obamacare,'' the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it's adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that by this year he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that's one reason I don't want it.
Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.
Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people, ultimately, what kind of treatments they can have. I don't like that idea.
Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country. It said, what's been the effect of ''Obamacare'' on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said, it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table and spent his energy and passion for two years fighting for ''Obamacare'' instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.
It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state, craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, four years ago when I was running for office I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees; it wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs. But it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick -- millions of families, all across the country.
If they had a pre-existing condition they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold they don't have enough money to pay the bills because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit. So we did work on this alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.
And let me tell you exactly what ''Obamacare'' did. Number one, if you've got health insurance it doesn't mean a government take over. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan till you're 26 years old. And it also says that they're -- you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.
Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.
Now, the last point I'd make before --
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: -- before --
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes is up, sir.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I -- I think I've -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me -- was -- (laughter) -- that the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model. And as a consequence, people are covered there. It hasn't destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down cost, as opposed to just --
MR. LEHRER: Your five --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: -- leaving millions of people out in the cold.
MR. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago. (Laughter.)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That --
MR. LEHRER: All right, Governor. Governor, tell the -- tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about ''Obamacare.''
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You did.
MR. ROMNEY: But I'll go on.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Please elaborate.
MR. ROMNEY: I'll elaborate.
Exactly right.
First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary, elected a Republican senator to stop ''Obamacare,'' you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.
What we did, in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together. Two hundred legislators in my legislature -- only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.
What were some differences?
We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them by a trillion dollars under ''Obamacare.'' We didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.
We didn't -- we didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as ''Obamacare'' goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey & Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want -- don't want ''Obamacare.'' It's why Republicans said, do not do this.
And the Republicans had a -- had a plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done in a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea.
And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.
It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example -- unelected board that we've created -- what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall, because the -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.
One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out how do we make the cost of care more effective. And there are ways of doing it.
So at -- at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.
And the fact of the matter is that when ''Obamacare'' is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up, it's true, but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.
Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says we should replace it. I'm just going to repeal it, but we can replace it with something. But the problem is he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.
But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it's estimated that by repealing ''Obamacare,'' you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance at a time when it's vitally important.
MR. LEHRER: Let's let the governor explain what you would do if ''Obamacare'' is repealed. How would you replace it? What do you have in mind?
MR. ROMNEY: Let -- well, actually -- actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description, but number one, pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace; you don't have -- have the government mandate that for that to occur.
But let's come back to something the president -- I agree on, which is the -- the key task we have in health care is to get the costs down so it's more affordable for families, and -- and then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, it isn't.
MR. ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the costs than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.
I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a -- an -- a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on targets such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.
Intermountain Health Care does it superbly well.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: They do.
MR. ROMNEY: Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let me just point out, first of all, this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law.
But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan he would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Well, actually, Governor, that isn't what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.
But that's already the law. And that doesn't help the millions of people out there with pre-existing conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that insurers, you've got to take everybody. Now, that also means that you've got more customers.
But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced, and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts is because there isn't a better way of dealing with the pre-existing conditions problem, it -- it just reminds me of -- you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.
That's how it's going to be paid for. But we don't know the details. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform. But we don't know exactly which ones. He won't tell us. He now says hes going to replace ''Obamacare'' and assure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.
And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good? Is -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No, the -- the reason is because when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems, and we've got to make choices. And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.
MR. LEHRER: All right, we're going to move to a --
MR. ROMNEY: No, I -- I have to respond to that --
MR. LEHRER: No, but --
MR. ROMNEY: -- which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say it's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You've said the same thing: You're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those are my principles.
I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number -- 25,000 (dollars), $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That's one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.
There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code and create incentives for growth.
And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on -- on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation, state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.
MR. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And let's see, role of government and it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President. The question is this. Do you believe -- both of you -- but you have the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.
MR. LEHRER: And -- yeah.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That's its most basic function. And as commander in chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.
But I also believe that government has the capacity -- the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system, and freedom, and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.
But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.
So in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad. Let's start the National Academy of Sciences. Let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off. That doesn't restrict people's freedom; that enhances it.
And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education, what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor. What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.
But what I've also said is let's hire another hundred thousand math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact, we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It can't do it all, but it can make a difference, and as a consequence, we'll have a better-trained workforce, and that will create jobs, because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government, your view.
MR. ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools: great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.
The role of government -- look behind us: the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means the military, second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.
Second, in that line that says, we are endowed by our Creator with our rights -- I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our Creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.
We're a nation that believes we're all children of the same God. And we care for those that have difficulties -- those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that disabled, we care for them. And we look for discovery and innovation, all these thing desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.
But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams, and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it's not working.
And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty. The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible) --
MR. ROMNEY: We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path.
MR. LEHRER: All right, let's go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government. How do -- education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?
MR. ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is of course at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan. He's -- there's some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top -- not all of them but some of them I agree with, and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.
My own view, by the way, is I've added to that. I happen to believe -- I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or -- or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather. I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go -- if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.
MR. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's responsibility to -- as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.
MR. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and those of Governor Romney on -- about education and the federal government?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it, we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.
You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about. And it wasn't very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.
When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs --
MR. LEHRER: Do you agree, Governor?
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let -- let -- let me just finish the point.
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I suspect it'll be a small agreement.
MR. ROMNEY: It's going over well in my state, by the way, yeah.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The -- where their partnering so that -- they're designing training programs, and people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete them. That makes a big difference. But that requires some federal support.
Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable -- whether it's two-year or four-year -- one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middle men for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders but they were taking billions out of the system.
And we said, why not cut out the middle man? And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education. But when he tells a student that, you know, you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver just don't have that option.
And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important -- not just to those kids. It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.
MR. LEHRER: We're running out of time.
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, Jim --
MR. LEHRER: I'm certainly going give you a chance to respond to that. Yes, sir, Governor.
MR. ROMNEY: Mr. -- Mr. President, you're entitled, as the president, to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts -- (laughter) -- all right? I'm -- I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there.
But you make a very good point, which is that the -- the place you put your money makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs. And -- and I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy. Ninety billion (dollars) -- that -- that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers. Ninety billion dollars. And these businesses -- many of them have gone out of business. I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in, they've gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by -- by people who were contributors to your campaigns.
Look, the right course for -- for America's government -- we were talking about the role of government -- is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that -- that has existed in this country for -- for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is to say, how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?
How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let's grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that's being more successful. I don't -- I don't want to cut our commitment to education; I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.
And by the way, I've had that experience. I don't just talk about it. I've been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn't have commitment to education. It's because I care about education for all of our kids.
MR. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen, look --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I -- (inaudible) --
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me, one sec -- excuse, me sir. (Laughter.) We've got -- we've got -- barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say you've -- your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job --
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You've done a great job, Jim.
MR. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is, government -- the role of government and governing, we've lost a (pod ?), in other words, so we only have three minutes left in the -- in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here -- and remember, we've got three minutes total time here.
And the question is this: Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected in your case, if re-elected in your case, what would you do about that?
Governor?
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.
MR. LEHRER: Well, what would you do as president?
MR. ROMNEY: We -- as president, I will sit down on day one -- actually the day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders and -- as we did in my state. We met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state, in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis -- not because we're going to compromise our principle(s), but because there's common ground.
And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country, and we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East? There are developments around the world that are of real concern. And Republicans and Democrats both love America, but we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do it again.
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal ''Obamacare,'' which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.
(Laughter.)
But look, my philosophy has been I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity into the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That's how we repealed ''don't ask, don't tell.'' That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after al-Qaida and bin Laden.
So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House or Representatives. But ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, I'll sit down, but you have to have a plan.
Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say now to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when they fought back against us, reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had. When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have. And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things.
And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.
MR. LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss, and you elected to go last.
So you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think this was a terrific debate and I very much appreciate it.
And I want to thank the University of Denver.
You know, four years ago we were going through a major crisis, and yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people. Because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter, and now has a new job from that new training that she's gotten. Because of the company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession. The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world -- not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.
And so the question now is, how do we build on those strengths? And everything that I've tried to do and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system, or developing American energy, or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or -- or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future -- all those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination is -- is channeled, and -- and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed.
And everybody's getting a fair shot and everybody's getting a fair share. Everybody's doing a fair share and everybody's playing by the same rules.
You know, four years ago I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president. And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept. But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people and the middle class and all those who are striving to get in the middle class.
I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.
MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening. This is a -- this is an important election. And I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years. I know this is bigger than election about the two of us as individuals. It's bigger than our respective parties. It's an election about the course of America -- what kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.
And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening. And over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and vice presidential debate. We'll talk about those two paths. But they lead in very different directions. And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go; you can look at the record.
There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up. I'll get incomes up again. You'll see chronic unemployment. We've had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent. If I'm president, I will create -- help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.
If the president's re-elected, ''Obamacare'' will be fully installed. In my view, that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You're going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per -- per family. If I'm elected, we won't have ''Obamacare.'' We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured. And we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.
If the president were to be re-elected, you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare advantage. You'll have hospitals and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.
I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.
And finally, military. If the president's re-elected, you'll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating. I will not cut our commitment to our military. I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.
Thank you, Jim.
MR. LEHRER: Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The next debate will be the vice presidential event on Thursday, October 11th at Center College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night. (Cheers, applause.)

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Are Highest In 4 Years

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Unemployment is still high and the so-called fiscal cliff is looming, but those worries didn't slow down the nation's car and truck buyers in September.
Autos flew off the lot at the highest sales rate in four years, adjusted for seasonal variations, according to the research firm Autodata.
Over all, a total of 1.19 million cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s were sold in the United States during the month -- a 13 percent increase from a year ago. 
Japanese and German manufacturers led the sales boom, offsetting weaker results at General Motors and Ford.
The monthly sales rate equaled about 14.9 million vehicles on an annualized basis, and it was the highest seasonally adjusted rate since February 2008, according to Autodata.
Analysts said the robust pace was fed by consumers replacing older vehicles, the wide variety of new fuel-efficient models on the market and the greater availability of credit at low interest rates.
''The industry is continuing its comeback the old-fashioned way: with new products, better inventory management and historically cheap loans,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto research Web site TrueCar.com.
Overall industry sales are up 14.5 percent through the first nine months of the year, compared with the same period in 2011.
Many of the gains in September came at Toyota and Honda, the two big Japanese manufacturers that suffered major product shortages after last year's earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
''We all underestimated the strength of the Toyota and Honda brands and their customer loyalty,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''They have not only gained back their market share, but increased it.''
Toyota said that it sold 171,000 vehicles during the month, a 41.5 percent increase from a year ago. The company reported that sales of its Prius gas-electric hybrid cars more than doubled from last year.
Honda reported that its sales grew 30.9 percent, to 117,000 vehicles. The company benefited from high demand for its two best-selling passenger cars, the Civic and the Accord. Honda began selling a new version of the Accord in the middle of the month.
The performance of Toyota and Honda contrasted with essentially flat sales at both G.M. and Ford, partly because of tepid sales of pickup trucks.
G.M. said Tuesday that its overall sales grew by 1.5 percent during September, which the company said were its best results for the month since 2008. G.M. said it sold 210,245 vehicles; passenger cars led the way with a 29 percent gain.
But sales of the company's pickup trucks, which are big profit producers, dropped by 20 percent during September. G.M. attributed the decrease partly to a reduction in sales to rental fleets.
A G.M. executive said the automaker was trying to keep truck inventories low as it continued to focus on introducing new cars like the Chevrolet Spark.
''Passenger cars have been the launch point for a broad and deep G.M. product offensive,'' said Kurt McNeil, vice president for United States sales.
Ford said its total sales for September were down 0.2 percent from a year ago. Truck sales dropped 7.6 percent, wiping out gains made by new cars and S.U.V.'s like the Ford Focus and the Escape.
Ford said it sold 174,000 vehicles during the month, reporting its best results in small cars, sales of which increased by 73 percent.
''Fuel economy remains one of the most important features customers want today,'' said Ken Czubay, Ford's head of United States marketing, sales and service.
Sales of the company's top seller, the F-series pickup, grew by just 1.2 percent during September, and sales of its Lincoln luxury brand fell 3.1 percent.
One industry analyst said stock investors were betting that an uptick in housing starts would eventually fuel an increase in pickup sales.
''The most popular theme in auto land appears to be to buy companies with pickup exposure,'' Brian Johnson of Barclays wrote in a research report on Tuesday.
While G.M. and Ford struggled somewhat, Chrysler continued its steady comeback from very weak sales after its government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009.
Chrysler said its September sales increased 11.5 percent from the year-ago period, its 30th consecutive month of year-over-year sales gains. The company said it sold 142,000 vehicles, and each of its brands had gains, led by an 18 percent increase at Dodge.
The company benefited from the introduction of its Dodge Dart compact sedan, the first high-mileage small car Chrysler has produced since it was acquired by the Italian automaker Fiat. It also outperformed its Detroit rivals in pickups with a 4 percent increase in sales of Ram pickups.
Chrysler's top American sales executive, Reid Bigland, said the industry's recovery appeared to be gaining steam in the latter part of the year.
''Going forward with our current product lineup, record low interest rates and a stable U.S. economy, we remain optimistic about the health of the U.S. new-vehicle sales industry and our position in it,'' Mr. Bigland said.
Other carmakers reported mixed results during the month. Nissan said it sold 91,000 vehicles, a 1.1 percent decline from a year ago. Like G.M. and Ford, it was hurt by the resurgence at Toyota and Honda.
One of the hottest manufacturers during the month continued to be Volkswagen. The German carmaker, which is already expanding its new assembly plant in Tennessee, said it sold 48,000 Volkswagen and Audi brand vehicles in September, a 32.4 percent increase from a year ago.

HEADLINE: Wright Masterwork Is Seen in a New Light: A Fight for Its Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
It's hard to say which is more startling. That a developer in Phoenix could threaten -- by Thursday, no less -- to knock down a 1952 house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Or that the house has until now slipped under the radar, escaping the attention of most architectural historians, even though it is one of Wright's great works, a spiral home for his son David.
The prospect of its demolition has suddenly galvanized preservationists, as these crises often belatedly do. They are pursuing a two-pronged attack, trying to have the building designated a landmark, although in Arizona, where private property rights are strong, landmark status is really just a stay of execution, limited to three years. After that the owner is free to tear down the place. So the other prong of attack is to find some preservation-minded angel with deep pockets who will buy it from the developer. Preferably today.
Wright designed this 2,500-square-foot concrete home for David and his wife, Gladys, on a desert site facing north toward Camelback Mountain in a neighborhood called Arcadia. The area, known since the 1920s for its citrus groves and romantic getaway resorts among old Spanish colonial and adobe revival homes, was increasingly subdivided after the war and filled with new, custom-designed ranch houses. 
But the Wright lot still had its orange trees. The architect took advantage of them by raising his son's house on columns, to provide views over the orchard. It was a touch that partly echoed Le Corbusier's famous Villa Savoye in France; at the same time Wright chose a spiral design akin to the Guggenheim Museum's. He had drawn plans for the Guggenheim by then, but it was still some years away from construction.
The David Wright house is the Guggenheim's prodigal son, except that unlike the museum, whose interior creates a vertical streetscape while turning its back on the city, David's house was configured by Wright to look both inward and out. It twists around a central courtyard, a Pompeian oasis to which he gave a plunge pool and shade garden, but also faces onto the surrounding desert, with sweeping views of the mountain.
The house is coiled, animated, like a rattlesnake, yet flowing and open. A spiral entrance ramp gives it a processional grandeur out of proportion to its size -- especially nowadays, when many of the old ranch homes in Arcadia have been torn down to make way for McMansions that dwarf Wright's house. The developer's plan for the site involves subdividing the lot and erecting two or more new houses.
''There is no house quite like this one, with its mythic content,'' is how Neil Levine, the architectural historian and Wright scholar, put it the other day. ''Everything is custom designed so that the house is, more than most of Wright's later buildings, a complete work of art.''
How could such a house go largely unnoticed? David and Gladys Wright didn't want their home in a residential neighborhood to be a museum, and so not many architectural scholars or even Wright experts ever got inside it, to see the rug and chairs and mahogany woodwork that Wright devised, even though it is only about a dozen miles from Taliesin West, the headquarters of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation.
David died in 1997 at 102; Gladys in 2008, at 104, leaving the house, no longer in mint condition, to granddaughters who sold it to a buyer promising to fix it up and live in it. But the buyer did neither, and the place, on its 2.2-acre lot, went back on the market. This June a developer called 8081 Meridian bought it.
''The place was uninhabited for four years and it had never been placed on a watch list,'' explained John Hoffman, managing partner of 8081 Meridian, when I called him on Monday. ''We didn't close on the property until the city approved a lot split. The line through the property went through one end of the house, so it was an indirect approval for demolition.''
That was his interpretation, although demolition requires separate city approval, and in any case, before the sale closed, the landmark process was already under way. It is scheduled to reach the City Council on Nov. 7. Though not written into the city ordinance, it has for several years been city policy in Phoenix to seek owner consent before designating any building for historic preservation, and because 8081 Meridian never gave its consent, and has no intention of doing so, Mr. Hoffman says he rejects the landmark process outright.
The threatened deadline derives from a demolition permit that a staff member in the city development office issued to him and his partner, Steve Sells, despite the fact that other city officials had flagged the house to ensure no permit would be issued.
Planning authorities learned of the permit and voided it after the demolition company the developer had hired, concerned about razing a Wright house, called to check that the permit was valid. Mr. Hoffman maintains that the permit is legal and that it expires on Thursday.
It may be that the demolition threat is being used as leverage to drive up the price to be paid by preservationists. Having just bought the house for $1.8 million, Mr. Hoffman said 8081 Meridian is looking to clear $2.2 million from any sale, and has so far rejected a cash offer floated several weeks ago from an anonymous, out-of-state Wright lover. This prospective buyer promised a little over $2 million, according to the realtor representing him.
Underlying the brouhaha is a proposition Arizona voters passed in 2006, Prop 207, which calls for the compensation of owners any time the government adopts some regulation that affects the value of their property. No money has been paid so far, but the law has clearly had its desired effect, making cities like Phoenix fearful of changing their regulations and spooking city lawyers and historic preservationists.
The bottom line, for economic as well as cultural reasons, should of course be protecting both owners and society. Toothless though a three-year landmark delay may seem, it's an eternity in pro-development Arizona, and it can work. Various owners in the Woodland Historic District in Phoenix, near the State Capitol, were dissuaded, during just such a reprieve, from tearing down early-20th-century bungalows, and with some city historic preservation bond money, have begun a restoration that has revitalized the area.
Years ago Phoenix prevented the owner of El Encanto Apartments, a conspicuous Spanish Colonial low-rise, from tearing it down to put up a high-rise, and the stay helped shift the building into the hands of a preservation-minded developer.
As for sparing the David and Gladys Wright house, you don't have to be a preservationist to believe that a major work by one of the greatest American architects has a value to posterity, as well as to its Arcadia neighbors, that competes with the interests of developers, who are already well placed to make a healthy profit after just a few months' investment. In retrospect, steps should have been taken long ago, by Wright's heirs and by city officials, to avoid all this.
But what's now a cliffhanger is also a no-brainer.

HEADLINE: Trying to Build for the Future, The Athletics Win in a Hurry

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
The Oakland Athletics were the inspiration last year for a surprising Hollywood hit: ''Moneyball,'' a movie about baseball economics, one that, through astute casting, made the geeky world of advanced player statistics seem sexy.
The A's are back this season as ripe material for a sequel, though not to ''Moneyball.'' Instead, think of ''Major League,'' with Charlie Sheen, not Brad Pitt. In that 1989 movie, a team desperate for a new stadium has traded away most of its high-priced players and allowed others to leave through free agency. The roster is filled with mostly rookies and a few lesser-known veterans, and they start the season playing to tiny crowds. There is even a mysterious Cuban slugger with a propensity for long home runs. 
The A's are certainly on script. Before the season, in a sell-off of talent aimed at stockpiling young players whose promise might help the club relocate to a new stadium in San Jose, the A's traded their best pitcher and their star closer; they fielded a team that has so far seen a record 99 games started by rookie pitchers; they have been ignited by a young Cuban slugger who was previously known to much of the world only through his YouTube video clips; and they've played in a stadium that is more an embarrassing contraption than a ballpark -- with a third of its seats permanently closed off because of poor attendance.
Through it all, they have won ballgames at a remarkable rate, qualifying for the playoffs in a run far more unlikely than those pulled off by the teams depicted in ''Moneyball.'' They have done it with strong pitching, superb defense, timely hitting and a great deal of youthful swagger.
''They play with no conscience,'' said Ron Washington, the former A's coach who now manages their rivals the Texas Rangers. ''They're not afraid of nobody right now.''
''Moneyball'' told the tale of Billy Beane, the team's brilliant general manager, who found novel ways to define how and why players are valuable and then acquired valuable players on the cheap. With his cutting-edge methods, he built a winning team and annoyed the sport's establishment along the way.
Beane, played by Mr. Pitt in a performance that drew an Academy Award nomination, is still in charge of the A's, and he has not abandoned his beliefs. But the team's success this season, to be frank, was not supposed to happen. The Athletics, entering the season's final two games, could finish with the best record in the American League.
''This is a team that knows it can do a lot of things,'' Jarrod Parker, one of the five rookies in Oakland's starting rotation, told reporters Monday after a victory that clinched a playoff spot. ''It's no surprise to me. It might be a surprise to everybody else.''
Michael Lewis, the author of the book ''Moneyball,'' on which the movie was based, said of the 2012 team: ''The spirit of the thing still feels kind of the same. I still feel like they look different from other teams. There is this misfit-toys quality to them.''
If the Athletics lacked outsize ambitions at season's start, they have had plenty to overcome to mount their outsider's run. The team's top two starters were both lost for the season, one of them struck in the head by a line drive on Sept. 5. The other, Bartolo Colon, was suspended for 50 games after testing positive for a banned substance. (It might be noted that Charlie Sheen's character in ''Major League'' was never drug-tested.)
Through Monday, the team's offense had provided enough runs to win games despite producing the fifth fewest hits in the majors. Relying on home runs to make up for a dearth of base runners, Oakland was just 15th in runs scored.
The modest offensive output was not unexpected, for the Athletics' theme heading into the season had appeared to be capitulation rather than triumph.
Beane raised eyebrows by trading away the team's top starting pitchers, Gio Gonzalez and Trevor Cahill, and the team's closer, Andrew Bailey, in cost-cutting moves that yielded 10 prospects. He also let Josh Willingham and David DeJesus, two-thirds of the 2011 starting outfield, leave via free agency.
Gonzalez has won 21 games for the Washington Nationals and could well win the National League Cy Young Award. Willingham has hit 35 home runs for the Minnesota Twins.
Beane's moves were designed for the future. The club, long beleaguered by meager attendance, wants badly to relocate to San Jose, to draw fans, and, yes, make and spend money.
''That place is a pit,'' Mr. Lewis said of the club's current home, the Oakland Coliseum. ''It's a horrible place to try to run a baseball team from. But it makes his life more interesting. Operating with constraints, in a lot of ways, is more energizing than not having them. It forces him to think about things differently. In some weird way, I bet it makes Billy better at his job.''
Beane's decisions, made with an eye on the horizon, have certainly affected the present in a fantastic way.
Most significant has been the production of the team's rookie pitchers. Parker (acquired in the Cahill trade) and Tommy Milone (acquired in the Gonzalez trade) have led the way. The bullpen has been excellent as well, with Ryan Cook (also acquired for Cahill) being one of the team's best relievers.
Outfielder Josh Reddick, acquired from the Boston Red Sox as part of the Bailey trade, had 32 home runs through Monday, the most on the team. Yoenis Cespedes, the mysterious Cuban, was signed to a four-year, $36 million contract that seemed incongruous with Beane's other moves. He has rewarded the faith by batting .290 with 23 home runs and 16 stolen bases.
As a result, the Athletics have been among the most exciting teams in baseball, winning 14 games in the team's final at-bat, tops in the majors. That late-game magic, combined with the ability of starting pitchers Parker and Brett Anderson to dominate batters, has the Athletics poised to be one of the teams most feared in the postseason.
''We're just a bunch of young guys having fun,'' said Coco Crisp, one of the team's few veterans. ''You wouldn't think all these rookies would be doing things like this.''
Not even Beane. Certainly not Mr. Lewis, his co-conspirator on ''Moneyball.''
''They are still very data-driven,'' Mr. Lewis said of the Athletics. ''But this team required enormous luck.''

HEADLINE: What Will Asia's Ascendance Bring?

BYLINE: PANKAJ MISHRA


HIGHLIGHT: The International Herald Tribune began life in Oct. 4, 1887 as the European edition of The New York Herald. In a special 125th anniversary issue, we recall the world as the paper captured it, and we look into the future. Here, an essay by Pankaj Mishra on the implications of the rise of Asia. 

 BODY:
 In 1889, two years after an eccentric American millionaire established the European edition of The New York Herald, the precursor of the International Herald Tribune, Rudyard Kipling dined with some British businessmen in Hong Kong. The imperial rulers of China, most recently humiliated by France, had reluctantly started to modernize their vast domain; and British entrepreneurs, who had long chafed at the Middle Kingdom's stubborn isolationism, were drawn to the new possibility of investments and profits.
 Kipling, however, worried that these men who were doing their best to ''force upon the great Empire all the stimulants of the West - railways, tramlines, and so forth'' were deeply misguided. ''What will happen,'' he wondered, ''when China really wakes up, runs a line from Shanghai to Lhasa, and controls her own gun-factories and arsenals?''
 The future feared by Kipling, in which Asians adopt the stimulants of Western countries and the East comes dangerously close to meeting the West as equals, is now our present: the abrupt emergence of China, after an intense period of economic globalization, and the redrawing of Asia's political and economic relationships will define the next 125 years just as the previous century and a quarter was defined by a worldwide diffusion of Western models of politics, economy and culture.
 But in the late 1880s, the rise of the East and the relative decline of the West would have seemed very remote. Having broken out of their small continent, Europeans were still in the middle of an unprecedented global expansion, fueled by industrial capitalism.
 Most of Asia's predominantly agrarian societies had been subordinated; and the scramble for Africa, which even Germany, a latecomer to imperial expansion, would join, had only just begun. In less than a decade, the United States, having completed its internal expansion, would also start an international quest for markets and territories; and Kipling would be on hand to exhort the country to share the white man's burden and civilize the natives of Asia and Africa.
 This white man's presumption was not baseless. The political and philosophical breakthroughs of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment combined with the industrial revolution had brought about a radical new vision of human possibility - one previously unknown to or untested by the agrarian, religious-minded and communitarian peoples of Europe as well as Asia and Africa. 
 This new conception of the good life, defined for centuries by association with religious virtue, had as its center the sovereign individual: liberated from older obligations to guild and church, his pursuit of self-interest would be henceforth assisted by continuous technical innovation, commercial expansion and the political institutions of the nation-state.
 Competing European empires brought this new vision to Asia and Africa through the 19th century; and easy successes over poorly equipped natives seemed to vindicate it. Thus, Woodrow Wilson in 1901, the high noon of imperialism, confidently proclaiming ''the universal world of commerce,'' could say that ''the East is to be opened and transformed'' and ''the standards of the West are to be imposed upon it.''
 Many in the East had already taken notice of such intentions. Visiting the United States in 1903, just as it manipulated its way into control of the Panama Canal route, China's foremost modern intellectual, Liang Qichao (who was also a major early influence on Mao Zedong), concluded that China had to rapidly build an industrial and military base in order to survive.
 This meant first organizing the loosely knit peoples of far-flung empires into citizens of nation-states with coherent identities and shared goals. It is hard to underestimate just how the search for self-strengthening along Western lines was to provoke a widespread reinvention of tradition.
 Many Asian intellectuals and activists like Liang, for instance, came to believe that a clear belief system like Christianity was one of the secrets of Western power. Consequently, religions like Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, which were practiced variously across Asia, began to acquire hard-edged political identities in the late 19th century.
The real boost to Asian efforts, however, came in 1905, when Japan unexpectedly defeated Russia in the epochal Battle of Tsushima. Shocked out of isolation by American battleships, Japan had quickly modernized itself into an industrial nation-state - to the point where it threatened European imperialisms in Asia.
Its success first revealed to Asia's thinkers and leaders - from Ataturk in Turkey to Gandhi in India and Sun Yat-sen in China - how Asian countries, initially bullied by the West, could strengthen themselves enough to both adopt and resist the ''standards of the West.''
Within two decades, assisted considerably by the West's self-inflicted wounds from World War I, there would be strong political movements across Asia, encompassing military modernizers in Turkey, nonviolent nationalist parties in India and Egypt and communist revolutionaries in China, Java and Vietnam.
 Indeed, communism seemed to many in Asia to be a way of matching Western power through Western methods. As the disasters of Stalin and Mao showed, this ideology apparently opposed to capitalism did not depart from the Western vision of endless growth and abundance, with its overarching blueprint of rapid industrialization aided by systematic exploitation of natural resources.
Decolonization - the biggest event of the 20th century - did not fundamentally alter the pattern of left-behind countries seeking to catch up with the West. Early failures, especially in the Muslim world, doomed many societies to near-permanent political instability. And calamities like the Great Famine almost undermined China.
Since then there have been some mixed successes: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Turkey are all supposedly ''rising'' and collectively shrinking the political and economic power of the West.
 But the global cultures originating in the West, which began to travel deep into most non-Western societies in the 19th century, are not so easily supplanted. The second half of the 20th century was marked in particular by the worldwide proliferation of consumer lifestyles emanating from the United States. As Henry Luce pointed out in his seminal essay ''American Century,'' ''American jazz, Hollywood movies, American slang, American machines and patented products, are in fact the only things that every community in the world, from Zanzibar to Hamburg, recognizes in common.''
 This internationalization of taste exacted a heavy price from many local cultures. Premodern crafts did not have much of a chance against shiny mass-manufactured goods. But even entire literary and linguistic cultures of great sophistication were vanquished by the predominance of English.
 That said, most Asian cultures did not simply capitulate, or discard their traditions, as in Turkey and China, for the sake of an elusive modernization. In India, for instance, a proactive postcolonial state helped rediscover and revitalize many of its indigenous dances, music and handicrafts.
 Globalization combined with mass immigration has helped unleash new forms of hybridity and cultural diffusion. Hollywood may spell cultural imperialism to the French, but its empire has stalled in India, whose indigenously produced films cater to a large diaspora as well as domestic audiences. Similarly, Al Jazeera, Japanese comics, Taiwanese pop music and Turkish soaps have carved their own spheres of influence in large parts of the world.
 World religions, too, have been transformed in the age of mass mobility and communications. Islam has gone D.I.Y. in the hands of televangelists preaching to Muslims who live without the consolations of traditional authority in urban areas of Europe and America. Christianity, rapidly declining in Europe, has a new lease on life among enterprising Chinese and Latin Americans.
 But the diversity of global cultures cannot hide the basic uniformity of the economic path chosen by nearly all countries (save outliers like North Korea and Cuba). It is a pattern that first appeared in industrializing Europe in the 19th century - huge shifts from rural-subsistence to urban-professional lifestyles, and consumer-oriented economic development - and now replicates itself ad infinitum in the most unlikely corners of the world.
 Superficially, this sounds like a long overdue redistribution of the world's richness. Louis Vuitton recently opened an outlet in Ulan Bator, following Mongolia's discovery by the world's commodity extractors and traders, who have already made Angola's hotel rooms the most expensive in the world, and who are also eyeing war-ravaged Afghanistan's underground treasures of oil, gold, iron ore, copper and lithium.
 But as we absorb the unexpected news of rapidly melting polar ice caps, drought in the United States, monsoon failure in India and freakish weather everywhere, we can only marvel at the hubristic project of bringing to billions of people the good life enjoyed so far by a few hundred million Europeans and Americans.
 There is little doubt that it will fail, and the fallout - political, economic and environmental - will define the next few decades.
 In China, the largest migration in history from rural areas to urban ones has just occurred. In August 2010, a 100-kilometer, or 60-mile, traffic jam outside Beijing that lasted 11 days outlined an alarming future for China's new cities, which by 2020 are likely to have an additional 350 million people - more than the population of United States. The country, now the world's biggest car market, will need to pave an estimated five billion square meters, or about six billion square yards, of roads by 2025 simply to avoid turning its existing ones into enormous parking lots.
An energy boom in North America may reduce the United States' politically calamitous dependence on Middle Eastern oil. But it is China's turn now to grow addicted to foreign sources of energy - a development that is already provoking conflicts with its neighbors.
''Rising'' nations must also deal with grave domestic challenges. Tens of thousands of protests each year attest to a growing intolerance of inequality and corruption in China. Exalted to BRIC economic status, South Africa now contends with militant disaffection among its working classes. An armed insurgency led by forest-dwelling tribal peoples resisting the dispossession of their lands by mining companies has broken out in central India.
 In Iran, the enforced uprooting of millions of people from their rural habitats created the reservoir of rage and resentment that erupted in the Islamic Revolution of 1979. In much of the Arab world, failed modernization by capitalist as well as socialist regimes has led to the resurrection of Islamist parties, with the militant Islamists waiting in the wings.
 The greatest beneficiaries of economic growth in Asia themselves do not seem very content. A recent survey, led by the University of Southern California, of predominantly urban people in China revealed ''no evidence of a marked increase in life satisfaction'' to match the fourfold rise in prosperity and consumption from 1990 to 2010.
This was, of course, predicted by many of Asia's greatest thinkers and leaders. As the Chinese philosopher Zhang Junmai pointed out in the 1920s, speaking about the Asian peoples exposed to the stimulants of the West, their traditional principles are ''quietism, as opposed to Western activism; spiritual satisfaction, as opposed to the striving for material advantage; a self-sufficient agrarianism, as opposed to profit-seeking mercantilism; and a morally transforming sense of brotherhood rather than racial segregation. A nation founded on agriculture lacks a knowledge of the industrial arts, but it is likewise without material demands; thus, though it exists over a long period of time, it can still maintain a standard of poverty but equality, scarcity but peace. But how will it be hereafter?''
 Zhang could see as clearly as Kipling in 1889 how the West's great power had helped concentrate income, resources and opportunities among a small minority, and relegated most people to permanently playing catch-up. ''It is abundantly clear,'' Zhang wrote, ''who are the strong and who the weak, who the fit and the unfit, in today's world.''
But Zhang did not think that the East could ever match the West in the way Kipling feared. ''In the future,'' he predicted, ''a condition of prosperity without equality, wealth without peace, will probably prevail.''
Zhang's qualification ''probably'' may sound too naïve amid a deepening political and economic crisis worldwide. For that future he dreaded, the East's stalled makeover in the image of the West, is now with us, and makes the next 125 years seem a very sobering prospect.
 Pankaj Mishra, an Indian novelist and essayist, contributes regularly to The Guardian, The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books, and is the author of several books, including the recent ''From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia.''

HEADLINE: The Rise and Fall of Wages

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Jobs have been lost and labor made more costly because of various safety-net measures that help the poor and the unemployed, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. 
Aggregate wage-rate data show no sign of the huge and prolonged demand shock said to have hit the economy in 2008. Instead, they bear the fingerprints of an expanded social-safety net.
A conventional narrative of the American labor market since 2007 is that the demand for labor collapsed, so that despite a uniformly willing and eager work force, millions of people had to go without jobs. This narrative is an aggregate theory and not primarily about sectoral shifts that would depress demand for some types of labor and increase it for others. If this narrative is accurate, it should be visible in aggregate wage-rate data.
At a minimum, the aggregate demand collapse should have frozen wage rates in dollar terms, so that inflation-adjusted wages would erode with inflation as consumer prices crept up. With the price index for consumer items 8 percent higher at the end of 2011 than it was when the recession began, inflation-adjusted hourly wages should have fallen at least 8 percent over that time frame, if not more.
In my view, the change in aggregate demand has been heavily exaggerated, and the greater impulse affecting the labor market over the last five years has been higher marginal tax rates created by an expanding social safety net of unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicare and other anti-poverty programs. Those tax rates, as I noted last week, refer "to the extra taxes paid, and subsidies forgone, as a result of working, expressed as a ratio to the income from working." 
I expected real wage rates (and hourly labor productivity) to rise in the short term, and to do so a couple of percentage points above the previous upward trend made possible by continuing progress of the productivity of labor and capital.

Marginal tax rates increase real wage rates a few percentage points in the short term because, with more help during unemployment, employees at struggling businesses have less reason to make some of the concessions in wages and working conditions that can help the employer to retain employees affordably.
As I explain in "The Redistribution Recession," wage rates would quickly fall back toward the trend line when some of the temporary safety-net measures began to expire, which was two or three years after the recession began.
Those safety-net expansions that were permanent would eventually reduce average real wage rates, as people out of work reduced their human capital investment. This reduction might reflect people who, because they no longer practice a trade, lose contacts in the workplace or no longer maintain a wardrobe or tools they need for work. (For more on this effect, see especially the literature on women's wage trends.) Unfortunately, these wage reductions do not encourage employers to hire because they derive from reductions in productivity.
The black series in Chart 1 below shows aggregate real wage rates measured as inflation-adjusted employee compensation (including fringe benefits like health insurance) per hour worked. I have removed an upward trend, because for short-run analysis it is interesting to look at deviations from trends. Under normal conditions real wages can increase with productivity even while the amount of labor is neither rising nor falling.
The chart also shows in red the marginal tax rate on labor income measured in my book for a typical household head or spouse based on the ever-changing eligibility and benefit rules for safety-net programs. Sure enough, real hourly compensation increased during the recession and did so about a quarter after marginal tax rates began their increase.
Marginal tax rates were high and fairly flat during 2009 and early 2010 as the "stimulus" law was in full force. During this time, real wages failed to fall back anywhere close to their prerecession values. Only when some of the stimulus provisions began to expire, reflected in a marginal tax rate that falls to 44 or 45 percent from 48 percent, did real wage rates decline quickly and significantly.
Even after the decline in late 2010 and early 2011, it looks as though real wage rates are about where the previous trend line was, rather than being the several percentage points below what one might expect after a huge, prolonged demand shock.
A few economists have used Census Bureau wage data, which ignore the fringe benefits from employment, to show that wages fell during 2010 and 2011. It is incorrect to ignore fringe benefits (I discuss this and other wage measurement issues in Chapter 2 of "The Redistribution Recession"), but the choice of series is just a quibble, because none of the aggregate wage measures display a cumulative decline that would be commensurate with the huge, prolonged demand collapse said to have occurred.
A magnifying glass is not required to see a decline in after-tax real wage rates. The after-tax real wage rate (calculated as the product of real hourly compensation and one minus the marginal tax rate shown in black in Chart 2), reflects the net financial reward per hour of working, taking into account taxes and safety-net subsidies.
Marginal tax-rate changes, such as those created by an expanding social safety net, cause deviations between the real hourly compensation shown in Chart 1 and the after-tax series shown in Chart 2. In theory, the downward marginal tax rate effect on after-tax real wages exceeds the upward effect on real hourly compensation. 
In fact, after-tax real wages fell a startling 12 percent below the trend line during the first two years of the recession (note that each tick in Chart 2 is twice as large as each tick in Chart 1). They rebounded somewhat as marginal tax rates came off their stimulus highs but still remain six or seven percentage points below the trend line.
The quantity of labor - hours worked per capita including zeros for people not working - is shown as a red series in Chart 2. Remarkably, labor and after-tax real wage rates collapse together, hit bottom together and exhibit a partial recovery together.
Helping the poor and unemployed is intrinsically valuable, but is not free. It has made labor more expensive and depresses employment.

HEADLINE: Overseas Cash and the Tax Games Multinationals Play

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: What to do with a tax system that invites gamesmanship by American companies and their advisers? 

 BODY:
More than a trillion dollars in cash and short-term investments sits in offshore holding companies, awaiting a repatriation tax holiday. In the meantime, tax professionals spin out ways to game the system. 
The tax code provides multinationals based in the United States with many incentives to shift income to foreign low-tax jurisdictions. In theory, American corporations are taxed at 35 percent on their worldwide income. But income earned by an active controlled foreign corporation is not usually taxed until the cash is repatriated to the parent company in the United States as a dividend. 
From a policy perspective, the problem is not so much that tax on foreign income is deferred, but rather that United States income is being masqueraded as foreign income. 
 Many multinationals use transfer pricing (the pricing of goods and services sold between affiliates of a parent company) to minimize their global tax rate. After transferring intellectual property to low-tax jurisdictions like Puerto Rico, Ireland and Singapore, companies manipulate licensing and cost-sharing arrangements to avoid or reduce United States taxes. Cash from global operations is then parked offshore until the tax professionals can figure out how to get it home tax-free. 
Microsoft, for example, now holds more than $50 billion in foreign cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Appleholds more than $100 billion in foreign cash and investments - an amount roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Vietnam. 
Accounting rules make the situation worse. Based on a presumption that the earnings of a foreign subsidiary will eventually be distributed to the United States parent company, the promise of a future 35 percent tax on repatriated income often creates a deferred tax liability on the consolidated balance sheet. There is an exception, however, for "permanently reinvested earnings" - that is, earnings the parent company does not need and is indefinitely or permanently reinvesting overseas. If a company can convince its accountants that the cash will be reinvested overseas and is not needed at home, the company can avoid recognizing a tax liability on its balance sheet. 
Congress is largely to blame. In 2004, the United States temporarily reduced the tax rate on repatriations to roughly 5 percent. The problem was not just the lost revenue or the false promise of a flood of new domestic investment. The tax holiday also raised expectations for future tax holidays, and companies have changed their behavior accordingly by hoarding cash offshore. 
Many companies now find themselves holding a particularly awkward pose - simultaneously accessing cash for stock buybacks, acquisitions and working capital needs while maintaining the false financial-reporting premise that the cash is indefinitely reinvested overseas. 
A recent hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations highlighted one technique. According to the subcommittee report, Hewlett-Packard used a loan program employing overseas cash to de facto repatriate billions of dollars each year to finance most of H.P.'s American operations without paying the repatriation tax. 
H.P. used alternating loans from two offshore entities, one in Belgium and another in the Cayman Islands, during 45-day windows to technically meet an exception for "short term" loans. The subcommittee report explains that a pattern of "continuous lending appeared to be occurring for most of the period between 2008 through 2011."
The legality of this loan program is questionable. In similar cases, the Internal Revenue Service has successfully argued that a series of short-term loans should be recast as what it is in substance: a single long-term loan that would be treated as a cash repatriation under Section 956 of the tax code. In an e-mail attached as an exhibit to the subcommittee report, an Ernst & Young adviser warned that with respect to the H.P. loan program, "the I.R.S. may seek to apply the substance over form [doctrine] to transactions that it views as abusive." 
A conservative adviser might have stopped there and advised against the scheme. Instead, Ernst & Young sprinkled holy water on the transaction, explaining: "We do believe that we can get comfortable with a 'should' level of opinion, assuming H.P. avoids behavior that could be interpreted as abusive." 
Should-level opinions and getting comfortable are, increasingly, telltale signs of aggressive tax behavior, as is a warning not to write down the goal of the transactions. "Documents and/or workpapers that indicate an intention to circumvent or otherwise abuse the spirit of section 956," the e-mail warns, "could prove particularly troublesome and thus should be avoided." 
No one will be surprised when, after a new tax holiday, companies bring back "permanently" reinvested cash to conduct stock buybacks. As another Ernst & Young adviser wrote: "An assertion of indefinite or permanent investment until Congress changes the law allowing cheaper repatriation again doesn't sound permanent." 
Hoarding cash in tax havens is evidence of the implicit cost of international tax deferral, as companies engage in wasteful tax planning techniques and fail to allocate economic resources in an efficient manner. 
There is reason to be equally concerned about companies that respect the accounting rules and, in order to avoid the repatriation tax, actually reinvest overseas. Evidence suggests that accounting-motivated foreign direct investments achieve a lower rate of return than investments in the United States. As economic theory would predict, corporate managers are willing to accept a lower pretax rate of return and create jobs overseas rather than paying the repatriation tax and create jobs at home.
The tax system that creates these incentives is in need of attention. A territorial tax system with better policing of transfer pricing is one option. A worldwide consolidation system without tax deferral is a better one. And a lower corporate tax rate would help. 
Until then, we can expect further scrutiny of tax professionals struggling to navigate a system that begs for gamesmanship.

HEADLINE: Refinancing Spikes as Mortgage Rates Fall

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Mortgage refinancing rose to a three-year high in late September as interest rates slid. 

 BODY:
Is it time to think about refinancing -- or perhaps, re-refinancing?
Mortgage refinancing jumped to a three-year high, as interest rates on home loans dropped to new lows, according to a weekly industry survey from theMortgage Bankers Association.
Mortgage applications overall increased 16.6 percent from one week earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week that ended Sept. 28, according to the association's Market Composite Index, a measure of loan application volume. The survey covers more than three-fourths of all retail home mortgage applications in the United States, and has been conducted weekly since 1990.
The Refinance Index, meanwhile, increased 20 percent from the previous week. This was the highest refinance index recorded in the survey since April 2009.
"Refinance application volume jumped to the highest level in more than three years last week as each of the five mortgage rates in the M.B.A.'s dropped to new record lows in the survey," Mike Fratantoni, the association's vice president of research and economics, said in a prepared statement.
He said the markets are continuing to adjust as the Federal Reserve's initiative to buy bonds known as mortgage-backed securities, dubbed "QE3," pushes rates lower.
The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 83 percent of total applications, from 81 percent the previous week.
The average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with "conforming" loan balances (meaning $417,500 or less) fell to 3.53 percent from 3.63 percent, while the average rate for 30-year fixed-rate jumbo loans (greater than $417,500) fell to 3.82 percent from 3.87 percent.
The average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration fell to 3.37 percent.
Those who can swing the monthly payments for a 15-year fixed rate mortgage saw the average rate decline to 2.90 percent.
Are low rates causing you to consider refinancing? Have you refinanced previously?

HEADLINE: A Tug of War Over Solar Tariffs

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: At a hearing, proponents of government tariffs on solar panels imported from China said that such measures were vital to saving American manufacturers from unfair competition. Foes said they would protect companies that made poor business choices. 

 BODY:
The United States trade case against Chinese manufacturers of solar panels took a step toward completion Wednesday with a final hearing before the International Trade Commission on whether cheap Chinese imports have injured or threatened to injure the domestic solar industry.
The Commerce Department found earlier this year that Chinese companies, which dominate the global panel business, were benefiting from unfair government subsidies and were selling their products below the cost of production on the American market. In March, the department imposed anti-subsidy tariffs of 2.9 percent to 4.73 percent, and in May, it added anti-dumping duties of at least 31 percent. Those rulings were preliminary, and the department is due to announce its final decision on both on Oct. 10.
But for any tariffs to go into effect, the trade commission must find that the Chinese pricing practices have actually harmed or threatened to harm the American industry, a determination that is not expected until November.
The solar case has become one of the sharpest sticking points in growing trade tensions between the United States and China that have surfaced in the presidential contest as well. 
In trying to make a case for harm, a group of American solar industry executives told the panel of commissioners on Wednesday that they had been forced to close plants, scale back production and lay off workers at a time when they should have been able to take advantage of rising demand for their products. They said that they were unfairly undercut by Chinese suppliers that had been able to sell at a loss and continue operating, despite tottering on the brink of bankruptcy, because of generous support from state-owned banks.
Kevin Kilkelly, president of sales in the Americas for SolarWorld, the German-based manufacturer that originally filed the trade complaint, said that his company had already shut down one facility and laid off nearly 200 workers.
"Now, more workers and production at our Hillsboro, Oregon, facility are threatened," he said. "We hope that with relief from this case, we will be able to stop the harm to this industry and return to fair competition in this market."
But tariff opponents argued that SolarWorld had largely brought its problems on itself, and had proved unable to compete in a world where the low price of natural gas and declining subsidies were putting pressure on solar manufacturers to cut their prices sharply in order to survive. SolarWorld, they said, had bet on a more expensive technology for its panels and failed to pursue the potentially lucrative utility sector quickly enough.
Alan King, general manager of Canadian Solar's business in the United States, said that it was critical to pick an efficient technology, but one that would work in the marketplace. He named Evergreen Solar and Solyndra, both bankrupt, as companies that had not made good choices.
"The continuing importance of innovation in the solar industry cannot be overstated," he said. "Our goal has to be to reach grid parity."
Some said that the trade dispute had harmed their businesses because of a preliminary finding of "critical circumstances" that allows the tariffs to be applied retroactively to goods entering the country 90 days before the ruling. The International Trade Commission will uphold or reject that finding, assuming that it remains in the Commerce Department's final determination in the case. 
Marco Mangelsdorf, a solar contractor from Hilo, Hawaii, told the panel he had received a notice that he owed about $138,000 in duties - his profit for the year - on a $54,000 order placed before the tariff announcement.
He said that he had become "collateral damage in a much wider economic and political dispute between countries and titans of the solar electric industry."
"To harshly penalize me and my small business and employees, along with the other independent American businesses caught in this same government retroactive tariffs dragnet, cannot and should not be seen as just or fair," Mr. Mangelsdorf said.

HEADLINE: Video Offers Glimpses of Tehran Protests

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Iranian journalists working from outside the country shared video and photographs posted online by people who said they witnessed Wednesday's protests in Tehran. 

 BODY:
Last Updated, 8:04 p.m. As my colleague Thomas Erdbrink reports, shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar closed their doors on Wednesday, after a protest by foreign-currency traders nearby was attacked by the security forces. The protests came as pressure from international sanctions caused a sudden plunge in the value of Iran's currency, the rial, which has in turn played havoc with the buying and selling of foreign currency, angering merchants and the capital's black-market money-changers, who work along Ferdowsi Avenue in central Tehran.
Iranian journalists and bloggers working from outside the country shared video and photographs posted online by people who said they witnessed Wednesday's protests in Tehran's commercial center. 
A reporter for the BBC's Persian-language service, Rana Rahimpour, pointed to video uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday morning, showing protesters marching into the bazaar, chanting, "Dignified merchants, support us, support us."
Ms. Rahimpour also directed her Twitter followers to a second video clip, uploaded to an Iranian opposition YouTube channel that collected images of protests in 2009. That video, apparently shot after the protesters entered the bazaar, showed them repeating their call for the merchants to join them by closing their shops.
Video uploaded later to the same opposition YouTube channel showed the shutters pulled down on many of the stalls in the bazaar.
Saeed Valadbaygi, an opposition blogger and journalist now based in Toronto, posted a link to video of people milling about outside the entrance the bazaar, said to have been recorded after the shopkeepers closed down.
As the Iranian-American sociologist Kevan Harris explains in The Iran Primer, "Iranian bazaars, especially Tehran's Grand Bazaar, have played central roles in the economic and political history of the country." During the last years of the Shah's rule, Mr. Harris notes, "Bazaaris participated in and supported protests and demonstrations in the spring of 1977, well before most social groups - including the clergy - had joined the revolutionary surge."
Noting that the merchant class failed to join the wave of protests that followed the disputed presidential election in 2009, Mr. Harris observes: 
The absence of bazaari activity during the Green Movement demonstrations of June and July 2009 indicates that broader links between the bazaar as a social entity and democratic social movements in Iran have not developed. This is perhaps because bazaars today seldom exhibit the collective identity and public solidarity that occurred in past moments of Iranian political history. This stems partially from the new cleavages in bazaar networks that resulted from the Islamic Republic's management of the economy and the picking of politically subservient economic winners. However, it also derives from significant changes in relations between the bazaar and the global economy.
The scale of Wednesday's protests remained unclear, even to some journalists in Tehran who did not witness the demonstrations and were unable to say for certain if video posted online showing large numbers of protesters on the streets was new or simply recycled from previous demonstrations by activists who wanted to magnify the importance of the new demonstrations. 
Mr. Valadbaygi also drew attention to one of the clips that was in doubt: video showing a large crowd of protesters marching past the distinctive facade of the Bank Melli building in front of the bazaar. 
Although Iranian opposition bloggers have occasionally misidentified images in the past, pointing to video or photographs shot at previous demonstrations as if they were evidence of new protests, several clips uploaded on Wednesday seemed to match accounts of events by witnesses and looked new to journalists who follow Iran closely. 
One reason is that photographs showed protests and clashes in parts of the capital where even the official media reported demonstrations; another is that some of the video clips included chants against the government's support for Syria, which was not an issue in 2009, when street protests were common. (That said, audio is easily manipulated and The Lede would be glad to hear from any readers who might have evidence that any of the clip featured in this post was recorded at a previous protest.)
Golnaz Esfandiari, who edits the blog Persian Letters from Washington, drew attention to video of the protesters chanting, "Leave Syria alone, think of us!" a reference to the government's support for the Syrian government despite economic difficulties at home.
What appears to be more video of that same scene, recorded at about the same time, but from the reverse angle, indicates that the protesters were marching out of Imam Khomeini Square, north of the bazaar, along Ferdowsi Avenue. The large telecommunications building located at the southern end of that square can be seen in the background of both clips, but more clearly in the second one.
As Reuters reports, the opposition news site Kaleme said the protests began around the bazaar and then spread north to Imam Khomeini Square and Ferdowsi Avenue. The semiofficial Mehr News Agency reports that the security forces dispersed protests on Ferdowsi Avenue and in Imam Khomeini Square.

Another clip uploaded by an Iranian blogger and verified by a witness to the protest, showed a large number of demonstrators on Ferdowsi Avenue also chanting for the government to disengage from Syria and take care of problems at home.
One of the most striking clips (embedded at the very top of this post), showed a large number of protesters angrily shouting "interest takers" outside a branch of Saderat Bank, which deals in foreign currency exchange and has a branch on Ferdowsi Avenue, and also featured the chant "Death to Syria."
On the question of authenticity, and whether any of these clips might have been recorded in 2009, one reader of The Lede who is in Iran makes an interesting point. It appears that all or almost all of the protesters seen in the video and photographs bearing today's date are men. That seems to fit with a protest like Wednesday's, led by money-changers and merchants, but would have been unusual in 2009 when women were very much in evidence.
Earlier in the day, Bahman Kalbasi, who reports for the BBC from New York, drew attention to a photograph of protesters posted on Twitter by a blogger named Ali Soltani that appeared to show a march along Manoucheri Street, off Ferdowsi, where the black-market trade in foreign currency proliferates and clashes were reported on Wednesday.

In response to a question from another Twitter user, about a second image he posted online of burning debris behind the marchers, Mr. Soltani wrote that "our house located adjacent to Manouchehri Street, and this photo has been taken by my friend."

Mr. Valadbaygi posted a photograph on TwitPic, which he said was shot on Wednesday as riot police officers ran down Saadi Street, which intersects with Manouchehri, to confront protesters, as smoke billowed from fires or tear gas.

HEADLINE: T-Mobile Courts MetroPCS

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The parent company of T-Mobile USA is in talks to buy MetroPCS. | This election season, politicians love attacking opponents for ties to Wall Street - even flimsy ones. | Why top Wall Street executives are lucking out on their stock awards. | You know your ideas hold sway when your name is used as a verb. 

 BODY:
T-Mobile Courts MetroPCS | Deutsche Telekom of Germany, the parent company of T-Mobile USA, is in talks to buy MetroPCS, a deal that could be announced as soon as Wednesday, DealBook reports.
The acquisition would help strengthen T-Mobile after AT&T's failed attempt last year to buy the cellphone service provider. Deutsche Telekom could also use a MetroPCS deal to pare back its American exposure. If the companies structure the deal as a reverse merger, as a Heard on the Street column notes, T-Mobile would have a United States stock listing, allowing Deutsche Telekom to exit gracefully from its American subsidiary over time.
As with any deal, investors handicapped the winners and the losers. Leap Wireless International, another logical acquisition target, rose 8 percent. But shares of Sprint Nextel, the No. 3 carrier, fell more than 5 percent on Tuesday on fears of a new competitive threat.
Political Ads Define Wall Street Loosely | This election season, politicians love attacking opponents for their ties to Wall Street - even ones that are flimsy, DealBook's Peter Lattman writes. "I visited Wall Street once, in 1980, as a tourist at the New York Stock Exchange," said Keith J. Rothfus, a Pittsburgh lawyer who is running for Congress in Pennsylvania. "If I'm a Wall Street lawyer, then the 7,500 people that work for Mellon bank in western Pennsylvania are fast-money traders who charter private jets to the Hamptons on weekends."
The anti-Wall Street rhetoric is bound to be on display in the presidential debate on Wednesday night, where references to Mitt Romney's time at the private equity firm Bain Capital can be expected. Still, one prominent private equity boss says the attacks are having a beneficial side effect. "Ironically, it gave the public and other people a chance to think through these arguments," Stephen A. Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, told Bloomberg Television. He added, "We have not seen any of the blowback that you might expect."
Pay Rises With the Market | Companies always trumpet that stock rewards help link compensation to performance. But it may be more about the luck of the market for top Wall Street executives, the Deal Professor writes. During the depths of the financial crisis, banks on government assistance handed out millions of options and stock incentives at low prices. Now, executives could reap huge gains. On average, those packages gained 221 percent, according to Equilar data. "The sad thing is that these executives were compensated not because of the work they did at their firms, but because of a lucky rise in the stock market. It is anything but pay for performance," the Deal Professor says.
Einhorn's New Short | 
You know your ideas hold sway when your name is used as a verb. David Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, once again moved stocks, announcing his latest picks and pans at an industry conference on Tuesday. He praised General Motors and the health care company Cigna, giving a lift to their shares. He also prompted a sell-off in Chipotle Mexican Grill, his latest short.
But the hedge fund manager's power is not absolute. He had harsh words on Tuesday for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, his short-selling target from last year, but that stock rose 3 percent by the end of the day.
On the Agenda | While he's unlikely to talk shorts, David Einhorn and his brother, Daniel (who was recently profiled in DealBook), are speaking on Wednesday at an event at the Milwaukee Jewish Federation. In New York, Bloomberg Link is hosting a conference on state and municipal finance. The hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, of Hayman Capital Management, is on CNBC at 10:40 a.m.
Not Much New in JPMorgan Chase | The lawsuit filed by New York's attorney general against JPMorgan Chase rehashes the same old stuff, Peter J. Henning writes in his White Collar Watch: "Like so many cases related to the financial crisis, no individuals are named in the complaint. Nor does it appear that any criminal charges will emerge this long after Bear Stearns was pushed into the arms of JPMorgan by the federal government in a transaction routinely described as a fire sale."
Still, there may be an advantage to revisiting old complaints. The lawsuit's "broad scope presents an opportunity not only to punish wrongdoing at one bank, but to apply the methods and findings of the case to other banks," the editorial board of The New York Times writes. And the case highlights a legal weapon that past attorneys general have used to take on Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Obama Leads, but a Romney Comeback Might Start Out West With Colorado

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: If the presidential debates represent Mitt Romney's last, best chance at a comeback, Colorado and the Mountain West may present the most likely starting point. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it's changing. Here is a look at Colorado, the Centennial State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Peter Hanson and Seth Masket, two professors of political science at the University of Denver, and Kyle L. Saunders, an associate professor of political science at Colorado State University. 
Colorado, the host state of the first presidential debate on Wednesday night, is a fitting platform for President Obama and Mitt Romney to begin making their closing pitch to voters. Colorado is a persuadable state, with a relatively balanced partisan split and a large number of swing voters. 
Moreover, if the debates represent Mr. Romney's last, best chance at a comeback, Colorado and the West may present the most likely starting point. Mr. Obama's standing, compared to 2008, has appeared to deteriorate more in the West -- specifically the Mountain West -- than in other regions. That shift is evident in Colorado, although Mr. Obama has maintained a narrow lead in surveys there.
But the fact that Colorado is a political battleground at all is a recent development. It was a reliably Republican state just 10 years ago, having favored G.O.P. presidential candidates in every election but two -- 1964 and 1992 -- since 1950.
In 2000, Al Gore won the national popular vote, but George W. Bush easily carried Colorado. In 2002, Republicans held the governorship, the state's two United States Senate seats, five of Colorado's seven seats in the United States Congress, as well as majorities in the Colorado State Senate and Statehouse. 
But fast-forward six years, and everything had been reversed. Democrats held both Senate seats, five United States Congressional seats, and majorities in both houses of the Colorado legislature. Republicans were left with only two House seats, exactly what Democrats had been clinging to in 2002. 
The Colorado political landscape had been remade, and swiftly, by a rapidly growing Hispanic population and an influx of young, highly educated migrants from the West Coast, particularly California. 
"Since the 1990s," Mr. Masket said, "the high-tech industry has drawn a lot of people out here."
Colorado is now 21 percent Hispanic as well as one of the youngest and best educated states. Almost a quarter of 2008 voters had completed at least a year of postgraduate study, according to exit polls.
In 2010, Republicans gained back some of that lost territory, and the political balance in Colorado now sits between its 2002 and 2008 extremes.
About 80 percent of Colorado residents live in cities, suburbs and small towns along the Front Range, from Greeley and Fort Collins south to Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs and Pueblo.
Denver, the northern Denver suburbs in Adams County and Boulder form the bedrock of Democratic support in Colorado. Denver is young, single and liberal. It's a diverse city, at 31 percent Hispanic and 10 percent black. Adams County is 38 percent Hispanic.
Boulder County is mostly white but just as liberal as Denver. Boulder is home to the University of Colorado and a vibrant tech industry. 
Democrats also tend to prevail in heavily Hispanic Pueblo County, although by smaller margins than in Denver and Boulder counties.
Between Denver and Pueblo is the Republican base of support. Colorado Springs is both fiscally and socially conservative, home to Focus on the Family and a large share of evangelical Christians as well as Fort Carson and Peterson Air Force Base. 
Republicans are also strong in the outer ring of Denver suburbs. The communities south of Denver and north of Colorado Springs -- in affluent and culturally conservative Douglas County -- are solidly Republican.
With a few exceptions -- ski resort towns like Aspen and Telluride and heavily Hispanic central and southern counties -- the rest of Colorado is rural, dotted by ranches and Republicans. The western slope of the Rocky Mountains and the eastern plains (everything east of the Front Range) are both conservative but in a classic, western, libertarian way.
 The Bellwether: Arapahoe County and Jefferson County 
Arapahoe County and Jefferson County are part of the inner ring of the Denver suburbs. This is where the political effects of Colorado's changing demographic have been most evident. George W. Bush carried both counties in 2000 and 2004, but Mr. Obama carried them in 2008.
Both counties are good barometers of the statewide vote, but Jefferson County has been perfect in each of the past three presidential elections. Jefferson County is full of working-class suburbs, a pivotal voting group.
"The campaigns are hitting Jefferson County hard," Mr. Hanson said, because voters there "are more likely to be undecided."
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is a 75 percent favorite in Colorado, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. That's lower than his odds of winning re-election all together. Despite the fact that Mr. Obama overperformed in Colorado in 2008 relative to the nation, he seems to have lost more ground there than in other, seemingly less hospitable battleground states.
That shift is indicative of the entire region. Comparing the 2008 exit polls with the regional breakdown of Gallup's national tracking poll, it becomes clear that Mr. Obama's popularity has taken a disproportionate hit in the West.
What happened? To begin with, battleground states in the Mountain West are elastic. That is, Colorado and Nevada have an above average share of swing voters, and they tend to respond to the national political environment.
Roughly 35 percent of registered voters in Colorado are unaffiliated with a political party. Some aren't true swing voters, Mr. Saunders said, but Colorado has "a lot voters who are willing to wet their finger, put it up, and see which way the winds are blowing."
And Mr. Obama had a much more favorable wind in 2008. 
The economic recovery has been particularly anemic in Mountain West battleground states. Colorado and Nevada are still suffering with unemployment rates above the national average; Nevada's is 12.1 percent, and Colorado's is 8.2 percent.
Still, even if the Mountain West is a good region for Mr. Romney to begin a comeback, he would need to carry swing states in other regions to win the White House. Colorado has nine electoral votes, and Nevada has just six.

HEADLINE: McQueary Files Lawsuit Against Penn State

BYLINE: LYNN ZINSER


HIGHLIGHT: The former Penn State assistant coach Mike McQueary has filed a lawsuit against the university for not backing him as a whistleblower. 

 BODY:
As the dust continues to settle from the Jerry Sandusky mess at Penn State, the former offensive coordinator Mike McQueary has filed a $4 million whistleblower lawsuit against the university and forced a new question to the forefront: What about him?
McQueary, 37, became infamous as the graduate assistant who witnessed one of Sandusky's sexual assaults on a young boy and reported it, but only to Coach Joe Paterno and then the university officials Tim Curley, the athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a vice president. McQueary testified about it not only to the grand jury that indicted Sandusky but also in Sandusky's trial, where McQueary's account played a significant role in Sandusky's conviction on multiple counts.
But McQueary found himself trapped between the public's revulsion that he hadn't done more to help Sandusky's victim at the time -- not stopping the assault or calling police -- and Penn State's decision to support Curley and Schultz but not him. The university placed McQueary on administrative leave when Sandusky was indicted last November and then he was the only one of Paterno's assistants not interviewed for a position on the staff of the new coach Bill O'Brien. 
Clearly, Penn State just wanted McQueary to go away. But he believes Penn State had an obligation to support him as the case's whistleblower. Dan Wetzel writes on Yahoo.com that by washing its hands of McQueary, the university has left him unemployable as a coach and wrecked what was left of his reputation. 
After Sandusky was arrested, the university quickly made its choice to back the version of the story told by Curley and Schultz, which was that McQueary had not told them that he saw Sandusky doing something sexual in nature. Had it backed McQueary, it would have been admitting Curley and Schultz and Paterno had negligently handled McQueary's initial report. It might be an admission university officials are forced to make if Curley and Schultz are convicted for perjury in their upcoming trial, but it's too late to rally around McQueary.
Now he wants to know, what about him? He can't turn himself into a sympathetic figure, because his failure to call the police back in 2001 helped Sandusky escape punishment for another decade. But the failures didn't end there and Penn State will start to find out how much its failures will cost.

HEADLINE: The Scene Before Obama's First Debate

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: What is it like inside President Obama's bubble as he gets ready for Wednesday night's debate? No one outside the room can know for sure. But it's worth remembering what it was like before his first debate at the presidential level five years ago.

DENVER - What is it like inside President Obama's bubble as he gets ready for Wednesday night's debate? No one outside the room can know for sure. But it's worth remembering what it was like before his first debate at the presidential level five years ago
He was going up against Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Edwards, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats seeking the party's presidential nomination in a face-off in South Carolina in 2007. David Plouffe, then Mr. Obama's campaign manager and now the president's senior adviser, recalled the scene in his memoir, "The Audacity to Win."
"Don't forget to smile," David Axelrod, the campaign strategist, told Mr. Obama.
"Iraq is an economic issue too," Mr. Plouffe added.
"And remember the experience riff," Mr. Axelrod threw in.
Finally Mr. Obama grew impatient. "Guys, enough," he said. "You're junking up my head. All I will be thinking about is what you just told me I had to do and I'll be tight."
Mr. Obama was "not a strong debater," as Mr. Plouffe put it in the book. He derided "the whole exercise of boiling down complex answers into thirty- or sixty-second sound bites." So his staff was more than a little nervous when he went out to face Mrs. Clinton, one of the most formidable figures in the party. "This could be an unmitigated disaster," Mr. Axelrod said after the candidate took the stage.
In the end, Mrs. Clinton did win, according to the pundits. Mr. Axelrod's minimalist verdict? "Well, that could have been a lot worse."

HEADLINE: Robert J. Manning, Editor, Is Dead at 92

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Robert J. Manning, who covered the White House as a cub reporter during the final term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, worked for the State Department under President John F. Kennedy and later became editor of The Atlantic Monthly, where he broadened the magazine's scope and readership, died on Friday in Boston. He was 92.
The cause was lymphoma, his son Brian said. 
Mr. Manning became editor in chief of The Atlantic Monthly in 1966, more than a century after the magazine was founded in Boston. (It is now called The Atlantic.) While the magazine had a rich history in cultural matters, Mr. Manning expanded its attention to current affairs, including the civil rights movement, Vietnam and the oil and economic crises of the 1970s.
''He really began the process of bringing it into the modern era,'' said James Fallows, a national correspondent for the magazine who was one of many writers, including Elizabeth Drew, Ward Just and Tracy Kidder, Mr. Manning nurtured there.
Mr. Manning got an early jump on his journalism career. He was a senior in high school in Binghamton, N.Y., when he was hired as a copy boy at The Binghamton Press. Soon he was promoted to reporter. He never attended college, instead taking a job with The Associated Press in Buffalo before joining the Army in 1942. He received an early honorable discharge because of nearsightedness.
''He couldn't get his gas mask on because of his glasses,'' Brian Manning said.
In April 1945, Mr. Manning was working for United Press in Washington when White House officials summoned reporters to announce Roosevelt's death in Warm Springs, Ga. By 1949, he had become a writer for Time magazine. In 1954 he wrote a cover story on Ernest Hemingway after interviewing and fishing with him in Cuba. He spent his final years with Time, from 1958 to 1960, as its London bureau chief.
In 1961, the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, hired Mr. Manning to be assistant secretary of state for public affairs in the Kennedy administration. As part of an administration that was often accused of limiting press access to information, particularly during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, Mr. Manning was said to be less restrictive than other officials. In June 1963, he traveled with the president to Italy, Ireland, Britain and Germany, where Kennedy gave his ''Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech in West Berlin.
Mr. Manning joined The Atlantic Monthly in 1964 as executive editor under Edward Weeks, the editor, and succeeded him on his retirement two years later, a tumultuous time of war in Vietnam and political and cultural conflicts at home. He was proud to learn later that he had been placed on President Richard M. Nixon's enemies list.
''If you look back at The Atlantic's coverage in those days,'' Mr. Fallows said, ''I think it gives you a very good sense of America and how it was changing.''
Mr. Manning's time at The Atlantic ended in a bitter dispute with Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a real estate developer who bought the magazine in 1980. In a fight played out in court for several years, Mr. Zuckerman maintained that he had been misled about the magazine's troubled finances when he bought it, and Mr. Manning and others accused Mr. Zuckerman of reneging on the terms of the deal, including an expectation that Mr. Manning would remain at the magazine.
Mr. Manning was gone by the end of 1980. The case ended in 1987 with Mr. Zuckerman ordered to honor the original deal. In a separate settlement, he agreed to pay Mr. Manning $429,000. Mr. Zuckerman, who now owns The Daily News in New York, sold the magazine in 1999.
Mr. Manning later became editor in chief of Boston Publishing and oversaw publication of ''The Vietnam Experience,'' an illustrated 25-volume series. In 1992 he published a memoir, ''The Swamp Root Chronicle.''
Robert Joseph Manning was born on Dec. 25, 1919, in Binghamton. His first wife, the former Margaret Raymond, a former book editor of The Boston Globe, died in 1984. In 1987 he married the former Theresa Slomkowski. She survives him. Besides his son Brian, he is survived by another son, Robert, and five grandchildren. A third son, Richard, died in 2004.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Home Sweet Architectural Masterpiece

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA LANGE

 BODY:
Lafayette Park in Detroit consists of three high-rises, 24 single-story courthouses and 162 two-story town houses, completed in the early 1960s. It was an urban renewal project built on land that was once a working-class black neighborhood. It was designed by one of the 20th century's most famous modern architects, Mies van der Rohe.
All these elements have spelled disaster in other cities, and yet Lafayette Park has been a success, with high occupancy rates, a racially diverse population and a strong commitment to maintaining Mies's architecture. 
In their new book, ''Thanks for the View, Mr. Mies,'' which is due out at the end of the month (Metropolis Books, $29.95), the editors Danielle Aubert, Lana Cavar and Natasha Chandani, graphic designers all, offer a portrait of Lafayette Park very different from the classic Mies monograph.
Contents include interviews with residents of Lafayette Park's towers and town houses; archival materials from the complex's history; an account of nine days spent trying to climate-control a corner apartment; and essays on Mies in Detroit, the Lafayette Park landscape, bird-watching and a record of bird-strike deaths (birds and plate glass don't mix).
At-home portraits of residents by Corine Vermeulen show Mies's architecture as a strong frame for personal expression. Some homes look like shrines to 1958, while others reflect the lived-in décor of decades. Jacqueline Neal, an interior designer and 12-year resident of the Pavilion, the smallest of the complex's three towers, spoke last month about living and accessorizing with Mies.
What kind of interior design do you do?
For the past 17 years, I have been doing commercial design, corporate offices, working for C.E.O.'s. But the commercial industry has not come back as quickly as residential furniture. Residential is not difficult for a designer.
How did you come to live at Lafayette Park?
I went to college at Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Mich. When I came back to Detroit, I kind of stumbled upon it. What drew me to the building was the ambience of the space when I would come by at night. When you drive down Rivard, you pass the town houses, and it gives you that serene feeling. Then you pull in and see the doorman at the Pavilion. When I finally came in and they gave me the brochure, I said, ''I studied this guy in college.''
Design-wise, what do you like about the Pavilion?
I like the floors and the green marble walls in the lobby that are accented with chrome trim and chrome elevator doors. The housekeeping staff does an excellent job in maintaining the space. The floors are always done. Everything is original. When you invest in quality, you do get what you pay for. That's a sad thing a lot of people don't understand or appreciate.
What about Mies's furniture?
That is not my style at all, no, uh-uh. It is sterile. When it comes to the furniture like that, to sit on it long-term, it doesn't quite work for me. Would you really entertain in that living room? They have Mies chairs in the lobby of the Pavilion. They aren't leather but they have that leather look. They are there with the glass table and the chrome.
So what is your taste like?
My taste is contemporary, classy and elegant. I am going to use a street term, not that I am a bougie woman by any stretch of the imagination, but I like quality things.
How big is your apartment?
This is a studio I have divided up. I want to say it is 600 square feet. I decided I was going to create my space to be like an elegant hotel suite. The green wall is the area designated for the bedroom, then I have a conversational grouping, then I have my office. I did put different shades of green on a lot of different walls, but I didn't paint everything, because that would close up the space. Plus I know when I get ready to leave, I will have to paint all this back.
Why so much green?
About eight years ago in commercial environments, sage was really popular. I decided this was a color I can incorporate. Then I introduced aubergine. Those are my two foundational colors. I swap out chocolate or mint green, but never lose the sage.
You sound like you love decorating. What was the last thing you bought?
I just bought a huge sage and chocolate plate. And pillows. I love pillows. In fact, when I came in, the doorman said, ''More pillows?'' I got upstairs at 9:30 or quarter to ten, I wound down for a little bit, and then I had to do my little decorating. I could not wait for morning. It is all about the details.

HEADLINE: Bar Soap Sheds Its Irritating Image

BYLINE: By ALIX STRAUSS

 BODY:
THIS year marks the 60th anniversary of Dr. Erno Laszlo's Dead Sea Mud cleansing bar. Sold at Saks since 1952, the distinctive black bar, a louche, luxurious cousin to Ivory, promises to remove impurities and exfoliate the skin while hydrating it.
Dr. Laszlo's creation is a cult favorite, but face soap in general has long had a dirty reputation in the beauty industry. Many consumers have been pushed by marketers into thinking that soap strips necessary oils and unfavorably alters the skin's pH level. Bar soap has also had a tough time competing with the overabundance of liquids, creams and foams that skin care companies offer. 
But the scorn for soap might be outdated, said Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a dermatologist in New Orleans.
''Bars of the past contained alkaline and had a pH of 9 to 10, which disrupted one's epidermal barrier,'' she said. ''Today's face bars are formulated to be nonirritating. They contain less than 10 percent soap and are made with syndets, synthetic detergents that cleanse the skin. They also have a lower pH of 5.5 to 7.0, to match your normal skin's level.''
Like many other personal grooming products, face soap has gotten a makeover, shedding preservatives, chemicals and fragrance. And at a time when natural and organic are prized, bars seem to fit the bill. And besides Dr. Laszlo's bar, which is $40, they are almost all less expensive than bottled cleansers. (The Neutrogena Original Formula Facial Cleansing Bar, a drugstore favorite for its clear appearance, is less than $3.)
Kim Gillman, 45, a marketing manager who lives in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., is a devotee of Aveeno with oatmeal, sold in drugstores, and the higher-end Origins Checks and Balances.
''I feel a bar gives you better control,'' Ms. Gillman said. ''It lasts longer and it doesn't have the slimy consistency of liquid cleaners. I also like to feel the heaviness of a bar in my hand. There's something soothingly tactile about it.''
Dr. Dennis Gross, a dermatologist in New York, said: ''People now have a choice on what delivery method they prefer. Many are choosing to go back to a bar. Companies are making them because over all they are more economical, have more environmentally friendly packaging and there's a demand for it.''
One of these companies is the Britain-based Lush, which manufactures almost 600,000 pounds of solid soap a year. Sales of Fresh Farmacy face soap, which contains calamine and is packaged like cheese, are up 41 percent since last year, according to Brandi Halls, North American campaign and communications director for Lush.
''Bar soaps are hygienic because they contain no water, which is required for bacterial growth,'' Ms. Halls said. ''Liquid soaps are predominantly water, a breeding ground for bacteria, and so they require chemical preservatives.''
Though, as Lynn Fischer, director of global education at SkinCeuticals, a company that offers six bottled cleansers, pointed out: ''Bar soap can sit in a dish of dirty water and be exposed to the air. Or your hands could have bacteria on them. Then it's transferred to the soap, and that can go to your face.''
Despite such concerns, soap sales seem to be on the rise. In July, Melvita, an organic cosmetics and skin-care company, released Ultra-Gentle Face Soap, promoted as a nondrying deep-cleaning bar. In December, Lather, another natural skin-care business known for its olive oil bar soaps, will introduce two bars: Vanilla Bean & Shea and Eucalyptus & Clay.
From July 2011 to July 2012, Ahava sold more than 8,000 bars of its Moisturizing Salt Soap, up 22 percent from the year before, according to Elana Drell-Szyfer, the chief executive of the company. ''That means eight additional bars of soap we sold each day this year,'' Ms. Drell-Szyfer said. ''That's a very large and surprising number for a small brand like ours, especially when it's not been an intentional focus.'' (Ahava also sells a popular Purifying Mud Soap.)
Kiss My Face has been selling face soap since the company started in 1981. Today it sells 14 times the number of bar soaps than all their other facial cleansers combined, and more bar soaps than any of the 100 products it sells, according to Jim Healy, the company's vice president for marketing.
Dr. Sarah Villafranco is an emergency physician who in 2010 developed and created Osmia Organics, an all-natural skin-care company.
''Commercial soap companies tend to manufacture and process soap in a way that decreases or removes glycerin and adds other synthetic elements to create a harder bar,'' she said, adding that some industry professionals think big companies want soap to dry your skin so you'll need their lotion to moisturize it. And liquid washes can be just as drying as bars, since many contain harsh surfactants, like sodium laureth sulfate, to lend the sudsy feeling some consumers demand.
Last month, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences questioned the use of the chemical triclosan, an ingredient found in many antibacterial cleansers. The study suggested that exposure to triclosan was linked with muscle function impairment in humans.
But some people seek out soap simply because it provides a sensual and decorative experience. At C. O. Bigelow, the 174-year-old apothecary and beauty emporium in Greenwich Village, some of the best-selling products are soaps made from silk and rice bran, and egg white and camomile flower, and a sponge made from pure vegetable fiber and Binchotan charcoal. The hardest worker of the lot, according to Ian Ginsberg, a pharmacist and the owner of the store, is Cor Soap Silver treatment, an all-natural bar that, like Laszlo's, costs $40 and promises to even out skin tone, fade sunspots, replenish lost collagen and protect from ultraviolet rays.

HEADLINE: A Bigger Role on Behalf of the Romney She Knows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO, ASHLEY PARKER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Ann Romney sounded like a seasoned political operative. Backstage at a rally in Iowa recently, she delivered instructions to Renee Fry, a former aide to Mitt Romney who is now campaigning for him: Tell the Bristol-Myers story.
As governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney had negotiated a major deal to persuade Bristol-Myers Squibb to open a factory in the state, luring hundreds of jobs. ''No one would have thought about relocating to Massachusetts before that,'' Mrs. Romney told her. ''Tell them what Mitt can do for the economy.''
Once in the background, more cheerleader than consultant, Mrs. Romney is asserting herself with new force as the campaign enters its final weeks, publicly scolding Republicans who second-guess her husband and privately pushing for ways to recast him in her own terms.
She regularly sits in on high-level strategy sessions, weighs in with candid opinions for her husband and calls senior advisers to share her views, according to campaign aides, who are reluctant to discuss her private conversations. 
On the road, Mrs. Romney notes voters' worries, complaints and suggestions, which she passes on to the campaign.
''She is collecting information and suggesting action about it,'' said Ms. Fry, who has campaigned with Mrs. Romney in Iowa and Wisconsin recently.
At a time when some Republican operatives say the Romney campaign is foundering because of the candidate's weaknesses or missteps, his wife of 43 years is a relentlessly upbeat figure inside the Boston headquarters, pushing back against that line of thinking. Her message: the story of the Mitt Romney she knows -- an empathetic man who has cared for suffering families, nurtured women's careers and given up riches to serve the public -- has not reached the electorate.
With her husband reluctant -- or unable -- to tell his own story in a compelling way, she has made the task of humanizing him a personal mission. But it is late in the game, and polls show that the Obama campaign has effectively substituted its own, unflattering version of Mr. Romney.
Mrs. Romney's frustration with the popular image of her husband is at times palpable. During his trip to Europe in August, when he seemed to cast doubt on preparations for the Olympics and suggested that culture explained Palestinian economic woes, Mrs. Romney was so livid about the news media's coverage that she had to be persuaded not to walk to the back of the campaign plane to upbraid reporters, according to multiple aides.
In Iowa last month, she admonished Republicans who question her husband's strategy and performance. ''Stop it,'' she said. ''This is hard.''
Internally, Mrs. Romney insists that the campaign allow Mr. Romney to be himself and that those around him provide positive reinforcement. ''Encourager in chief,'' an aide calls her.
Laraine Wright, a close friend of Mrs. Romney's, put it this way: ''Everyone wants to give them advice, and she said it's very nice, but Mitt is who Mitt is.''
That has led some close to the campaign to suggest that Mrs. Romney's approach might discourage constructive criticism from reaching Mr. Romney, a worry at a time when his campaign is lagging in some swing states, according to recent polls. Two Republican strategists who do not advise Mr. Romney but who are familiar with the workings of his campaign said that Mrs. Romney's defense of her husband's instincts had blunted negative -- but necessary -- feedback.
Campaign aides, though, dismissed that claim as carping from misinformed outsiders.
Mrs. Romney has encouraged those who have worked with Mr. Romney in the past, in the governor's office or at the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, to publicly recount their experiences with him. The idea, she has said, is to both familiarize voters with the her husband's softer side and counter claims that his agenda would set women back.
Beth Lindstrom, the secretary of consumer affairs under Mr. Romney in the governor's office, said Mrs. Romney urged these women to discuss how family friendly he was as a boss. Ms. Lindstrom, who had three small children when she went to work for Mr. Romney, has told audiences about how Mr. Romney told her, at their first cabinet meeting, that he his approach was ''family first.''
''I think we all feel frustrated and I'm sure Ann specifically because she sees the fellow that he is and knows his skill set and knows how he is being portrayed as being unfriendly to women and it's just not true,'' Ms. Lindstrom said.
Mrs. Romney has long served as an informal adviser for her husband, a calming presence and a gut-check barometer. She has played those roles since his days as governor, when aides used to invite her to into the office for lunch on days when Mr. Romney was in a dark mood. As Ms. Fry recalled, her presence alone made him forget whatever was bothering him.
Inside the campaign these days, said a top Romney adviser, ''it's very positive, and Ann helps us keep it that way.''
During campaign debates, Mr. Romney routinely looks to his wife after delivering answers to gauge her reactions, sometimes conferring with her during commercial breaks. After Mr. Romney gave Newt Gingrich a drubbing during a primary season debate, Mrs. Romney telegraphed her views in a brief conversation: enough. Mr. Romney had made his point, an adviser recalled.
Her place in the campaign has grown as she hits the trail with her own team of staff members, evolving from occasional stand-in to full-blown campaigner in her own right. On Monday, she read Dr. Seuss' ''One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish'' to a kindergarten class in Henderson, Nev., then spoke to a crowd of about 1,000 at a local convention center. On Tuesday, she held a rally in Denver and sat down for six local television interviews.
At a Las Vegas event on Tuesday, Mrs. Romney was introduced by an old friend, who recalled how Mr. Romney, then a local Mormon leader, all but adopted her family when a daughter became gravely ill. Images of faded photographs of Mr. Romney cradling the girl and a handwritten thank you card flashed on a big screen.
As she took the stage, Mrs. Romney looked relieved, as if somebody had finally captured her husband as she sees him.
''I love the fact that people are standing up and saying this is the Mitt Romney I know,'' she said.
Mrs. Romney acknowledged that her husband does not excel at telling stories. ''He doesn't talk. He does,'' she said to applause. ''You've got to find voters who voted for Obama,'' she told well-wishers along a rope line in Nevada, as she posed for photographs and signed T-shirts. ''We've got to win this.''

HEADLINE: A Clash of Philosophies

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
DENVER -- Somewhere in the wonky blizzard of facts, statistics and studies thrown out on stage here on Wednesday night was a fundamental philosophical choice about the future of America, quite possibly the starkest in nearly three decades.
As President Obama and Mitt Romney faced off for the first time, their largely zinger-free styles may have disguised a fierce clash of views not only over taxes, spending and health care, but over the very role of government in American society in a time of wrenching problems.
On one side was an incumbent who, while recognizing that government is not the solution to all problems, argued that it plays an essential part in promoting economic growth and ensuring fairness for various segments of the population. On the other was a challenger who, while recognizing the basic value of government, argued that its greatest goal was to get out of the way of a free people and unleash the American entrepreneurial spirit. 
''Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes skewed towards the wealthy and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off,'' Mr. Obama said. He asked: ''Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best?''
Mr. Romney fired back with an indictment of Mr. Obama. ''The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years ago, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work,'' he said. ''That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.''
There was little of the overt nastiness that has characterized the campaign this year. Instead, the debate was perhaps as direct an articulation of the profound schism in this election as has been heard over the course of the campaign. The candidates spent much of the 90 minutes here at the University of Denver defining it in narrow policy details that may have bled some of the passion out of their arguments and made them sound smaller than they were. But at its core, the debate brought home a divide over domestic policy greater than any since President Ronald Reagan and Walter F. Mondale faced off in 1984.
Mr. Romney came in with the greater hurdle of explaining his vision for the future and convincing the shrinking pool of undecided voters that it represents a better path for a country plagued by stubborn unemployment and rising national debt. He calmly and persistently rebutted Mr. Obama's characterizations of his plans while pressing his more-in-sorrow line of attack on the incumbent.
Whether he succeeded enough to change the dynamics of the race may take a day or two to become evident.
But the Romney camp hoped his performance was strong enough to fuel a sense of comeback heading into the final month of the campaign. After a rough few weeks, Mr. Romney's advisers were heartened coming into the debate by new polls showing that the race was close nationally and somewhat closer in a few battleground states. The Obama team arrived here worried that a bored news media would exaggerate any perceived turnaround by Mr. Romney to promote a more compelling race.
What they got was a substantive if sometimes hard to follow dialogue over far-reaching issues. Both cast their positions in terms of concern over everyday Americans, but from opposite ends. Mr. Obama expressed worry about those who would lose out if government programs are cut too deeply, while Mr. Romney talked about those who feel constrained by excessive government taxation and regulation.
''The magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly would not help us grow,'' Mr. Obama said.
Referring to possible cuts in Medicaid, he said, ''that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.''
Mr. Romney talked about the impact of the continuing economic problems, noting that the cost of gasoline, electricity, food and health care has grown. ''I'll call it the economy tax,'' he said. ''It's been crushing.''
The Republican focused on the impact on small business of Mr. Obama's policies. ''It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing,'' he said. ''It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America.'' He added, ''You raise taxes and you kill jobs.''
Mr. Obama cited Abraham Lincoln and his efforts to finance a transcontinental railroad, land-grant colleges and a National Academy of Sciences. It was those sorts of investments, made by presidents of both parties, that helped make America great by providing opportunity for progress, the president argued.
''If all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That doesn't restrict people's freedom. That enhances it. And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.''
Mr. Romney pointed to the president's efforts to stimulate the growth of clean energy with $90 billion in taxpayer assistance as an example of what government should not be about.
''The role of government is not to become the economic player picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system,'' he said. ''The right answer for government is to say how do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?''
In a way, it was the inevitable culmination of a polarized debate that ultimately spawned the Tea Party backlash against activist government. Mr. Obama has searched for the right blend of policies and messages to diminish antipathy toward government, debt and liberalism. Mr. Romney, while an imperfect messenger from the right, advanced a revision of the Great Society social compact that even President Reagan never could achieve.
As it happens, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney may actually be more moderate at heart, given their records. But the debate exposed little nuance or agreement. As they battled it out Wednesday night, neither shied away from the fight of a generation.

HEADLINE: Taking Stock of Some of the Claims and Counterclaims

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, JACKIE CALMES, ANNIE LOWREY, ROBERT PEAR and JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney repeatedly questioned President Obama's honesty at Wednesday night's debate -- likening the president and vice president at one point to his five sons repeating things that were not true -- but he made a number of misleading statements himself on the size of the federal deficits, taxes, Medicare and health care.
''I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals,'' Mr. Romney said to Mr. Obama, describing his plan to cut tax rates by 20 percent. ''I know that you and your running mate keep saying that, and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it, and ultimately hoping I'll believe it. But that is not the case, all right?''
But among other misleading statements, Mr. Romney falsely stated that Mr. Obama had doubled the deficit. ''The president said he'd cut the deficit in half,'' Mr. Romney charged. ''Unfortunately, he doubled it.'' 
Mr. Obama made a number of misleading statements of his own -- mainly by filling in the blanks of some of Mr. Romney's vague plans, usually in the least politically palatable way. He described Mr. Romney's tax plan as a $5 trillion tax ''cut'' and said the average middle-class family would pay more, contrary to Mr. Romney's pledges.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama are hardly the first presidential candidates to use debates to challenge the honesty of their opponents.
But this year, as the line between acceptable political debate and sophistry has often been crossed, the accuracy of campaign statements has emerged as a campaign issue. Here is an examination of some of the claims and counterclaims.
Doubling the Deficit
Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama had doubled the deficit. That is not true. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, the Congressional Budget Office had already projected that the deficit for fiscal year 2009, which ended Sept. 30 of that year, would be $1.2 trillion. (It ended up as $1.4 trillion.) For fiscal year 2012, which ended last week, the deficit is expected to be $1.1 trillion -- just under the level in the year he was inaugurated. Measured as a share of the economy, as economists prefer, the deficit has declined more significantly -- from 10.1 percent of the economy's total output in 2009 to 7.3 percent for 2012. JACKIE CALMES
The $5 Trillion Tax Cut
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney repeatedly sparred over whether Mr. Romney has proposed a $5 trillion tax cut.
It is true that Mr. Romney has proposed ''revenue neutral'' tax reform, meaning that he would not expand the deficit. However, he has proposed cutting all marginal tax rates by 20 percent -- which would in and of itself cut tax revenue by $5 trillion.
To make up that revenue, Mr. Romney has said he wants to clear out the underbrush of deductions and loopholes in the tax code. But he has not yet specified how he would do so.
This week, in a television interview, Mr. Romney did shed some light -- floating the idea of capping each household's deductions at $17,000.
''As an option, you could say everybody's going to get up to a $17,000 deduction. And you could use your charitable deduction, your home mortgage deduction, or others, your health care deduction, and you can fill that bucket, if you will, that $17,000 bucket that way,'' he said. ''Higher-income people might have a lower number.''
The deduction cap has the virtue of avoiding the tough negotiations over which tax expenditures to unwind. Many tax expenditures are highly popular, like the deduction for charitable giving. Moreover, many are important to the stability of the economy. Suddenly ending the home mortgage interest deduction, for instance, would threaten to destabilize the housing market.
But a number of unanswered questions about Mr. Romney's tax plan remain.
For instance, Mr. Romney did not address how his proposed cap on deductions would affect tax credits. (Generally, deductions lower a family's level of taxable income and credits erase part of their overall tax bill.)
It is also unclear whether his proposal to cap deductions would raise enough revenue to pay for his income tax rate cuts -- at least not without increasing the tax burden on families making less than $200,000 a year, which Mr. Romney has vowed that he will not do. ANNIE LOWREY
Government 'Takeover' Of Health Care
Mr. Romney said that Mr. Obama's health care overhaul would allow the federal government to ''take over health care,'' an assertion rejected by the president.
The 2010 health care law clearly expands the role of the federal government. But it also builds on the foundation of private health insurance, providing subsidies for millions of low- and moderate-income people to buy private insurance.
Under the law, close to 30 million Americans are expected to gain health coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many of them would receive insurance through the expansion of Medicaid. The federal government will initially pay the entire cost of Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries and would never pay less than 90 percent.
In addition, the federal government would subsidize the purchase of private insurance for millions of people with incomes up to four times the poverty level (up to $92,200 for a family of four). Private insurers would thus have many new customers.
Projections by the nonpartisan office of the actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services show that federal, state and local government health spending will account for nearly 50 percent of all health spending in the United States by 2021, up from 46 percent in 2011. The federal share of all health spending is expected to rise to more than 31 percent, from slightly less than 29 percent.
The changes reflect the expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the new subsidies for private insurance, as well as the increase in Medicare enrollment as baby boomers join the program.
When Mr. Romney and other Republicans complain of a federal takeover, they are referring to more than spending and enrollment in government health programs. They say the new health care law will require most Americans to purchase ''government-approved insurance'' or pay a new tax. The tax issue was at the heart of the Supreme Court's much-debated 5-to-4 decision in June to uphold the president's health care overhaul law, the Affordable Care Act. ROBERT PEAR
Green Energy
Mr. Romney said that half the companies backed by the president's green energy stimulus program have gone out of business. That is a gross overstatement. Of nearly three dozen recipients of loans under the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program, only three are currently in bankruptcy, although several others are facing financial difficulties. Mr. Romney also said that ''many'' of the companies that received such loans were supported by campaign contributors. George Kaiser, a major fund-raiser for Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign, was an investor in Solyndra, the failed solar panel maker, but there are also examples of Republican and Democratic campaign contributors who also invested in firms supported by the loan guarantee program. JOHN M. BRODER
The $716 Billion Cut From Medicare
Mr. Obama first brought up Mr. Romney's frequent criticism that the president cut $716 billion from Medicare, by saying the cost savings were from reduced payments to insurance companies and other health care providers. But Mr. Romney repeated the claim, suggesting that the $716 billion in Medicare reductions would indeed come from current beneficiaries.
While fact-checkers have repeatedly debunked this claim, it remains a standard attack line for Mr. Romney.
The charge that Mr. Obama took $716 billion from Medicare recipients to pay for ''Obamacare'' has several problems -- not least the fact that Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, included the identical savings in his budget plans that House Republicans voted for in the past two years.
Mr. Obama did not cut benefits by $716 billion over 10 years as part of his 2010 health care law; rather, he reduced Medicare reimbursements to health care providers, chiefly insurance companies and drug manufacturers. And the law gave Medicare recipients more generous benefits for prescription drugs and free preventive care like mammograms.
According to nonpartisan analysts, it is Mr. Romney who would both cut benefits and add costs for beneficiaries if he restored the $716 billion in reductions. Restoring higher payments to insurers and other companies would in turn increase Medicare premiums because beneficiaries share in Medicare's total cost. Marilyn Moon, a vice president at the American Institutes for Research, has calculated that a Medicare recipient's out-of-pocket expenses would increase $577 a year on average by 2022.
Also, the Obama reductions added eight years to the life of Medicare's financially troubled trust fund, to 2024, according to Medicare trustees. If the cuts were restored, the insolvency date would revert to 2016.
But the cuts to providers could cause private Medicare plans to raise their premiums, which is expected to reduce enrollment in them. Those changes have not materialized yet.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney, in First Debate, Spar Over Fixing the Economy

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
DENVER -- Mitt Romney on Wednesday accused President Obama of failing to lead the country out of the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, using the first presidential debate to invigorate his candidacy by presenting himself as an equal who can solve problems Mr. Obama has been unable to.
The president implored Americans to be patient and argued that his policies needed more time to work, warning that changing course would wipe away the economic progress the country is steadily making. The two quarreled aggressively over tax policy, the budget deficit and the role of government, with each man accusing the other of being evasive and misleading voters.
But for all of the anticipation, and with less than five weeks remaining until Election Day, the 90-minute debate unfolded much like a seminar by a business consultant and a college professor. Both men argued that their policies would improve the lives of the middle class, but their discussion often dipped deep into the weeds, and they talked over each other without connecting their ideas to voters. 
If Mr. Romney's goal was to show that he could project equal stature to the president, he succeeded, perhaps offering his campaign the lift that Republicans have been seeking. Mr. Obama often stopped short of challenging his rival's specific policies and chose not to invoke some of the same arguments that his campaign has been making against Mr. Romney for months.
At one point, Mr. Romney offered an admonishment, saying, ''Mr. President, you're entitled, as the president, to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts, all right?'' He forcefully engaged Mr. Obama throughout the night, while the president often looked down at his lectern and took notes.
A boisterous campaign, which has played out through dueling rallies and an endless stream of television commercials, took a sober turn as the candidates stood at facing lecterns for the first time. Mr. Obama, who has appeared to take command of the race in most battleground states, seemed to adopt an air of caution throughout the evening that left some of his liberal supporters disappointed in his performance.
''Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess,'' he said, ''or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says, 'America does best when the middle class does best' ''?
For much of the debate, the candidates commandeered the stage, taking control away from the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, as they kept trying to rebut one other. At times, the moderator seemed as if he had walked off the stage, a result of new rules that were intended to allow for a deeper and more freewheeling discussion.
On a basic level it was a clash of two ideologies, the president's Democratic vision of government playing a supporting role in spurring economic growth, and Mr. Romney's Republican vision that government should get out of the way of businesses that know best how to create jobs.
Mr. Romney sought to use his moment before a prime-time audience of tens of millions to escape the corner Mr. Obama and his allies have painted him into, depicting him as an uncompromising adherent to policies that have been tried before. He instead turned the focus on his opponent's record.
''You've been president four years. You've been president four years,'' Mr. Romney said at one point. He ticked through a list of promises he said Mr. Obama had not lived up to, and said, ''Middle-income families are being crushed.''
Neither candidate delivered that knockout blow or devastating line that each side was hoping for. Still, style points went to Mr. Romney, who continually and methodically pressed his critique of Mr. Obama. The president at times acted more as if he were addressing reporters in the Rose Garden than beating back a challenger intent on taking his job.
Throughout the evening, Mr. Romney escaped Mr. Obama's attempts to pin him down on which deductions he would eliminate in his tax proposals.
''At some point,'' Mr. Obama said, ''the American people have to ask themselves: Is the reason Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret, is it because they're going to be too good? Because middle-class families benefit too much? No.''
Mr. Obama criticized Mr. Romney for his answer to a primary debate question last year in which he joined his fellow Republicans in saying he would not accept a budget deal allowing $1 of tax increases for every $10 in spending cuts. ''Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach,'' Mr. Obama said, ''then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.''
Mr. Romney said his position on the tax-for-revenue deal was because of the state of the economy, not necessarily ideology. ''I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because when the economy's growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone,'' he said.
He said his proposals were unlike those of other Republicans because he was combining tax reform with lowered tax rates. ''My plan is not like anything that's been tried before,'' he said. He said he would not support any tax cuts that added to the deficit, in other words, that were not paid for.
The debate, held at Magness Arena on the campus of the University of Denver, was the first of three face-to-face encounters between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. It took place even as voters across the country were already casting early ballots.
All year Democrats have been waiting for Mr. Romney to make a more overt appeal to the sort of moderate voters he needs to win over by highlighting the more centrist positions from his years as Massachusetts governor. And on Wednesday he seemed to highlight his record in ways he had yet to do.
Even as he repeated his plans to repeal the president's health care plan, he happily embraced the plan he pushed into law in Massachusetts -- the basis for the president's -- that is anathema to many in his party.
''I like the way we did it in Massachusetts,'' Mr. Romney said of his health plan. ''We had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.''
But an argument for bipartisanship animated much of Mr. Romney's message through the night. He said he had worked with Democratic legislators in Massachusetts. And he said that he would do the same thing on his first day in the Oval Office.
The claim drew one of Mr. Obama's sharpest retorts of the night. ''I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day,'' he said, ''because he's also going to repeal 'Obamacare,' which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.''
Mr. Romney pressed Mr. Obama on a provision of his health care overhaul that cut $716 billion from the growth in Medicare, saying that by cutting fees paid to providers it was certain to affect treatment. And he emphasized that his plans for Medicare would not affect current beneficiaries or people close to entering the system.
But Mr. Obama interjected, saying that if ''you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen because this will affect you.'' He said that Mr. Romney's plans to offer subsidies for private insurance would mean ''the traditional Medicare system will collapse.''
The discussion between the candidates often unfolded in a staccato of statistics, making it difficult to follow. The candidates quarreled over subsidies for the oil industry, Medicare cuts, taxes and government spending.
In the opening half of the debate, Mr. Obama sought to link Mr. Romney to former President George W. Bush. For his part, Mr. Obama sought to link himself to the economic policies of former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Romney pushed back against Democrats arguments that he is proposing a form of ''trickle-down'' economics that would benefit the rich and hurt he middle class. He accused Mr. Obama of proposing ''trickle-down government.''
''We know the path that we're taking isn't working, and it's time for a new path,'' Mr. Romney said.
Both campaigns acknowledged that the race is close enough that the first debate could reorder a contest that has recently appeared to be tilting in Mr. Obama's favor, in spite of continued economic hardship throughout the nation and a slower recovery than he promised four years ago. The candidates meet for their second debate on Oct. 16 in New York.
While acrimony has deepened between the rivals, the men smiled broadly as they strode briskly onto the stage Wednesday night and exchanged a hand shake that lingered for several seconds. The president opened his remarks by wishing his wife a happy 20th anniversary and offered her a promise: ''A year from now, we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.''
Mr. Romney congratulated Mr. Obama and drew laughter from the crowd when he joked: ''I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine -- here with me.''

HEADLINE: Jobs and Service Sector Data Point to Modest U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Companies in the United States added more jobs than expected last month while activity in the vast services sector picked up, suggesting the economy remained on track for modest growth. 
The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 162,000 jobs in September. While the gain topped economists' expectations, it was still fewer than the 189,000 new hires seen in August.
Separate data showed the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index for the service sector rose to its highest level since March at 55.1 from 53.7 as new orders accelerated.
''It looks more like things are heading in the right direction. It is this new reality. We don't have robust growth; we just have very moderate growth,'' said William Larkin, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass.
The ADP report comes ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, which will include both public and private sector employment. That report is expected to show job growth improved slightly, with employers adding 113,000 jobs. Private sector payrolls are seen rising by 130,000.
''While the economy isn't plunging into recession, it still isn't creating enough jobs to drive the unemployment rate lower either,'' Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote.
Small businesses, firms with fewer than 50 workers, added half of the jobs in September, according to ADP, with 81,000 new workers. Large companies with 500 or more workers added 17,000 jobs, while companies in the middle created 64,000 jobs.
The increase in private payrolls in August was revised down to 189,000 from the previously reported 201,000. July's rise was also revised down, to 156,000 from 173,000.
Last month the Federal Reserve introduced an aggressive new plan to bolster the economy, saying it would buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities a month until the outlook for the job market substantially improved and as long as inflation remained under control.
The I.S.M.'s forward-looking new-orders index jumped to 57.7 from 53.7, but growth in employment eased to 51.1 from 53.8.
Exports also waned, to 50.5 from 52.
Services firms, which range from agriculture to real estate companies, avoided the contraction that hit their manufacturing counterparts over the summer.

HEADLINE: Sioux Racing to Find Millions to Buy Sacred Land in Black Hills

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
The Black Hills, the rolling range of mountains that rise out of the badlands of western South Dakota, are considered sacred to the Sioux, who for 150 years have fought on battlefields and in courtrooms for the return of the land.
And so the Great Sioux Nation exulted this summer when a long-sought parcel in the mountains called Pe' Sla by the Lakota was put up for sale and a bid from the Sioux was accepted by the family that had controlled the land since 1876, the year that Gen. George Armstrong Custer died not far to the west at Little Bighorn.
But now, anxiety has replaced optimism as more than a half-dozen Sioux tribes, which include some of the nation's poorest people, race to come up with the $9 million purchase price before the deadline next month.
Not only poverty stands in the way, but also the charged history: many Sioux ask why they should have to pay for land that already belongs to them, given numerous treaties broken by the United States and a landmark federal court decision in 1979 that called the government's seizure of the Black Hills one of the most dishonorable acts in American history. 
''It's like someone stealing my car and I have to pay to get it back,'' said Tom Poor Bear, the vice president of the Oglala Lakota Tribe in South Dakota.
On Friday, tribal chairmen from across the Great Plains are scheduled to meet to devise a strategy.
But if the Sioux tribes -- which for generations have been troubled by grinding poverty, unemployment rates as high as 80 percent, and disproportionate levels of violence, alcoholism and preventable death -- are unable to come up with the money, long-held dreams, as well as a $900,000 initial payment, will be lost.
''This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get some land back that is very, very dear to us,'' said Louis Wayne Boyd, the treasurer of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, which has taken the lead in the purchase. ''Most of the tribes want to do something, but it's very difficult for them to raise any money, especially of this magnitude.''
The Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 guaranteed the Sioux ownership of the Black Hills, but after the discovery of gold, the federal government took back the mountains.
Pe' Sla (pronounced pay-shlah), 1,942 acres of prairie in the heart of the range, was first homesteaded by the ancestors of the current owners, the Reynolds family, in 1876.
More than 100 years later, in 1979, the United States Court of Claims, discussing the federal government's misdeeds against the Sioux, including its tactic of starving them, before it appropriated the land, wrote that ''a more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealing will never, in all probability, be found in our history.''
The next year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Sioux had not received adequate compensation for the Black Hills and ordered the government to pay them. The Sioux, however, have refused to accept any money, saying that doing so would have the effect of selling their mountains. Instead, they insist on the return of the Black Hills to tribal authority.
The government fund, accumulating interest in a federal bank account, has grown to more than $800 million, although the Sioux say that using the money to buy Pe' Sla is not an option.
The Sioux believe that the site was the scene of an epic battle between good and evil, and each spring they hold a religious ceremony there, where life is welcomed back with peace after a long winter.
Pe' Sla is deemed sacred, but the plan to spend millions in scarce revenue on its purchase may not represent a consensus of the Sioux.
''There are mixed feelings,'' said Vernon Schmidt, executive director of the Rosebud Sioux's land enterprise department. ''Some tribal members are wholeheartedly in support, and other tribal members are not. It's hard to say, 'Tighten your belt,' but we're going to have to do it anyway. There's no dollar amount you can put on a sacred site.''
The Reynolds family, which declined to comment, has used the land it calls Reynolds Prairie Ranch -- pristine grassland bisected by an asphalt road -- for cattle grazing, but has always allowed access for prayer ceremonies.
The Sioux say their culture would be irreparably harmed if their bid to buy Pe' Sla failed and the land was bought by an owner who prevented them from visiting.
''Our ceremonial patterns would collapse,'' said Victor Douville, who teaches Lakota history and culture at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, S.D. Mr. Douville said that there had been annual pilgrimages at Pe' Sla for 3,000 years, and that if they were halted, ''we might come to an end as a people.''
So far, though, the Rosebud Sioux say they have received no firm financial commitments from other tribes, despite promises. The deadline to come up with the remaining $8.1 million -- an amount roughly equal to the tribe's annual budget -- is Nov. 30.
''Not by any means are we a rich tribe,'' said Mr. Boyd, treasurer of the Rosebud, whose unemployment rate is 83 percent. ''It was always our intention to work with other tribes. We are a little nervous because this is a lot of money, and it would really hurt us if we had to do it ourselves.''
The Oglala Lakota -- one of the few tribes with fewer resources than the Rosebud Sioux -- say they intend to help, but have not yet decided how much to give.
''Our tribe, even though we're a poor tribe, we'll come up with some money,'' said Mr. Poor Bear, the tribe's vice president.
One hope had been that the richest of the Sioux tribes, the Shakopee Mdewakanton, which operates a highly profitable casino and entertainment complex outside Minneapolis and donates millions each year to other tribes, would contribute as well.
But Tessa Lehto, a spokeswoman for the Shakopee, said in an e-mail that she had ''no information'' about a forthcoming grant or loan for Pe' Sla.
The Rosebud Sioux have been left to negotiate with commercial banks, which often decline to make large loans to tribes because banks are generally prohibited from seizing assets on reservations if a tribe is unable to repay.
Still, Charmaine White Face, the coordinator of the volunteer group Defenders of the Black Hills, echoed the sentiments of Sioux across the Great Plains. ''It can't not go through,'' she said of the purchase.

HEADLINE: Merkel's Plan B?

BYLINE: By JOHN VINOCUR

 BODY:
BERLIN -- As recession bit hard early in 2009, Angela Merkel proclaimed Germany's ''social market economy'' as provider of a new set of benchmarks for capitalism. Sounding very sure of herself and her country's healing wisdom, the chancellor exclaimed, ''These guiding principles must be followed worldwide.''
Germany's economy bounced upward after a deep descent, and the rest of Europe, without a rival game-plan and in thrall to the power of German finances, accepted Berlin's liturgy of austerity cum low-growth. Now, those two components are colliding. 
Austerity is strangling a European recovery that never really took place. Achieving the E.U.'s debt and deficit reduction targets can look like a torturous long-shot. And Merkel's Germany, which she portrayed as dwelling above such second-rate failings, is forecast by the O.E.C.D. to enter recession by January [pdf].
So where's Plan B, a little recalibrating, or even a small demonstration of German suppleness and imagination? Looking ahead in July, I wrote it wasn't yet forthcoming.
Now, the answer is: Nowhere.
The 2013 national election campaign began last week with the Social Democrats' selection of a candidate to face Merkel, effectively setting up a campaign in which nothing will be dared.
The chancellor's unique selling point has been making German voters immune to external grief. With a recession and an election at her throat, there will be a new reality that hardly lends itself to cutting the rest of Europe more slack -- one likely to lead the incumbent in the direction of finding a scapegoat or two (like America flooding the globe with cheap, inflation-causing dollars), and repeating that Germany has gotten it just right, its new misery being the product the world's weaknesses.
Merkel's opponent, Peer Steinbrück, is not the guy to challenge her on Germany's inadequate blueprint. During the Grand Coalition government of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, he served as her finance minister, and in 2008 set the tone for Germany's attitude toward E.U. members in trouble by initially refusing to join an E.U. bailout fund for fear of German money being misused.
''There is no plan, no idea about Germany's future, and Ms. Merkel's cubbyhole is empty,'' Handelsblatt, the business newspaper, wrote this week in an editorial. It added: ''Today's Social Democrats are no better.''
In a sense, you might call this a reflection of the instincts of the German electorate. In an essay titled ''No risks now, folks!'', Renate Köcher, director of the Allensbach opinion research institute, described voters as predominantly concerned with their own material security and ''allergic to political reforms.'' She wrote, ''There is not the slightest indication of a growing feeling of European identity. An overwhelming majority of citizens is skeptical about accelerating the process of European integration.''
This, of course, is not acknowledged by the political class, but Merkel and Steinbrück certainly won't play against the reflexes of the electorate. So, the non-articulated heart of the campaign is a battle between the candidates to appear as the most eager guardian of German interests and voters' social benefits.
Want to think of a German election campaign in which the debate between left and right is focused on sharing euro zone members' debt through the creation of Eurobonds? Or on a European banking union that might eliminate German institutions like the chronically weak and wasteful (yet politically significant) Landesbanken and Sparkassen?
Fahgettaboudit.
John Kornblum, U.S. ambassador to Germany under Bill Clinton, has pointed to the discrepancy between German interests that are basically not the same as its neighbors' and the Merkel government's self-characterization as ''extremely European.''
''Hardly anybody buys that, '' he said.
Indeed, German willingness to discuss a European banking union and a decision by the federal constitutional court to approve the permanent E.U. rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, have been sold here as new German flexibility concerning Europe's frailties.
But just read German exegeses of the court's finding. What the judges really did, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine, was to rule that any decision made by the E.S.M.'s councils requires subsequent Bundestag approval.
Concerning the banking union, the Germans have made clear they will delay its approval so as not to have it weigh on the election, and resist Spain, and eventually other countries' notions that they could shift recapitalization of their banks from their own responsibility to the E.S.M.
What you get here is Germany saying it's interested in much closer, even complete European political union -- but putting a brake on the process. This is at time when the E.U.'s real economy is heading straight for the wall, with Claude Bartolone, president of the French National Assembly, describing as ''untenable'' France's pledge to reduce its deficit to 3 percent of G.N.P. in 2013. How could a faster, more powerful German response not be required?
Last week, Merkel focused her ideas on the future, commenting that ''a lot of deep respiration'' will be needed to put an end to the euro zone crisis.
She may as well have told Europe, now constrained by Germany's ''guiding principles,'' hey, don't bother me now, I'm running for re-election.

HEADLINE: Exposing Power, and Its Effects

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Have you ever wondered what it is like to roam China's corridors of power, where politics is a skill thousands of years old and state secrets abound? Wang Xiaofang roamed them for a decade and lived to tell the tale -- an achievement, considering that the man whom he served as private secretary, the executive deputy mayor of Shenyang, Ma Xiangdong, was executed for corruption in 2001, the year Mr. Wang left government to become a writer.
Today, with a dozen novels to his credit and a first, ''The Civil Servant's Notebook,'' just out in English, Mr. Wang's goal is ''to tell the truth'' about China, he said by telephone from the southern Chinese island of Hainan, where he was spending the weeklong National Day vacation. 
So what is the truth about China?
''We worship power. That is the real China, that is its essence,'' Mr. Wang said, tracing the country's cultural obsession with power and its human embodiment, the government official, back about 2,200 years to the rule of the despotic Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who curtailed freethinking and meted out harsh punishments.
Mr. Wang's words reverberate today as the country watches the fall of Bo Xilai, the former star politician, amid corruption and morals charges, in the biggest political scandal in China in decades. Mr. Bo's wife, the lawyer Gu Kailai, is in jail for murdering a British businessman. His former police chief in Chongqing, Wang Lijun, is in jail after being convicted of defection and other charges after fleeing from Mr. Bo to a U.S. consulate in February. In the United States, Mr. Bo and Ms. Gu's son, Bo Guagua, hovers, a princeling in exile.
Mr. Wang's words reverberate especially strongly for another reason: Hundreds of top Communist Party officials are competing fiercely for more power as the country gears up for its most important political meeting in a decade, the 18th Party Congress, due to start in Beijing on Nov. 8. The meeting will pick new leaders for China.
Power worship has exacted a heavy price from China's soul, Mr. Wang said.
''We all adore power, but our spirit has been castrated by power. This is the heart of my novel, its core idea,'' he said, referring to ''The Civil Servant's Notebook.''
Secretly, Yang Hengda, the official who opens the novel's action, knows it.
Shortly after getting the promotion he dreamed of to be the head of the No.2 Department of the city of Dongzhou, Mr. Yang thinks of his new office: ''Every day when I open this door I am at my most smug and complacent -- and my soul is at its most empty.''
Mr. Yang also knows he owes his promotion from lowly researcher to his having agreed, against his better judgment, to drink his own urine for five years in order to please his powerful backer, the shadowy Old Leader, who believes that urine prolongs life. As the action begins, the Old Leader is in the hospital with uric acid poisoning.
Mr. Wang, who portrays conspiracy, betrayal and lovelessness as part of everyday life for the official, sees Mr. Bo's downfall as merely part of the same game -- just like the secret politicking before the Party Congress, an event that most people cannot observe and that those who can, cannot discuss publicly.
While he did not comment directly on Mr. Bo's fate, Mr. Wang said: ''The basic attitude of the officials with power is: You don't need to know anything. Because if you know something, then you threaten my power. Hence all the secrecy that we see around us.
''Power must be a monopoly. Power is hidden. It doesn't like the sun. If you know too much, then they lose their power.''
''Some people have said that my novels are how-to manuals, how to rise as a civil servant,'' he said. ''I disagree deeply. My novels are about people who are alive but have no life. With this novel, I want to open up this closed can and let the sun shine into it, and maybe it will rot, maybe it will live. Maybe it will become free.''
China is urgently in need of change, he said.
''What did gaige kaifang do?'' he asked, referring to the policy of economic openness that began after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.
''It let those who couldn't breathe, breathe. But we mustn't let materialism be the only thing it gave us. Even more, we need freedom to spread, the freedom that has been suppressed since the time of the Emperor Qin Shi. That has been suppressed by thousands of years of this kind of unfree, power-driven thinking that the officials represent.''
Hardly any author in China dares write about the reality of power and how it operates in the country, he said.
''They don't want to write about the darkness,'' he said. ''So many are bureaucrats, paid by the system. Everyone wants to become an official, and then they are eaten up by the system.''
He added: ''If writers fall silent in the face of power, of the darkness, then everyone will fall silent. Even God will fall silent.''

HEADLINE: Egypt Struggles to Pay Oil Bill

BYLINE: By FARAH HALIME

 BODY:
CAIRO -- A prime example of the difficult financial and economic circumstances that the new Egyptian government faces is the billions of dollars it owes foreign oil companies.
The Oil Ministry is in the midst of negotiating new payment deals with the companies, which are among the leading investors in the country, oil executives say. Industry executives estimate that the government is $6 billion to $7 billion behind in payments to the companies for oil and natural gas they have produced and delivered to the state-owned Egypt General Petroleum Corp.
The companies are supposed to be paid within two months, but the government has been delaying payments to conserve cash.
''It's a burden largely shared across all the oil companies,'' said Nick Dancer, country manager for Egypt at Dana Petroleum of Britain. 
The company received 78 percent of overdue debts by April, a company financial statement said. But it is still discussing ''different forms of repayment schedules'' with the E.G.P.C.
''While we don't want to maintain this position long-term, we have every confidence that the E.G.P.C. will bring us back to normal,'' Mr. Dancer said.
Dana Petroleum, like the other foreign operators in Egypt, including BP of Britain, Eni of Italy and Repsol of Spain, forms joint ventures with the E.G.P.C. to explore for oil and natural gas. The discoveries are then shared between the state and the company.
Despite the problems, companies that are able to withstand higher levels of debt are still attracted by Egypt's oil and gas potential. For instance, BP decided in September to invest $11 billion in an Egyptian gas project that is expected to produce 40 percent of the country's natural gas output when completed.
In February, the U.S. oil producer Apache agreed to spend $1 billion developing Egyptian hydrocarbons over the next two years.
Because its domestic consumption is rapidly growing, Egypt winds up using its share of production locally rather than earning much-needed revenue from exports.
The country has shifted from being a net exporter to a net importer of oil over the past decade.
In a rare peek into Egyptian petroleum finances, Hani Dahi, head of the E.G.P.C., told the government-owned newspaper Al Ahram that the organization had paid off $9 billion in such arrears to the foreign companies in the fiscal year that ended June 30.
A central problem is Egypt's longstanding practice of importing oil and gas at international market prices and selling locally at subsidized prices. This not only encourages waste but means that the state oil industry is now operating at a loss.
Much of Egypt's spending on subsidies goes to keeping the price of natural gas below market rates. Egypt has the cheapest fuel in the Middle East, with a liter costing as little as one Egyptian pound, or 16 cents.
Not surprisingly, the state bill for energy subsidies has climbed to almost $16 billion a year, representing about a fifth of the government's entire budget. The cost of imported petroleum products was $5 billion in the fiscal year ended in June.
Egypt's financial supporters, including the International Monetary Fund, which is considering a $4.8 billion loan for the country, are calling for cuts in these subsidies.
The government has promised to phase out subsidies and begin a coupon system that would distribute subsidies to the neediest. So far, none of these overhauls have been implemented because the government worries about angering a population that no longer fears to express itself.
On Wednesday, Oil Minister Osama Kamal said that Egypt was holding off on reform of the state energy subsidy regime until it completed more studies and held a ''social dialogue'' on the issue. But he also said that Egypt would have a major economic problem until the subsidies bill, which represent about a quarter of state spending, is cut. ''Every day we delay restructuring subsidies bleeds state resources,'' he said, though he declined to say when the subsidy regime would be reformed.
''The burden has become very high on the Egyptian government,'' said Magdi M. Nasrallah, a professor at the Department of Petroleum and Energy Engineering at American University in Cairo, and a consultant to energy companies operating in Egypt. ''It has become dangerous because Egypt is buying the share of the joint ventures at international prices and selling this share on at subsidized prices.''
The E.G.P.C. has had to renegotiate contracts with several oil companies whose concern about mounting debt is threatening one of the country's most lucrative industries, he said.
BG Group, a natural gas producer based in Britain, is among those exposed to Egypt's debt problem and is talking with the government about repayment. The company, which has invested more than $10 billion in Egypt over 23 years, said it had agreed to ''a mechanism with the Egyptian government that will allow the company to recover all outstanding receivables.''
''We remain committed to Egypt and are in the process of delivering or considering opportunities which will require a further multibillion-dollar investment,'' the statement added.
BG's financial statements show that in 2011 the company refinanced $590 emillion of overdue receivables that are scheduled to be fully repaid by the end of 2014. The company declined to comment on whether this amount relates to BG's operations in Egypt.
Another company that has engaged with the Egyptian government on overdue payments is Dana Gas, which has no affiliation to Dana Petroleum.
Dana, based in the United Arab Emirates, was owed $198.5 million by Egypt as of June 30, according to its half-year results. The company received $117.3 million from Egypt during the first six months of the year.
Transglobe of Canada, whose activities are concentrated in Egypt and Yemen, said it collected $41.4 million in receivables outstanding from E.G.P.C. at the end of June 30, without disclosing the total amount owed.
Meanwhile, Circle Oil, an Irish energy company with interests in Egypt, said in its latest financial statements that its E.G.P.C. receivables had been ''reduced since year-end despite higher sales revenue.''
Thomas Voytovich, local general manager of Apache, Egypt's biggest foreign investor, said the company had not been hurt as much as others by payment difficulties because 80 percent of Apache's revenue in Egypt came from oil rather than gas.
Companies who earn most of their revenue from gas have been most affected because of Egypt's artificially low prices for natural gas.
''Most of our revenue comes from oil, which gives us some optionality,'' Mr. Voytovich ''The companies that are most reliant on natural gas, that's an animal of a different color.''
He said Apache's operations, in remote areas of the Western Desert in Egypt, had continued uninterrupted.
The company's annual statement shows that it has an insurance policy with the Overseas Private Investment Corp., an arm of the U.S. government, which covers nonpayment by the E.G.P.C. of amounts owed on past dues.
''I won't say they don't owe us money, because they do, but the amount of past due receivables that Apache has is not materially different that it has been for many years,'' Mr. Voytovich said.

HEADLINE: Some Protesters in Middle East Regret Anti-U.S. Outbreaks

BYLINE: By KRISTEN McTIGHE

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Ahmad Aggour is a 24-year-old Egyptian activist who was shot in the face by the police during clashes last November on Mohammed Mahmoud Street in Cairo and again in his legs in February at protests that followed soccer riots in Port Said. In short, he has no qualms about protesting.
Yet Mr. Aggour said he was embarrassed when a mob of angry protesters breached the United States Embassy's walls in Cairo on Sept. 11 to protest a short trailer for an amateur film mocking the Prophet Muhammad.
''The movie defaming Muhammad wasn't a movie, it was just a trailer,'' Mr. Aggour wrote to his Twitter account the Friday after protests began. ''We are the movie.'' 
Liberal activists like Mr. Aggour started the Arab Spring revolts. Now they are taking to the social media to express their dismay that a contentious film trailer could generate more attention and outrage than bloody oppression and threats to the freedom that they have risked their lives to obtain.
Some liberal activists say the latest unrest is further proof that Islamists have seized the gains of the revolution. Others, though, suspect that far-right provocateurs are fueling the rage and argue that the protests highlight the continuing struggle between moderate and extreme Islamic forces.
''While you are outraged, remember the Bahrain regime, along with other regimes, have attacked mosques, burned Korans and killed,'' Maryam Alkhawaja, acting president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, wrote on her Twitter account.
Many activists are expressing similar sentiments on the social media. They are saying that the demonstrations against the anti-Islam film epitomize the focus on religious issues instead of on continuing repression.
Nowhere is frustration and disillusionment louder than in Syria.
''We begged our Arab 'brothers' to protest against Bashar's crimes against humanity and Islam. Nope, they'd rather protest against Obama!'' Shakeeb al-Jabri, an editor of a Syrian activist news site who is based in Beirut, wrote on Twitter, referring to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.
The circumstances surrounding the film have fueled activists' suspicions. It was a crude film promoted by a shadowy assortment of right-wing Christians in the United States and posted on YouTube in June, then picked up three months later by ultraconservative Salafist groups in Egypt. Protests were called for the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
''My feelings are that there is something very manufactured about this, on both sides, very shady characters setting out to provoke,'' Hani Shukrallah, a political writer and managing editor of Al Ahram, an Egyptian daily newspaper, said in a phone interview in Cairo. ''You have to look at who stands to benefit.''
Some online activists drew attention to the role played by Nader Bakkar, the official spokesman of Egypt's ultraconservative Nour Party, which is politically at odds with the Muslim Brotherhood, the party of President Mohamed Morsi, in calling for protests at the United States Embassy in Cairo on social media.
In an opinion article for The National, an Abu Dhabi daily, Issandr El Amrani, a journalist based in Cairo who blogs as the Arabist, said Mr. Bakkar had announced on the widely watched Al Jazeera television channel that the American media had broadcast the film.
Mr. Aggour, the activist, said: ''Why didn't these people later interfere to try and stop the fights? They give these guys a reason to be angry, then they tell them to protest, get them close to the police, then clashes break out and they run away and say, 'No, no, we didn't have anything to do with it.' ''
''There is an ambassador dead because of this, and I blame Bakkar,'' he said, referring to the roughly simultaneous violence in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead.
After the attacks on the embassy in Egypt, Mr. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood have been pressed by conservative Islamic groups to take a firm stance against the United States for allowing the film's release. In a country where more than 60 percent of the population sees Islam as playing a major role in the political life of the country, Mr. Morsi has been careful not to offend his Islamic base.
''Now the Salafists are back on the stage,'' said Mr. Shukrallah, continuing with a reference to the protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo that came to symbolize the Arab Spring. ''They can push the Muslim Brotherhood to the wall, embarrass them or challenge how Muslim they are in order to push their agenda.''
''This is the exact opposite of what was in Tahrir,'' he continued, referring to Tahrir Square, the location of the Arab Spring protests in Egypt. ''This was just the golden opportunity for them to strike against the values of the revolution that they are so against.''
Other observers think Islamist extremists are provoking unrest in an attempt to gain political ground. Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate in the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the attacks in Libya that left Mr. Stevens and the other Americans dead had been a symptom of the Salafist militants' isolation from the mainstream and a sign of division among their own groups.
''Libyan Salafis who returned to Libya from abroad during or after the revolution are grasping for traction by resorting to the usual slogans: rooting out idolatry, whipping up anti-Americanism, and sending volunteers to Syria,'' Mr. Wehrey said by e-mail from Doha, Qatar. ''There has been an enormous backlash against the Salafis' attempt to muscle their way to prominence: by civil society groups, women's organizations, other Islamists like the Muslim Brotherhood, tribes and the grand mufti of Libya.''
In an effort to strike back after the attacks in Benghazi, many Libyans took to the social media in a counterprotest of apology -- uploading photos to Facebook of Libyans carrying hand-lettered signs condemning the violence and expressing contrition for the attacks on the United States Mission.
The question then turns to who the protesters are and why they took to the streets. In Cairo, protesters overwhelmingly said they were rallying to the defense of the Prophet Muhammad, but analysts say the reasoning was more complex.
Robert Malley, the Middle East and North African program director for the International Crisis Group, said there were socioeconomic causes behind the recent events. ''There is a large number of unemployed, politically unanchored, socially marginalized youth, many who may have played a part in the Arab Spring,'' he said. ''They haven't benefited, and are likely not to benefit for some time, making them easy prey for the Salafist movement.''

HEADLINE: Anger Erupts in Tehran as Currency Plunges

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK and RICK GLADSTONE; Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Ramtin Rastin contributed reporting from Tehran.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- The first outbreak of public anger over Iran's collapsing currency and other economic maladies jolted the heart of the capital on Wednesday, with the riot police violently clamping down on black-market money changers, hundreds of citizens marching to demand relief and merchants in the sprawling bazaar closing their shops in protest.
Iran's official news media said an unspecified number of people, including two Europeans, had been arrested in the turmoil, which was documented in news photographs, at least two verifiable videos uploaded on YouTube and witness accounts.
Economists and political analysts in Iran and abroad said the anger reflected the accumulated impact of harsh Western economic sanctions over Iran's disputed nuclear program, as well as the government's inability to manage an increasingly acute economic crisis. 
It came a day after Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said at a televised news conference that the plunge in the value of Iran's currency, the rial -- which has fallen by 40 percent against the dollar this past week -- was orchestrated by ruthless currency speculators, the United States and other unspecified internal enemies of Iran. He urged people to stop selling their rials for dollars, a currency he once characterized as ''a worthless piece of paper,'' and warned that speculators faced arrest and punishment.
But Mr. Ahmadinejad, whose stewardship of the economy has been increasingly challenged by other Iranian politicians in the last year of his term, offered no new solutions to arrest the slide in the rial, which is a major inflationary threat and has become the most visible barometer of Iran's economic travails. Because of the sanctions, Iran is facing extreme difficulties in selling oil, its main export, and in repatriating dollars and other foreign currencies, because Iran has been cut off from the global banking system.
Unscripted protests in Iran are highly unusual, particularly since the political opposition in the country was crushed after Mr. Ahmadinejad's disputed re-election in 2009. Iran experts said the outbreak on Wednesday was significant because it appeared to offer an insight into the degree of public weariness.
''It may not be widespread yet, but it demonstrates not just unhappiness with the Ahmadinejad government, but also dissatisfaction with the Islamic republic's failure to stem the economic crisis brought about by incompetence, mismanagement and sanctions,'' said Alireza Nader, a political analyst at the RAND Corporation, a research and consulting firm. He said that ''the regime is going to face much greater instability in the future, especially if it loses the support of Iran's business and merchant class.''
Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said in an audio commentary on the group's Web site that the sanctions had effectively halved Iran's oil exports, choked its ability to import essential goods and left its currency worth a fraction of its value compared with early this year. ''These are hard times for ordinary and upper-class Iranian people,'' he said.
The unrest caught the attention of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who, speaking from Washington rejected Mr. Ahmadinejad's explanation for the rial's plunge. She suggested that conditions would improve if Iran engaged in meaningful negotiations over its nuclear program, which Western powers and Israel suspect is meant to develop nuclear weapons, but which Iran says is for peaceful purposes.
''I think the Iranian government deserves responsibility for what is going on inside Iran,'' she told reporters. ''And that is who should be held accountable.''
Mr. Ahmadinejad's warning to currency manipulators appeared to be the reason for the deployment of riot police officers in and around Manoucheri Street in central Tehran, where the black-market money changes had been doing a thriving business, particularly in recent days, as hundreds of Iranians sought to trade their rials for other currencies, fearing even worse times ahead.
Witnesses described cat-and-mouse chases between riot police officers on motorcycles armed with tear gas and batons, and money changers and their customers, who had to scatter.
Anger spread to Tehran's grand bazaar, where many merchants closed their stores. Some were cheered by shoppers in denouncing the government for its financial support of Syria's embattled government instead of investing that money at home.
''They spend billions of dollars to keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power, but now they say they have no money!'' one clothing merchant screamed, according to witnesses.
A team from Iran's state television was nearly attacked when its reporter turned to the camera saying that the people behind him had been upset over a robbery.
Abdullah, a young man selling textiles, loudly complained that it had become extremely difficult to do business when the value of the rial was so unpredictable. ''The checks our customers give us bounce, we don't know what prices will be tomorrow, how can we earn a living?'' he asked.
One of the videos uploaded on YouTube that witnesses verified as genuine showed hundreds of demonstrators marching peacefully and chanting, ''Leave Syria alone, think of us!''
But other videos, apparently uploaded by Iran's underground and exiled opposition movement to exploit the moment for political advantage, appeared to be fake, blending clips from Wednesday with old footage from the antigovernment protests that followed the disputed election more than three years ago.
The secretary general of the Tehran Bazaar and Trade Union, a powerful official close to the government, accused unspecified outside instigators of pressing bazaar merchants to close their shops. The official, Ahmad Karimi Esfahani, was quoted by the Iranian Labor News Agency as saying that most merchants had wanted to remain open. ''Those now present are trying to show the bazaar as closed,'' he was quoted as saying. ''They are guided by foreigners.''
Other bazaar traders hinted that the closing had been organized by powerful opponents of Mr. Ahmadinejad, who were trying to make him look weak. The bazaar is firmly in the hands of conservative businessmen who once supported Mr. Ahmadinejad's rise to power but now strongly oppose him.
Members of Parliament and Shiite Muslim clerics have been calling for an end to the black-market currency trade, accusing the money changers of driving down the rial's value. Others have called upon the government to buy rials and sell dollars, presumably from the central bank's reserves, to stabilize the rial. But it is unclear how large a cash reserve the central bank has at its disposal.
The head of Iran's central bank and Mr. Ahmadinejad regularly say that Iran has more than $100 billion in cash, but government contractors, state employees and even members of the Revolutionary Guards have complained of late payments in recent months -- and sometimes of none at all.
With many trying to blame Mr. Ahmadinejad for the wide range of problems plaguing Iran, he seems to be gearing up for a political fight. On Tuesday he attacked the head of Iran's parliament, Ali Larijani, accusing him and other politicians of trying to bring him down, after Mr. Larijani said the government practiced ''Robin Hood economics.''

HEADLINE: A Roman Rapper Comes to New York, Where He Can Get Real

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
When Jovanotti, a pioneering Italian rapper, was starting out in the 1980s, he and his producers tried to emulate the sound of the Beastie Boys and Run-DMC as produced by Rick Rubin. They had all the right equipment, like the Roland 808 drum machine, but no matter what they did, they could not get their tracks to sound as powerful.
''We tried to do exactly the same thing, but we couldn't make it sound so rude,'' Jovanotti recalled recently. ''If you listen to my records of the same time as 'Walk This Way,' they sound small, while if I play 'Walk This Way,' it still sounds huge.'' 
Eventually he came to a realization about music and geography. ''It's not just Rick Rubin,'' he said. ''It's the place.''
That place is New York City, sacred ground for any hip-hop fan and an especially mythical site for an artist who learned the craft from afar. After Jovanotti -- a tall, shaggy-bearded Roman whose real name is Lorenzo Cherubini -- released his first single in 1987, he went on to sell millions of records and join the fraternity of the famously mononymous (Bono, Pavarotti). He vies with a motorcycle racer, Valentino Rossi, for the title of Italy's most-followed Twitter user.
Making a mark in New York remained an itch, though, so three years ago he began his pilgrimage, playing club shows in occasional series. Last month Jovanotti, 46, moved with his family to an apartment in Greenwich Village, and his American invasion began in earnest. In August a compilation of his work, ''Italia: 1988-2012,'' was released here by ATO Records, and on Saturday he will perform at Terminal 5 in Manhattan as part of a national tour.
When asked why he was taking a risk in a country that can be brutally indifferent to the pop of other tongues, Jovanotti said he was stimulated by the city's energy and by the connection to his musical roots. But he acknowledged that ''pure ambition'' played a role.
''You respect Fellini here, you respect Roberto Benigni, you respect Antonioni,'' he said. ''Why is it that Italian pop music is totally off the radar? I just want to try to break that tradition.''
''Being somebody in America is the dream of every musician in the world,'' he added.
His background is as much Old World as old school. He grew up around the Vatican, where his father was a guard. In 1979, at the age of 14, he saw a TV report about the new musical phenomenon taking shape in the Bronx and, though he could barely understand the words, was mesmerized by the Sugarhill Gang's ''Rapper's Delight.'' He absorbed endless American sitcoms like ''Happy Days,'' a world far removed from the political and economic strife of Italy at the time.
''The father was so funny and so nice,'' he said of ''Happy Days.'' ''My father was always tired and always hungry, while the father of Richie Cunningham was never hungry.''
His early records mimicked American rap, but by the 1990s he began to develop a more eclectic songwriting voice. He drew from the dusky romanticism of Italian ballads, and rhythms from Latin pop and from Africa, leading to songs like ''L'Ombelico del Mondo,'' a huge hit that might ring a bell for any tourist who passed through Italy in mid-90s. Political and social causes also made their way into his work.
Over a leisurely three-hour meal at an Italian restaurant near his new home he discussed his childhood in Rome, postwar Italian politics and his infatuation with American pop culture. He can be disarmingly chummy until he casually drops a conversational bomb underscoring his place among the ultra-elite, like: ''I had the privilege to know opera through Luciano Pavarotti, who was a friend of mine -- a real friend of mine.''
That magnetism, and the energy of his live performance, could help win over American audiences. So could his accessible and wide-ranging musical style, said Joseph Sciorra of the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute at Queens College. He also noted that Jovanotti's arrival follows a mini-wave of other sophisticated Italian pop performers like Vinicio Capossela, Carmen Consoli and Avion Travel, who have been turning up at New York clubs and some American festivals in recent years.
''Jovanotti's potential for success here in the States is that he is this consummate pop artist, knowing how to tap into what's cool,'' Mr. Sciorra said.
To sell him in America, Jovanotti's label, ATO, is going after the ''food and wine crowd,'' said Jon Salter, the label's general manager. That means pushing him at stores like Barnes & Noble and through noncommercial radio stations like KEXP in Seattle and WFUV in New York. So far the tastemakers love him, but that has not translated into big sales. According to Nielsen SoundScan, ''Italia: 1988-2012'' has sold about 1,000 copies in the United States.
Jovanotti can afford to take it slowly. He is dividing his time between New York and Italy, where he remains a megastar. Next summer he plans to do a tour of 15 soccer stadiums there, which could sell as many as one million tickets. ''I don't want to get rich in this country,'' he said. ''That's not even something I'm thinking about.''
Instead, he said he is soaking up American culture, pulling all the inspiration he can from New York.
''It's like tomatoes in Italy,'' he said. ''You cannot have these kinds of tomatoes here. In Whole Foods I can find wonderful tomatoes. But the tomatoes we have in July in Italy? It's another thing.''

HEADLINE: You Want Haunted? We've Got Jeffrey Dahmer in the House

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
The haunted house is theater's answer to the video game: interactive, addictive and often underestimated as an art form. Audience members move room to room, with surprises around every corner. While the experience is highly structured, there are enough choices for viewers to make that no two visits are exactly alike. 
The central difference, of course, is that no matter how enveloping a video-game world may be, it can't simulate the reality of being chased by a man with a power drill. ''Killers: A Nightmare Haunted House,'' at Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, the latest theatrical scare show by Timothy Haskell, exploits this advantage splendidly. Instead of startling audiences with ghosts or vampires or movie villains, the production is peopled with real-life serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy.
You enter the dark, smoky house in groups of six and over the course of 40 minutes, you get a view of the dining room of Ed Gein, the graveyard-robbing lunatic who inspired the makers of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' and ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' and the streets where Jack the Ripper prowled. These celebrity killers appear in economically plotted, vividly designed vignettes that end with a strategically timed shock. It may be the sudden sound of a chain saw or something slithering around your feet. And what's that smell?
Mr. Haskell stages these mini-dramas and sleights of hand with the panache of a seasoned magician. His production includes limited dialogue, sticking primarily to an evocative and detailed visual vocabulary, steering clear of indulgent theatrical flourishes and thematic self-importance. Paul Smithyman's production design is, like so many of the greatest horror movies rooted, in a grim realism. The sets are full of empty spaces interrupted by chaotic messes; the lighting is stark and the sound cacophonous. This is a no-nonsense haunted house, a taut, assured production that knows exactly what it wants to do (scare the hell out of you) and performs its task with ruthless, coldblooded precision.
''Killers: A Nightmare Haunted House'' continues through Nov. 3 at Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side; hauntedhousenyc.com.

HEADLINE: Why Let the Rich Hoard All the Toys?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Imagine a kindergarten with 100 students, lavishly supplied with books, crayons and toys.
Yet you gasp: one avaricious little boy is jealously guarding a mountain of toys for himself. A handful of other children are quietly playing with a few toys each, while 90 of the children are looking on forlornly -- empty-handed.
The one greedy boy has hoarded more toys than all those 90 children put together! 
''What's going on?'' you ask. ''Let's learn to share! One child shouldn't hog everything for himself!''
The greedy little boy looks at you, indignant. ''Do you believe in redistribution?'' he asks suspiciously, his lips curling in contempt. ''I don't want to share. This is America!''
And then he summons his private security firm and has you dragged off the premises. Well, maybe not, but you get the point.
That kindergarten distribution is precisely what America looks like. Our wealth has become so skewed that the top 1 percent possesses a greater collective worth than the entire bottom 90 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
This inequality is a central challenge for the United States today and should be getting far more attention in this presidential campaign. A few snapshots:
The six heirs of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, own as much wealth as the bottom 100 million Americans.
In 2010, 93 percent of the gain in national income went to the top 1 percent.
America's Gini coefficient, the classic measure of inequality, set a modern record last month -- the highest since the Great Depression.
This dismal ground is explored in an important and smart new book, ''The Price of Inequality,'' by Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. It's a searing read.
''We are paying a high price for our inequality -- an economic system that is less stable and less efficient, with less growth,'' Stiglitz warns.
The problem is not that the rich are venal or immoral, and I buy into the Chinese mantra of the reform era: ''To get rich is glorious.'' But today's level of inequality is unusual by American historical and global standards alike, and, as Stiglitz notes, evidence is mounting that inequality at the levels we've reached stifles growth and employment.
As I see it, the best way to create a more equitable society wouldn't be Robin Hood-style redistribution, but a focus on inner-city and rural education -- including early childhood programs -- and job training. That approach would expand opportunity, even up the starting line, and chip away at cycles of poverty. If the cost means forcing tycoons to pay modestly higher taxes, so be it. The economy wouldn't suffer.
After all, the United States enjoyed strong growth in the 1950s when we were a more egalitarian country, even though the top income tax rate in that decade was always more than 90 percent.
Indeed, it was only in 1987 that the top income tax rate dropped below 50 percent in the United States. So the 15 percent rate that some tycoons pay because of the carried interest loophole is a recent, er, entitlement.
On this issue, Americans seem by intuition to be flaming lefties. A study published last year by scholars from Harvard Business School and Duke University asked Americans which country they would rather live in -- one with America's wealth distribution or one with Sweden's. But they weren't labeled Sweden and America. It turned out that more than 90 percent of Americans preferred to live in a country with the Swedish distribution.
Perhaps nothing gets done because, in polls, Americans hugely underestimate the level of inequality here. Not only do we aspire to live in Sweden, but we think we already do.
It's also troubling that a considerable share of wealth today comes from the plutocratic version of welfare.
Mitt Romney, for example, became rich in private equity, as did many barons of finance. They're smart, entrepreneurial and hard-working business executives. But private equity exists largely because of tax advantages for corporate debt that amount to a huge subsidy.
Likewise, the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington estimates that four major tax breaks that encourage excessive corporate pay cost taxpayers $14.4 billion last year. And 26 chief executives received more in pay last year than their companies paid in total federal corporate income taxes.
Often the best route to wealth isn't competing in the marketplace but lobbying Congress for a tax break. That's why there are six lobbyists for every member of Congress from the health care industry alone.
All this inequity would be unconscionable if it unfolded in a kindergarten. It should be more offensive when it defines our nation from womb to tomb.

 BODY:
Q. Our house has a dirt driveway. Would it pay to put in something more permanent?
A. ''The condition of the driveway sets the tone for the condition of the home,'' said Amanda Miller, a real estate agent with Sotheby's International Realty in Greenwich, Conn. If you have a driveway that's in poor repair, buyers may immediately assume the rest of the house needs work as well. 
It's important to consider the context. If your home is in a secluded, wooded area, she said, ''a dirt driveway would add allure and charm to the approach'' and could probably be left as is. But if you're in a more populated, manicured area, putting in something more permanent, in a material like asphalt, stone or concrete, she said, ''would be a wise investment.''
A driveway can be an appealing design feature when done well, said Joe Weuste, the owner of the landscape design firm Summerset Gardens, in Warwick, N.Y.
''One mistake I see people make is that they don't think the driveway needs to be designed like the rest of the yard,'' he said. In fact, it deserves as much attention as the front walk or the front steps.
The most economical material for a new driveway, and a very attractive option, is gravel, Mr. Weuste said. (His driveway at home is gravel, as it happens.) It may require some maintenance, he said, as snowplows can push the gravel to one side during the winter, and weeds can grow up from time to time.
''But to me,'' he said, ''it's worth it for the look and feel.''
Gravel is best in a somewhat rural setting, he said, and owners of homes in urban settings might prefer asphalt, which tends to be more expensive, or concrete pavers, which can cost even more. The most high-end option, he said, is cobblestone, but it might be worth the expense for an upscale property.
''Cobblestones are so elegant and timeless,'' he said. ''They worked hundreds of years ago and they're still around. There's something so charming when you pull into a cobblestone driveway.''
To create a similar effect on a budget for a number of his projects, Mr. Weuste has installed cobblestones along the edges of the driveway and as a ''driveway apron'' (covering the first few feet of the driveway, where it connects to the road) and then used gravel for the rest. ''That adds some visual appeal to the driveway, while keeping costs down,'' he said.
But if you plan to stay in your home for a few more years, Ms. Miller suggested thinking carefully about the functional requirements of your driveway. The crunch of gravel under tires ''sounds great when you're approaching,'' she said, and could help create a positive impression. ''But it's tough to walk on in heels,'' she added, and makes it ''difficult for the kids to ride bikes.''

HEADLINE: Markets Close Slightly Higher on Labor Report

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street ended modestly higher on Wednesday on stronger-than-expected data on the labor market and the service sector, but the Dow industrials were hobbled by a slide in Hewlett-Packard. 
Shares of H.P. dropped sharply after the company warned on Wednesday of a darker outlook for 2013 earnings, reflecting slow progress on the turnaround plan developed by the chief executive, Meg Whitman, and a slowdown in technology spending. Its stock fell $4.22, or 13 percent, to $14.91 a share, a nine-year low.
The three major stock indexes, which were initially lifted from the positive data, came off their highs by late afternoon trade on lingering concerns about the global economy. A gloomier outlook in China and Europe weighed on commodity prices and hit energy and materials shares.
''The ADP numbers were good and the services index was good, but we are missing the big catalyst to keep the market up,'' said Jack De Gan, principal and senior adviser at Harbor Advisory in Portsmouth, N.H.
Data showed growth in the services sector picked up in September, defying economists' expectations for a slight decrease, while last month, the private sector added more jobs than forecast. The data comes ahead of the closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.
The Standard & Poor's consumer discretionary sector index rose 0.8 percent, helped by stocks like Amazon, up 2.1 percent at $255.92.
But prices of crude and metals tumbled, pressuring stocks in the energy and basic materials sectors, and China's slowdown looked likely to extend to a seventh quarter.
The S.& P. energy index fell 1.1 percent. Chevron also slipped 1.5 percent, falling to $116.14, and dragged on the Dow.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12.25 points, or 0.09 percent, to 13,494.61 at the close. The S.& P. 500-stock index advanced 5.24 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,450.99. The Nasdaq composite index rose 15.19 points, or 0.49 percent, to close at 3,135.23.
H.P. forecast that its earnings would slide sharply next year, compared with Wall Street's expectations for flat profits.
''If you look at Apple and Google, they are pretty much doing well today. H.P. is basically on its own,'' Ben Schwartz, chief market strategist at Lightspeed Trading in Chicago, said.
Apple shares rose 1.5 percent to $671.45, and Google shares gained 0.7 percent to $762.50.
Best Buy shares gained 4.7 percent to $17.76 as the founder, Richard Schulze, and at least four private equity firms started examining its books, in early steps toward what could become an $11 billion buyout.
Shares of Family Dollar Stores rose 3.9 percent to $68.56 after the discount chain posted a higher quarterly profit. The proportion of bullish United States investment advisers fell below 50 percent for the first time in five weeks, hitting 46.8 percent in the latest week versus 51 percent the previous week, according to a survey by Investors Intelligence on Wednesday.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 100 3/32 and the yield was unchanged at 1.62 percent.

HEADLINE: To Return to Washington, Both Montana Senate Candidates Run Against It

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
GREAT FALLS, Mont. -- It is more than 2,000 miles from Washington to this old industrial city tucked along a bend in the Missouri River. But that distance still seemed uncomfortably close for the two men locked in a tight race for Montana's potentially pivotal Senate seat.
As they worked their way through town this week, shaking hands at the Staggering Ox restaurant and answering questions from 12th-grade government students, Senator Jon Tester, a first-term Democrat, and Representative Denny Rehberg, his Republican challenger, did their best to put another few miles between themselves and Washington, polishing their own Western credentials while hammering each other as Beltway partisans. 
The mustachioed Mr. Rehberg campaigns in cowboy boots and denim, telling stories about his family's old ranch and his days at Billings West High School. His speeches and advertisements are aimed at yoking Mr. Tester to President Obama, bailouts, deficits and health care reform -- none of which are popular here.
''They're trying to convert me into President Obama,'' Mr. Tester said one evening at his campaign office here, while a few volunteers made phone calls to voters. ''There are plenty of things I've done that have been different from the president.''
Mr. Tester, sporting an $8 buzz cut, argues he is the real agrarian. His family runs an organic millet and alfalfa farm near Big Sandy, and in his campaign ads, he drives a red combine across his fields and talks about understanding the lives of farmers. He has dismissed Mr. Rehberg as a ''mansion rancher'' who converted much of his ranchland to housing developments.
The race is one of a handful of contests that could tilt the balance of the Senate this November. And from the wildfire-hazy mountains in Missoula to the state's yellowing eastern plains, it is playing out as a bitter, personal contest between two men trying to out-Montana each other.
''It's about identity, about who Montanans are more comfortable with, as much as it is about politics,'' said David C. W. Parker, an associate professor of political science at Montana State University who is writing a book about the race. ''The question is, who is seen as more like the average Montanan?''
Both Mr. Tester and Mr. Rehlberg have reason to run from Washington on a few crucial issues. Although Mr. Tester voted for the stimulus and health care laws, he broke with the president on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and says he favors removing gray wolves from the endangered species list.
Mr. Rehberg, in his sixth term, points out that he voted against the budget put forth by Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate. And he joined other rural Republicans in urging House leaders to pass a farm bill that would provide help to farmers and ranchers after one of the worst droughts in American history. The Senate has passed its own version, but the House declined to take up a vote before it adjourned last month.
''I'm fighting my own leadership,'' Mr. Rehberg said in a question-and-answer session with students at Great Falls High School.
Despite the state's Republican tilt in presidential elections, Montana voters have an independent streak, for years sending Democrats to the Senate. To win with Mr. Obama at the top of the ticket, Mr. Tester will need a good chunk of Mitt Romney voters to split his way, including some members of his own wife's family, who vote Republican.
To his supporters, Mr. Tester still represents the New Western Democrat -- a straight-talking rural politician who supported hunters and energy development in addition to more traditional liberal positions.
Eli Parker, a lawyer in Missoula, recalled seeing Mr. Tester sitting alone in a cafe, like any other patron. Ingrid Lovitt, who works at a bakery in Missoula, met Mr. Tester at a dinner, and said he was ''just a nice, folksy kind of dude.''
But other Montanans said that Mr. Tester was just a liberal in populist clothing. Greg Philpott said he voted for Mr. Tester in 2006, but on Tuesday morning, he was one of 20 people sitting in the back room of a Greek restaurant in Great Falls, applauding Mr. Rehberg's promises to cut government spending, help small businesses and undo some of Mr. Obama's key domestic achievements.
''He looks like a good redneck Montanan,'' Mr. Philpott said of Mr. Tester. ''But if you're just going to toe the party line, you're not really speaking for Montanans.''
As the race intensifies, both campaigns are looking outside Montana for help. Big-name supporters like the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, and Senator Jim Webb, a Virginia Democrat, are flying into town, and outside groups are deluging voters with ads -- a total of 45,000 spots were shown from June to mid-September, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.
So far, the fierce attacks and $3 million in advertising have done little to break the race open. In a Mason-Dixon/Lee Newspapers poll conducted Sept. 17-19, the candidates were essentially tied, with 45 percent of likely voters supporting Mr. Tester, and 48 percent supporting Mr. Rehberg. The difference is within the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
If voters are split, it may be because they have voted for both men at the same time. In 2006, when Montana narrowly ousted the incumbent Republican, Conrad Burns, in favor of Mr. Tester, voters on the same ballot also sent Mr. Rehberg back to another term as the state's lone congressman.
At Spas of Montana in Missoula, the manager, Russell Moody, has put up red Rehberg yard signs, but said he doubted the election would do much to undo years of political paralysis in Washington and stagnant economic growth. His company recently closed a hot-tub factory in Stevensville, adding another few dozen people to the state's 6.3 percent unemployment rate.
''Something's got to change, no matter what,'' Mr. Moody said. ''People are disgusted with how things are going.''

HEADLINE: Reviewing the Numbers Before Candidates Trade Words

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
During the first presidential debate in 2008 between Senator Barack Obama and Senator John McCain, the candidates and moderator uttered 16,152 words. And as Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney opened a month of debates Wednesday night, the word counts for these spectacles should be about the same.
And many of those words will actually be numbers.
Throughout the campaign, both candidates had at their disposal numbers, figures, statistics and percentages to bolster their arguments and attacks. Most of those numbers have become staples of the Republican and Democratic stump speeches during the past several months, and are likely to be the focus of the three debates between the presidential candidates and the one faceoff between their running mates.
On Wednesday the candidates descended on Denver for their first debate, along with scores of aides who had been prepping them for the big night. With all eyes on their first face-to-face encounter in years, much attention will be on the stagecraft. But their main points through their month of debates will be delivered through a blizzard of numbers, and here is a roundup of the most frequently cited figures that have been at the core of the arguments between the two campaigns. 
8.1 PERCENT The unemployment rate, probably the most frequently cited number in the 2012 presidential campaign. Mr. Romney cites it as evidence of the president's persistent failure to confront a sluggish economy. Mr. Obama counters by citing more than two years of positive job growth.
30 The number of months in which the country added private-sector jobs. Mr. Obama frequently uses it to push back against Mr. Romney's attacks that he has failed at job creation.
47 PERCENT The now-famous proportion of the public that Mr. Romney said were ''dependent'' on the government and viewed themselves as ''victims.'' The president's campaign has seized on the comments from secretly recorded remarks as evidence of Mr. Romney's true feelings toward the less well off.
100 PERCENT The proportion of the American public that Mr. Romney says he will represent as president. During the debates, Mr. Romney is likely to emphasize this number frequently as he tries to counter the perception that he cares only about the wealthy.
$5,000,000,000,000 This $5 trillion figure is the cost of Mr. Romney's proposals to cut taxes for the wealthy, according to Mr. Obama's campaign. The president's claim that Mr. Romney would raise taxes on the middle class is driven by this estimate of the Republican tax cuts.
$16,000,000,000,000 The amount of United States debt. Mr. Romney has tried repeatedly to get people focused on the country's $16 trillion debt after four years of an Obama presidency. (His convention even featured a large debt clock.) For Republicans, it is a good way to motivate swing voters in places like Colorado.
$2,000 The amount that Mr. Obama says middle-class taxes will go up if Mr. Romney is elected. The president bases this on a study by a bipartisan research institute, and uses it frequently on the stump. .
5 The number of days that Mr. Romney says the United States government knew about the terrorist connections to the attack in Benghazi, Libya, before acknowledging them. Four people were killed, including the ambassador. Wednesday night's debate was focused on domestic policy, but Mr. Romney seems eager to push the idea that Mr. Obama was covering up the true nature of the attack.
$3.80 The average price of a gallon of gas. Energy has faded a bit as an issue since the summer. But if he gets a chance, Mr. Romney will use the debates to note that gas was $1.84 a gallon when Mr. Obama took office.
$6,400 The additional amount Mr. Obama says individual beneficiaries would pay if Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, enacted their plans for reforming Medicare. The president calls the Republican plan a ''voucher'' system that would cost beneficiaries more for insurance and drugs. Republicans accuse the president of scare tactics and bad math.
NO. 1 Where Russia ranks on the list of America's most important geopolitical foes, according to Mr. Romney. The Republican has since revised his comment, saying he was talking about Russia as a political adversary. Expect Mr. Obama to perhaps cite the number as evidence that Mr. Romney is not well schooled in foreign policy when they focus on this subject at a later debate.
4 YEARS The amount of time that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. says the middle class has been ''buried'' during Mr. Obama's administration. The administration quickly said the vice president was talking about a middle class saddled by the effect of Republican policies from before Mr. Obama's presidency. But Republicans have vigorously pounced on this.
23 MILLION The number of Americans who are, in Mr. Romney's vernacular, ''unemployed, underemployed or have stopped looking for work.'' This is one of Mr. Romney's favorite statistics, meant to dramatize the extent of the jobs crisis that has persisted and grown during Mr. Obama's tenure. During the debates, the president will likely cite steady -- if not spectacular -- job growth.
46.2 MILLION AND 15 MILLION The number of people in poverty and the growth in the number of people on food stamps. The Republicans use these figures to try to counter the suggestion that the president is the one who cares for the poor and the middle class.
47TH Where Massachusetts ranked in job creation during Mr. Romney's tenure as governor. The president's campaign likes this statistic, because it says it undermines Mr. Romney's claim of achievement as an executive. Mr. Romney counters that the job picture improved significantly by the end of his term.
$17,000 The amount at which Mr. Romney says he might cap deductions after lowering income tax rates. He offered the new detail this week after resisting any specifics, and could offer it during the debate. Democrats say such a cap could hit middle-income people who already deduct more for homes, health care and charitable donations.
4 The number of Supreme Court justices over age 70, who might be candidates for replacement by the next president. Both candidates can appeal to their base by warning that the direction of the court could be determined by the outcome of November's election.
2 The number of years of tax returns that Mr. Romney has released. This has been the focus of one of the most aggressive attacks by the president, who believes that it crystallizes the sense that Mr. Romney is out of touch with regular people. And it's been one of the things Mr. Romney has struggled to respond to.
12 The number of years of tax returns that George Romney, Mr. Romney's father, released when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968. Democrats love to tweak Mitt Romney with that number, especially because he awkwardly answered ''maybe'' when asked during a primary debate if he would do the same.
11 MILLION The number of illegal immigrants already in America. Mr. Romney has recently tried to soften his hard edge on immigration, saying that he would not undo Mr. Obama's executive order that allows some immigrants who came as children to stay for two years. During the debates, Mr. Obama may take the opportunity to remind viewers that Mr. Romney used to say the 11 million people should ''self-deport.''
14.1 PERCENT The rate that Mr. Romney paid on his federal tax returns during the past two years. When it comes to the president's effort to portray Mr. Romney as wealthy and out of touch, this is a crucial figure. Mr. Romney has argued that he paid every cent he owed, and defends lower rates on investment income as good for the economy.
20 PERCENT The size of the across-the-board tax rate cuts that Mr. Romney promises if he is elected. The Republican candidate says everyone will pay a lower rate, but that the wealthy will continue to pay because of loopholes and deductions that will be closed or reduced. The middle class will benefit the most, he says.
ZERO The number of votes in the Senate that Mr. Obama's budget received when Republicans forced it to a vote. Republicans love to cite this figure, using it as evidence of how out of the mainstream the president's proposals are. Mr. Obama counters that the vote was a gimmick engineered by Republicans to embarrass the White House.
1.3 PERCENT The United States' economic growth in the second quarter, revised down from an already paltry 1.7 percent. The new, lower figure that came out last week provides new ammunition for Mr. Romney to argue that the president's policies have failed to kick-start the American economy.
12 MILLION The number of new jobs that Mr. Romney promises his economic plan will deliver during his first term. It also happens to be the number of new jobs that independent economists say would be created during the next four years if Mr. Obama's current policies are followed.
$4,000 The amount that middle-class families will be taxed because of Mr. Obama's economic policies, according to Mr. Romney. On the stump, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan both use this figure, arguing that average Americans will continue to suffer during another Obama term. Democrats contest the figure.

HEADLINE: Longtime Chief of Pearson, Owner of Financial Times, Is Leaving

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of the global educational and media conglomerate Pearson and one of Britain's highest-ranking female executives, will step down after nearly 16 years, the company said Wednesday.
John Fallon, currently chief executive of Pearson's international education division, was expected to take over the company, which owns The Financial Times, the book publisher Penguin Group and half of The Economist magazine.
The transition, expected to take place in January, raises questions about the future of Pearson's flagship newspaper, known as The FT. Analysts have speculated that Pearson would sell the FT Group, which includes the rose-colored business daily and its various digital assets. Potential buyers include Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, both of which employ hundreds of financial journalists but do not own a daily newspaper. 
''I think it increases the chance that in the medium term they dispose of The FT,'' said Ian Whittaker, a media analyst at Liberum Capital in London. He said the company could look for other ways to slim down as its core education business faces challenges, particularly in the tough North American market.
A longtime player in printed educational products, Pearson has had to adapt to the digital era and a range of deep-pocketed competitors like Discovery Communications, the Walt Disney Company and Apple. At the same time, public schools in the United States face budget cutbacks.
''Penguin is in question, too, but there are more synergies between that and the education division than The FT,'' Mr. Whittaker said.
In an interview, Mr. Fallon said The FT was a ''valued and valuable'' asset that fit into Pearson's education business. He noted a popular English-language program in China aimed at executives that used The FT's business and markets coverage into lesson plans. The company says The FT has more than two million readers worldwide, including the print paper and its online, mobile and tablet services.
''If you look at the portfolio of Pearson, it's constantly changing and evolving and we never ever said what we're going to do or not going to do,'' Mr. Fallon said. ''We never rule out anything.''
Mr. Fallon, 50, does not have a traditional publishing background but does understand the company's fast-growing education business. He spent the last several years leading Pearson in its expansion into international markets, which represent a significant area of growth. Before taking over the international education division in 2008, Mr. Fallon headed operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
His appointment signals the company's global ambitions, particularly in emerging markets like China, Brazil, India and sub-Saharan Africa. ''What you see is a rapidly growing middle class that is very conscious of the importance and value of education,'' Mr. Fallon said.
Ms. Scardino, 65, was born in Arizona and previously served as chief executive of The Economist Group. She took over Pearson in 1997 and led a period of aggressive acquisitions, including the $2.4 billion purchase of National Computer Systems, a company that provides school administrators and teachers with data management for educational exams, and the $4.6 billion purchase of Simon & Schuster's educational, professional and reference book publishing business from Viacom.
Even as newspapers faced a downturn in advertising revenue, Ms. Scardino stood by The FT. When questioned about its future, Ms. Scardino once said Pearson would sell the newspaper ''over my dead body.''
Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg have denied that they are interested in acquiring the FT Group. But strategically, analysts said such an acquisition would make sense for either company because each relies on computer terminals that dispense financial news to a small but lucrative subscription audience mostly in the financial sector. That business has softened in recent years as Wall Street and hedge funds cut back.
The company said Ms. Scardino had for months planned to retire after leading the company for nearly 16 years.
Analysts said the timing corresponded to the challenges facing Pearson's core education business and that Ms. Scardino, who oversaw the 168-year-old company through a period of great growth wanted to go out on a high note, while board members wanted a leader who could emphasize digital and emerging market expansion.
''For more than 160 years, Pearson has stood for integrity, quality and business strength. It has been a privilege to be part of such a great company for a small part of its history,'' Ms. Scardino said in a statement.
Glen R. Moreno, the chairman of Pearson, said Ms. Scardino had ''navigated two recessions, one financial crisis, a dot-com boom and bust and several waves of structural industry change.''

HEADLINE: 18 'Tax Cuts' For Business

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
This summer, the number 18 has crept into President Obama's campaign speeches -- as in, "We've cut taxes for small businesses 18 times." (That's from a speech in Melbourne, Fla., last month.) The first lady, Michelle Obama, mentions it, too. And, of course, it came up frequently at the Democratic National Convention a few weeks ago, where it caught the attention of a regular You're The Boss commenter who calls himself Einstein. (No, not that Einstein.)
"Which small businesses had their taxes cut?" Einstein recently asked. "Hate to be skeptical but I know a lot of small-business owners and independent contractors and they never heard of ANY tax cuts. All this talk of helping small business from both political parties sounds like lip service. What are the facts?" 
Happy to oblige, Einstein. Back in 2010, when the administration's boast was that it had merely cut taxes 16 times, The Agenda wrote a post about it. Here are the White House's 16 "tax cuts."
From the 2009 stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, and other legislation:
A new small-business health care tax credit. A tax credit for hiring unemployed workers in 2010. Temporary extension of bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment. 75 percent exclusion of small-business capital gains, for stock acquired in 2009 and 2010. Temporary expansion of limits on small-business expensing. Five-year carryback of net operating losses, available through fall 2009. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses to seven years, from 10, in 2009 and 2010. Temporary small-business estimated tax payment relief.
Tax provisions in the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act (both The Agenda and the I.R.S. have published summaries): 100 percent exclusion of small-business capital gains, for stock acquired in late 2010 and 2011. A further increase to the expensing limit to $500,000 for 2011 (in 2012, the limit falls to $139,000). A further extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation through 2010. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed in 2010. Tax relief and simplification for cellphone deductions. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs' start-up expenses in 2010. A five-year carry-back of general business credits in 2010. Lower penalties for failing to report listed (that is, abusive) tax shelters.
Since then, the president has added two more tax cuts to the list, according to a Small Business Administration spokeswoman, who supplied an update:
Increasing bonus depreciation to 100 percent for 2011 (from the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, the compromise law that keeps the Bush income tax cuts in place through this year; for 2012, bonus depreciation falls to 50 percent and then expires). Tax credits for hiring veterans, ranging from $2,400 to $9,600 (from the Veterans Opportunity to Work to Hire Heroes Act of 2011).
As you can see, some of these aren't tax cuts in the way many people would define them. Rather, they're tax incentives - you've got to spend money (on health insurance, a new employee or new equipment) to save money. Several are improvements or extensions of previous tax incentives. (By that score, some other measures could also be counted as tax cuts, but don't appear on the administration's list - for example, the 2010 Small Business Jobs Act further reduced the built-in gains period to five years for an asset sold in the 2011 tax year.) And, of course, most were temporary, and have already expired.
So has the president really cut taxes 18 (or more) times? We've reported - now you decide.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Digital Roots To Dead Trees

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
Robin Sloan, a 32-year-old former Twitter manager and self-described ''media inventor'' from San Francisco, has established himself over the past few years as a notably nimble thinker on the future of digital culture.
But on Tuesday morning he arrived at the Grolier Club, a redoubt of rare book collectors on East 60th Street in Manhattan, prepared to talk -- mostly very quickly -- about the joys of old-fashioned paper and ink.
Dressed in a black Patagonia pullover and a straw fedora and downing a cup of coffee on the sidewalk, Mr. Sloan unleashed a rundown of the other venerable book depositories in the vicinity, including the New York Society Library on East 79th Street (the oldest cultural institution in New York) and the Mercantile Library on East 47th Street (now the Center for Fiction). ''We're standing in the middle of this whole history of private libraries,'' he said, opening his eyes wide as punctuation. ''It's really cool.'' 
''Cool'' is a word you hear a lot in conversation with Mr. Sloan. It's also a word that pops up often in his first novel, ''Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore,'' a rollicking neo-Borgesian tale about an unemployed San Francisco Web designer who takes a job in a mysterious bookshop only to find himself initiated into the Unbroken Spine, a 500-year-old secret society of bibliophiles on an unexpected collision course with Google.
The book, published this week by Farrar Straus & Giroux, is an affectionate shout-out to everything Mr. Sloan loves about his home city's tech culture -- some of whose luminaries were scheduled to appear in a 24-hour live Webcast staged by Mr. Sloan from the Center for Fiction, starting at 9 p.m. on Wednesday.
During a tour of the Grolier's atmospheric third-floor library Mr. Sloan gave a preview of the playful attitude and fast-twitch intellectual style that he brings to the older side of his story.
The Grolier doesn't own a copy of the ''Codex Vita'' of the 15th-century Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, the fictional tome on which Mr. Sloan's plot turns. But in preparation for his visit Meghan Constantinou, the club's librarian, had pulled out some ''Aldines,'' as books from Aldus's very real print shop are known.
There was a 1502 edition of Catullus, printed in reader-friendly italic type (an Aldus invention), and a 1504 edition of Homer that belonged to the early French collector Jean Grolier, the club's namesake. Both, Ms. Constantinou explained, were examples of the small-format, relatively affordable books that Aldus pioneered -- the rough predecessors of today's Modern Library classics.
Mr. Sloan, however, reached for another analogy. ''They're so appealing and human scale,'' he said. ''They must have felt as remarkable as an iPhone does now, and literally that high tech.''
Growing up in Troy, Mich., the son of a salesman and a home economics teacher, Mr. Sloan loved both computers and books, especially the ones ''with spaceships and dragons,'' he recalled. At Michigan State University, where he majored in economics, he started a literary magazine but never considered a literary career.
''I always got the sense that it was frivolous, and that maybe writing made-up stories wasn't the best use of my time,'' he said.
At the Poynter Institute, a journalism center in St. Petersburg, Fla., where he landed a fellowship after graduation, Mr. Sloan found himself writing them anyway, and grabbing huge numbers of eyeballs while he was at it. ''Epic 2014,'' a 2004 eight-minute Flash video describing an apocalyptic near-future in which the traditional news media are vanquished by a rampaging conglomerate called Googlezon, was viewed more than a million times -- impressive numbers in the pre-YouTube era -- and put Mr. Sloan and his collaborator, Matt Thompson, on the map.
''It's amazing to watch how many times people reference that film,'' said Andrew Fitzgerald, the manager of editorial programming at Twitter, who met Mr. Sloan shortly afterward, when both were working at Current TV in San Francisco. ''Robin is incredibly good at stepping out of the present and looking to the future in what for most people is a bit of a fantastical way.''
Mr. Sloan said he owed his job at Current to another bit of speculative fiction. After reading about the start-up in 2004, he e-mailed Joel Hyatt, who founded the company with Al Gore, to inform him that he would be sending him a new idea about digital strategy every day for the next month.
Not that he already had the ideas. ''I was driving cross-country, composing things in my head, stopping at rest stops to type them out,'' he recalled. ''The final message, basically, was 'Hire me.' ''
Mr. Sloan became Current's employee No. 7 and, eventually, its official ''futurist.'' Among many other projects he orchestrated what he called the first-ever television broadcast using live Twitter data, during the 2008 presidential campaign. In 2010 he became the manager of media partnerships at Twitter.
Around the same time he started thinking about a literary career, a process that, as he recounts it, comes across as a friendly hack on the traditional machinery of publishing. In the spring of 2009, inspired by a friend's tweet -- ''just misread '24-hour bookdrop' as '24-hour bookshop.' the disappointment is beyond words'' -- he wrote a 6,000-word version of ''Mr. Penumbra,'' which he published in the Kindle Store.
The story, priced at 99 cents, drew a respectable 5,000 downloads, Mr. Sloan estimated. Next came another straight-to-Kindle story, followed by ''Annabel Scheme,'' a detective novella ''set halfway between San Francisco and the Internet'' and financed with $14,000 raised on Kickstarter, then brand new.
In 2010 he signed with an agent, Sarah Burnes of the Gernert Company, and began spending his off hours from Twitter turning the Penumbra ''prototype,'' as he called it, into a full-scale novel. He had no shortage of ideas, he said. The bigger challenge was getting over the habit of writing in short, punchy -- in a word, bloggy -- chunks.
''When you're writing for the Internet, you have the analytics, and you know that people are bailing every second,'' he explained. ''But various people kept reminding me that once people have bought a book, they're in. You don't have to be selling them on every page.''
While his fantasy of printing ''Mr. Penumbra'' in a custom typeface named after a crucial character turned out to be wildly impractical, Mr. Sloan -- who fills the novel with odes to the beauty of the dead-tree book -- praises the glow-in-the-dark cover designed by Rodrigo Corral as ''a work of mad genius.'' And his publishers praise him for bringing an infectious spirit of optimism to an industry knocked sideways by digital technology.
''He's making things up as he goes along, making decisions partly on what's the most fun,'' said Sean McDonald, his editor at Farrar Straus. ''He has the right mix of cleverness and hardheaded business sense, and that's apparent in the book.''
When it comes to the showdown between print and digital, Mr. Sloan, who has 275,000 Twitter followers, strikes a gentle ''why can't we all get along?'' tone. Not that he is entirely unconcerned with the downside of living inside the Googlezon. One of his first digital projects since leaving Twitter last November was a much-blogged-about iPhone app called Fish, a ''tap essay'' questioning the erosion of attention in our distracted digital age. In the months since, he has downgraded his ''walking-around phone'' to a basic Nokia that can only handle texts and calls.
Cellphones of any kind are forbidden inside the Grolier Club. But during his visit Mr. Sloan made sure to test-drive a different piece of gee-whiz technology he wrote about in the novel but had never seen: a secret door concealed in one of the library's bookshelves.
Swinging it back and forth, Mr. Sloan noted with a satisfied smile, ''It's exactly as heavy as you expect a secret door to be.''

HEADLINE: Japan's New Tech Generation

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Every Wednesday, a bar in central Tokyo hosts an unusual speed-dating event. There are drinks and plenty of coy looks. But the young people at the bar aren't here for romance.
''I want to meet like-minded people -- basically, people who get the Internet,'' said Shingo Hiranuma, 29, a former smartphone engineer at Toshiba who recently introduced a new map application, Sanpo. ''And I won't settle for just anyone.''
As Japan's aging tech giants like Sony and Panasonic continue to falter, a new generation of Japanese technology entrepreneurs is stepping up. While their numbers are small compared to those in the United States, they are turning to a bevy of start-up incubators and even to financing from Silicon Valley. And so-called start-up dating salons, like the bar in central Tokyo, are helping to match would-be collaborators.
''There's a lot of uncertainty in Japan right now, and that's actually made younger Japanese more willing to take risks and try out new ideas,'' said Hiro Maeda, 26. 
Mr. Maeda went to college at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and worked on several start-ups in the United States before returning to Japan to create Open Network Lab, a Tokyo-based incubator.
Open Network Lab has financed five rounds of start-ups since its start in 2010. Mr. Maeda said it received close to 100 applications during its latest round this year -- more than twice the number from the previous year. The lab provides early funds, office space and mentoring.
Japan badly needs an infusion of entrepreneurial blood. With its economy sluggish and its population graying, the country slipped to No. 25 in the most recent ranking of global innovation by the United Nations, falling out of the top 20 for the first time since the survey began in 2007.
And it has become increasingly clear that the country's big electronics firms cannot be counted on to drive innovation. Japan's top tech giants in products from televisions to smartphones, their competitiveness sapped by a strong yen, are racking up huge losses and being overtaken by nimbler, cheaper overseas rivals.
More than ever, many innovations seem incremental or just plain odd. A $4,500 ''networked'' washing machine released by Panasonic in August that can be operated remotely via smartphone was greeted with derision in the Japanese blogosphere. ''Has Panasonic lost its way?'' one blogger asked.
Still, Japan's tech entrepreneurs have much to overcome if they hope to succeed where the mainline giants have not.
Japanese society continues to venerate lifetime company loyalty, while penalizing risk-taking and failure. The government has created a cumbersome web of regulations that hampers new entrants. And risk-taking is absent not just among would-be entrepreneurs, but also among investors, who still favor propping up old companies rather than fostering new ones.
''Whether you're talking about driving innovation or creating new jobs, it's clear that Japan needs to try something new,'' said Taizo Son, who helped start Yahoo Japan with his brother, Masayoshi Son, in 1996, and now runs the venture capital fund Movida Japan. ''But the odds are still stacked against people who dare to try.''
According to the Tokyo-based Venture Enterprise Center, the value of investments by its 50 or so venture capital fund members increased to 24.6 billion yen ($316 million) in 2011, 35 percent higher than the previous year. But that was a small fraction of the $12.6 billion in venture funding raised by Silicon Valley companies that year, according to Ernst & Young.
The proportion of the working population involved in entrepreneurship in Japan -- as measured by a start-up portal, InternationalEntrepreneurship.com -- stood at 3.3 percent in 2010, one of the lowest rates in the industrialized world. In the United States, the equivalent number was 7.6 percent.
Satoshi Sugie, Junpei Naito, Muneaki Fukuoka and Hiroshi Kurita are among those who are trying. All left comfortable jobs -- at Nissan, Sony, Olympus and Japan's largest advertising agency, Dentsu -- to work on Whill, a device that clamps onto wheelchairs to turn them into electric vehicles.
It is a big bet for the founders. Because they were unable to secure large investors, the 6 million yen put toward developing a prototype came from their savings. After it was invited to display the prototype at the Tokyo Motor Show last year, the start-up has been inundated with inquiries from Japan, Europe and the United States, the company says. The start-up is preparing to announce a brand-new model next week.
''At Whill, we move at such a different speed from Sony,'' said Mr. Naito, who came up with the idea for Whill before leaving his job this year as a Sony product engineer. ''We move things along much faster, and I enjoy that.''
Makoto Fukuyama, 27, and Kota Uemura, 25, ex-Google employees who started Social Lunch in October, have also seen interest surge among users.
Social Lunch's Facebook-based app helps young professionals set up casual business lunches to expand their social networks. The start-up now has 60,000 users and is adding 10,000 more a month. It won 32 million yen of seed money this year from a new start-up fund started by KDDI, Japan's second-largest telecommunications firm, but has found that few investors in Japan are willing to offer larger amounts.
Part of the problem is that there is still no real track record of start-up buyouts in Japan, which means the only way that tech entrepreneurs can cash out of an investment is through an initial public offering -- a lofty goal for most companies. (Eleven technology companies managed an initial public offering last year.)
Because Japanese investors do not have high expectations of a successful exit, they invest far less than their Silicon Valley counterparts, which leads to fewer companies succeeding, a vicious cycle that damps entrepreneurship.
''Seed funding has grown in Japan, but you're talking about very small amounts,'' Mr. Fukuyama said. ''Entrepreneurs are still seen as drifters with nothing better to do.''
But the growing trickle of older, more experienced Japanese who are leaving their jobs to start their own companies is helping to galvanize the local start-up scene, said Taku Harada. Mr. Harada runs PeaTiX, an event management start-up that lets users set up event invitations and ticketing.
Mr. Harada, who worked at Sony, Apple and Amazon before founding PeaTiX in 2009, says it has become easier for him to lure talent away from big companies; the average age at his 20-person start-up is well over 30, and all hires have extensive experience in the tech sector.
''More success stories might inspire more people at senior positions at corporations to make the jump,'' Mr. Harada said. Still, many potential recruits tell him that the blow to their reputations if they fail is too large in Japan.
''If you fail, you don't get many chances after that,'' Mr. Harada said.
The constraints of Japan's local start-up scene drove Gengo, a Web-based translation start-up, to look for investors and talent beyond Japan's shores. Robert Laing, 33, Gengo's founder and chief executive, had the idea of setting up a platform that instantly links clients looking for translations with a network of freelance translators worldwide.
But Gengo struggled to take off. Mr. Laing, a British citizen, paid himself nothing for a year, living off his savings. His business partner, Matthew Romaine, who is part Japanese, slept on the floor of his parents' apartment in Tokyo. Landlords would not lease them office space without years' worth of company statements.
Their break came in early 2010 when an American angel investor, Dave McClure, gave them seed funding and connected them with other investors outside Japan. Gengo's main investor is now Atomico, based in London, and a handful of non-Japanese investors.
Even as Gengo won investors and clients, it struggled to find people willing to join its team. It turned to Craigslist, word-of-mouth and recruiters to assemble what Mr. Laing calls a motley international crew, now 30 strong and growing. Only in the last year did Gengo make big hires in Japan; among those it brought in were Hiroto Tokusei, a former senior product manager at Google.
''We ended up with foreigners because they seemed to be the only ones willing to join some crazy start-up,'' he said. ''And because there are so few start-ups in Tokyo, we had nobody to discuss things with, to ask whether we're on the right track.''
The weekly start-up dating salons, like the bar Nomad New's Base here in central Tokyo, seek to fill such a need. As the drinks flowed, Mr. Hiranuma, the former Toshiba engineer, moved around the room on a recent Wednesday with his MacBook Air, pitching his Sanpo app.
Sanpo, which means stroll in Japanese, lets users plan routes to destinations, as Google Maps does -- except the app suggests detours to popular shops, restaurants and other spots along the way.
''It helps people take fun detours, and try something new,'' Mr. Hiranuma said. ''I believe in trying new things.''

HEADLINE: Turkey Strikes Syrian Targets After Shelling

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and ANNE BARNARD; Tim Arango reported from Istanbul, and Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon. Reporting was contributed by Hala Droubi, Hania Mourtada and Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul, and Thom Shanker from Washington.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Turkey said Wednesday that it shelled targets within Syria as retaliation for a mortar that landed across the Turkish border and killed five civilians, a move that increases the risk of escalating the bloody civil war into a regional conflict and ratchets up pressure for further international involvement.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which Turkey is a member and whose charter calls in some cases for collective action when one of its members is targeted militarily, called an emergency meeting on Wednesday evening to discuss the crisis, as Turkey's civilian and military leaders said Parliament would consider a motion on Thursday to permit further military action within Syria.
''This atrocious attack was immediately responded to adequately by our armed forces in the border region, in accordance with rules of engagement,'' said a statement from the office of the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, carried by the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency. ''Targets were shelled in locations identified by radar.'' 
And while suicide bombers killed dozens on Wednesday as violence surged in Syria's largest city, Aleppo, it was the cross-border strike that raised the stakes in a civil war that has left tens of thousands dead and forced more than a million people from their homes. The war has defied exhaustive diplomatic efforts by the global community. The events may increase pressure for the West to take military action, something Turkey has supported. The United States and its allies have balked at engaging in another armed conflict in the Muslim world that would be far riskier than NATO's intervention in Libya, which helped oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
''The conflict in Syria is spilling well over its borders,'' said Andrew Tabler, a Syria analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''I don't see how the Obama administration continues policy as usual after this.''
But in the fog of war that has settled over Syria, where allegiances and motives are uncertain and a bloody stalemate has taken hold, some observers said they could not help wondering if the episode had been orchestrated by one side or another. The rebels have implored NATO to provide a no-fly zone or havens, and President Bashar al-Assad may feel he can rally his supporters against foreign invasion, experts said. ''Various parties are trying to pull Turkey into the conflict,'' Atilla Sandikli, the director of the Wise Men Center for Strategic Studies in Ankara, Turkey, said on the Turkish channel NTV.
In Washington, George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, called the Syrian attack on Turkish territory ''yet another example of the depraved behavior of the Syrian regime, and why it must go.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she was ''outraged'' by the mortar attack in Turkey.
After its meeting, NATO issued a statement saying the alliance continued ''to stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant violations of international law.''
Turkey's military strike within Syria, which represented a further deterioration of relations between the onetime allies, came after several huge explosions struck a government-held district of Aleppo. The blast killed dozens of people and filled the streets with rubble in a square near a public park, according to video, photographs and reports from the Syrian government and its opponents.
At least two explosions, which both sides said appeared to be car bombs, struck Saadallah al-Jabiri Square near an officers' club and two government-owned hotels that residents said had housed pro-government militiamen who had essentially taken over the square. Another explosion struck near the chamber of commerce in nearby Bab Jenine, both sides reported.
Jabhet al-Nusra, an insurgent group affiliated with Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility late on Wednesday for the suicide bombings, which caused anguish for government supporters and opponents alike. The scale of Wednesday's bombings seemed to deepen Aleppo's sense of alarm and disgust, bringing expressions of horror and bewilderment from people on either side of the conflict.
''Oh, my God, the destruction is huge,'' an accountant who works nearby, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Rami, said on his cellphone as he tried without success to approach the square, which he said was barricaded by security forces. Back in his office, listening to gunfire still echoing through the area, he wrote on Facebook: ''My soul has died and my body is waiting for its turn.''
One Syrian activist, who uses the pseudonym Anonymous Syria, wrote on Twitter: ''Whoever is behind those explosions is a terrorist if civilians were killed. Whether it is the regime, Al-Nusra brigade or the Free Syrian Army.''
In the square, men simply shouted obscenities and cursed ''the terrorists' fathers.'' Their voices could be heard in the background as another man videotaped the bomb scene for a pro-government YouTube channel, panning over the corpses of two men in crisp camouflage uniforms who he said were would-be suicide bombers killed by security forces.
Before the retaliatory strike by Turkey, the government said in a statement that its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, had consulted Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria, as well as Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations. The prime minister's statement said the strike was within the rules of engagement established after the Syrian military shot down a Turkish warplane in June, killing two pilots in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea. Syria had claimed the plane was flying over its own territory.
''This last incident is pretty much the final straw,'' said Bulent Arinc, Turkey's deputy prime minister, as quoted by the Anatolian News Agency. ''There has been an attack on our land and our citizens lost their lives, which surely has adequate response in international law.''
The Syrian government urged restraint and offered condolences to the victims in Turkey. By announcing that an investigation was under way, it suggested that it never intended to strike within Turkey.
Syria's minister of information, Omran al-Zo'aby, suggested on state television that Syria was defending against a regional threat that could affect Turkey and Syria.
''The Syrian-Turkish border is a long one and is being used for smuggling weapons and terrorists,'' he said, adding that in response to border episodes, neighboring countries should act ''wisely and rationally and responsibly, especially in cases of the presence of armed terrorist groups who have their different agendas that are not targeting the Syrian national security but the regional security.''
It was unclear if the mortar that struck Turkey was fired by government forces or by rebels fighting to oust the government of Mr. Assad, but Turkey believed it came from a government position, Turkish analysts said. The government said it used radar to select the target for its strikes, believed to be Syrian military outposts.
The shell that set off the outrage struck a building in Akcakale, one of the largest cities along Turkey's 550-mile border with Syria, killing a woman, her three children and a relative. Officials said that eight other people were wounded, and that two were in critical condition. The town had been hit before amid the clashes between rebels and government forces, but no one on the Turkish side had been killed before. Stray mortars have also landed across other borders, including Lebanon and Iraq.
The tit-for-tat bombings signaled the collapse of the relationship between Syria and Turkey, which had blossomed before the Arab revolutions with deepening commercial and political ties between the two countries. When protests broke out last year in Syria, Turkey first called for reform, but as the government turned its guns on its own people, Turkey switched allegiance to the rebels.
But Turkey has paid a price, including a public outcry against its Syria policy, which has led to economic hardships in the south and a strain on government resources as officials contend with the refugee crisis.

HEADLINE: The Untouchables

 BODY:
In hopes of embarrassing President Obama, several right-wing news organizations took a renewed interest on Tuesday in a well-reported speech Mr. Obama delivered in 2007 to a conference of ministers at Hampton University, a historically black college in Virginia. As always, they tried unsuccessfully to twist the president's words into those of a racial provocateur; what they inadvertently succeeded in doing was highlighting a speech that was one of Mr. Obama's best, full of ideals and ideas about poverty and urban despair that have been ignored in this year's presidential race.
The two candidates said nothing about poverty in Wednesday's debate. The political reasons for focusing the campaigns on the middle class are obvious, but that doesn't change the fact that the candidates are ducking responsibility for neglecting those without a powerful voice at the ballot box, with Mitt Romney treating them with particular disdain. 
As the 2007 speech shows, Mr. Obama was once quite passionate about improving the lives of what he called ''young men and women without hope, without miracles, and without a sense of destiny other than life on the edge -- the edge of the law, the edge of the economy, the edge of family structures and communities.'' Fifteen years after the Los Angeles riots, he reminded his audience of the ''quiet riots'' that take place when those who are struggling reach the point of despair.
When schools are always second-rate, despair sinks in, he said. When good jobs are always out of reach, when housing is too expensive, when crime and violence loiter on every street corner, people decide that things are never going to get better. That year, as Mr. Obama noted, there were 37 million Americans living in poverty and on the far edge of hope. According to the most recent Census report, there were 46 million people in poverty in 2011.
The recession was the biggest reason for that 24 percent increase, obviously, and Mr. Obama has proposed a number of measures to lift the poor and revive the economy that have been rejected or diluted by Republicans. But many of the ideas he put forward in the Hampton speech -- a youth service corps, a program to help low-income people commute to jobs, a prison-to-work incentive program -- have never been tried or have been listlessly implemented.
''If we want to stop the cycle of poverty, then we need to start with our families,'' he said, urging programs to improve parenting skills, home environments and the health of infants. As president, he included $1.5 billion in the health reform law for a home visiting program that sends nurses and social workers to the homes of at-risk families. But as Paul Tough recently reported in The Times Magazine, the administration's efforts to build a comprehensive antipoverty strategy have been done ''in relatively small and uncoordinated ways, and often only temporarily.'' His education policies have focused more on test scores than on interventions to improve the troubling family situations that hold back so many low-income students.
Mr. Romney often mentions the rising poverty rate over the last four years, but his ideas for dealing with the problem would be far worse than Mr. Obama's neglect. By drilling for energy, demanding freer trade and providing tax cuts to businesses and the rich, he says, the economy will improve, pulling up the poor.
But the notion that tax cuts trickle down was long ago discredited, and his secretly recorded remarks claiming 47 percent of the country lives off government handouts show how little interest he really has in those far below him on the income ladder.
Reducing urban misery requires money, but, more urgently, it needs sustained attention and creativity. It may never be the subject of a real debate, but the untreated wound leaves both candidates with much to answer for.

HEADLINE: Georgia Speaks Its Mind

 BODY:
The stunning victory by a reclusive billionaire over the forces of the West-leaning president in Georgia raises a host of questions. But before they can be answered, the election itself is worth celebrating. It was a significant achievement that Monday's election in the small former Soviet state was deemed essentially free and fair by international observers, despite President Mikheil Saakashvili's increasingly imperious ways, and that both sides accepted its results nine years after the Rose Revolution. 
Still, the next steps are rife with dangers. Under a transitional political arrangement, victor and loser will have to rule jointly for most of the next year, and Georgia still has to find its place between the West and Russia, with which it fought a short, nasty war in 2008.
Mr. Saakashvili will remain president for almost a year as Bidzina Ivanishvili's victorious Georgian Dream coalition takes over the Parliament, with Mr. Ivanishvili most likely becoming the prime minister. Next October, a new constitution will come into force, devolving many powers of the president to the prime minister.
Until then, both men will have to somehow overcome the scars of a vicious campaign in a culture not given to compromise. Even in his gracious concession of defeat, Mr. Saakashvili noted that ''we believe that their views are extremely wrong.'' And Mr. Ivanishvili called on Mr. Saakashvili to resign, but later withdrew his demand.
Another challenge for the new government will be to lower tensions with Russia without abandoning its Western ambitions. Mr. Saakashvili, who took an unabashedly pro-Western stance, was completely spurned by Moscow, especially after the brief Russian-Georgian war. Russian boycotts of Georgian wine and other products have hurt the Georgians, while Russia's recognition of the independence claims of two Georgian regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, remains a deep wound.
Mr. Ivanishvili, who made a huge fortune in Russia, was little known even to Georgians before he plunged into politics a year ago, and remains something of an enigma. He promises to improve relations with Russia, and also says he will continue to pursue membership in NATO.
During the campaign, Washington wisely avoided taking sides. The United States and the European Union must continue giving the Georgians every incentive to build their democracy and to take their place in Western institutions. But overt interference can only create unnecessary tensions and suspicions.
Russia expressed hope that the election would help restore ''constructive and respectful relations.'' For Russia, that would mean lifting economic pressures and acknowledging that Georgia has its own hopes and dreams.

 BODY:
CHICAGO hit a grim milestone last week, when it recorded its 400th murder for the year. Homicides are up about 25 percent over last year. Chicago has surpassed New York and Los Angeles as a hub of gun-related violence, most of it involving young people. Since 2001, it has recorded more than 5,000 gun-related deaths, compared with the 2,000 American military deaths in the war in Afghanistan.
I've been studying violent crime for more than a decade -- first as an academic researcher, then briefly as a senior adviser to the F.B.I. -- and have been struck by the ways in which our efforts to stop gun violence are not as targeted and efficient as they should be. 
Until I started observing gangs and criminals, I used to think that young, violent criminals were generally adept in gun use. I learned the reality was far worse. Gangs and drug crews had caches of high-powered weapons but no formal training. Their members could not match a gun to its proper bullet. Few knew how to load, clean or shoot. Their aim was woeful: they injured one another -- not to mention bystanders -- as often as their enemies. It would be ludicrous to train gang members to shoot better (even if it would reduce the number of innocent bystanders who get shot, it would empower criminals). So big-city mayors, and their police departments, understandably focus on gun access.
But they have done so in an unbalanced way. Gun runners who transport weapons from federally licensed dealers to city neighborhoods have been singled out as a primary culprit. But purchases from authorized dealers account for only about 60 percent of gun purchases, and the gun runners -- so-called straw purchasers -- are responsible for only a fraction of these. We can no longer ignore the 40 percent of guns obtained on the secondary market, which includes gun brokers, gangs and other informal traders.
For inner-city young men, a gun is a badge of honor and an act of masculine one-upmanship. Rarely do they have access to straw purchasers -- most couldn't even name one. They do, however, know a gang or a clandestine seller around the corner from whom they can buy, borrow or rent a gun.
Stopping the intra- and interstate transport of guns by straw purchasers can net great sums of money, not to mention public acclaim. But more significant gains have been made by targeting the secondary market, through amnesty programs in which guns may be turned in by the public, no questions asked. In June, for example, 5,500 guns (including some replicas and BB guns) were turned in to the Chicago police as part of its annual gun ''buyback'' program. The incentive? A $100 gift card for each real gun. (Chicago's crime rate did not drop significantly as a result, but that is not the point of buybacks, which signal to communities that the police are interested in nonpunitive ways to get guns off the street.)
A second problem with current policy is the lack of support for mediation programs. In Boston, the interfaith Ten Point Coalition, co-founded by the Rev. Eugene F. Rivers with police support, helped reset relations between the community and law enforcement. Then the criminologist David M. Kennedy brought in his Ceasefire program, which brings street-based mediators and cops into productive discussions with gang members and would-be criminals. Gang violence sharply declined through both efforts, and Mr. Kennedy's experiment has been successfully replicated in other cities.
But many police chiefs have been reluctant to embrace such efforts. They fear that mediators will usurp their authority and become vigilante citizen patrols. Charities are reluctant to support mediation efforts because of a mistaken view that philanthropy should not get into bed with law enforcement. The fact that criminal justice programs receive less than 1 percent of total philanthropic giving should alarm us.
A third mistake: not understanding how guns change hands. A Justice Department study found in 2001 that 40 percent of all criminals acquired their guns on the street, but another 40 percent obtained their guns from friends or family members. Why not wage a national campaign around the familial dynamics that perpetuate liberal gun exchange?
We are unlikely to eliminate guns from the home, but at least we could get out this message, through social media and clever advertising, that just as friends don't let friends drive drunk, they shouldn't lend or give weapons away. Acknowledging that many illegal guns will remain on the streets, while recruiting friends and relatives to at least make sure those guns are kept away from untrained and emotionally volatile kids, would be a sensible step.
Good gun policy is good social policy. A study by researchers at the University of Chicago found that one-fifth of youths killed by gunfire there were innocent bystanders. The economist Steven J. Levitt has estimated that each homicide is associated with out-migration of 70 city residents. The total social costs of gun violence in Chicago have been estimated at about $2.5 billon -- $2,500 per household -- a year.
I'm sure that Chicago's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, could find better ways to spend that money. Gun buybacks, mediation programs and media campaigns aimed at gun owners and their families should be among them.

HEADLINE: At Debate-Watching Party in Suburban Ohio, Voters Are Less Than Thrilled

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
WORTHINGTON, Ohio -- Theater seats? Check. Shrimp cocktails and crudités? Check. Flat-screen television with the volume low just waiting for the big show to start? Check.
People who have been un-friended on Facebook by relatives because of their political views? Oh, yes.
The first night of truly must-see TV this fall season for the Gardner and Jernigan families in this suburb of Columbus was the first presidential debate Wednesday evening between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger. 
Jeremy Gardner, 32, a software developer and independent voter, hosted a small viewing party in a cozy living room where his two Chihuahuas were jumping around, looking truly excited.
Before the debate, the tensions were building. (There were partisans in the room.)
''I'm getting an eye twitch!'' said Heather Jernigan, Mr. Gardner's sister-in-law. An Obama supporter, she worried that even if he did well, his opponents would give his performance a negative review. ''Rainbows could shoot out of his ears and it wouldn't matter,'' said Ms. Jernigan, who works for an insurer.
Mr. Gardner was open to being swayed, but said he was leaning toward Mr. Obama.
Brent Jernigan, 48, a business consultant who is married to Ms. Jernigan and likes Mr. Obama, is the ultimate solo fact checker. It was his fact-checking on Facebook that cost him his aunt's friendship. What did those gathered here want out of the candidates' performance?
''I want to see an actual plan from Romney,'' Mr. Jernigan said. ''I'd like to see Obama be very forceful in defending his own actions as president. And I wouldn't be opposed to a highly entertaining moment from Romney, something like, 'I can see Russia from my house!' ''
After the debate, the group did not shift their views. ''I don't know the specifics of these things, so some of it didn't mean a lot to me,'' said Mr. Gardner, the host. ''Like I said before we started, I hate the 'I'm going to repeal what you did and do something that's better!' Who doesn't want to hear that? Basically nothing changed for me.''
Scenes from the evening:
9:02 p.m. President Obama's opening lines, wishing Michelle Obama a happy 20th anniversary, earned him a few sympathetic ''awwws'' from the women in the room. But Mr. Romney got a good reaction, too, when he joked about the debate being a ''romantic place'' for him and the president.
Then, it was on to the economy.
Mr. Romney's contention that he would reduce the tax burden on the middle class and reduce the deficit confused some of the debate watchers here in Worthington.
''But what about his own statements about the across-the-board 20 percent tax cuts?'' Mr. Jernigan asked out loud.
Mr. Romney repeated his claim that his tax plan would not add to the national debt, and that income earners at the top would not get extra breaks. ''Well, then you can't accomplish the things you promise,'' Mr. Jernigan said to the television. ''He's basically completely backed off saying he's going to do an across-the-board tax cut.''
Mr. Gardner's wife, Megan, added, ''Is this him not standing by his word?''
9:56 p.m. Is Medicare changing? Both candidates insisted that nothing would change for seniors today. ''Future seniors'' got a lot of attention. From the audience here, so did the personal style of the candidates as they answered the Medicare questions.
When Mr. Romney interrupted an answer by Mr. Obama, it didn't go over well.
''Tell him to shut up!'' Mr. Jernigan said to the television. ''He keeps inserting himself.''
Mr. Gardner said, ''Can Obama speak? He's just been standing there for a few minutes.''
Mr. Jernigan did not reply; he was busy fact-checking.
10:08 p.m. Numbers. Numbers. There were so many numbers. What was the impact of the figures overload?
''I think that these figures will be lost on a lot of people who aren't paying careful attention,'' Mr. Jernigan said.
Mr. Gardner added, ''And the numbers are so specific. But what's a trillion dollars over 10 years? It's an arbitrary number. What does that mean?
''Seems like it's more impactful or might seem more believable to some people to hear specific numbers,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''But if these numbers are false, it's going to be off-putting.''
10:43 p.m. Ms. Gardner and Ms. Jernigan both felt frustrated at the end of the debate, despite Mr. Obama calling it ''terrific'' in his closing statement.
''I was really kind of hoping Romney would say some stuff that I'd understand, as far as what his plans are,'' Ms. Jernigan said. ''And I don't feel that this has clarified anything for me.''
Ms. Gardner, a homemaker and dog breeder, said, ''I felt that Obama lost some of his passion. This time, when he was speaking, he just didn't have that.''

HEADLINE: How Lenders Make Money (and Create It Too)

BYLINE: PADDY HIRSCH


HIGHLIGHT: When the banking system works and lenders are actually lending, they can turn a $1 million deposit into much more than that sloshing around the economy. 

 BODY:
 In this excerpt from his new book, "Man vs. Markets," Paddy Hirsch, senior producer for personal finance at American Public Media's business radio program production house, Marketplace, explains the basics of lending from the bank's side of things. 
 Mr. Hirsch, perhaps best known for his series of whiteboard drawings and videos, leads the Marketplace team that produces two special newspaper sections and two hourlong radio shows each year in partnership with The New York Times. 
Today most banks work this way: borrowing money from depositors at one rate of interest, and lending the money out again at another, higher rate of interest. And pocketing the difference.
You might think that makes bankers pretty selfish. They pay measly rates of interest to their depositors and charge higher rates to people who want to borrow from them. In the end they're firmly focused on making a profit for themselves and their shareholders. The loans they make are a way to make that money.
Fortunately, the banks' lust for profits works to everyone's advantage.
The loans the banks make to companies and people usually do a great deal of good. The money helps us to buy everything from groceries to cars and houses, and it helps companies expand and hire. If people are able to borrow (and don't overstretch), the money they borrow can help grow businesses and create jobs, and that's good for everyone.
There's another benefit to banks' desire to lend money out in order to make profits: Lending creates money. Out of thin air!
This is how the magic works. One day, Mr. Smith comes to his bank and deposits $1 million. The bank keeps 10 percent, or $100,000, in reserve, in case Mr. Smith wants some of his money quickly.
The next day, Mrs. Jones comes to the same bank and asks for a $900,000 loan, to buy a private jet. The bank lends her the money. Suddenly the amount of money in the system has almost doubled. There's the million dollars that Mr. Smith has in his bank account. And there's the $900,000 loan the bank made to Mrs. Jones. Both are assets - Mr. Smith can point to his million-dollar balance on his statement, and Mrs. Jones has a briefcase full of cash - so both are real. The bank has turned a million dollars into $1.9 million, just like that.
Mrs. Jones drives out of the airport and gives the briefcase full of cash to Mr. Sharif, of Sharif Aviation. Mr. Sharif gives Mrs. Jones the keys to a gently used Bell 407 helicopter and puts the cash in his bank. The bank puts 10 percent ($90,000) aside as a reserve and lends $810,000 to a clothing manufacturer who needs to buy some new equipment. The clothing maker gives the equipment salesman the $810,000. He takes it to his bank, which holds 10 percent in reserve, and . . .
You get the picture. That $1 million has now more than tripled, in terms of its purchasing power. And yet there's no new money in the system - it's still just a million dollars. It's the banks' ability to lend that money out, over and over, that creates a ripple effect through the economy and improves everyone's ability to spend and to grow. Lending and borrowing can be a good thing, in other words. So long as you don't overdo it.
Which means that banks aren't all bad. Yes, some banks - or the bankers who run them - do make mistakes. Some bankers cheat, some bankers lie, and some bankers take foolish risks that threaten the entire global economy. But most banks and bankers work to our mutual benefit, and the network of the country's banks has become an essential part of our economy, driving money through the system like a heart pumping blood around the body.

HEADLINE: How to Read Like a Fact Chief

BYLINE: NANDI RODRIGO


HIGHLIGHT: The magazine's head of research tells us about her favorite illustrated memoirs and the book she has given as a gift - despite having never read it. 

 BODY:
 Nandi Rodrigo is the magazine's head of research. 
 Book I'm reading now: 
I've just started Zadie Smith's "NW." I have read only her essays and short fiction.
 Last book I loved: 
"The Tiger's Wife," by Téa Obreht. This novel about a family in a postwar Balkan country was so beautifully written that I had to read more slowly. Sometimes I would read sections twice. And the events seemed so real. It was like reading poetry and history all at once.
 Unread book on my bedside table that gnaws at my conscience: 
"Cloud Atlas," by David Mitchell. So many friends have raved about this book that I've given it to other friends as gifts. But I still haven't read it.
 Three books that I highly recommend: 
"Let the Great World Spin," by Colum McCann. I loved the quiet power of all the interconnected stories in this novel. You could hear what the characters were thinking. The book really captured 1970s New York City.
"The Last Life" by Claire Messud. Though the novel has been out for more than 10 years, I still recommend it to friends. The story is told from the point of view of a teenage girl who is uncovering her family history. It spans colonial Algeria, France and the U.S. I couldn't put it down, and I still remember the young narrator's mental state.
"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic" and "Are You My Mother? A Comic Drama," both memoirs by Alison Bechdel. I like reading memoirs in graphic form and these two are great. One is about Bechdel's relationship with her father and the other is about her relationship with her mother. There is a lot of painful probing of her parents as individuals, about the choices they made. It's as if Bechdel were a grown up critically looking at them even when she was a child.
 A new book that is high on my list: 
Pankaj Mishra's "From the Ruins of Empire: The Intellectuals Who Remade Asia."

HEADLINE: A Modest Rise in Global Food Prices

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: Prices rose only 1 percent in the all-important cereals sector in September. 

 BODY:
Given the fears set off by the agricultural disasters of the summer, the latest report on food prices from the United Nations has to be counted as good news. The Food and Agriculture Organization reported Thursday that global prices rose 1.4 percent in September from the previous month.
Prices increased only 1 percent in the all-important cereals sector, with gains in rice and wheat prices somewhat offset by a drop in corn prices. The overall figures suggest that the price run-ups that accompanied this summer's weather problems in several producing countries - including the United States, the world's largest grain exporter - are now largely factored into the market. 
And, barring some fresh disaster early in the Southern Hemisphere's growing season, it probably means we will get through this year without witnessing the peaks in global food prices seen in 2008 and 2011. Those, readers will recall, set off global unrest and prompted renewed commitments to agricultural development in poor countries. 
Still, the long-term food outlook remains worrisome. Prices are still high by the standards of recent history, and we have seen big increases in global hunger as a consequence. Adjusted for inflation, prices are more than 50 percent above the level that prevailed at the turn of the 21st century. As my colleague Ron Nixon relates in his take on the report, concerns persist about the potential for food shortages in those countries.

The F.A.O. now projects a 2.6 percent decline in world grain production this year, compared with record output in 2011. And even though high prices are suppressing demand somewhat, the agency expects the world to use more grain than it produces in the coming year. That means global grain stocks, already tight, will decline further.
In this environment, experts say, it would not take much of a supply shock to set off a new spiral of price increases.

HEADLINE: Four of Five Red Pencils to The Times on Fact-Checking the Debate

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Debate fact-checking was effective but could have been better integrated into regular coverage. 

 BODY:
With its battalion of fact-checking reporters at the ready, The Times did battle Wednesday night against lies, damn lies, statistics, misstatements and subtle truth stretching during the presidential debate in Denver.
So did competing forces around the country at other major newspapers and organizations like Politifact.com and FactCheck.org.
On Thursday morning, I put out the call to some professional observers and some regular readers, and talked to a few people inside The Times as well to get a read on how well it went. The effort was the paper's most extensive fact-checking effort, as Richard L. Berke, an assistant managing editor, told me this week.
Here is a sampling of what I heard - and eventually, my own thoughts. Although The Times, with its usual elegance, does not often stoop to gimmicky metrics like stars for movie reviews, letter grades for football coaches, or needle-to-the-wall applause meters for lies and truth, I have less self-restraint. I'm giving the effort four red pencils of a possible five, and will elaborate later.
Onto the opinions and observations of others:
From Dan Gillmor, director of the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at Arizona State University:
It's good to see The Times try to sort out truth and lies, but it would be great to see The Times a) call falsehoods and lies what they are instead of using euphemisms; and b) put the fact-checking into the main story, the one that most people will read, rather than turning it into a less-viewed sideshow.
From Brendan Nyhan, Dartmouth College:
I'm heartened by seeing less punch-pulling on stating that factual claims are wrong. There is no hedging when Jackie Calmes writes, "That is not true."
One concern about the fact-checking movement is that it could lead to ghettoization of verification in political journalism. I worry about that. The main piece was about style, horse race and conflict. Those stories are the ones that drive the conversation, get on the front page and that people read.
Here is Mr. Nyhan's overall take on the debate.
From Michael Cooper, a political reporter at The Times:
I hope readers found it useful to get some real-time evaluation of what the candidates were saying as the debate unfolded - checking some of their assertions, or simply providing context to illuminate complex issues without self-serving spin. It was especially great to be able to draw on the expertise of our beat reporters - Annie Lowrey on the economy, Robert Pear and Abby Goodnough on health care, Jackie Calmes on fiscal policy, John Broder on energy, to name just a few. Personally, I thought many of the most effective posts were the work of our Graphics department: the graphics showing how much the debt has grown, or how many jobs have been added back, told those stories more effectively than words.
The clock, of course, was the enemy. We added items to our debate dashboard in real time, all the while preparing for a print deadline that fell all-too-soon after the debate ended. Overnight we drilled down and took an expanded look at the candidates' differences on health care, which went up on the site on Thursday morning, and our producers made what I think just may be the most useful thing on our entire Web site: the interactive tool that allows people to watch the debate, read the transcript and see our analysis and checkpoint pieces scroll along in one place.
Now, with the luxury of more time, I hope we will be able to write in greater depth about a whole host of things that came up in the heat of the moment on Wednesday night that we need to explore in more detail.
From some Times readers, some who are experts in their own right, responding to my Twitter query:
: @Sulliview Accurate and explained clearly. But the language used e.g. "misleading statements" and "falsely stated," is lie too strong?
[#x200f]@pessimism: @Sulliview I really don't like the way "fact-checking" is used everywhere as something separate from what should be expected in journalism.
[#x200f]@capnjoy: @Sulliview great. Clear, with lots of context, and driven by facts, not need to appear perfectly balanced at any cost.
@stevekass: @Sulliview No one's "fact-checking" was any good. Mitt lied blatantly, Obama didn't. Moving business overseas, pre-existing conditions...
@froomkin: @sulliview Pretty good NYT fact-checking story on A20. But no skepticism of Romney's fantastical claims on A1 
So why do I give the effort four red pencils out of five? The Times was prepared, fast and as far as I can tell accurate in its fact-checking, both on the Web and in print. As noted by others above, though, it's disappointing that not even a whiff of the fact-checking is integrated into main article or front-page coverage.
And CNN forfeits all its red pencils for the night for one fact-checking blooper concerning a $5 trillion tax cut for high-income earners, as pointed out by Talking Point Memo's Josh Marshall.

HEADLINE: What to Look For in Friday's Jobs Report

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The September numbers due on Friday are likely to absorb heightened attention as the election draws near. 

 BODY:
The monthly jobs report usually gets a lot of attention, but the September numbers due on Friday are likely to absorb an outsize amount of oxygen because of the election just over a month away.
Here are some crucial details economists and analysts are likely to be looking for in the report.
One note of caution: The jobs report numbers are volatile and subject to major revisions months or even years afterward, so it's a good idea not to read too much into any one report, Friday's included. Last week, in fact, the Labor Department released preliminary revisions to the jobs numbers for the 12 months ended in March 2012 suggesting that the economy added 386,000 more jobs than originally believed.
 1. The number of jobs that employers added to their payrolls. 
Economists are predicting job growth of 113,000, far below the economy's long-term trend and too slow to absorb just those coming of age into the labor force.
The pace of job growth the last few months has been somewhat lackluster, with the economy adding an average of 87,000 jobs a month since April, after averaging 226,000 jobs in the first three months of this year.
It's not clear what accounts for the slowdown; some analysts have attributed it partly to the unusually warm weather last winter, which may have caused employers to hire earlier than usual and so kept them from needing to add workers in the spring.

In any case, if we continue to have the same pace of job growth that we've seen so far this year (an average of 139,000 jobs monthly over the course of 2012), it will take nearly three years before the economy regains the number of jobs it had before the recession began in December 2007. We have 3.4 percent fewer jobs today than we did then, even though the number of working-age people has increased.
If we want to close the jobs gap fully -- that is, add enough jobs to absorb new entrants to the labor force as well as the already unemployed -- it will take more than a decade at this pace.
 2. The unemployment rate.
This number refers to the unemployed as a share of Americans who want jobs and are actively looking for work. It excludes people who are out of the work force altogether and who are not applying for jobs.
It always gets a lot of attention, although economists play it down because it is based on a somewhat volatile survey. Economists are forecasting that the unemployment rate will again be 8.1 percent, reflecting the slow job growth.
 3. The number of people joining or leaving the labor force. 
This is based on the same noisy survey that the unemployment number comes from, and you can expect talk about it on Friday, particularly if the size of the labor force falls.
Usually in a recovery, many who were sitting on the sidelines decide to re-enter the labor force and start looking for work. In August, however, the share of Americans in the labor force fell, which is why the unemployment rate ticked down. (And that's a bad reason for the unemployment rate to fall; we want it to fall because people who wanted jobs found them, not because people who wanted jobs stopped looking for work.)
We don't know why the number of people in the labor force declined; it did not appear to be primarily because people gave up on looking for work. It's possible that more people than usual decided to enroll in school in August. A surprisingly large share of people who dropped out of the labor force in August did so after being employed, as opposed to unemployed.
 4. The broader unemployment rate. 
This number includes the people who are out of work and looking for a job (the traditional unemployed), as well as two other groups of "shadow unemployed": people who want to be working full time but can only find part-time work, and people who want to work but are no longer looking because they've been discouraged by their prospects. This group is sometimes referred to collectively as the "underemployed."
This number has bounced around a bit this year, ranging from 14.5 percent to 15.1 percent. It was 14.7 percent in August. If the number goes up, you can expect to hear a lot of commentary about how the economy is worse than everybody thinks.
 5. Government payrolls. 
While the private sector has been adding jobs for 30 consecutive months, the public sector has been hemorrhaging workers almost every month for roughly the same period. There are fewer government workers today than there were when President Obama took office, because of job losses at the state and local levels. In August, governments at all levels shed 7,000 jobs.
Government job losses are weighing on the economy, since laid off government workers have less money to spend at private sector businesses, causing those businesses to retrench as well.
If the so-called "fiscal cliff," which includes cutting $109 billion across the board from the federal budget, materializes at the end of this year, we can expect more government layoffs to follow. The Congressional Research Service recently a group of studies that estimated that the "sequestration" of federal funds would lead to the elimination of direct, indirect and "induced" jobs of 907,000 because of military spending cuts; 34,000 from cuts to the National Institutes of Health budget; 80,500 from cuts to education spending; and 500,000 from cuts to Medicare.

HEADLINE: Live From Paris, the Global Conversation

BYLINE: ALISON SMALE


HIGHLIGHT: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece spoke, and a lively discussion of the European economic crisis followed as the International Herald Tribune convened The Global Conversation to celebrate its 125th anniversary. 

 BODY:
 6:33 p.m. | Updated 
The Global Conversation, was convened by The International Herald Tribune to celebrate its 125th anniversary and broadcast live Thursday evening on Rendezvous. Here is a recording of the discussion moderated by Andrew Ross Sorkin. 
PARIS - On our 125th birthday, we are - as ever - mulling our present, mindful of our past, and peering into the future. Perhaps nowhere in the world right now is this as urgent a task as in Europe.
 The Continent is not just in an economic mess, but in considerable political flux. Grandiose visions sketched by European leaders are falling victim to old-fashioned or small-minded thinking. How does Europe get its mojo back? We are gathering here, in Paris, our birthplace in 1887, to consider this question with the prime minister of Greece, Antonis Samaras, who carries the weight of expectations not just of his own people as they grapple with more and more hardship, but of hundreds of millions of Europeans who fear for their economic future.
After Mr. Samaras speaks and I question him on his vision, we will welcome Carl Bildt, the foreign minister of Sweden, Viviane Reding, the European commissioner for justice and perhaps the Continent's foremost proponent of gender equality, and Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari, to mull European competitiveness. What do we do best? Will we still be doing those things in 10 or 20 years? 
Moderating this discussion will be Andrew Ross Sorkin, one of the sharpest writers on business and financial matters in the United States. Later, Andrew - the mastermind behind The New York Times' Dealbook coverage - will be offering us his insights on Wall Street, the United States economy and the possible outcomes of the all-important American elections in November.

HEADLINE: Money, Power and the Rule of Law

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: New York's attorney general is standing up to banking interests with his complaint against JPMorgan Chase, and whether he wins support from other government quarters will be telling, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
Economic policy is always torn between helping the broader social interest - lots of ordinary people - and favoring particular special interests. Unfortunately, special interests typically win out in the kind of situation we have in America in 2012, when it's all about spending money to win friends and influence people.
The most effective way to push back against powerful special interests is to have the same rules for everyone - and to enforce those rules fairly, even when they are broken by the richest and most politically connected people in the land. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of New York took a major step toward restoring the rule of law this week, by bringing a case against JPMorgan Chase. But it will be an uphill battle; the forces against him are incredibly strong, including some within the Obama administration.
Special interests always want to take over and organize society for their own benefit. In the terminology of economics, there are always some "rents" to be had - meaning some form of extra compensation that you get from tilting the playing field in your favor. Powerful people are always "rent-seeking," another way of saying that they would like to feather their own nests. And such activities impose costs on society, lowering incomes and limiting opportunities for everyone else.

When money is the primary source of power, the special interests win hands down. They can create advantages for themselves. One way is through the market mechanism - as monopolists did with railroads and industrial sectors at the end of the 19th century. 
Or they can capture the government and use state policies to help themselves - for example, by deregulating the financial sector and allowing excessive risk-taking in big banks. The ability to take such risks hurts all consumers and taxpayers while helping the special interests who get this advantage.
In a brilliant satire, Steven Pearlstein recently put his finger on a central problem: powerful people want one set of rules for themselves and different, less advantageous rules for everyone else. In modern America, Mr. Pearlstein points out, the rich and powerful also like to complain a lot.
Democracy can be a countervailing force. But if this is only about holding elections, and money buys votes, it is not much of a constraint on powerful people. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Senate was known as the "millionaires' club" for a reason - most of its members were rich or very close to rich people.
In his classic book "The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups," Mancur Olson articulated another central problem: it is hard to organize people around broader social interests, while special interests know exactly what they want and coalesce much more readily. 
In this situation, it is essential to have elected officials who seek to enforce the law in an even-handed fashion. This was what Theodore Roosevelt did with antitrust law at the beginning of the century. J.P. Morgan (the man) was shocked that the Sherman Antitrust Act could possibly be applied to him, and he brought a great deal of political pressure against it. 
Fortunately, Roosevelt was not prone to backing down, and we developed a broad and effective antimonopoly approach in the early decades of the 20th century.
In the case brought against JPMorgan Chase on Monday, Mr. Schneiderman's complaint is straightforward: Bear Stearns (acquired by JPMorgan Chase in early 2008) misrepresented securities that it sold to the public before 2008. 
"Bear Stearns led its investors to believe that the quality of the loans in its RMBS had been carefully evaluated and would be continuously monitored," the summary of the complaint issued by Mr. Schneiderman's office said, referring to residential mortgage-backed securities. "In reality, Bear Stearns did neither."
As with the cheating by Barclays on Libor, or the recent money-laundering cases against HSBC and Standard Chartered, management was at best negligent (for background on those cases, see my Economix posts from the summer). More likely, in the case of Bear Stearns, misleading investors was a deliberate decision by top people.
The broader social costs of these reckless actions by Bear Stearns and others were enormous. If you have not already seen the recent report by Better Markets on the real costs of the financial crisis, you should read it, or its summary, immediately - it puts put total losses of gross domestic product at $12.8 trillion. 
As Brian Kettenring of the Campaign for a Fair Settlement, Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets and others pointed out this week, this should be the first case of many to be brought by Mr. Schneiderman and presumably the relevant federal authorities. By all accounts, Bear Stearns behaved badly, and so did many other companies engaged in the business of issuing residential mortgages and turning them into securities that could be sold to investors.
The pushback against the New York attorney general is already intense, with bankers and their lobbyists mustering all possible political clout to prevent further cases and to force a small and inconsequential settlement when cases are brought.
The bankers assert that great damage will be done to the economy if they are held accountable. In fact, the greatest damage has already been done through their lack of accountability. 
Since early 2009, the Justice Department and other government agencies have repeatedly declined to enforce the law as it applies to large financial sector companies. Jeff Connaughton provides chapter and verse in his compelling recent book, "The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins," which I wrote about in August. People at the very top of the Obama administration deferred excessively to the very largest Wall Street banks.
Have we now turned a corner? Watch carefully what Mr. Schneiderman is able to accomplish and what kind of political support he draws.

HEADLINE: Carol Bartz on the Yahoo Board That Fired Her and Advice for Marissa Mayer

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech, Yahoo's former chief executive, Carol Bartz, spoke about her regrets about the board that fired her, gave advice for the company's new chief executive and celebrated being able to buy her own bling. 

 BODY:
If Carol Bartz, the former chief executive of Yahoo, could go back in time, she would have changed one thing about her relationship with the board that fired her by phone last year.
Ms. Bartz would have spent more time understanding the relationships between the board members, she said Tuesday at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
"I didn't understand or have the time or take the time - that's a much better thing to say, take the time - to understand the relationships they had between themselves," she said.
How could she have done that as chief executive? "Well, you go in the men's room," she said. In reality, she added, she should have arranged dinners with two board members at a time.
Ms. Bartz gave Yahoo's former board some credit - but also a little dig.
"Unfortunately for the board, they had gone through one year of the acquisition battle with Microsoft," she said. "And in fairness to them, they just wanted it to be simple, like no more press, no more anything. But the business is tougher than that."
Now Marissa Mayer has taken over as chief executive of Yahoo, with an entirely new board. Ms. Bartz said she and Ms. Mayer have spoken about the job.
Her advice for Ms. Mayer was to understand that change at such a big company is hard. Ms. Mayer is trying to change Yahoo's culture in ways big and small, like serving free food and acquiring more startups.
"One piece of advice I would give her is changing culture is not a sprint, it's a marathon," Ms. Bartz said. "It's very, very hard to affect culture. And you can get surprised thinking you're farther down the path of change than you really are because, frankly, most of us like the way things are."
Employees might nod when an executive suggests changes, she said, "then they go back to their cube and go, 'I ain't doing that.' And so I think that's important for all of us, is to realize how stuck individuals can be, much less 14,000 people."
Ms. Bartz did not rule out taking another chief executive role, saying she is an opportunist rather than a planner.
"I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin," she said. "I never thought I'd be where I am. I never thought I'd have bling," she said, flashing the rings on her fingers before adding, with perfect comic timing, "that I bought."
Ms. Bartz is the lead director of Cisco Systems, where she has been on the board for two decades, and she has also served on seven other public company boards during that time.
The difference between a good board and a bad one, she said, is not panicking, which she said the Cisco board achieves, and being genuinely interested in the company rather than prestige or money.
She said she has turned down board positions from banks because "I like banks because they keep my money safe, but I don't want to talk about banks 12 times a year."
Directors who are genuinely interested will take the time to get to know one another and the executives, but not be afraid to fire one another, she said.
"When trouble strikes, which it always does - bad economy, bad quarter, activists, takeover - when trouble strikes, those board members who don't understand or are not committed are not helpful," she said.

HEADLINE: Dodd-Frank Makes a Debate Cameo

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Romney calls Dodd-Frank "the biggest kiss" for "New York banks I've ever seen." | T-Mobile USA's deal for MetroPCS puts more pressure on Sprint Nextel. | Hewlett-Packard's weak stock price is increasing deal speculation. | Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point and the Tupac Shakur theory of investing. 

 BODY:
Dodd-Frank Makes a Debate Cameo | 
While Wednesday night's presidential debate covered a lot of wonky ground, DealBook was gripped when Mitt Romney began discussing the new Wall Street regulation. The Republican candidate called Dodd-Frank "the biggest kiss" for "New York banks I've ever seen," saying the law was hurting smaller lenders. (Big banks haven't exactly seen it that way.) 
Asked whether he would roll back the law, Mr. Romney said, "I would repeal it and replace it." Mr. Romney also said "one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank" was that it designated "five banks as too big to fail" and gave them a "blank check," a claim that may be a bit exaggerated. President Obama countered, "Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?"
The rivals also discussed tax policies, including ones that could encourage big corporations to repatriate some of their cash. But the issue is more complicated than the candidates made it seem. Victor Fleischer, DealBook's tax columnist, writes: "From a policy perspective, the problem is not so much that tax on foreign income is deferred, but rather that United States income is being masqueraded as foreign income."
And for those paying close attention Wednesday night, Mr. Romney gave a harsh assessment of Tesla, the electric car start-up that recently received some eased conditions on a government loan.
Sprint Left Hanging | 
T-Mobile USA's deal for MetroPCS puts more pressure on Sprint Nextel, DealBook writes. "MetroPCS represents a potentially big lost opportunity for Sprint," the No. 3 carrier, which tried and failed to buy MetroPCS earlier this year. According to The Wall Street Journal, Sprint was in preliminary talks with T-Mobile at the same time as T-Mobile was in negotiations with MetroPCS. One potential takeover target for Sprint, Leap Wireless International, looked like less of a viable partner on Wednesday, DealBook notes. Its shares fell nearly 18 percent.
One of MetroPCS's advisers in the deal was a law firm with an unusual name, writes DealBook's Peter Lattman. Telecommunications Law Professionals, a boutique firm in Washington, "wanted to go with something very descriptive with what we were doing," said Michael Lazarus, one of the founding partners. "In terms of marketing you know what you're getting right away." The banks advising on the deal stand to earn at least $50 million, according to an estimate from the research firm Freeman & Company.
Whither H.P.? | Meg Whitman showed no mercy for her company, Hewlett-Packard, when she told analysts on Wednesday to lower their expectations sharply. The stock tumbled 13 percent by the end of the day. While analysts praised the chief executive for her candor, the weak stock price is increasing deal speculation. The Bits blog writes: "The tech industry is facing a transition from traditional PCs and servers to mobile devices and cloud computing, and is consolidating. H.P. could become a target either for corporate raiders or for another tech company in a hostile takeover."
On the Agenda | The focus is on Europe on Thursday, as the Bank of England and European Central Bank announce their interest rate decisions. The head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is holding a press conference at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, where he might offer more details on the central bank's bond-buying program. In the United States, the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee releases minutes from its recent meeting at 2 p.m.
 Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard is appearing on CNBC at 9:05 a.m. The chief executive of AOL, Tim Armstrong, is on Bloomberg TV at 9:45. William Harrison, JPMorgan Chase's former leader, is on Bloomberg TV at 10. And Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, is on CNBC at 4:10.
Keepin' It Real at Third Point | 
Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point may be the only hedge fund manager to employ the Tupac Shakur theory of investing. In his quarterly letter, he quoted the deceased rapper: "I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents." In this case, he was referring to his European debt holdings, which gained 35 percent over the last six months.
Is The Financial Times in Play? | The chief executive of Pearson, the education and media company that owns The Financial Times, is stepping down after nearly 16 years, raising questions about the future of the newspaper. "Analysts have speculated that Pearson would sell the FT Group, which includes the rose-colored business daily and its various digital assets. Potential buyers include Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, both of which employ hundreds of financial journalists but do not own a daily newspaper," The New York Times reports.
After Bear Stearns, a Ferris Wheel | Richard Marin, who gained notoriety for blogging about movies during a particularly tense weekend for Bear Stearns hedge funds, is now behind the effort to build the world's biggest Ferris wheel on Staten Island, The New York Observer reports.

HEADLINE: In Debate on Domestic Policy, No Talk of Cities

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: No question, many topics in the first presidential debate affect urbanites the same as everyone else. But issues at the heart of life in New York and other big cities were unmentioned. 

 BODY:
For all the thousands of words that poured out of President Obama and Mitt Romney in their debate Wednesday night, neither man could find room for a word that applies to more Americans than just about any other: cities.
Nearly all Americans live in cities and their suburbs. But even though this first presidential debate of 2012 focused on domestic policy, the two candidates couldn't devote so much as a sentence to any thoughts they might have had on mass transit or crime or crumbling infrastructure or homelessness or other matters that enormously affect cities, including, of course, New York.
While we're at it, another word that never arose is "guns." Thanks go to Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, for pointing this out.
The omission of guns might be shrugged off were it not for the fact that the debate took place in Denver, minutes by car from two of the worst massacres in modern American history - the shootings at Columbine High School in 1999 and at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., less than three months ago. To be in that corner of the country and make no mention of gun violence was somewhat like traveling to northern Japan and saying nothing about its nuclear crisis. 
Some of the blame rested with Jim Lehrer, the debate moderator, who asked no urban-specific questions (and who showed no sign of being in control as the candidates rattled on well past their allotted time). Two themes that Mr. Lehrer set forth at the start of the evening were the economy and the role of government. Both of them directly affect the life and, often enough, the death of cities. But Mr. Lehrer made no such connection. Nor did either candidate do so on his own.
"Cities and metropolitan areas are the engines of the economy," said Bruce Katz, founding director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. "For all intents and purposes, they are the American economy." By Mr. Katz's reckoning, 84 percent of Americans live in cities and surrounding areas, and account for 91 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
No question, many of the debate's topics affect urbanites the same as everyone else, like health care, taxes, education and energy. But issues at the heart of everyday life in New York and other big cities were left outside the door.
As usual, it may be added.
Both Mr. Katz and Professor Moss said that the relationship between the federal government and America's cities is changing profoundly, and will probably continue to do so no matter which man wins in November. Professor Moss singled out the Community Development Block Grant program, which is "a key way that federal money is given out to cities, for whatever they want to do." It is "going to be cut severely," he said.
Similarly, Mr. Katz said that Washington was already "scaling back," mass transit being an example. "I think this is the wave of the future," he said. "The federal government will still be an investor in transportation infrastructure, but a broader portion of the investment is going to come locally, and will come from the private sector."
Politics is always a consideration. Big cities typically vote Democratic, so national Republicans regard campaigning there as a waste of time, and Democrats feel they can take them for granted.
In New York City, where Mr. Obama won about 75 percent of the vote in 2008, you'd be hard-pressed to think of the last time someone running for president from a major party bothered to truly campaign among us. Not just go to a hotel ballroom to squeeze donors for money, or call on a celebrity loudmouth, or drop by a television studio to appear on "The View," but hit the streets and shake hands with real people. The last occasion that Professor Moss could recall was a rally in Washington Square Park that Jerry Brown, now California's governor once again, held during the 1992 Democratic primary. 
"The reason they don't care about cities is that the independent voters they're seeking are in the suburbs," Professor Moss said.
This is, and will remain, "a metro nation," Mr. Katz said. National politicians are "about 25 years out of whack" with demographic and economic changes under way both here and abroad, he said, adding: "So the conversation in Washington seems to be happening in almost a parallel universe to the conversation at the local level, where the rubber hits the road, where you really have to grapple with issues. You can't duck them."
But the presidential candidates and their ineffectual debate moderator just did.

HEADLINE: Fact-Checking Obama's 'Kiss' to Wall Street

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, was designed to be a slap in the face to Wall Street. But Mitt Romney, during the first debate of the presidential campaign, claims it was "the biggest kiss that's been given to New York banks I've ever seen." 

 BODY:
Did Mitt Romney catch President Obama smooching with Wall Street?
The Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, the Obama administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis, was designed to be a slap in the face to Wall Street after big banks nearly toppled the economy. But Mr. Romney, attacking the president on Wednesday night in their first debate of the campaign season, claimed Dodd-Frank was "the biggest kiss that's been given to New York banks I've ever seen."
That argument might seem strange to Wall Street. If Mr. Obama is cozying up to Lloyd C. Blankfein and Jamie Dimon, that is news to them. Most big bank executives find Mr. Obama disengaged, even aloof. And some never forgave the president for his unflattering depiction of them as "fat cats." 
 As for Dodd-Frank, Wall Street has spent three years - and hundreds of millions of dollars - trying to kill or tame the law. Mr. Dimon, a Democrat who runs JPMorgan Chase, once said new rules stemming from Dodd-Frank "would damage America." (He supports other aspects of the law). 
Mr. Romney on Wednesday said he supported some regulation but also called for the repeal of Dodd-Frank. When pressed to explain what would replace the law, the Republican nominee declined to provide specifics. 
Despite being one of Mr. Obama's signature accomplishments, Dodd-Frank has played a back seat to health care and broader economic issues on the campaign trail. But the debate on Wednesday brought Dodd-Frank to the forefront.
For his part, Mr. Obama defended the law and attacked an era of deregulation that he said enabled Wall Street recklessness. "Does anyone out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?" Mr. Obama said. 
Mr. Romney countered with a common criticism of Dodd-Frank, that it labels some financial institutions as "systemically important." Mr. Romney called this policy "an enormous boon" for Wall Street because "it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government."
It was this rule that Mr. Romney seemed to interpret as a big kiss to the banks. "I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check."
Mr. Romney's claims echoed the concerns of Republican lawmakers, who say that Dodd-Frank enshrines several banks as so important that the government would need to rescue them in times of trouble. Dodd-Frank, critics say, did little to break up the nation's biggest banks but left small community banks without implicit government backing and fighting for survival. 
But that is not the full story. 
For one, Democrats note that the "systemically important" brand is actually meant to strike down the perception that some banks are too big to fail. As Mr. Obama said on Wednesday, these firms must produce so-called living wills and face other measures that empower regulators to wind down big banks in an orderly fashion. 
Mr. Romney's decision to single out five New York banks is also suspect. The designation applies not only to Wall Street banks but to dozens of insurance companies, conglomerates and other major banks scattered across the country. Politico's Morning Money newsletter on Thursday quoted an anonymous executive as saying, "If he'd named names, it would have been his top five contributors."
Dodd-Frank supporters also argue that the designation of SIFI - systemically important financial institutions - is hardly a wet kiss. It comes with heightened capital requirements and regulatory scrutiny. 
Of course, it is not like Wall Street has never been kissed before. The Clinton administration, at the behest of big banks, tossed out Depression era measures like the Glass Steagall Act, which prevented banks from buying insurance companies. And when the banks grew so bloated that they nearly burst in 2008, Congress came to their rescue with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars. 
But is Dodd-Frank the giveaway that Mr. Romney claims? If so, the Obama administration is kissing but not telling.

HEADLINE: On Health Care, Two Visions With Their Own Set of Facts

BYLINE: MICHAEL COOPER, ABBY GOODNOUGH and ROBERT PEAR


HIGHLIGHT: On health care, Mitt Romney and President Obama sometimes seemed to inhabit parallel universes at their debate on Wednesday night - with separate sets of assumptions, beliefs and even facts - it was on the question of health care, and government's role in providing it. 

 BODY:
If there was one area where Mitt Romney and President Obama sometimes seemed to inhabit parallel universes at their debate on Wednesday night - with separate sets of assumptions, beliefs and even facts - it was on the question of health care and government's role in providing it.
Mr. Romney sharply criticized Mr. Obama's health care law, falsely suggesting that it would allow the federal government to "take over health care." He painted a vision of a reshaped Medicare system in which the elderly would get fixed amounts of money to buy private or public plans, fostering competition. And he called for capping federal Medicaid spending and sending it to the states to decide how to spend it.
Mr. Obama noted the similarities between his health care law and the one Mr. Romney signed as governor of Massachusetts, saying: "It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance." 
He warned that under Mr. Romney's Medicare plan, private insurers would pick the healthiest seniors, endangering the public health plan by leaving it with the sickest, most-expensive-to-cover patients. And he described Mr. Romney's Medicaid cuts as "a big problem" for "a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid."
Two of their sharpest divisions came over how to insure people who are already sick, and what Medicaid should look like. 
Mr. Obama said that if Mr. Romney repeals his health care law, insurers would no longer be required to provide coverage to people with pre-existing medical problems. Mr. Romney countered that "pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan." 
Mr. Romney made a similar claim in an appearance last month on NBC's "Meet the Press." At the time, he said, "I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform. Of course, there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage."

But Mr. Romney's aides later clarified that he would only explicitly guarantee insurance for people with pre-existing conditions if they have maintained coverage with no significant lapses. That could exclude millions of Americans with conditions like cancer, heart disease and asthma.
Breaks in coverage are common. A recentreportby the Commonwealth Fund found that 89 million Americans went without health insurance for at least one month in the period from 2004 to 2007, perhaps because they had lost jobs, been divorced or lost eligibility for a public insurance program. 
For people who have not been continuously insured, Mr. Romney says many of them could get coverage through health plans known as high-risk pools. Many states have such pools, which generally operate at a loss. And the federal government is running a high-risk pool, as a temporary measure under the new health care law, in more than 20 states.
But Mr. Romney has not provided details, like whether or how he would regulate premiums or subsidize the high cost of coverage in a high-risk pool. 
A 1996 federal law already limits the ability of health plans to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions. But under that law, consumers may lose some of their rights if, for example, they do not buy an individual insurance policy within 63 days of losing group coverage. Mr. Obama said during the debate that Mr. Romney's plan only duplicates what is "already the law, and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with pre-existing conditions."
The two men also differed over their vision for Medicaid, the jointly administered state-federal program that provides health care to nearly 60 million low-income individuals, including children and families, people with disabilities and seniors who need long-term care. 
The federal government currently provides matching money to states based on how much they spend, so states with more generous benefits qualify for more federal dollars. Mr. Romney wants to cap the growth of Medicaid spending and let states decide how to spend it.
"I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year plus inflation plus 1 percent," he said at the debate. "And then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best." 
In a last November, Mr. Romney estimated that such a cap would save the federal government $100 billion a year.
Mr. Obama criticized the proposal at the debate, saying "Governor Romney talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities."
He was relying on a conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The study examined a 2011 proposal by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate, to transform Medicaid in essentially the same way Mr. Romney has called for.
Mr. Ryan's plan called for cutting federal spending on Medicaid by $810 billion over 10 years by turning Medicaid into a block-grant program. According to the Urban Institute study, federal spending on Medicaid under the Ryan plan would be 33.9 percent less over 10 years than it is projected to be under Mr. Obama's health care law, which would enroll millions of additional people in Medicaid. 
Under a block-grant program like the one Mr. Romney has proposed, each state would get a fixed payment and more leeway to decide eligibility and benefits. (Currently, the federal government sets minimum requirements, like covering all children under the poverty level, which some states surpass. It also provides unlimited matching funds.)
Mr. Romney says, correctly, that the program's soaring costs are swallowing an ever-larger chunk of state budgets. States have generally not been allowed to cut Medicaid eligibility since the passage of Mr. Obama's health care law in 2010, but many have slashed optional benefits and payments to doctors and hospitals instead. Mr. Obama wants to vastly expand the program, with the federal government paying almost all of the costs for the millions who would become eligible through the expansion. During the debate, Mr. Romney stressed that his proposal would free up states to make their own decisions.
"One of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy," he said. "Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this."
But critics of the block grant plan say it would shrink the medical safety net for the poorest Americans. The Urban Institute study estimated that under Mr. Ryan's proposal millions of people could lose Medicaid coverage by 2021. 
And the two men sparred repeatedly over Medicare. Mr. Romney, who has declined to give specifics about how much money he would propose giving future beneficiaries to buy coverage, denied that his plan would raise their out-of-pocket costs, saying it would foster competition. But Mr. Obama noted that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance, and that private insurers strive to make a profit. 
"If you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere," he said. 
Mr. Romney took pains to note that his plan would not take effect for a decade. "If you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further," he said at one point.
Mr. Obama looked at the other side of that equation. "If you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen," he said, "because this - this will affect you."

HEADLINE: No, the Debate Was Not Substantial

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: Substance means grappling with the truth, not merely sounding wonky by repeating the words Dodd and Frank. 

 BODY:
Trying to salvage something useful from last night's dreary debate, a few commentators have claimed that it was at least substantive, that it dealt with the real issues the country faces. But substance means grappling with the truth and its many interpretations, not merely sounding wonky by repeating the words Dodd and Frank. Truthful arguments were missing on the Denver stage.
You could have a substantive argument on whether tax cuts for the rich stimulate the economy and benefit the middle class and the poor. But Mitt Romney didn't want that argument; instead he simply walked past the facts and denied that he was even proposing a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not substance; it's thin air.

You could have a substantive argument on whether the government should play a role in providing health insurance to the uninsured, requiring coverage of pre-existing conditions. If Mr. Romney really feels so strongly that "Obamacare is a mistake," as he said, he could explain why that's not government's role and why the chronically ill should rely on the private market. Instead he said he has a plan to cover pre-existing conditions. There is no such plan, and thus no real substance.
A debate isn't serious simply because it ostensibly deals with complicated subjects. A real discussion of education policy, for example, would grapple with whether Mr. Obama's investment in Race to the Top is working, and whether those dollars should be cut. It does not consist of a line like this from Mr. Romney, one of his most egregious in the debate:
"I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there."
This was a head-slapping moment from the man who told donors in Florida that he would do exactly that, either merging the Education Department into another agency "or perhaps make it a heck of a lot smaller." When he was trying to persuade Republicans to make him their nominee, he loudly endorsed the Paul Ryan budgets in the House that would have forced drastic cuts to education spending, including dropping 200,000 children from Head Start. And he has made it clear he would reduce the number of students eligible for Pell grants for college.
A substantive debate would also have required Mr. Obama to interrupt a lie like this one and ridicule it with the facts. But time after time, the president passed up opportunities to do exactly that, leaving uninformed viewers with the impression that Mr. Romney was crisper and had more "facts" at his fingertips.
The president's failure to engage was, in miniature, the same one that has allowed Republicans to misrepresent the stimulus, and health care reform, and the sequester, and get away with it. For four years, Mr. Obama has been an ineffective salesman of his own hard work and vision, and he was an even worse salesman last night, when it counted. He seems to view the work of making a sale as beneath him - an advertiser's grubby task - but that is the essence of politics, and Republicans are quite good at it.
It's time the president joined the game, and not just to win re-election. If he does return to the White House, he will need all of his persuasive powers to make his second term more successful than his first. For the moment, he seems to have misplaced them.

HEADLINE: $90 Billion for Green Energy? A Closer Look

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Parsing the accuracy of Mitt Romney's remarks about $90 billion in green energy spending by the Obama administration. 

 BODY:
Three times in Wednesday night's debate, Mitt Romney said that President Obama had plowed $90 billion of federal money into green energy. "Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives,'' he said. "Ninety billion -- that -- that would have -- that would have hired two million teachers,'' he said.
Is $90 billion accurate?
 As we reported in August when Mr. Romney first raised the figure, sort of. It The $90 billion is a real number drawn from the 2009 stimulus package, but it wasn't all spent, as Mr. Romney said, and a lot of the green energy spending that went out the door on Mr. Obama's watch was authorized during the Bush administration. 
The biggest component of the $90 billion was $29 billion for energy efficiency, of which $5 billion involved improvements in the homes and apartments of low-income households. There was also $18 billion for fast trains and $21 billion for wind farms, solar panels and other renewable energy. Supporters point out that much of the energy spending drew in private capital. 
Mr. Romney also said, "I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in, they've gone out of business." One, Solyndra, a maker of solar equipment, went under and took the government's $528 million with it. (The Solyndra grant process began during the Bush administration, however, as my colleague John Mr. Broder noted.) Others went bankrupt, but the government recovered some of the stimulus money. The defaults were far less than Congress had allocated to cover losses, and far, far less than half of the ventures, although some others may yet fail.

 As Mr. Broder also pointed out, Mr. Romney asserted that all the increase in oil and gas production during Mr. Obama's term occurred on private lands,
Environmentalists and others were quick to point out that the debate was also noteworthy for what was not said; there was no mention of global warming or climate change in general.

HEADLINE: Romney's Tone May Not Sit Well With Conservatives

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Many conservatives, who have long viewed Mitt Romney's ideological commitment with some skepticism, might have been less than thrilled with his tone. 

 BODY:
To viewers of the first presidential debate who knew Mitt Romney only from the Republican primary season or Democratic advertising, the man on the stage on Wednesday night must have sounded surprisingly moderate.
Tax cuts under a President Romney? On the whole, really wouldn't be any. Government regulation? Good for business. President Obama's education policies? Lots to like there. Mr. Obama's health care plan? Would keep some of its key provisions.
Republicans are reveling in the instant analysis that Mr. Romney outscored Mr. Obama on Wednesday night, largely on style points for aggressiveness.
Yet many conservatives, who have long viewed Mr. Romney's ideological commitment with some skepticism, might have been less than thrilled with his tone. Mr. Romney, in front of a national television audience, took the opportunity to present himself as a reasonable pragmatist who was willing to work across the aisle as governor of Massachusetts - risking criticism that this was another "Etch-A-Sketch" moment for him, potentially reviving accusations that he is a flip-flopper.

Mr. Romney's responses repeatedly were a reminder of the difference between the tenor of Republican primary debates, where last winter he and his rivals vied to serve up red meat to the party's conservative base, and these general-election debates, where the two finalists compete for the few undecided voters in the electorate's center even as they try to keep their more ideological supporters energized. 
The change in Mr. Romney was evident from his opening statement, in which he eschewed get-goverment-out-of-the-way rhetoric to argue for Washington's essential role in society. He told of an unemployed woman in Dayton, Ohio, who recently grabbed him and a woman in Denver, baby in her arms, who similarly pleaded to his wife, Ann, about her husband's joblessness, both women asking, Can you help?
"And the answer is yes," Mr. Romney said. "We can help." 
Questions from the moderator, Jim Lehrer, about whether there is too much government regulation seemed the softest of softballs to a conservative. Yet Mr. Romney's answer was not exactly out of the Tea Party playbook. 
"Regulation is essential," he said emphatically. "You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have - I needed to know - the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn't have people opening banks in their garage and making loans. I mean you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation."
Only then did Mr. Romney add, "At the same time, regulation can become excessive" - not "is" excessive, as conservatives might prefer.
Even when Mr. Lehrer, seemingly intrigued, followed up by asking, "Is it excessive now, do you think?" Mr. Romney vacillated: "In some places, yes; in other places, no."
Mr. Romney's example was the Dodd-Frank law tightening regulation of financial institutions. On the campaign trail, he routinely promises conservative audiences that he will repeal it, period.
But on the Denver stage, he said, "I would repeal it and replace it," adding, "We're not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulations. And there's some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world." Indeed, his main complaint was that it did not regulate big banks enough to guard against the need for government bailouts again. Mr. Romney, sounding like a populist, called the law "the biggest kiss" to New York banks that he had ever seen.
Mr. Romney's remarks even roused Mr. Obama to quip, "It appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation."
On the defensive early on about the size of his proposed tax cuts at a time of big budget deficits, Mr. Romney hardly offered a fulsome justification for his central economic policy. Three times he emphasized that while he wanted to lower tax rates, he would offset the lost revenue by ending or cutting back unspecified tax breaks elsewhere - yielding no net reduction in taxes.
 "I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut."
"I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut."
"Let me repeat, let me repeat what I said: I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut."
His point was that he was not adding the sum to the annual deficits over a decade, that he could find a way around the political and policy difficulties of ending well-entrenched tax breaks to offset the lost revenue. But the specifics sometimes seemed lost to the thematic disavowals.
Here, too, Mr. Obama got in a jab: "Now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is 'never mind.'"
Much like George W. Bush in 2000, Mr. Romney seized on the issue of education to signal - especially to women, who lopsidedly support Mr. Obama - that he supports a muscular role for the federal government. In Republican primary debates, the popular answer, and one Mr. Romney has floated in the past, is to call for abolishing the Department of Education.
Mr. Romney did say the primary role in education should be at the state and local level.
"But the federal government also can play a very important role," he said, adding, "The federal government can get local and state schools to do a better job."
As for federal spending, "I'm not going to cut education funding," Mr. Romney said. "I'm planning on continuing to grow."

HEADLINE: About That '$90 Billion' Green Energy Tax Break

BYLINE: ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's energy policy whoppers. 

 BODY:
Various truth squads have identified at least two dozen factual misstatements by Mitt Romney in 38 minutes of debate time on Wednesday night. Several involved energy policy, and two of these were particularly outrageous.
First, Mr. Romney asserted that President Obama had "provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world." This was a piece of masterful spin, though not an outright falsehood. As part of the $800 billion 2009 stimulus package, the administration provided about $90 billion in green energy programs that went well beyond tax breaks for the wind and solar ventures that Mr. Romney finds so objectionable - a broad array of grants, loans and demonstration projects aimed at everything from updating the energy grid to improving mass transit to encouraging cleaner cars to weatherizing older buildings to constructing power plants capable of capturing and storing greenhouse gases.

The second and more objectionable whopper was Mr. Romney's assertion that "half" of the companies funded by the green energy portion of the stimulus have gone out of business. His campaign later said he meant to refer only to the Energy Department's $40 billion loan guarantee program, but even here he was not even within hailing distance of the truth. The program has produced one notable casualty which Republicans cannot stop harping on -- a solar panel company called Solyndra, whose bankruptcy cost taxpayers $535 million, as well as two smaller companies. But the bottom line, so far, is that only three of the 33 companies that received loans have failed, representing less than 2 percent of money budgeted.
The jury is still out on some of the green energy programs underwritten by the stimulus bill --mass transit projects, for instance, and the home weatherization program. But as Daniel J. Weiss of the Center for American Progress observed Thursday, the wind and solar energy industries have grown rapidly, while costs have fallen, due in no small part to the stimulus. Mr. Obama has a good story to tell, and perhaps in the next debate he will do so - instead of allowing Mr. Romney to roll him with misinformation.
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this post contained an inaccurate transcription of a quote from Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: With Banks Skittish, Europe's Private Equity Firms Look Elsewhere

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: As banks have curbed their lending in response to the European sovereign debt crisis, private equity firms have had to get creative to finance buyouts. 

 BODY:
LONDON - As the sovereign debt crisis has slammed Europe, Cinven has had to get creative to finance buyouts.
When the London-based private equity firm wanted to buy CPA Global this year for $1.5 billion, Cinven looked beyond banks, the usual source of money. Along with debt from HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, it secured almost $200 million of higher-interest loans from nontraditional lenders. It also had to spend roughly $600 million of its own cash.
"The debt markets have been challenging since 2007," said Matthew Sabben-Clare, a partner at Cinven. "There's a degree of selectivity by the banks over geographies and certain industries. Banks are more regionally focused than before."
 Europe's financial woes are forcing private equity firms like Cinven to revise their deal-making playbooks.
As banks pull back, private equity firms are increasingly turning to high-yield bonds, mezzanine loans and other types of debt that carry higher interest rates. Some are appealing directly to institutional investors like pensions and sovereign wealth funds to finance specific deals.
Given the tight credit, most firms are having to put up more capital to get deals done. Cash now accounts for more than 50 percent of the average European buyout, according to the data provider S.&.P. Capital I.Q. Five years ago, that number was 33 percent. In the United States, cash represents 38 percent of the average buyout, mainly because firms have access to a variety of financing options, like capital markets.
Private equity firms "are having to widen the net to find the loan financing they need," said Kristian Orssten, head of European high-yield and loan capital markets at JPMorgan Chase in London. "Many lenders in Europe are getting to grips with their own funding challenges."
The financing troubles for buyouts are reflected in the weak deal-making environment.
Although firms are raising money to buy distressed assets in Europe, many have remained on the sidelines as the debt crisis continues. So far this year, European acquisitions by private equity firms have totaled $23.2 billion, a 38 percent decline from the same period in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.
Firms have pulled some deals altogether, fearing that asset prices could fall even further. After months of negotiations, Blackstone and BC Partners dropped their $3.2 billion bid for the frozen-food company Iglo after failing to come to terms with its private equity owner, Permira, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to speak publicly.
In good times, European buyout firms relied heavily on cheap bank lending. Flush with cash, the Continent's financial institutions provided almost 80 percent of financing on deals, often keeping the debt on their own balance sheets instead of selling it off to other investors.
But as the debt crisis worsened, banks curbed their lending in an effort to meet stricter capital requirements, which penalize firms for holding risky investments like debt connected to private equity deals. Firms like Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland have sold loans at a discount to other investors to shed unwanted assets.
Even when banks are willing to finance deals, they are limiting their bets. Local banks are focusing mostly on deals in their home countries, and they are often willing to finance only a portion of the buyouts.
As a result, private equity firms are often tapping multiple lenders, even when the costs of a buyout are less than $1 billion. To finance its £465 million ($749 million) acquisition of the British company Mercury Pharma, Cinven capitalized on its 20-year relationships with certain banks, securing £235 million of financing from a consortium of firms, including Lloyds Banking Group.
With banks being selective, private equity firms have had to tap other markets.
High-yield debt investors, in search of better yields, have been receptive. The European private equity firm Apax issued almost $1 billion of high-yield bonds in February as part of its $2.1 billion acquisition of the telecommunications company Orange Switzerland. Intelsat, one of the world's largest satellite operators, owned by a BC Partners-led group, raised $1.2 billion this year in an effort to refinance its debt.
"The high-yield market in Europe is exploding," said a partner from a leading European private equity firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's attracting a lot of institutional investors who are chasing high returns." The amount of European high-yield bonds connected to investments from private equity firms has risen 49 percent, to $13.5 billion, since 2007, according to the data provider Dealogic.
Private equity firms are also stepping in to fill the void. The Scandinavian firm EQT Partners turned to a consortium of financial players, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for around $510 million of mezzanine financing for its $2.3 billion acquisition of the German medical supplies company BSN Medical in June.
"As bank funding has become more expensive, it has opened up an opportunity for new types of financing," said Sachin Date, head of private equity for Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa at the accounting firm Ernst & Young in London.
But such debt carries its own set of risks. Generally, loans from nontraditional lenders carry higher interest rates, which can be costly for companies, especially in the current economic conditions. If the financial burden became too high, it could force borrowers to default on their loans and exacerbate the region's woes.
"The crisis has hit much harder than people had expected," said Nicolas de Nazelle, a managing partner at the private equity adviser Triago in Paris.

HEADLINE: Idiot's Delight

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: At this point in the campaign, how can the undecideds expect to have anyone's support? 

 BODY:
You're an undecided voter. Your time is up. The rest of us are sick of pretending to care about you, saying nice things to you, doing your damn laundry.
Decide, O.K.? When the choice was between Scrooge McDuck and the Kenyan Socialist, you couldn't make up your mind. Now that you know it's between two Harvard know-it-alls, with clear, divergent views of government, you're waiting for - what? The long-lost Mormon tablets to reappear? Donald Trump to reveal what his phantom investigators found among the birth records in Hawaii?
No, of course not. To your credit, you don't take your talking points from the toxic menu of far-right radio nor from the conspiracy theorists of the paranoid left. But that's the only nice thing I'm going to say about you.
You're not Solomon, carefully weighing the choices. You're a ditherer. You probably panic at "paper or plastic" in the supermarket, backing up the checkout line. We know all about you, because the campaigns have spent millions studying you, probing you, stuffing you with those little sausage things. Your every emotion is wired and registered.
And here's what we know: there aren't that many of you, not compared with past years. In 2008, 1 in 7 voters was persuadable at one time. This year it is closer to 1 in 20 - about 5 percent. And in your hands, the savants of politics say, rests the future of the republic.

But here's the thing: while we're paying so much attention to you, you're not paying that much attention to known facts about the two men who want to lead the United States. You barely keep up on the news. If you'd been paying attention, of course, you wouldn't be undecided.
You, most likely, were not among the millions of Americans who watched the first presidential debate. Of all voters, the undecided were the least interested in the debates, a Washington Post poll found last week.
So, here's what you missed, or may have heard something about today: Mitt Romney wants to fire Big Bird. He's got a plan, mostly secret, to restore America to fiscal sanity. But first, he wants to cut taxes by 20 percent. Ultimately, that will cost $5 trillion. At the same time, he wants to add things to the defense budget. And none of this will add a penny to the debt.
A third grader could tell you that his numbers don't add up. Go ahead, ask a third grader. Romney knows it doesn't add up, so he's not specific. Oh, except for Big Bird - no more subsidies for PBS, you monotoned moochers. That's 0.00014 percent of the budget. 
I forgot: you hate policy-wonk stuff, so those numbers are not likely to move you. Then listen to your heart - the one that may stop beating earlier than you think, if you have a pre-existing condition. Romney vows to throw out Obamacare, which will cover that condition. But he says his plan would cover it as well. That's true, but only if you live in a state, like Massachusetts, that already has Obamacare. Otherwise, in all truth, you're toast. He said so earlier this month, when he explained that the millions of Americans who would lose health care once he kills it can always go the hospital emergency room.
Maybe you just want an overarching philosophy. Romney's slogan is "Believe in America" (as opposed to, say, Lichtenstein). He summarized his view Wednesday night: "I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again." You would think he has some fiscal Viagra in mind, but again - no specifics. 
On to Obama. He saved the auto industry; the recovery in Michigan and Ohio was not an accident. You didn't like the stimulus because, like, where's my bailout, dude? But the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, not 8, without the stimulus. Whatever. You don't know about any of this because Obama never brought it home on Wednesday, and therefore it will not be part of the distant chatter that will find its way into your orbit over the next few days.
Obama's opponent thinks that nearly half of all Americans - many among you - are deadbeats and victims. Obama didn't bring this up, either, and Romney certainly wasn't going to.
For philosophy, Obama gave you this: "Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess, or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best."
There you have it - a clear choice, as everyone keeps telling you. But still, you're not sure. You say you don't like either of them. Romney's too snooty and just plain weird. Obama's too professorial and goes on, and on, and on. You say they're corrupt, all politicians. You say there's no difference between the parties. You're wrong, but we're not supposed to tell you that.
The headline of an Associated Press story on you was typical: "Many Watch Debate; Some Are Pleased, Few Are Moved." After the debate, a CNN focus group of your type found that eight of you were now leaning toward Romney, and eight of you were coming over to the Obama side. No real movement, in other words. 
 I'm going to let you in on a little secret, after many years of sitting with you during past presidential debates: we don't like you. Not because you can't make up your mind, but because you won't.

HEADLINE: Biden Gives Rebuttal to Romney's Debate Remarks

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: In Iowa, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered the kind of impassioned response to Mitt Romney that many Democrats said they wished they had heard from President Obama. 

 BODY:
COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- Criticizing Mitt Romney in the first presidential debate, his voice now indignant, now deeply sarcastic, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered the kind of impassioned response to the Republican nominee on Thursday that many Democrats said they wished they had heard from President Obama.
Mr. Biden addressed some 600 supporters here after speaking briefly to reporters, who asked for his impressions of Mr. Romney's performance. 
"Last night we found out he doesn't have a $5 trillion tax cut,'' Mr. Biden said. "I guess he outsourced that to China or something.''
He defended Mr. Obama's low affect and refusal to engage Mr. Romney more aggressively. "I think the president did well; he was presidential,'' he said. "As time goes on, meaning days, it's going to become pretty clear that Governor Romney has either changed a number of his positions or didn't remember some of his positions. I think at the end of the day we have two more debates coming up, or the president does, and I feel very good about it.''
Anticipating his own debate with Representative Paul D. Ryan one week away on Oct. 11, Mr. Biden said he had been studying Mr. Ryan's positions to avoid making any factual errors describing them. "All debates are tough. But I'm looking forward to it, I really am,'' he said.
At his rally, Mr. Biden delivered scorching responses to positions Mr. Romney espoused on Wednesday night on Medicare, deficit reduction and education. He accused Mr. Romney, often sarcastically, of backing away from earlier positions. He said he was "stunned" to hear Mr. Romney say he planned no cuts to education. 
"Yo!'' Mr. Biden said, pretending to address Mr. Romney. "That came as a real surprise to your Republican colleagues in the House, man.'' 
(The House-passed budget written by Mr. Ryan calls for deep cuts to social programs without specifying amounts. The White House has calculated that if the cuts are applied equally across all programs, they will chop about 20 percent from each one.)
At another point, Mr. Biden dropped his voice to a deep baritone meant to mock Mr. Romney, saying, "I don't have a plan to cut $5 trillion.'' 
He laid out the Democrats' version of how the various tax cuts Mr. Romney proposes - including a 20 percent reduction in income taxes, eliminating inheritance taxes and extending all the Bush-era tax cuts - add up to $5 trillion over a decade. 
He contrasted the Republicans' economic plans with what he called the administration's "balanced" proposal to include spending cuts with higher taxes on the wealthy by allowing the Bush-era cuts on the top income bracket expire. 
"We're gonna ask - yes - we're gonna ask the wealthy to pay more,'' he said. "My heart breaks.''
"You know the phrase they always use?'' he added, again lowering his voice, this time in imitation of a scary-sounding television attack ad. "Obama and Biden want to raise taxes by $1 trillion.'' 
"Guess what,'' he said. "Yes, we do, in one regard. We want to let that trillion-dollar tax cut expire so the middle class doesn't have to bear the burden of all that money going to the superwealthy. That's not a tax raise. That's called fairness where I come from.''
The Romney-Ryan campaign jumped on the remark, highlighting the "yes, we do" phrase to accuse the president of baldly embracing tax hikes. An image of a yes-we-do T-shirt was circulated by a campaign spokesman, and Mr. Ryan planned to highlight the remark at a joint rally with Mr. Romney in Virginia late Thursday.
But the administration's proposal to increase revenues by some $1 trillion is fairly old news. The White House and Congressional Democrats have made no secret that is the estimated figure to be raised by allowing the Bush-era tax cuts for the highest earners to expire next year, which has been part of Mr. Obama's agenda for two years.

HEADLINE: Pity the Plutocrats

BYLINE: THOMAS FRANK


HIGHLIGHT: Why do the well-to-do whine so? Why do they wring their hands? 

 BODY:
Bethesda, Md.
THESE are the times that try rich men's patience. Not because this interminable economic crisis threatens to cost them their fortunes, of course, but rather the reverse: that by humiliating so many others, the slump has exposed the mighty to the horrors of criticism. Yes, sour sounds have reached their ears: recrimination, reproof, ridicule, rebellion!
The people have been thinking about how the economy came to collapse in the first place, of the role that great wealth and the deregulation of the financial industry played. And over the years, the unthinkable has happened. People have started to say mean things about billionaires. Even the president has engaged in the "rhetoric of class warfare." During Wednesday's debate, for example, this Danton of the Democrats went so far as to say that businesses shouldn't get tax breaks for moving jobs overseas and even scoffed at that archetypal small-business man, Donald J. Trump.
Rhetoric like this makes the very rich feel very sad. It has sent them on a crusade to restore matters to their rightful place. And in the process they have developed one of the distinctive literary forms of our time: the plutocrat's j'accuse.
The most famous example is the open letter to the president written last year by the hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman and dissected at length in this week's New Yorker magazine. In it, Mr. Cooperman blames Mr. Obama (and his "minions") for "setting the tenor of the rancorous debate now roiling us that smacks of what so many have characterized as 'class warfare.' " This is serious, this roiling and this tenor-setting, but it is not the only damage the president's words have done. The "divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf," Mr. Cooperman continued, "between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them" - meaning, apparently, hedge fund managers like himself.
Other princelings who have made noteworthy contributions to the genre include Ted Leonsis, the owner of several Washington sports teams, who feels that "anyone who has achieved success in terms of rank or fiscal success is being cast as a bad guy in a black hat," and the casino magnate Steve Wynn, who griped in a famous conference call that the president "keeps making speeches about redistribution." He said, "We haven't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists."
Reports have even reached us, via The Wall Street Journal, of a tragic incident last year on the streets of New York in which an unnamed "panhandler" rejected a handout with a spiteful, "You Wall Street fat cats!" Thankfully, the man at whom this imprecation was directed, the chief executive of a venture capital firm, knew whom to blame: President Obama, whose "incendiary message has now reached the streets."
Nobody likes to be criticized, but one would expect captains of industry, Darwinian tough guys that they are, to have thicker skins. Were Mr. Obama a true incendiary, he might have found a way on Wednesday to mention his opponent's millions; his work for Bain Capital; or his dismissal, captured on video, of those layabouts who make up 47 percent of the country. Mr. Obama called for ending the tax break for corporate jets, sure, but that's about it.
In the broad scheme of things, these are excellent times to be a billionaire. Labor is powerless. Taxes are low. The banks that survived the crisis are bigger than ever. So why do the well-to-do whine so? Why do they wring their hands?
For one thing, their criticisms reveal a contemptuous view of their fellow citizens. That all the books and articles on the financial crisis and the recession might have had an effect - that people might see the economic downturn as a reflection on the individuals who were, a few years back, lionized as the economy's leaders - is inconceivable to the class-war complainers. The public's attitude, they seem to believe, can have arisen only as a result of propagandizing by Mr. Obama. No American would ever stop respecting his betters unless he was brainwashed into it.
It is also a play for legitimacy. In good times, the very rich compare themselves to the Almighty; in hard times they convince themselves that Huey P. Long lurks just around the corner. History, they fear, will repeat its most sordid chapters unless it is stopped right now, and that's why they act as if a few mean words wound as hurtfully as any program of, say, antitrust enforcement.
They whine because whining works. One only wishes that if he wins a second term, Barack Obama will give them something to really cry about.
Thomas Frank, a columnist at Harper's Magazine, is the author of "Pity the Billionaire."

HEADLINE: Bit Parts but No Bit Players at Public Theater Dedication

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: Channeling their inner thespian, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other luminaries helped christen the renovated theater by delivering lines of Shakespeare. 

 BODY:
To be or not to be a Shakespearean actor, that was the question. The man who was about to read from "A Midsummer Night's Dream" explained his motivation this way: "I'm going to be unemployed in 453 days and out interviewing for new jobs."
 Then Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proceeded to deliver a passage from the comedy that Shakespeare is thought to have written when he was in his mid-30s. Like Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa Redgrave, who followed the mayor in delivering bits of Shakespeare during a ceremony at the Public Theater on Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg read his lines. 
The mayor, who said later that it was his debut in Shakespeare, popped the "p" in the word "accompany." Still, he got a standing ovation - but most of the audience was standing anyway, and had been for 15 or 20 minutes, because the ceremony took place in the lobby of the Public, not a place with rows and rows of seats. These were the mayor's lines, from Act V, Scene 1:
 Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts!
The ceremony celebrated the completion of a $40 million renovation of the Public's 1850s Renaissance Revival building, in the East Village. It has new granite stairs and a new canopy outside, along with reopened archways inside (they had been sealed off sometime in the past) and a new snack bar in the center of the lobby. It was dispensing coffee and juice as people mingled before the speeches - and the Shakespeare readings.
The cast was varied, to say the least. Mr. Patinkin read from "The Tempest" and added a mention of Joseph Papp, who founded the Public. Mr. Papp's widow, Gail, read three lines from "Coriolanus." The architect James S. Polshek, who was the design counsel on the renovation, read four lines from "Henry IV" that sounded like a job description, for they mentioned surveying a plot, drawing a model and figuring the cost when, as Shakespeare put it, "we mean to build." Miss Redgrave read from "As You Like It," while the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, read from "All's Well That Ends Well."
Oskar Eustis, the Public's artistic director, said the readings were a "kind of a peculiar benediction" after the speeches, which included one by Luis A. Urbinas, the president of the Ford Foundation, which gave $2 million for the renovation and for which the new lobby was named. 
Mr. Urbinas said he had discovered the Public as a teenager from the South Bronx in the 1970s when he and a friend went to a free performance of "Macbeth." They were approached, Mr. Urbinas recalled, by "what seemed to our high school eyes this ancient man - he was 50. He explained we were way too early, but we could hang around." The man turned out to be Mr. Papp, he said. 
For his part, Mr. Bloomberg said he had considered recreating "some of the theater's greatest moments." 
"For example, I could perform that showstopper from the Public's beloved 'The Pirates of Penzance,' my favorite Gilbert and Sullivan," he said, "and I would call it, 'I am the model of the modern mayor general.'"
The crowd laughed, perhaps a little uneasily, as if the next line might be a real groaner, and the mayor said, "It's not easy to write this stuff, folks, you know?"
He suggested changing one of the most famous songs in "The Threepenny Opera" to "Mike the Knife."
"Or maybe I could revive the performance I gave at a charity event a year or so ago with the cast of 'Hair,'" he said. "Thankfully, there was no nude scene there." A moment later, he said, "On the advice of our corporation counsel, Michael Cardozo, who doubles as a board member of the Public, I won't do it today, either." (Clothed cast members from the Public's 2008 revival of "Hair'' later performed "Let the Sun Shine In.")
Then, without so much as a spotlight or a snappy song like "One" from "A Chorus Line," Mr. Eustis introduced what he called the mayor's "audition for his new job, which I promise I will take very seriously."
Afterward, Mr. Eustis said, "There is no question I am going to give him a callback." He also promised to give the mayor "a few adjustments, because that's how we figure out what his range is."
"I'm actually sort of serious," Mr. Eustis said.

HEADLINE: Higher Taxes in de Blasio's Schools Push

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Bill de Blasio, the New York public advocate, laid out a provocative plan on Thursday to finance education programs by raising income taxes on the city's wealthiest residents, an early populist salvo in his presumptive campaign for mayor.
Speaking at a breakfast event for a prominent civic group, Mr. de Blasio also attacked a mayoral rival, Speaker Christine C. Quinn of the City Council, for proposing a set of small-business reforms that he dismissed as ''a joke,'' and he chastised Ms. Quinn for declining to challenge Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on the issue. 
Mr. de Blasio's criticisms were a signal of the intraparty combat that is expected to accompany a competitive, and potentially decisive, Democratic primary in 2013.
But the focus of his speech -- education -- also proved contentious, with members of the well-heeled audience seemingly cool to his idea of raising taxes to provide more prekindergarten classes and after-school activities for students in grades six through eight.
Mr. de Blasio argued that improvements in early childhood education were critical to improving the city's long-term economy and its middle class. He estimated that the new programs would cost about $500 million, which could be generated through a small tax surcharge on New Yorkers who earn $500,000 or more.
''The idea would be not to build more bureaucracy, but to build the middle class, to give kids the kind of educational foundation they need to move forward,'' Mr. de Blasio told members of the Association for a Better New York, a group whose events are a standard stop on the city's political circuit. ''We will be asking people who worked hard and have done well to contribute a little more and make this happen.''
A person earning $1 million in annual income would pay an additional $2,120 under Mr. de Blasio's plan, which was modeled after a similar surcharge used to hire new police officers under a 1990s anticrime initiative of Mayor David N. Dinkins, Mr. de Blasio's former employer. Any new surcharge would require approval by the State Legislature.
Mr. de Blasio's proposal was an incursion into policy territory typically dominated by Ms. Quinn, who has made early childhood education a priority. This year, Ms. Quinn successfully pressed Albany to make kindergarten mandatory for 5-year-olds; Mr. de Blasio said his proposal would affect 4-year-olds.
Mr. de Blasio is a longtime beneficiary of labor support whose expected candidacy has been viewed warily by the city's business elite. His proposal received a tepid response from the crowd, which included many wealthy civic leaders who would almost certainly be affected by his higher tax.
A question from the audience that challenged the rationale behind Mr. de Blasio's tax proposal received more applause than many lines in his prepared remarks.
''When you come to a group like this and you say to them, 'I want to tax you,' they immediately shut down,'' said Ernest A. Logan, president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, a city union.
But Mr. de Blasio, who joked in his speech that he was delivering his remarks in ''the lion's den,'' said he believed that the goal of improving the city's schools ought to require some investment from the wealthy.
''It's a roomful of people who know our educational status quo is unacceptable,'' Mr. de Blasio said. He added, of his proposal, ''I'm sure they'd love it if there was some other way to fund it, but I bet they will not disagree that this is fundamental to our future success.''
Mr. de Blasio has reached out to small-business groups in recent weeks, and he criticized a recent plan by Speaker Quinn and Mayor Bloomberg to simplify regulation of city businesses.
''What the mayor and the speaker did was lip service,'' Mr. de Blasio told reporters after his speech.
''They don't really intend to change it, and they should just come out and say that,'' Mr. de Blasio said.
Of Ms. Quinn, he added, ''She is clearly not challenging the mayor, and working with him to continue a bad policy.''
Ms. Quinn's office referred an inquiry about Mr. de Blasio's speech to Robert Bookman, a lawyer who often represents the hospitality industry in disputes with the city. Mr. Bookman said he was disappointed to hear Mr. de Blasio dismiss an effort that he said would help small-business owners.
''He should be careful who he's insulting when he does this kind of stuff,'' Mr. Bookman said of the public advocate.
Mr. Bloomberg had his own sharp words for Mr. de Blasio, telling reporters that the public advocate wishes to tax ''anything and everything.''
''He wants to drive everybody out of the city,'' the mayor, who has clashed frequently with Mr. de Blasio, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. He added, in a sarcastic tone: ''But that's O.K. He's a good guy.''

Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.
Douglas Dunn (Friday through Sunday) In his new work, ''Cassations,'' Mr. Dunn creates a circular space in which to explore opposing qualities -- disorder and calm, power and submission, humility and ego -- accenting gender lines within his cast of 12 dancers (7 women and 5 men, including himself). Whimsy and formalism should also come playfully head-to-head, as they often do in the work of this veteran postmodernist, who has been making dances in New York since the 1970s. The choreographic suite plays out to operatic arias, accompanied by lighting and visual design by Mimi Gross and Carol Mullins. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $15; sold out on Friday. (Siobhan Burke) 
Fall for Dance (Friday, Saturday and Thursday; through Oct. 13) There are two programs remaining in this far-reaching, pocketbook-friendly festival, where you can see flamenco from Spain, circus arts from Australia, hip-hop from South Korea and contemporary dance from the United States in a single evening. Such is the fifth and final lineup (Thursday), which features María Pagés, Circa, Laboratory Dance Project and Shen Wei. Program 4 (Friday and Saturday) includes the work of two glamorous yet grounded dancer-choreographers -- Jodi Melnick's ''Solo (Re)Deluxe Version'' and a United States premiere by Shantala Shivalingappa, both with live music -- as well as Pacific Northwest Ballet and a troupe of male hula dancers. At 8 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $15. (Burke)
Jack Ferver (Saturday) Mr. Ferver plans to tell us a lot about himself in ''Mon Ma Mes,'' which takes the form of a question-and-answer session about his life, as he simultaneously performs and deconstructs one of his works. All the while, further compounding the layers of ''me,'' a documentary film about the artist is being made. We know that Mr. Ferver can be darkly, bitingly humorous. What more will be revealed? At 8 p.m., French Institute Alliance Française, Le Skyroom, 22 East 60th Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, fiaf.org; $20 in advance, or $25 day of performance. (Burke)
&#x2605; Festival Flamenco Gitano (Saturday and Sunday) Flamenco, like all cultural dance traditions, has weathered its share of attempts at fusion and otherwise wrangling old into new. This festival, however, offers two evenings of Gypsy flamenco that stays close to its roots. Saturday's program features a multigenerational ensemble of 12 dancers and musicians from the Andalusian city Jerez de la Frontera. On Sunday the 14-year-old prodigy El Carpeta makes his New York debut, carrying on the legacy of the famed Farruco dynasty alongside his mother, La Farruca. Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., NYU Skirball Center, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org; $55 to $65, or $20 for students. (Burke)
Fridays at Noon (Friday) Kicking off a new season of this free, informal series at the 92nd Street Y, the witty David Parker organizes an afternoon of cabaret-inspired performance, ranging from traditional song-and-dance routines to subversions of vaudevillian convention. He's selected an array of artists who bring expertise from hip-hop, tap, performance art and other genres, including Catherine Galasso, Nicholas Leichter, Aaron Mattocks and his own company, the Bang Group. At noon, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; free. (Burke)
&#x2605; David Gordon and Valda Setterfield (Monday) This husband-and-wife team has been collaborating since the 1960s, when he was a founding member of Judson Dance Theater and she was a dancer with Merce Cunningham's company. A famously hard-to-categorize artist, Mr. Gordon continues to make delightfully absurd works of dance-theater, with the elegant Ms. Setterfield as his performer and muse. As part of Danspace Project's Judson Now platform, the couple joins Wendy Perron, the editor of Dance Magazine, for what promises to be a lively conversation examining the relationship between Mr. Gordon's current work and two of his classics, ''Mannequin'' (1962) and ''The Matter'' (1972). At 7 p.m., Diana Event Oval, Barnard College, 3009 Broadway, at 117th Street, (212) 674-8112, danspaceproject.org; free. (Burke)
Joanna Haigood (Saturday) For more than 30 years, Ms. Haigood has found inspiration in natural and built environments, bringing their histories to the surface in her large-scale, site-specific works. In ''Paseo,'' presented by Dancing in the Streets, she and the Latin jazz composer Bobby Sanabria have created a traveling performance -- with 80 dancers, musicians, actors and poets -- that will snake along 11 blocks of the South Bronx, invoking the cultural renaissance that took place there the 1950s and '60s. It all leads to an outdoor dance party with live music by artists who came of age in the neighborhood. At 3:30 p.m., starts at Casita Maria, 928 Simpson Street, Bronx, dancinginthestreets.org; free. (Burke)
Trajal Harrell (Thursday; through Oct. 13) Mr. Harrell has long been fascinated by the overlap (or lack thereof) between two cultural movements of 1960s New York: the postmodern experiments of Judson Dance Theater and, at the opposite end of Manhattan, the drag balls of Harlem. He continues his ''Twenty Looks'' series, which explores the connections, both real and hypothetical, between those worlds, with ''Judson Church Is Ringing in Harlem (Made-to-Measure),'' specially tailored to Danspace Project on the occasion of Judson's 50th anniversary. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
&#x2605; Keith Hennessy / Circo Zero (Friday and Saturday) A brilliant improviser and instigator of theatrical mischief, Mr. Hennessy comes to New York Live Arts with ''Turbulence (a dance about the economy),'' a response to our current economic and ecological crises. Integrating new cast members into each performance, the collaborative work continuously morphs and reinvents itself, never quite knowing where it's headed. If it's anything like Mr. Hennessy's ''Almost,'' performed at the Abrons Arts Center last year, that uncertainty will be thrilling. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $20, or $16 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Raimund Hoghe (Wednesday through next Friday) The classical pas de deux gets reimagined in ''Pas de Deux,'' a duet for this German choreographer and the Japanese dancer Takashi Ueno. Stark minimalism replaces displays of technical prowess, highlighting virtuosity of a different kind, as the two performers move together but in isolation. At 7:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org; $20. (Burke)
Judson Dance Theater: Reconstructed (Sunday) Thirty years ago, on the 20th anniversary of Judson Dance Theater (in case you haven't heard, the 50th is now under way), Danspace Project and Bennington College invited 14 Judson choreographers to reconstruct works from that era of creative upheaval. The Anthology Film Archives, in collaboration with Danspace Project and Movement Research, presents a screening featuring some of those rarely seen reconstructions and filmed interviews with the artists. At 3 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $10, or $8 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Rob List (Friday and Saturday) The Chocolate Factory rarely presents international artists (small theater, small budget), so when it does, you know it must be for good reason. Mr. List makes the trip to Long Island City from Amsterdam, where he's been based for 20 years, with ''Play By Ear,'' an attempt to connect honestly and directly to an audience without sentiment or fanfare. At 8 p.m., Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Burke)
Neal Medlyn (Friday and Saturday) Funny, loud, unruly, bizarre, maybe naked -- just a few words that come to mind when you hear that Mr. Medlyn is hosting a LateNite show at Dance New Amsterdam. The best description of his ''It's Like We Are Infiltrators Part II'' (Part I happened 12 years ago, in Texas) is probably his own: ''A semi-unstructured evening of things actually taking place that will never take place again, if you are lucky.'' Performers include DJ Duo Team Company LLC, Farris Craddock, Carmine Covelli and Eleanor Hullihan. At 10 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 625-8369, dnadance.org; $12 in advance, or $17 day of performance; $14 for students and 65+. (Burke)
&#x2605; New York City Ballet (Friday through Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday, through Oct. 14) Justin Peck, City Ballet's 25-year-old corps member and rising choreographer, unveils his second work for the company, a collaboration with Sufjan Stevens set to a new orchestration of that singer-songwriter's electronic album ''Enjoy Your Rabbit.'' The new ballet, ''Year of the Rabbit,'' shares a ''21st Century'' bill with recent pieces by Benjamin Millepied (''Two Hearts'') and Christopher Wheeldon (''Les Carillons'') on Friday, Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Also on deck: three evenings of Balanchine and Robbins (Saturday night, Wednesday and Thursday) and, on Tuesday, Mr. Wheeldon's ''After the Rain.'' Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., and Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com; $29 to $155. (Burke)
Rebecca Patek (Friday and Saturday; through Oct. 12) What better setting for Ms. Patek's ''You and I of the Storm,'' a commentary on art-world clichés and other sources of disenchantment, than an art museum?

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Rise; Factory Orders Decline

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week after a big drop the week before, a sign that the job market is still on the mend. 
Other data on Thursday showed a decline in new orders for factory goods, although orders outside the transportation sector rose for a second consecutive month, which should calm fears of a rapid loss of momentum in factory activity.
''The economy is obviously feeling the strain from cooler global conditions and the policy uncertainty that continues to overhang us here as we turn the corner on 2012 and into 2013,'' said Robert A. Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas.
Worries about the so-called fiscal cliff -- automatic tax increases and government spending cuts that will remove about $600 billion from the nation's economy next year unless Congress acts -- have made businesses cautious about ramping up hiring.
The report on jobless claims, however, offered little sign that companies were laying off workers on a large scale.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 367,000, the Labor Department said. But that followed a decline of 22,000 the week before. The four-week average held steady at 375,000.
Separately, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods fell 5.2 percent in August, the biggest decline since January 2009, when the economy was in the grip of a recession.
But the decline was a result of a collapse in demand for aircraft and a softening of automobile purchases. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.7 percent.
Manufacturing has carried the economic recovery, and while activity has cooled significantly in recent months, there are so far few signs of a hard landing. A closely watched index released on Monday showed that national factory activity increased in September for the first time in four months.
A third report bolstered the view that fears about the fiscal cliff were not leading businesses to lay off large numbers of workers.
While planned layoffs rose 4.9 percent in September, they came in at a 15-year low for the month, the consulting company Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.
The report suggested that there had not yet been a pickup in plans by larger firms to reduce employment levels, said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

HEADLINE: When Job-Creation Engines Stop at Just One

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- When Mike Farmer started a digital search company in 2004, he had a staff of 10.
Today, in his third start-up, he has one employee: himself, aided by seven contractors working more or less part time. His budget, like his head count, is smaller, and by his account the new model is much more sustainable.
''I think we're all headed toward an agent economy, where everyone becomes an agent or a service provider instead of an employee at some big corporation,'' said Mr. Farmer, whose mobile search app, Leap2, now has 10,000 users. ''That's just how the world is evolving. It's like telecommuting, but it's taken to the level of telecompanies.''
For more than a decade, start-ups have been getting leaner and meaner. In 1999, the typical new business had 7.7 employees; its counterpart in 2011 had 4.7, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by E. J. Reedy at the Kauffman Foundation, a research organization focused on entrepreneurship. 
The lean model bodes well for companies like Leap2 that hope to become power players with much less manpower. With a work force of contractors, Mr. Farmer said Leap2 could ''dial it up and dial it down'' as business demanded without having to spend money unless it was necessary, improving the company's chances of survival.
But the implications for the American work force are worrisome, and may help explain why economic output is growing much faster than employers are adding jobs. On Friday, two days after the issue dominated the first presidential debate, the Labor Department will release the unemployment rate for September along with payroll gains, which economists predict will barely keep pace with new people joining the labor force.
For decades, new companies have produced most of the country's job growth. Without start-ups, the country would have had a net increase in jobs in only seven years since 1977. The number of people employed by new businesses peaked in 1999, the height of the tech bubble, and has fallen by 46 percent since then, to 2.5 million in 2011, creating a slow leak in job creation that has proved difficult to plug.
''There's this idea that we can somehow rely on entrepreneurship to get us out of the job crisis,'' said Scott Shane, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University. ''That's getting harder and harder, considering there are fewer and fewer of them, and they're each employing fewer people.''
The decrease in start-up size is probably driven by some combination of technology, changes in management philosophy and tighter financing.
Mr. Farmer, an affable, bearded 43-year-old prone to long bouts of giddiness when talking about his company, co-founded Leap2 in 2010. He boldly declares that his app is revolutionizing search on mobile phones by integrating regular search engine results with local listings, feeds from Twitter and other social sites, and breaking news.
He manages this revolution from a tiny, shared office here in Kansas City with a few desks and a couple of white boards. There are no Foosball tables, pinball machines or other frivolities that are common in Silicon Valley start-ups. Rent is cheap. Perhaps more important, the rest of the overhead is, too.
Leap2 rents server space, which means Mr. Farmer did not need to hire people to build and maintain servers, as with his earlier start-ups. The company has access to programming language from Bing, Twitter and other established companies, so it does not have to build a new search engine to crawl the Web and index myriad Twitter posts.
Leap2 also does not have any back-office workers to handle things like travel arrangements, human resources or accounting. That is partly because there are now Web-based resources to help with these functions, and partly because Leap2's contracted developers pitch in on many of these tasks.
''We recruit athletes, not position players,'' Mr. Farmer said, meaning he believes his contractors can fill more than one role.
The desire to minimize back-office work is so common now that Leap2's co-founder, Dan Carroll, decided to invest in a company called Rocket Fuel that helps new firms handle administrative work and other tasks -- ''the kind of things once upon a time you maybe had an office manager figure out,'' said Mr. Carroll.
Mr. Carroll brags that Leap2 has been able to spend ''almost 100 percent'' of its budget on programming talent. That spending goes further because Leap2's developers, as independent contractors, do not get benefits.
Most of Leap2's developers have staff jobs at bigger, established companies that provide health insurance. Because most of them have children, they tend to do their work for Leap2 after about 9 p.m. Only one contractor, Travis Williams, does not have a day job anywhere. He is a graphic designer who juggles multiple projects by choice, and he has health insurance through his wife, who is a kindergarten teacher.
Though the company's developers are mostly local, they interact primarily by instant message or Skype. They meet in person once a week over dinner, and one, Michael Marley, who works on contract through the Allen Group in Norwalk, Conn., calls in via Skype. A monitor showing his face is propped up on a chair to suggest he is in the room.
''You used to hear about inventors tinkering in their garage,'' said Tyler VanWinkle, the company's product manager. ''Skype is the new garage.''
This focus on leanness and streamlining is not limited to high-tech start-ups, according to Eric Ries, the author of ''The Lean Startup.'' He said the revolution began in Japan in the 1980s, when manufacturers learned the value of creating products in smaller batches and refining them more often, and has since spread.
''Now you can rent the means of production instead of owning them,'' he said.
All of these factors should make it easier to start a business, suggesting that the volume of new companies would help make up for the smaller head count at start-ups. That has not been the case in recent years, however.
Over the last five years, the number of new employer businesses, including new franchises for existing companies, fell by 20 percent, to 536,445 in 2011 from 667,341 in 2006.
But there was tremendous growth in businesses like Leap2 that are operated by one person, partly reflecting the fact that more Americans are going it alone as consultants and contractors. The number of nonemployer businesses grew by 33.8 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to the Census Bureau. Some economists refer to this phenomenon as jobless entrepreneurship.
Experts do not know whether or how quickly the number of start-ups will recover, particularly because such businesses have often been financed through home equity loans and so many homes remain underwater, according to Tim Kane, chief economist at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization.
While much attention has been devoted to stoking entrepreneurship and job creation through tax breaks, entrepreneurship may be more influenced by other factors, such as the risks that come with starting a company, Mr. Ries said, including the loss of health insurance.
A study last year found a spike in business ownership at age 65, and attributed it to access to Medicare. Some economists have said that the Affordable Care Act's expansion of health insurance options could help increase entrepreneurship. Having raised $470,000 in its first two years of existence, Leap2 is aiming for $1.5 million more. Mr. Farmer said he hoped to hire some of his developers eventually as full-time staff members, perhaps six by the end of the year.
But even then, Leap2 expects to keep plenty of developers on contract, on Skype and around the country, to stay lean, efficient and nimble.
Mr. Carroll gave as an example one talented programmer who might help Leap2 with smaller projects while working on his own start-up.
''In the past, you would have raised a big round of funding at the beginning, and you would have hired him,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''And he's brilliant, and would be really helpful at some of the early stage stuff. But now you're stuck with him, and he's good at one particular thing, and your company has taken a turn. Either you have to fire him, or you end up building the wrong product.''

HEADLINE: Moving Beyond Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. ESPENSHADE. 
Thomas J. Espenshade, a professor of sociology at Princeton, is a co-author of ''No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal: Race and Class in Elite College Admission and Campus Life.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
ON Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas, the latest in a long line of conservative assaults on affirmative action that dates to the late 1970s. Nearly a decade has passed since the court, in Grutter v. Bollinger, approved the continued use of race as one factor in an individualized, ''holistic'' review of an applicant's qualifications for higher education. Now even such limited consideration of race is being challenged.
Abigail Fisher, who is white, graduated from a Texas public high school in 2008 and barely missed out on automatic admission to the University of Texas at Austin under the Texas Top 10 Percent Law. When she was later denied admission after an evaluation that considered a candidate's race, she sued, alleging racial discrimination. 
Supporters of race-conscious affirmative action in higher education are not optimistic that it will survive. But they shouldn't despair. A Supreme Court ruling against the university might put ethnic and racial diversity on college campuses on a firmer footing for the long term. It would spur Americans who care about racial inequality to seek alternatives to affirmative action by addressing the deeply entrenched disadvantages that lower-income and minority children face from the beginning of life.
Race-based affirmative action has been a woefully inadequate weapon in the arsenal against inequality. It treats the symptoms but not the root causes of an underlying social problem. It is limited to the more selective private and public colleges (those that accept fewer than half of all applicants), which together account for about 20 percent of all freshmen. By my estimate, between 10,000 and 15,000 black and Hispanic students enroll in selective colleges every year through race-conscious policies. This is about 1 percent of the entering freshman class nationwide and just 1 percent of all black and Hispanic 18-year-olds.
Graduation rates are higher for all students, not just underrepresented minority students, at more selective colleges. The trade-off is that students who are admitted through affirmative action (and who often have weaker academic credentials than their peers) are more likely to graduate toward the bottom of their class. Analyzing data from eight elite colleges (five private, three public) from 1999 and 2003, my colleague Alexandria Walton Radford and I found that one-half of black students and one-third of Hispanic students graduated in the bottom 20 percent of their class.
We also found that self-segregation dilutes the educational benefits of diversity that proponents of affirmative action rightly prize. Only half of the students in our sample reported having a roommate or close friend of a different race (or a different Hispanic ethnicity) during college. Finally, when asked about their level of satisfaction with the academic and social aspects of their college years, upper-middle-class white students reported the greatest satisfaction and working-class black students the least.
To be clear, I believe that race-conscious affirmative action is necessary, and often beneficial -- though I am not hopeful that the court will agree. Our study showed that eliminating it would reduce the number of black students by about 60 percent, and the number of Hispanic students by about one-third, at selective private schools. We also showed that there is no substitute policy, including preferences based on socioeconomic class, that would generate as much racial and ethnic diversity as affirmative action, given the large numbers of working-class non-Hispanic whites and Asians in the applicant pool.
Most important, our study found that without affirmative action, racial diversity could only be preserved if there were no racial differences in learned skills and knowledge or in college preparedness.
The racial and socioeconomic gap in academic performance is America's most pressing domestic issue. When they enter kindergarten, black children are about one year behind white children. When they graduate from high school, black teenagers are four years behind white teenagers.
Despite the No Child Left Behind law, the Race to the Top initiative and endless debate over K-12 school reforms -- accountability, standards, smaller classes, more effective teachers, better pay, charter schools, extended day, yearlong schools -- the performance gaps have persisted, especially at the later ages.
If affirmative action is abolished, selective colleges and universities will face a stark choice. They can try to manufacture diversity by giving more weight in admissions to those factors that are sometimes close substitutes for race -- for example, having overcome disadvantage in a poor urban neighborhood. Or they can take a far bolder step: putting their endowments and influence behind a comprehensive effort to close the learning gap that starts at birth. Higher education has a responsibility for all of education. The job of those atop the academic pyramid is not over once they've enrolled a diverse freshman class.
We need more research into the impact of factors like diet and nutrition, the amount of time parents talk and read with their kids, exposure to electronic screen time, sleep routines and the way stress outside the home affects family life. But we already know that an expansion of early-childhood education is urgently needed, along with programs, like peer-to-peer mentoring, that help low-income families support their children's learning. The first few years of life are the most critical ones, when parental investments and early-childhood interventions have a higher payoff than at later ages, particularly for disadvantaged children. Economists have estimated that the net taxpayer benefit from converting a high school dropout to a high school graduate is $127,000.
However the court decides the Fisher case, affirmative action's days appear numbered. Seven states -- Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Washington -- have banned racial preferences in college admissions. In 2003, in the Grutter decision, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that she expected such preferences to disappear within 25 years -- by 2028. The children who would go off to college that year are already 2 years old.

HEADLINE: Fed Members in Accord On Bond-Buying Plan

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Policy makers at the Federal Reserve were nearly united last month in their belief that the economic recovery needed additional help and that the central bank had the ability to provide it, according to the official account of the meeting released on Thursday.
''All members but one agreed that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for additional monetary accommodation,'' said the minutes of the September meeting, and participants were particularly concerned about the high unemployment rate. 
The minutes, which summarize the discussions at the Fed's top policy making meeting, are routinely released three weeks after the meeting's end.
At the last meeting, held Sept. 12-13, the Fed announced a major round of asset purchases aimed at stimulating the economy and pulling down the stubbornly high unemployment rate, which has ranged from 8.1 to 8.3 percent this year.
In their discussions leading up to the decision, many at the meeting noted the uncertainty surrounding the economy, given the risks posed by the continuing debt crisis in Western Europe and the major tax increases and spending cuts that may hit next year in the United States. And ''a number of participants'' expressed uncertainty about the impact the new Fed program might have and how it might complicate monetary policy in the future.
Thus, the Fed minutes said the committee adopted a ''flexible approach'' that would allow the Fed ''to tailor its policy response over time.''
Many Federal Reserve officials indicated that they would also support providing more explicit guidance on interest rate policies. The Fed currently intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until mid-2015.
But the minutes said that ''many'' officials suggested tying the guidance to economic benchmarks, like the unemployment rate, rather than to the calendar.
''A change in the calendar date might be interpreted pessimistically as a downgrade of the committee's economic outlook rather than as conveying the committee's determination to support the economic recovery,'' some participants noted according to the minutes.
Moreover, using economic data rather than a specific date might allow financial markets to adjust their expectations of Federal Reserve policy more fluidly.
Still, Fed officials indicated that choosing an economic benchmark might be difficult, implying that the policy change would not be an imminent one.
Some expressed concern ''that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process or could be incorrectly interpreted as triggers prompting an automatic policy response,'' the minutes said.
But on another major round of bond buying, the members of the policy making committee were broadly in agreement.
The economy grew at an annual pace of 1.3 percent in the second quarter of the year -- not nearly enough to bring down the unemployment rate, and just above stall speed.
The jobs market is ''a grave concern,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a news conference after the September meeting. ''While the economy appears to be on a path of moderate recovery, it isn't growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the unemployment rate.''
So the Fed announced it would buy large quantities of mortgage bonds until it was satisfied that the jobs market had ''substantially'' improved.
The Fed effort involves purchasing mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion a month. The central bank said that it would continue the asset purchases until it was satisfied the program had worked, but it did not designate a time frame or a specific economic benchmark for when it would stop.
''We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment,'' Mr. Bernanke said last month after the Fed's announcement.
In the meeting, some members ''were reluctant to specify explicit numerical thresholds out of concern that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process or could be incorrectly interpreted as triggers prompting an automatic policy response,'' the minutes of the meeting said.
The new Fed program is also intended to support the nascent housing recovery, where sales volumes and purchase prices are starting to track back upward six years after the housing bubble started to collapse.
The effort will ''provide further support for the housing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing,'' Mr. Bernanke said after the announcement.
Markets have mostly cheered the new Fed program. But it has provoked criticism from politicians.
''After four years of stagnant growth, falling incomes, rising costs and persistently high unemployment, the American economy doesn't need more artificial and ineffective measures,'' Mitt Romney's campaign said in a statement. ''We should be creating wealth, not printing dollars.''
Others have charged that the Fed's aggressive easing of monetary policy has reduced pressure on Washington to tackle the country's debt.
Mr. Bernanke gave a strong response to that criticism at a speech in Indianapolis this week. ''I find this argument unpersuasive,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''The responsibility for fiscal policy lies squarely with the administration and the Congress.''
Given the pervasive weakness in the economy, Mr. Bernanke has repeatedly called on other Washington policy makers to do more to support the recovery, and to avoid the ''fiscal cliff'' -- the nickname he coined for the enormous tax increases and spending cuts that will happen at year-end, if Congress does not act.
''Business contacts in many parts of the country were reported to be highly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and for fiscal and regulatory policies,'' the minutes said. ''Although firms' balance sheets were generally strong, these uncertainties had led them to be particularly cautious and to remain reluctant to hire or expand capacity.''
The next meeting of the Fed's open market committee will be Oct. 23-24.

HEADLINE: Food Prices Rise, Agency Says

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Global prices for meats, dairy products and cereals resumed rising last month, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported Thursday, adding to concerns that developing countries may face food shortages. 
The agency said that on average, prices rose 1.4 percent in September, after remaining steady in July and August. Scorching heat and drought in the United States, Russia and Europe constricted agricultural production and pushed up prices of corn and soybeans to record highs, the report said.
The largest increases were for dairy products, which rose 7 percent in September, their sharpest climb since January 2011. Higher feed costs were a major factor in the increase, and also helped to drive meat prices up 2.1 percent, especially in the ''grain intensive'' pork and poultry industries, the report said.
Cereal prices rose 1 percent, and the food agency forecast a decline in global cereal production this year.
Despite the recent price increases, the agency's overall food price index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of goods including cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, remains below the levels it reached in 2011, when high food prices led to unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa. But, adjusted for inflation, the index is now only 13 percent below its levels of 2008, when food costs set off riots in several countries.
After the release of the food agency's report, Oxfam, a nonprofit international aid group, called on governments to tackle the root causes of food price volatility.
The price index ''shows that food prices remain at extremely high levels,'' the group's spokesman, Colin Roche, said in a statement. ''The fact they are relatively steady is no cause for celebration. Governments must ensure that these high prices do not tip more vulnerable people into hunger. We cannot afford to sleepwalk into the next food crisis.''
Oxfam also released a report on Thursday, saying that rising food prices have helped drive a global land rush that is undermining the rights and livelihoods of the poor and the most vulnerable people.
The Oxfam report said that foreign investors have invested heavily in recent years to acquire agricultural land in developing countries with serious hunger problems, but that most of the investors plan to use the land to grow exclusively for export, not for domestic sale.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pity the Plutocrats

BYLINE: By THOMAS FRANK. 
Thomas Frank, a columnist at Harper's Magazine, is the author of ''Pity the Billionaire.''

 BODY:
Bethesda, Md.
THESE are the times that try rich men's patience. Not because this interminable economic crisis threatens to cost them their fortunes, of course, but rather the reverse: that by humiliating so many others, the slump has exposed the mighty to the horrors of criticism. Yes, sour sounds have reached their ears: recrimination, reproof, ridicule, rebellion!
The people have been thinking about how the economy came to collapse in the first place, of the role that great wealth and the deregulation of the financial industry played. And over the years, the unthinkable has happened. People have started to say mean things about billionaires. Even the president has engaged in the ''rhetoric of class warfare.'' During Wednesday's debate, for example, this Danton of the Democrats went so far as to say that businesses shouldn't get tax breaks for moving jobs overseas and even scoffed at that archetypal small-business man, Donald J. Trump. 
Rhetoric like this makes the very rich feel very sad. It has sent them on a crusade to restore matters to their rightful place. And in the process they have developed one of the distinctive literary forms of our time: the plutocrat's j'accuse.
The most famous example is the open letter to the president written last year by the hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman and dissected at length in this week's New Yorker magazine. In it, Mr. Cooperman blames Mr. Obama (and his ''minions'') for ''setting the tenor of the rancorous debate now roiling us that smacks of what so many have characterized as 'class warfare.' '' This is serious, this roiling and this tenor-setting, but it is not the only damage the president's words have done. The ''divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf,'' Mr. Cooperman continued, ''between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them'' -- meaning, apparently, hedge fund managers like himself.
Other princelings who have made noteworthy contributions to the genre include Ted Leonsis, the owner of several Washington sports teams, who feels that ''anyone who has achieved success in terms of rank or fiscal success is being cast as a bad guy in a black hat,'' and the casino magnate Steve Wynn, who griped in a famous conference call that the president ''keeps making speeches about redistribution.'' He said, ''We haven't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists.''
Reports have even reached us, via The Wall Street Journal, of a tragic incident last year on the streets of New York in which an unnamed ''panhandler'' rejected a handout with a spiteful, ''You Wall Street fat cats!'' Thankfully, the man at whom this imprecation was directed, the chief executive of a venture capital firm, knew whom to blame: President Obama, whose ''incendiary message has now reached the streets.''
Nobody likes to be criticized, but one would expect captains of industry, Darwinian tough guys that they are, to have thicker skins. Were Mr. Obama a true incendiary, he might have found a way on Wednesday to mention his opponent's millions; his work for Bain Capital; or his dismissal, captured on video, of those layabouts who make up 47 percent of the country. Mr. Obama called for ending the tax break for corporate jets, sure, but that's about it.
In the broad scheme of things, these are excellent times to be a billionaire. Labor is powerless. Taxes are low. The banks that survived the crisis are bigger than ever. So why do the well-to-do whine so? Why do they wring their hands?
For one thing, their criticisms reveal a contemptuous view of their fellow citizens. That all the books and articles on the financial crisis and the recession might have had an effect -- that people might see the economic downturn as a reflection on the individuals who were, a few years back, lionized as the economy's leaders -- is inconceivable to the class-war complainers. The public's attitude, they seem to believe, can have arisen only as a result of propagandizing by Mr. Obama. No American would ever stop respecting his betters unless he was brainwashed into it.
It is also a play for legitimacy. In good times, the very rich compare themselves to the Almighty; in hard times they convince themselves that Huey P. Long lurks just around the corner. History, they fear, will repeat its most sordid chapters unless it is stopped right now, and that's why they act as if a few mean words wound as hurtfully as any program of, say, antitrust enforcement.
They whine because whining works. One only wishes that if he wins a second term, Barack Obama will give them something to really cry about.

HEADLINE: A Barn-Raising Rocks A New Jersey Arena

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- It takes an arena concert to save a barn.
Collaborators and admirers of Levon Helm, who was the drummer for the Band, gathered on Wednesday at the Izod Center for a benefit concert, ''Love for Levon.'' It was a night of gritty voices, twangy guitars and songs steeped in American traditions and tall tales: a kind of powwow for the rootsy, handmade styles now categorized together as Americana.
The concert, which will eventually be shown on AXS TV and released as a DVD, raised money to keep music going at Mr. Helm's barn in Woodstock, N.Y.; he died in April. The barn is a recording studio and, since 2005, the home of the Midnight Ramble, a concert series where the Levon Helm Band had been joined, through the years, by most of the musicians at the concert. 
Even in an arena it was a cozy event. Dozens of luminaries from rock, soul and country -- among them Gregg Allman, Jakob Dylan, Bruce Hornsby, Mavis Staples, John Prine, Joan Osborne, John Hiatt, Jorma Kaukonen and Ray La Montagne -- were backed by the Levon Helm Band. It's now led by the guitarist and fiddler Larry Campbell and, Mr. Campbell announced, renamed the Midnight Ramble Band. Fondly, fervently and with few displays of vanity, they sang Band songs and songs from Mr. Helm's 2007 solo album, ''Dirt Farmer'' (including the Appalachian-style ''Little Birds,'' sung by Amy Helm, Mr. Helm's daughter).
Most of the performers echoed the inflections of Mr. Helm's singing, with its deep Southern memories in every unvarnished phrase. And at their foundation were the beats Mr. Helm had played: his amalgam of bedrock economy, R&B backbeat, military tattoo and jazzy variation. Sometimes it took two drummers to play them.
Garth Hudson, the Band's keyboardist, sat in vigorously on a few songs, including a rendition of ''Chest Fever'' (sung by the country star Dierks Bentley) that he opened with a sly, darting Bach pastiche as an organ solo. Robbie Robertson, the Band's primary songwriter and other surviving member, did not appear. But his songs did, with their conundrums, gravity and humor.
Joe Walsh, though hardly the night's most gifted singer, cackled through ''Up on Cripple Creek'' with lascivious glee, then ramped up a racing, swooping guitar duel with the steel guitarist Robert Randolph. Lucinda Williams captured the solitary anguish of ''Whispering Pines.'' The New Orleans songwriter Allen Toussaint sang ''Life Is a Carnival'' (written by Mr. Helm, Mr. Robertson and Rick Danko), riding the horn-section arrangement the Band had commissioned from Mr. Toussaint in the 1970s. Warren Haynes, from the Allman Brothers Band, pushed ''The Shape I'm In'' further south with a stubbornly leisurely slide guitar solo.
But some of the concert's best moments moved beyond homage. Grace Potter, accompanying herself on organ in a beautifully sparse arrangement, made Bob Dylan's ''I Shall Be Released'' a pure, lonely hymn. The Kentucky band My Morning Jacket took the stage on its own, keeping the horn section, to kick and stomp its way through ''Ophelia.'' Mr. Campbell sang the Grateful Dead's ''Tennessee Jed'' with John Mayer's lead guitar teasing all around him.
The country singer Eric Church seized ''A Train Robbery,'' a Paul Kennerley song from ''Dirt Farmer,'' and snarled through its depiction of Jesse James warning, ''We will burn your train to cinders.'' And Roger Waters -- the non-American on the bill -- gave another ''Dirt Farmer'' song, ''Wide River to Cross,'' the kind of stately, overwhelming crescendos he used in Pink Floyd. Mr. Waters had brought a red baseball cap that Mr. Helm impulsively gave him in 1990, and it hung on a microphone stand -- a relic and down-home talisman -- as the entire lineup gathered to sing ''The Weight,'' belting its tales of comic woe like a family anthem.

HEADLINE: In the Time of Skinny Cows

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
VALENCIA, SPAIN -- A vast theme park south of this coastal city is called Terra Mitica, or mythical land. That is not a bad term these days for Spain, a country rubbing its eyes in post-bubble bewilderment at the alarming cracks in the national edifice.
Terra Mitica, in and out of bankruptcy since its opening in 2000, is one product of the Valencia region's giddy building boom fed by cheap money, venal politics and galloping illusion.
An underused 14-story opera house perched like an avant-garde spaceship on a lapping pool, a soaring suspension bridge over nothing, and an unused airport at Castellón where pedestrians can picnic on the runway are other examples of the fever for tallest, biggest, grandest that gripped Spain's third city. Valencia was always a little envious of Madrid and Barcelona.
Now the tab is in for its delusional swoon. Hosting the America's Cup and Formula 1 races make headlines but not sustainable development. The opera and surrounding complex alone cost over $1 billion. Today signs on Valencia pharmacies say the local government ''finds itself -- again! -- without money to pay for medicines.'' Schools are starved of cash. 
In Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, the good times are those of ''vacas gordas,'' or fat cows, and the lean years those of ''vacas flacas,'' or thin cows. Hispanic cattle, no longer fed on funny money, are super-skinny in this season of bust and brooding.
Valencia, like most of Spain's 17 autonomous communities, is heavily in debt. It needs money from Madrid. The central government, headed by the hesitant Mariano Rajoy of the center-right People's Party, in turn needs money from the European Union -- and perhaps an international bailout.
As for Spaniards, they just need money from wherever: 15,000 of them lined up the other day outside offices of John Deere, the U.S. agricultural machinery manufacturer, after 150 jobs were advertised.
One way to look at Spain is as Europe in miniature: Threatened by crack-up, constitutionally flawed, uncertain of the relationship between central and regional powers, awakening to structural flaws under the pressure of economic crisis and high unemployment.
Separatist Catalan nationalism is nothing new; what is new is the spur given it by sharp financial pressures that provoke resentment -- especially when the right, with its centralizing instincts, is in power.
Catalonia is, with Valencia, Spain's most indebted region. In Spain, even a couple of generations on from the death of that ruthless centralizer Francisco Franco, it never takes much to stir historical wounds.
It was precisely to assuage such wounds -- to triangulate old problems -- that the European Union was created. Spain's membership, long embraced with enthusiasm but now sometimes questioned, remains an important source of stability. Crisis may also be a form of growing pain, for Spain as for Europe. Old habits will have to die and new models emerge. I'd wager that Spain, like General Motors, is too big to fail.
The old Spanish model went something like this: Cheap money poured into the country from Brussels and European banks; a building boom fed by foreign demand from sun-starved North Europeans and a welter of dubious mortgages turned the coast into a construction site; regional politicians, in cozy relationships with the local savings banks known as ''cajas,'' could not find an airport or high-speed train or luxury condominium they didn't want to build, however superfluous; layers of administration, from local to central, multiplied waste and obfuscated fraud; long after danger signs started flashing in Madrid the government opted, on the Citicorp model, to dance until the music stopped.
''We were very slow to react,'' said Joaquín Moya-Angeler Cabrera, a prominent businessman. ''When a politician wanted to get rid of another the consolation prize was always to become at least director, if not chairman, of a local savings bank.''
In Valencia, as elsewhere, the lack of professional bankers took a toll. Banco de Valencia went under, was rescued by the central government, and is now being sold off. Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo (CAM), collapsed after it was found to be more than $10 billion in the red, but not before its executives helped themselves to millions. Another savings bank, Bancaja, was forced to merge.
Close to a dozen local politicians are facing charges. Real estate assets, once prized, are toxic. Valencia's bonds are rated junk. Bilbao has its Guggenheim, a galvanizing attraction: Valencia has its problem-plagued opera. As in the run-up to the 2008 meltdown in the United States, everyone cashed in; risk was a quaint, old-fashioned notion.
''Our model was speculation,'' Ignacio Blanco, a politician from the left-wing Esquerra Unida told me.
Valencia was bad, other regions scarcely better. If Castellón has its ghost airport, so, at cost of over $1 billion, does Ciudad Real in the center of the country, another runway picnic spot.
Close to 25 percent of Spaniards are now officially unemployed and over half of young people: The numbers are exaggerated -- many work in the black economy while claiming unemployment benefits -- but they still tell a real story of pain. For the first time, young professionals are leaving in droves.
Carol Vera, a 30-year-old pharmacist, said the store where she works was still waiting to be reimbursed by the local government for medicines bought six months ago. Her boss depends on a dysfunctional state; she depends on her boss for a job that pays the mortgage. ''They keep promising to pay,'' she said, ''but meanwhile I worry.'' She's starting German lessons and wondering if she and her boyfriend may one day have to move.
Like this pharmacist looking up and seeing a void, many Spaniards are reassessing their country, reborn through the 1978 Constitution after the decades of dictatorship. Franco had tried to expunge Catalan and Basque identity; the bizarre creation of 17 autonomous communities was in part a way to satisfy Catalan and Basque demands for self-government while camouflaging the concessions in something wider. The system is not working.
The crisis has not only revealed the need for radical banking reform. It has revealed a need to rethink relations between the autonomous communities and the central government; peel away layers of expensive functionaries; and arrive at a form of federalism that keeps Spain together while empowering regions.
Having Madrid as the tax collector redistributing to Barcelona and Valencia is cumbersome and provocative. The country's new high-speed trains are impressive, but it's striking -- not least to Catalans -- that all lines lead to Madrid.
Rajoy, a moderate in a party that stretches to the far right, is going to have to get over the old centralizing ardor of Castile to reach a new accommodation. He is also going to have to prove a lot more nimble and determined than he has until now to tackle the crisis. ''Whoever is in government now is probably going to lose the next election, so Rajoy may as well do what needs to be done,'' said Moya-Angeler.
In Catalonia anger is rising. Some 10 percent of the region's population of 7.5 million joined a huge independence rally last month. Tax grievances have stoked old urges. Artur Mas, the nationalist leader, has called an election for next month that will be a surrogate vote on becoming the ''next independent state in Europe,'' as one popular banner has it. Catalans have no love for Rajoy's People's Party, longtime opponent of its self-governing ambitions.
But already the Catalan business community is muttering. Secession would be hugely expensive; the Constitution bars it. In former times, Spain would have devalued the peseta to regain competitiveness; now it is obliged by the constraints of the euro to tackle its fundamental problems -- a painful but necessary process.
In the same way I think the triumph of practical compromise that ushered post-dictatorship Spain into the European Union must offer the model for necessary adjustment -- including possible constitutional reform -- and the bulwark against fracture. Spain is agonizing but it is not mythical.

All Nite Soul (Sunday) A long-running annual celebration to benefit the jazz ministry at St. Peter's Church, All Nite Soul honors the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra this year, presenting the band (and assorted guests) in a 7 p.m. concert that stretches into the early morning and includes dozens of musicians, like the trumpeter Jon Faddis and the pianist Kenny Werner. A preceding set, at 5 p.m., will feature the bright young Cuban pianist Fabian Almazan, leading a group with strings.

Michaël Attias's Spun Tree (Saturday) To celebrate the release of ''Spun Tree,'' his new album on Clean Feed, Michaël Attias, a saxophonist and composer of coolly investigative temperament, regroups a smart ensemble with the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the pianist Matt Mitchell, the bassist Sean Conly and the drummer Tom Rainey.

Bobby Avey Group (Saturday) Not long ago the proficient young pianist Bobby Avey released ''A New Face'' (jayDell), his auspicious debut.

Michael Bates Quartet (Friday) The bassist Michael Bates brings a prickly fluency to his role as bandleader and arranger on ''Acrobat: Music for, and by, Dmitri Shostakovich,'' his most recent Sunnyside release. He lines up a slightly different ensemble for this engagement, but one with a comparable skill set: Donny McCaslin on saxophones, Ben Monder on guitar and Clarence Penn on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Andy Biskin's Ibid (Tuesday) Andy Biskin, a clarinetist and composer with a sensibility both earnest and playful, slings stylistic citations shrewdly in Ibid, a responsive quartet with Kirk Knuffke on cornet, Brian Drye on trombone and Vinnie Sperrazza on drums. The group plays an early set, at 7 p.m.; at 9 p.m. the floor belongs to Slavic Soul Party, making its boisterous weekly stand.

Edmar Castaneda Trio (Thursday and next Friday) Edmar Castaneda, the Colombian harpist, has a percussive interface with his instrument, saving the sweeping glissandi for special accents and otherwise using a sharp attack, all pluck and strum. He works here with the flutist Itai Kriss and the drummer Clarence Penn -- and as a bonus special guest, the Colombian singer Andrea Tierra, his wife. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 on Thursday, $30 next Friday. (Chinen)
Celebrating GRP Records's 30th Anniversary (Tuesday through Oct. 14) Ahead of the industry curve at the dawn of digitization, and always inclined toward the sleekest sort of populism, GRP is now a white dwarf in the constellation known as the Verve Music Group. But that hasn't prevented one of its founders, the keyboardist and composer Dave Grusin, from convening this anniversary band, with several former staples of the roster: the guitarist Lee Ritenour, the bassist John Patitucci and the former Yellowjackets drummer Will Kennedy, and (starting on Thursday) the singer Diane Schuur. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum ($45 and $30 on weekends.) (Chinen)
Brian Charette Music for Organ Sextette (Thursday) The Hammond B-3 organist Brian Charette weighs the ageless objective of soul-jazz with a trace of restless modernity. His band features Jay Collins on flute, Mike DiRubbo on alto saxophone, Kenny Brooks on tenor saxophone, Doug Yates on bass clarinet and Jochen Rueckert on drums. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; $10. (Chinen)
Bill Charlap Trio (Tuesday through Oct. 21) The pianist Bill Charlap, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington make up this spit-and-polish trio, which favors a crisp approach to standard songbook fare. As has been its custom at the Village Vanguard in recent years, the group hunkers down for a two-week engagement, except on Monday nights, which belong to the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Coca-Cola Generations in Jazz Festival (Friday through Sunday) This annual festival concludes with a group fittingly called Generations in Swing, featuring the trumpeter Marcus Printup and the baritone saxophonist Gary Smulyan, among others. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 to $40, $15 for select sets for students, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)
Emmet Cohen Trio (Thursday) Emmet Cohen, the second runner-up in last year's Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition, is a pianist of disarming harmonic sophistication, given that he's still in his early 20s. ''In the Element,'' his self-released recent debut, bears a few traces of unsteady youth, but much promise -- and in some ways it's probably already outdated. Mr. Cohen appears here with a young rhythm team consisting of the bassist Russell Hall and the drummer Evan Sherman. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $10 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Ravi Coltrane Quartet (Friday through Sunday) The implicit hope for ''Spirit Fiction,'' Ravi Coltrane's Blue Note debut, was that it would represent a clear step forward. And by that token Mr. Coltrane, an unflappable tenor and soprano saxophonist, succeeded handsomely, spotlighting both his longtime quartet and a reunited cohort from his past. This engagement presents neither of those, instead featuring a new band with the excellent young Cuban pianist David Virelles, the stalwart bassist Robert Hurst and the nimble drummer Greg Hutchinson. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Neil Cowley Trio (Thursday) In his native Britain, the savvy pianist and composer Neil Cowley is well known for bridging the chasm between jazz and pop: you have heard him, no doubt, on Adele's blockbuster ''21,'' and maybe with the Brand New Heavies before that. He kicks off his own first United States tour with this one-nighter, featuring the same adaptable trio found on his prepossessing new album, ''The Face of Mount Molehill'' (Naim Jazz). At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $25. (Chinen)
Aaron Diehl Quartet Featuring Warren Wolf (Tuesday) A smart young pianist with a fastidious grasp of jazz traditions, Aaron Diehl seems likely to turn his attention here to the music of the Modern Jazz Quartet. In any case it's the repertory mission he was tasked with the last time he used a personnel of Mr. Wolf on vibraphone, David Wong on bass and Rodney Green on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)
Philip Dizack (Friday) An intense young trumpeter of power and precision, Philip Dizack celebrates the release of ''End of an Era'' (Truth Revolution), his pointedly contemporary second album, with a cast that includes the pianist Eden Ladin, the bassist Linda Oh and the drummer Justin Brown, along with a coterie of strings led by the violist Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. At 8 p.m., Drom, 85 Avenue A, at Fifth Street, East Village, (212) 777-1157, dromnyc.com; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Chinen)
Peter Evans / John Eckhardt's 'Xylobiont' (Thursday) Mr. Evans, a trumpeter with a dazzlingly expressive command of timbre and texture, and Mr. Eckhardt, a bassist of similar technical reserves, perform alone and together as part of the Interpretations series at Roulette. Mr. Evans has worked extensively with solo improvisation; as for Mr. Eckhardt, he recently released a solo bass album, ''Xylobiont'' (Psi). At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for members and students. (Chinen)
Festival of New Trumpet Music (Friday through Sunday) This festival closes its 10th anniversary edition at the Jazz Standard, with a different group each night. On Friday the serious-minded trumpeter and composer Charles Tolliver leads a revamped version of his band Music Inc., featuring Bruce Davis on guitar, Xavier Davis on piano, Devin Starks on bass and Gene Jackson on drums. On Saturday another post-bop veteran, Tom Harrell, presents a promisingly lean quartet with the saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Adam Cruz. And on Sunday the Brazilian ace Claudio Roditi joins the West Point Jazz Knights Big Band, in a pair of free sets. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 on Friday and Saturday, free on Sunday. (Chinen)
Marcus Gilmore Ether (Friday and Saturday) Marcus Gilmore is one of the leading younger jazz drummers of his generation, magically adept at pairing a floating, semiabstract feeling with undeniable rhythmic undertow. Ether, the name of his new trio, seems to hint at insubstantiality, but that surely won't be the case -- not on Mr. Gilmore's watch, and not with the partners he has picked: the bassist Stephen Bruner, known in funk and electronic-music circles as Thundercat, and the pianist David Bryant. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)
Vince Giordano and Catherine Russell (Wednesday) The Sidney Bechet Society, a clearinghouse for traditional jazz in New York City, begins its 15th concert season with this appropriate double bill. Its headliner is Mr. Giordano, an impeccable throwback who keeps his band, the Nighthawks, in fighting trim with a regular gig at Sophia's Restaurant (every Monday and Tuesday); also on board is Ms. Russell, a jazz singer with a husky tone but a bright temperament, with a band that includes the venerable jazz impresario George Wein on piano. At 7:15 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448, kayeplayhouse.hunter.cuny.edu; $35, $10 for students. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Jim Hall Quartet (Friday and Saturday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quietly imposing hero of jazz guitar. He appears with an on-again, off-again band, featuring the alto saxophonist Greg Osby, the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Joey Baron: to a man, musicians of purpose and personality. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Joel Harrison's String Choir (Friday) The prolific guitarist and composer Joel Harrison uses this ensemble to explore the compositions of the drummer Paul Motian, which can convey shadowy depths even as they echo the simplicity of folk songs. Before Motian's death last year, the group -- which includes another accomplished guitarist, Liberty Ellman, and an improvising string quartet -- released a gorgeous album on Sunnyside, from which it will draw here. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, greenwichhouse.org; $12, $10 for students. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Jazz for Obama 2012: The Jazz Concert for America's Future (Tuesday) Organized by the pianist Aaron Goldberg, who has done similar work during each recent presidential election, this benefit concert will involve an impressive roster of jazz talent, including the guitarist Jim Hall; the drummers Roy Haynes and Jeff (Tain) Watts; the bassists Ron Carter and Christian McBride; the singers Dee Dee Bridgewater, Claudia Acuña and Gretchen Parlato; the pianists Kenny Barron, Geri Allen and Arturo O'Farrill; and the saxophonists Jimmy Heath, Kenny Garrett, Joe Lovano and Ravi Coltrane.

&#x2605; Irvin Mayfield and the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra (Monday) Mr. Mayfield, a trumpeter and composer from New Orleans, formed his flagship large ensemble 10 years ago, with a roughly equal emphasis on modernity and history. The band, which won a Grammy in 2010, performs an anniversary concert laden with guests, including the saxophonist Branford Marsalis; the artfully adaptable singers Aaron Neville and Dee Dee Bridgewater; the Sphinx Virtuosi chamber orchestra; and two popular former ''American Idol'' finalists, Haley Reinhart and Casey Abrams. At 8 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $35 to $125. (Chinen)
Christian McBride and Inside Straight (Saturday) On ''Kind of Brown,'' released on Mack Avenue in 2009, Mr. McBride, an effortlessly charismatic bassist, focused on his steamroller version of the hard-bop tradition. He has kept the album's band working, and now he opens the new jazz series at Miller Theater with it: Steve Wilson on saxophones, Warren Wolf on vibraphone, Peter Martin on piano and Carl Allen on drums. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $25 to $30, students $15 to $18. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Brad Mehldau (Friday and Saturday) In his solo piano recitals Mr. Mehldau blends judicious pop offerings, archaic songbook standards and intricate originals, employing a touch that runs from sprightly to somber. He has worked extensively in the format, and it should be a natural fit for Jazz at Lincoln Center's most urbane and romantic room. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $65. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Matt Mitchell Trio / Patrick Cornelius Quintet (Tuesday) Matt Mitchell, a probing pianist of fluid technique, plays the 10:30 p.m. set in this installment of the Konceptions series, leading a sharp working trio with the bassist Chris Tordini and the drummer Dan Weiss. An earlier set, at 9 p.m., will feature the expressive young tenor saxophonist Patrick Cornelius, previewing material from a forthcoming album, with Frank Kimbrough on piano, Peter Slavov on bass and Colin Stranahan on drums. At Korzo, 667 Fifth Avenue, at 20th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 499-1199, myspace.com/konceptions; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)

Organ Monk (Saturday and Tuesday through Thursday) Led by the Hammond B-3 organist Greg Lewis, Organ Monk puts an intelligent soul-jazz spin on the music of Thelonious Monk. The group is especially busy this month, playing Tuesday nights with the saxophonist Reggie Woods at Sapphire, the gentlemen's club, and Wednesday nights with the singer Sweet Georgia Brown at the Lenox Lounge. Mr. Lewis and crew will also play on Saturday with the saxophonist T. K. Blue at Sistas' Place in Brooklyn; and on Thursday at Showman's in Harlem. A complete lineup is at greglewismusic.com. Saturday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sistas' Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766, sistasplace.org; $20 in advance, $25 at the door.

Radio Zero at Sycamore (Monday) This weekly series has been programmed through October by the tenor saxophonist Adam Schneit, who features his own group -- with Dave Miller on guitar, Eivind Opsvik on bass and Devin Drobka on drums -- in a set at 9:30 p.m. An earlier set, at 8:30 p.m., will have Mr. Opsvik playing a solo bass recital, mainly featuring his own compositions. At Sycamore, 1118 Cortelyou Road, Brooklyn, (347) 240-5850, sycamorebrooklyn.com; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)
Adam Rudolph's Go: Organic Orchestra (Monday) This meditative large ensemble, scheduled to perform at Roulette every Monday night this month, is a project of the open-minded percussionist, composer and conductor Adam Rudolph. Drawing inspiration from earthy and elemental sources, it features a diverse whorl of woodwinds, strings, percussion, electronics and guitars. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for members and students. (Chinen)
&#x2605; John Scofield Trio (Friday through Sunday) Low key and temperate enough to be an easy-listening record, ''A Moment's Peace'' (Emarcy) -- the most recent album by the guitarist John Scofield, encompassing standards of jazz and pop -- nevertheless simmers with intent. The energy onstage should suggest more of a rolling boil, as Mr. Scofield reconnects with one of his best working bands, an alert and soulful trio featuring the bassist Steve Swallow and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
Stranahan / Zaleski / Rosato (Thursday) This young cooperative -- the drummer Colin Stranahan, the pianist Glenn Zaleski and the bassist Rick Rosato -- recently released an estimable album, ''Anticipation'' (Capri). Its meticulously flowing sound reflects a sizable debt to the original Brad Mehldau Trio, but with a few personal modifications, which seem likely to shine clearer in person. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $15, $10 for members in the first set; $10, $5 for members in the second set. (Chinen)
Trio Hornito (Wednesday) The name has volcanic implications, which seems about right for this improv collective, consisting of the Oscar Noriega on saxophone and clarinet, Brandon Seabrook on guitar and banjo and Tom Rainey on drums. But each musician knows how to temper a superheated outflow with pockets of cool reserve, and the tension involved could be riveting. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (347) 422-0248, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)
Robin Verheyen (Wednesday) An accomplished young tenor and soprano saxophonist from Belgium, Mr. Verheyen is in good company here, leading a group with the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Jeff Davis. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)
Cedar Walton Trio (Friday and Saturday) Clarity has always been the core principle of Cedar Walton's pianism, and a steadying force in his unpretentious but fastidious compositions. He leads a trio with the bassist David Williams and the drummer George Fludas, both adept with a pulse of swinging ease. At 8 and 10 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover. (Chinen)

HEADLINE: Retail Sales and Jobs Data Lift Shares

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
An encouraging report on the labor market and better sales at Costco and other retail stores helped push the stock market higher on Thursday.
The government said that 367,000 Americans sought unemployment benefits for the first time last week, an increase from the previous week but fewer than economists had forecast. 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 80.75 points, or 0.60 percent, to close at 13,575.36. Alcoa, the aluminum producer, led the 30 stocks in the Dow with a 3.3 percent gain, rising 29 cents to $9.07.
''It's not just the jobless claims numbers on their own,'' said Brian Gendreau, market strategist at the Cetera Financial Group. Mr. Gendreau cited manufacturing and service sector reports that were better than expected this week, as well
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 10.41 points, or 0.72 percent, to 1,461.40. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.23 points, or 0.45 percent, to 3,149.46.
Factory orders reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday were better than forecast, even though the 5.2 percent drop in orders was the biggest in more than three years.
Costco and other retail chain stores reported September sales that were ahead of Wall Street's estimates. Costco gained $1.86, to $101.48. Target rose 56 cents, to $63.65.
The stock market barely moved after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve board's meeting last month, when the Fed developed a new open-ended program to spend $40 billion a month buying mortgage bonds. The minutes revealed that all but one member -- Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve of Richmond, Va. -- of the Fed's interest-rate committee voted in favor of the bond-buying effort.
The most important event this week comes Friday morning when the Labor Department releases its monthly jobs report. Economists predict that the unemployment rate inched up to 8.2 percent in September from 8.1 percent in August.
The major stock market indexes have climbed steadily to start October. The Dow rose 78 points Monday after the Institute for Supply Management said its gauge of manufacturing rose in September for the first time in four months. For the month, the Dow is 1 percent higher and the S.& P. 500 is up 1.4 percent.
Among stocks making big moves, Google rose $5.55, to $768.05. Google and publishers in the United States announced they had settled a seven-year dispute over Google's book-scanning project. A lawsuit filed by authors remains, though.
Sprint Nextel sank 2 percent, or 11 cents, to $5.09. Reports said the wireless carrier might make a competing bid for MetroPCS Communications. That would pit Sprint against Deutsche Telekom, which plans to merge MetroPCS with its T-Mobile USA unit.
Avery Dennison's stock fell $1.38, to $30.07, after news that 3M dissolved an agreement to buy Avery Dennison's office and consumer products division. The Justice Department had threatened to block the deal, saying that the sale to 3M, the maker of Post-it notes, would curtail competition in the market for sticky labels.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32, to 99 18/32, and the yield rose to 1.67 percent from 1.62 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Fall to a Record Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Average rates on fixed mortgages fell to fresh record lows for the second straight week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said Thuerasday. 
Freddie Mac said the rate on the 30-year loan dropped to 3.36 percent, down from last week's rate of 3.40 percent, which was the lowest since long-term mortgages began in the 1950s.
The average on the 15-year fixed mortgage, a popular refinancing option, dipped to 2.69 percent, down from last week's record low of 2.73 percent.
Rates are falling after the Federal Reserve started buying mortgage bonds to help strengthen a housing recovery that began earlier this year. The Fed plans to continue the program until there is substantial improvement in the job market.
Sales of both previously occupied and newly built homes are up from last year. Home prices are rising more consistently. And builders are more confident in the market and are starting to build more homes.
Lower rates are also driving more people to refinance. Mortgage applications surged 16.6 percent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Wednesday. Of those applications, 83 percent were to refinance existing loans.
Still, some economists question whether a further decline in rates will make much of a difference. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has been below 4 percent since early December. Yet home sales remain below healthy levels. And most people who can qualify have likely already taken advantage of the lower rates.
Many people who would like to refinance or buy a home can't because they fail to meet stricter lending requirements or don't have enough money to make a down payment.

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'Arbitrage' (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki's sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis) 
'Barfi!' (No rating, 2:05, in Hindi) This engagingly odd Hindi romantic comedy stars Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra: He's deaf and mute; she's autistic; they fall in love. Featuring long sequences with minimal or no dialogue, the movie, written and directed by Anurag Basu, sometimes seems mawkish and the comedy tends toward pathos. But ''Barfi!'' is also a particularly pure expression of one Bollywood's most cherished themes: love conquers all. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
'The Bourne Legacy' (PG-13, 2:05) Less a thrilling franchise reboot than a solid salvage mission, the fourth installment of the ''Bourne'' spy series replaces Matt Damon with a sympathetic Jeremy Renner, who handles the action persuasively even if the fight sequences lack a sense of regret or even sorrow. As viewers are whisked from location to location, it feels as if the director, Tony Gilroy, is trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of the previous films. (Dargis)
'The Campaign' (R, 1:25) Two nincompoops run against each other for a seat in Congress. It's not a documentary, but a silly, not very outrageous comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel' (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)
'Dredd 3D' (R, 1:35) Alex Garland wrote and Pete Travis directed this grim, gory adaptation of the British comic series. The setting is a neo-wild West in which the gizmos look futuristic, but everything else is B-movie familiar. Karl Urban stars. (Dargis)
'End of Watch' (R, 1:49) David Ayer's ode to beat cops and the expansive literature on them is a muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. (Dargis)
'The Expendables 2' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone returns with his band of aging action stars and a ridiculous amount of ammunition and explosives, bent on avenging a comrade's death and keeping some plutonium out of evil hands. A brief appearance by Chuck Norris provides the best moment of self-parody in a movie that could have used a few more of them. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Harvest of Empire' (No rating, 1:30, in English and Spanish) This fact-filled documentary works as a civics lesson and has a punch that comes from political advocacy. Directed by Peter Getzels and Eduardo López, it has two clear missions: to combat anti-immigrant feeling and to show how migration from Latin America has been spurred by the sometimes violent intervention of the United States. (Saltz)
'Hope Springs' (PG-13, 1:32) While this film about a longtime marriage that's gone dry has modest charms to go with its well-matched and practiced pair of wily scene stealers -- Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones working on screen together for the first time -- the industry will have to do better if it wants to convince boomers that there's something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clichés. (Dargis)
'Hotel Transylvania' (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially ''The Little Mermaid'' with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she's 118) daughter in a hotel that's exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. There's some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over. (Genzlinger)
'House at the End of the Street' (PG-13, 1:41) Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue star in this blatant unscary rip-off of ''Psycho,'' an incoherent hybrid of that Hitchcock classic and standard teenage horror films. (Stephen Holden)
&#x2605; 'How to Survive a Plague' (No rating, 1:50) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France's inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Looper' (R, 1:58) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a killer and Bruce Willis plays an older version of the same in Rian Johnson's obstreperously entertaining science-fiction pastiche set in a futuristic world that sometimes looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
'My Life as Abraham Lincoln' (No rating, 1:27) Shari Berman's dramedy about a beleaguered New Yorker (the appealing, accessible Caroline Luft) is an abstract stew in which truth (about people, about events) proves constantly elusive. But Ken Lampl's score and camerawork by Ms. Berman's husband, Chris Benker, add welcome elegant layers. Ms. Berman can be funny; it's intriguing to imagine what she could do with a tighter, more linear script. (Andy Webster)
'Now, Forager' (No rating, 1:33) Jason Cortlund and Julia Halperin's uneven, slow-brewed film focuses on a mushroom-picking couple of food professionals whose stubborn devotion to their discipline outlasts their attachment to each other. (Nicolas Rapold)
'The Other Dream Team' (No rating, 1:29) This crowded, undisciplined documentary by Marius Markevicius merges political history, sports mania and the Grateful Dead into a triumphant timeline detailing the role of basketball in releasing Lithuania from Soviet oppression and sportswear obscurity. (Catsoulis)
'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who's rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)
'Pitch Perfect' (PG-13, 1:52) This comedy about a female collegiate a cappella group feels as if it's aimed at tweeners, which is too bad because that saddles it with dopey plot elements -- daddy issues, boyfriend issues -- that prevent a more substantive look at this rich genre of music. A few of the songs, though, rock. (Genzlinger)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Resident Evil: Retribution' (R, 1:35) Taking place almost entirely inside airless, computer-simulated locations, this fifth entry in the series finds its caffeinated heroine (Milla Jovovich) still battling zombies, still wearing bondage gear, only now with a daughter -- shamelessly cribbing from ''Aliens'' -- and an alternate suburban reality to protect. (Catsoulis)
'Robot & Frank' (PG-13, 1:30) Jake Schreier directed, from a script by Christopher D. Ford, this eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent (Frank Langella), his robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) and some awkwardly managed truths about old age. Susan Sarandon also stars. (Dargis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
'Stars in Shorts' (No rating, 1:48) The most consistent pleasures in this anthology of seven short comic films derive more from the performances (by Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Judi Dench, Lily Tomlin and others) than from storytelling. (Holden)
'Tales of the Night' (No rating, 1:24) The French animator Michel Ocelot again gives familiar folk tales a modest, charming, stylized spin with this film, which offers six stories from different cultures, some ending with a twist. Silhouettes evoke shadow plays, and often brilliant palettes reflect the regions represented. ''Tales'' happens to be Mr. Ocelot's first foray into 3-D. But his gentle sensibility yields abundant pleasures by itself. (Webster)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voice-over skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg) and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (A.O. Scott)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Trouble With the Curve' (PG-13, 1:51) The latest of Clint Eastwood's grumpy old men is Gus Lobel, a Major League Baseball scout struggling with failing eyesight and a front office full of number-crunching ''Moneyball'' types. On a trip to North Carolina to check out a promising young slugger, Gus and his semi-estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), do some squabbling and some healing. Mickey, a big-city lawyer, also dabbles in romance with a rival (and former protégé) of her dad's played by Justin Timberlake. The movie, directed by Mr. Eastwood's protégé Robert Lorenz, is hokey and predictable -- the very title is a spoiler -- but it is also full of warmth, humor and wonderful performances. (Scott)
'2016: Obama's America' (PG, 1:33) Dinesh D'Souza -- the author of the best seller ''The Roots of Obama's Rage'' and a former American Enterprise Institute fellow -- is the host and narrator of this strident documentary, in which Mr. D'Souza enlists a host of interviewees who are almost entirely critical of the president. The film is unlikely to convert supporters of President Obama to an opposite view. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'The Waiting Room' (No rating, 1:21) The crowded emergency room of Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., is the setting of Peter Nicks's wrenching documentary. With no narrator, titles, statistical analysis or overt editorializing, the film observes a typical 24 hours during which nearly 250 patients, most of them uninsured, pour into the hospital. (Holden)
'Won't Back Down' (PG, 2:00) Two moms, Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal, team up to fight a teachers' union in the name of ''the kids.'' This exercise in educational-reform propaganda, directed by Daniel Barnz, is somewhat amusing in the way it turns the traditional strike drama on its head, but it is so strident and tone-deaf that even those who sympathize with its anti-labor views -- to say nothing of the union members who make up the cast -- may find themselves embarrassed. (Scott)
'The Yakuza and the Mermaid' (No rating, 1:41) Mashing fiction and reality into a weirded-out tale of a novelist (Peter Hertsgaard) and his slinky muse (Georgiana Avram), Chris Benker's ode to tortured creativity is an uneven blend of jazzy colors and flat conversations. (Catsoulis)
Film Series
Apocalypse Soon (Friday through Sunday) Kick back, relax and enjoy the end of the world in three films from the genre first made popular by the Book of Revelation. The selection, presented by BAMcinématek, includes Thom E. Eberhardt's 1984 cult favorite, ''Night of the Comet'' (Friday), in which two determined valley girls (Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney) make the best of new shopping opportunities; George Miller's hard-charging 1979 ''Mad Max,'' with Mel Gibson as the ultimate highway patrolman (Saturday); and the genre's towering achievement, Alfred Hitchcock's enigmatically allegorical 1963 ''The Birds'' (Sunday). BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)
Kenji Misumi (Friday through Oct. 14) As a director of the Japanese swordplay films known as chanbara, Kenji Misumi introduced both the long-running Zatoichi series, about a philosophical blind swordsman, and the ''Lone Wolf and Cub'' films, which became notorious for their geysers of blood. This brief survey of his work, presented by the Museum of the Moving Image in collaboration with the Japan Foundation, offers 7 of his 50-odd films spread over two weekends, including the foundational 1962 ''Tale of Zatoichi'' (Friday at 7 p.m.) as well as some of his lesser-known, nonseries work. Highlights include the 1962 ''Destiny's Son'' (Saturday at 2 p.m.), filmed in color and wide-screen from a screenplay by Kaneto Shindo (''Onibaba''), which many scholars of Japanese film consider to be his masterpiece, and the 1967 Edo-period melodrama ''The Homely Sister'' (Oct. 13 at 4 p.m.), one of several female-centered movies that earned Misumi the nickname Little Mizoguchi. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $12. (Kehr)
'Wake in Fright' (Friday through Thursday) Released the same year (1971) as Sam Peckinpah's ''Straw Dogs,'' Ted Kotcheff's film (originally shown in the United States as ''Outback'') offers an even more extreme interpretation of the theme of the urban intellectual versus the rural primitive, here in the form of a schoolteacher (Gary Bond) forced to lay over in an Australian settlement populated by a tribe of macho men. The leader is played, in his final film role, by the Australian national icon Chips Rafferty (the prototype for Crocodile Dundee), adding an extra level of subversion to this astounding film, directed by a visiting Canadian, Mr. Kotcheff (''The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz''). Mr. Kotcheff will attend the 7:30 p.m. screenings on Friday and Saturday. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, Greenwich Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org, $12.50. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: U.S. Justice In Collision With Foreign Fraud

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Ross H. Mandell was accused of running what amounted to a boiler room in Florida, peddling stocks that were overvalued at best, and fraudulent at worst, to customers who were told lies. When some of them tried to sell the securities, he would not let them do so. They lost, and he made, more than $50 million from the scam, the government said.
This spring he was convicted of securities fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Judge Paul A. Crotty of the United States District Court in Lower Manhattan ordered him sent to prison immediately and directed him to forfeit $50 million.
But now he seems likely to have his convictions overturned. The prestigious Association of the Bar of the City of New York has filed a brief with the appeals court in his support, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ordered him freed on bail pending appeal. 
Why? He showed what turned out to be good judgment in both whom he defrauded, and where. Most of the victims were British, and the securities were traded in London, not New York.
In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that a civil suit contending securities fraud could not proceed because the law did not apply to foreign transactions. In that case, Morrison v. National Australia Bank, foreign shareholders were suing a foreign bank whose share price had plummeted when it was disclosed the bank was taking a big loss caused by its American mortgage business. That bank's securities did not trade in the United States.
The case has become known as the ''3-F'' ruling, at least in securities law circles. Foreign issuer, foreign investors and foreign trading added up to no American jurisdiction. The fact that some of the supposedly deceptive statements were made in United States was not enough for the court, which said Congress had not authorized the application of that statute to crimes committed outside the United States.
''It is a rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all conduct with United States territory,'' wrote Justice Antonin Scalia. ''But the presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.''
The Supreme Court opinion was quiet as to whether it also applied to criminal cases; that is the issue in a number of pending appeals.
The government argues that it does not. But the Second Circuit Court seems to be poised to rule that it does. In another case, the appeals court this week ordered the release on bail of Alberto W. Vilar, the former head of Amerindo investments, who was convicted of securities fraud in 2008. His lawyers argued that the Morrison precedent made it highly likely that he would win his appeal.
In his appeal, Mr. Mandell argues all of the claimed American victims who testified at his trial conducted their trades so long ago that the statute of limitations bars charging him with crimes for those trades, and that the rest were British. His lawyers say the Morrison case requires that the conviction be overturned.
It is at least conceivable that the mail fraud and wire fraud convictions could stand even if the securities fraud conviction did not. In a concurring opinion in Morrison, Justice Stephen Breyer said as much. But it was not clear that the majority would agree.
The government argues that Section 10(b) of the securities act may apply in criminal cases ''even if the transactions at issue were executed overseas.''
It is that argument that drew the opposition from the city bar association's white-collar crime committee. The government's position ''that Section 10(b) can simultaneously have two authoritative constructions -- an extraterritorial reading that applies in criminal cases, and a purely domestic one that applies in civil cases -- is mistaken,'' argues the brief filed by the committee's chairman, John F. Savarese, a partner in Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
If Mr. Mandell's conviction is overturned and he goes free, one of the more colorful securities law violators will be back on the scene. As far back as 1995, he was suspended from the New York Stock Exchange for unauthorized trading. He later attributed those problems to drug usage.
Aware of his background, American regulators required Sky Capital, Mr. Mandell's brokerage firm, to promise that he would have no supervisory authority. The government says he ignored that promise.
Sky Capital went public in Britain in 2002 and was traded on London's Alternative Investment Market, where there are fewer rules than on other markets. The charges say that stock was one of the securities used to defraud investors, with Mr. Mandell promising some investors that the price would double. The shares have not traded since 2006.
In 2009, he says, he was days away from starting a ''mixed martial arts franchise,'' only to have it delayed after he was indicted. He then tried to sell his life story -- including the trial -- as a reality television show. In the show's trailer, he proclaimed his innocence and determination to fight the charges.
''Always a fighter, ready to face any challenge, Ross Mandell continues to live his life as a husband to his wife, a father to his children, and as an entrepreneur, who is free on $5 million bail. He is a defendant facing criminal charges, the subject of a new reality television show and a recovering alcoholic with 19 years sobriety. Ross Mandell has got a lot on the line, a lot to lose and a lot to live for as the drama continues to unfold in this real life saga,'' says the pitch accompanying the video, which is posted on YouTube.
Mr. Mandell did not respond to an interview request. His lawyer said he would have no comment.
His Web site asks those visiting there to vote on his innocence or guilt, and 1,000 have, with a small majority saying he is innocent.
The jury in federal court, however, was unanimous in finding him guilty. He evidently continues to live large. His video shows him driving an expensive sports car in Boca Raton, Fla., proclaiming ''I have a perfect life.''
The government says the money he gained from defrauding investors paid for ''first-class flights, five-star hotel suites, expensive meals, adult entertainment and personal spending,'' even though his firm was losing money. It says some of the money was used for ''work done on Mandell's penthouse apartment at Trump U.N. Plaza'' in Manhattan.
The Supreme Court opinion in Morrison was based on its reading of the Securities Act, and the court made clear that Congress could change the law if it wished.
If the courts free Mr. Mandell, and Congress does not act, the government will be sending an unfortunate message to foreign investors: If American brokers defraud Americans, the government can prosecute them. But if they defraud foreigners, and arrange to have the fraudulent securities traded overseas, there is nothing the American government will do about it.
