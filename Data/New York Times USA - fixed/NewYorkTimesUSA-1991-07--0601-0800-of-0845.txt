HEADLINE: Administration Errs on Taxes, Kemp Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp said today that the Bush Administration was wrong in predicting that tax breaks for businesses that locate in poor areas would lose revenue for the Government.
"It is my opinion that enterprise zones will actually increase Government revenues by spawning new business and by putting unemployed people and resources back to work and back on the tax rolls," Mr. Kemp told the Senate Small Business Committee. 
 President Bush, like President Ronald Reagan, has urged creation of enterprise zones for a decade. Employers that locate in selected blighted areas would be forgiven capital-gains taxes and be allowed an immediate tax deduction of up to $50,000 a year for spending on equipment. Workers would get a tax credit on part of their wages.
The White House Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation have forecast that creation of those enterprise zones would cost as much as $1.8 billion over five years.
Mr. Kemp also disagreed with many in the Administration who say the economy is already recovering from recession.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Higher; Gold Down $3 in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the major currencies yesterday in thin, uninspired trading.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery dropped $3 an ounce, to $367.60. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $367.35, off $3.05 from late Friday. 
 Currency dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range and ended slightly higher as the market corrected itself from Friday's drop.
"It was very thin trading, very quiet, with just a little profit taking," said Karen Kluge, a corporate adviser for foreign-exchange trading at Credit Suisse in New York.
John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Algemene Banc Nederland in New York, said the market was being driven by technical considerations.
"I think we need another round of news positive about the U.S." economy before the dollar is pushed higher, he said.
Economic indicators due later this week include durable-goods orders for June, mid-July auto sales and the Government's first report on the gross national product for the second quarter. Reports indicating strength in the economy would prop up interest rates and make the dollar more valuable.
In New York, the dollar gained 1.25 Japanese yen to close at 137.65 yen. Mr. McCarthy said the yen remained weak in the face of the country's brokerage scandal.
Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar slipped 0.45 yen, to close at 136.65 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 137.43 yen.
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.6795, from $1.69425 late Friday. In London, it slipped to $1.681, from $1.69.
Against the German mark, the dollar rose in New York to 1.762 marks, from 1.748.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.5255 Swiss francs, up from 1.51125; 5.9805 French francs, up from 5.9360; 1,311.875 Italian lire, up from 1,303.75, and 1.15475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15975.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $369.90 an ounce, from $370.25 late Friday. In Zurich, gold's closing bid was $369.85, down from $370 on Friday. Gold in Hong Kong rose 67 cents, to close at $370.52.
Silver for current delivery fell 6.1 cents on New York's Comex, to $4.325 a troy ounce. Silver also fell in London, to a late bid price of $4.39, from $4.40.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Late Premed Programs for Graduates

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
LIBERAL arts graduates unhappy in or out of the job market, nurses, engineers and others interested in midcareer changes can become doctors if they have the dedication, persistence and enthusiasm, plus a respectable scholastic average. Many are doing just that, as schools that have had programs in place for some time have noticed a large increase in applicants since the beginning of the recession.
For the last few years, Goucher College in Towson, Md., has had a premed program intended for such persons, and especially for liberal arts majors who decide they would like to become doctors after working at other jobs following college graduation. 
 "We have an 87 percent placement success in medical schools," Barbara Berkowitz, director of Goucher's post-baccalaureate premedical program, said recently.
She works closely with Dr. George Delahunty, associate professor of biology, in processing and selecting candidates for the program, which requires eight intensive semester courses in basic sciences starting in June and continuing for a year. Those who took basic sciences in their undergraduate programs can have some required courses waived, but they must then take more advanced science courses to make up the semester hours.
"We prefer liberal arts majors, art, English, psychology, music and others," she said, "although we have taken nurses, physicians' assistants and electrical engineers into the program who do offer some science courses."
Other premed programs are available for such career changes, most notably one at Bryn Mawr College, near Philadelphia, which this year has 55 students. Goucher has 26.
The Goucher program takes a liberal view of scores achieved on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests. Entry requirements for Bryn Mawr's program are more stringent. Goucher likes combined marks of 1,100 or more, along with a good scholastic record of around a B average. But it has accepted students offering combined marks of 950, considered quite low in terms of the aptitude tests, which measure verbal and mathematics skills.
"We use our intuition about accepting students for the program," Mrs. Berkowitz said. "Some talented people do have low S.A.T. marks, but maybe they have better sensitivity. As long as they can do the work, such as passing two semesters of organic chemistry, we don't object to the lower marks." In some instances, students do have good college marks but do not fare well in the exam-taking.
Sometimes she urges prospective students to "wait a year and do volunteer work in a medical setting" to be sure they are really interested.
This year's class, which began studies in June, consists mostly of women. "Sometimes the classes are 50-50," she said, "but this year we have 21 women and 5 men."
She does not know why so many women applied and were accepted this year, but she suggested that perhaps more women have become disenchanted with working for corporations or have had difficulty finding jobs because of the recession.
"We have no nurses this year, but we did last year," she said. "It's a relatively young class this year with ages ranging from 22 to 38 years, and we have taken some students in past years as old as 46." The program has no limit on age for entry.
About half a dozen of this year's students recently graduated from college, and another half a dozen have been out of college about a year. "We have majors in English, fine arts, Russian literature and language, mathematics and psychology in the current class, she said. "We have had a Ph.D. in anthropology, several computer science majors and some Peace Corps workers in past years, as well as many children or other relatives of doctors."
The current class started by taking "a very intense" summer course, which is the equivalent of two semesters of basic chemistry, called Principles of Chemistry. Then in the fall and spring semesters the students continue taking basic sciences -- two semesters of physics, two of biology and two of organic chemistry.
An advantage, Mrs. Berkowitz believes, is that all of the premed students take courses together as a cohesive group, and not with undergraduates. It makes for strong and enduring friendships among the group, she said, adding, "That is a good marketing point for us."
In January, she said, it is recommended that all the students get some "hands on" experience in a hospital. "We have a working arrangement with the University of Maryland Medical Health System to provide them with such experience," she explained.
In the spring, the students take review sessions for the medical college aptitude tests required for admission to medical school.
As for costs, she estimates the total for the year at somewhat more than $15,000. The tuition is $10,400, and Mrs. Berkowitz suggested that by sharing apartments and brown-bagging lunches a student could get along on another $5,000 for rent and food.

HEADLINE: Sandinistas Shed a Bit of Their Past

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, July 22

 BODY:
The Sandinista Front took the first tentative steps toward giving up its leftist guerrilla past to create the structure of a democratic political party during a congress that ended on Sunday night.
But the existing leadership retained control and fought off the demands of dissidents for profound changes, both in the internal structure of the party and in its ideology and world view. 
 While dropping references in the organizational documents to being a Marxist-Leninist party, the nearly 600 delegates decided to continue calling their party socialist, revolutionary and anti-imperialist.
After three days of debate, the delegates voted to retain in the nine-member National Directorate most of the former guerrilla commanders who dominated Nicaragua in the nearly 11 years the Sandinistas held power.
 
Ortega to Lead Party
 Daniel Ortega Saavedra, who served as President of Nicaragua until losing last year's elections to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and a broad opposition coalition, was elected to serve as secretary general in addition to continuing on the Directorate.
Two longtime members of the Sandinista inner circle who had not previously been on the Directorate -- Sergio Ramirez Mercado and Rene Nunez Tellez -- were elected to replace Gen. Humberto Ortega, who had resigned as a condition of his remaining army commander under the Chamorro Government, and Mr. Nunez's brother Carlos, who died of cancer last October.
Tomas Borge, the last surviving founder of the Sandinista Front, who was Interior Minister and head of the secret police during the years in power, argued that conditions in the party and the country were not right to replace the original leadership.
 
'Economic or Political Errors'
 Dismissing the demands of many party members to vote for members of the Directorate on an individual basis, Mr. Borge said that "if it is necessary to judge economic or political errors then the Directorate should be judged in its entirety."
The single slate for the Directorate emerged from congresses held earlier in the country's 17 departments. There was opposition to the single slate concept in some of the departmental congresses, especially in the capital, but it was always in the minority.
In the report of the National Directorate, the leadership recognized that many of its policies while in power had created the dissatisfaction among voters that led to the Sandinistas' defeat in 1990.
But Mr. Ortega asserted that the Sandinista Government had been forced to undertake land seizures, price controls and other unpopular economic measures in response to the guerrilla war mounted by United States-backed contras. The report closed with a continued rejection of capitalism and said the Sandinistas would continue to seek "a new economic-social model."
Rafael Solis, a longtime leader of the Sandinista parliamentary delegation and now a leading dissident, said in a long interview published in the newspaper El Nuevo Diario that blaming the contra war on foreign intervention had been "part of the rhetoric and our propaganda," adding that even though the contras received help from the United States the Sandinistas had been aided by the Soviet Union.

Banco de Santander C.D.'s Are Rated AA by S.& P.

 BODY:
Banco de Santander, the Spanish bank that recently purchased a large financial interest in New Jersey's largest bank, has been given an AA rating on its long-term certificates of deposit from the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the rating agency. The agency also affirmed the A-1+ rating on the bank's commercial paper.
At the same time, the subordinate debt of the bank's wholly owned subsidiary, Banco Santander Puerto Rico, has been raised to a AA- from an A+. The certificates of deposit of the Puerto Rican subsidiary also were raised to AA/A-1+ from AA-/ A-1+, affecting about $40 million of the subsidiary's debt. 
 In upgrading the ratings, S.& P. said that the loan quality remains strong and that a buoyant Spanish economy continues to benefit all Spanish banks.
In May, Banco de Santander of Spain bought a 13.3 percent interest in First Fidelity Bancorp of New Jersey for more than $220 million. The purchase involved 9.5 million shares of First Fidelity common. At the time, Emilio Boton, chairman of the Spanish bank, acknowledged the bank's interest in United States banks, saying, "We looked at some 80 banks in 38 states before deciding to invest in First Fidelity."

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
New Loss Is Reported By Cummins

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Losses continue unabated at the Cummins Engine Company as sluggish sales of big trucks have shrunk orders for the large engines that are its primary product and aggressive competitors have reduced its share of what market there is left.
Yesterday the company reported a second-quarter loss of $17.2 million, compared with a profit of $6.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the 1990 period, and said it expected the losses to continue at least through the third quarter. Sales in the second quarter rose only slightly, to $877.6 million from $871.3 million. 
 The company's stock closed yesterday at $38, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
A Bitter Disappointment
 For Cummins, the loss came as a bitter disappointment after a decade of rebuilding plants, fending off Japanese manufacturers and gaining important investors and customers. "In this business, if you can't make money in the second quarter you have a problem," said Mitchell I. Quain, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder. "Spring is spare-parts shipment time, and parts are the most profitable part of their business."
Even the company conceded that the outlook was grim. Cummins, which is based in Columbus, Ind., said in a statement that it continued to see no sign of improvement in the North American heavy-truck market. In the first half of this year, 48,083 class 8 heavy trucks were sold in this country, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. If the current trend continues that would produce annual sales of about 98,000 trucks. This represents a 34 percent drop from sales of 148,361 as recently as 1988.
 
Economy Seen as Issue
 "The issue here is the economy," said John E. McGinty, an analyst with First Boston. "If the economy improves, then trucks sales should improve as well."
But Cummins may not automatically benefit from an upturn in truck sales. After holding more than 50 percent of the market for heavy-duty truck engines for most of the 1980's, the share of Cummins has slipped sharply in the last few years. The company said its market share was 41 percent in the first half of this year.
Unlike buyers of automobiles, who can expect to get a Ford engine in a Ford car, buyers of heavy trucks specify which of a limited range of engines they want installed. Caterpilllar Inc. and a newly revived Detroit Diesel Corporation have both picked up sales at the expense of Cummins.
Roger Penske, the auto racer and business executive, bought 80 percent of Detroit Diesel from the General Motors Corporation and began aggressively marketing a new series of engines. Detroit Diesel's market share grew to more than 20 percent in the first quarter from 12.4 percent last year and 3.5 percent in 1988.
"Penske has been very successful in getting engines into the market," said Steven J. Colbert, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "That has impacted Cummins in both share and price levels."
 
Dividend Cut to 5 Cents
 Analysts are estimating that Cummins will lose between $70 million and $100 million this year, on top of a loss of $165 million last year. To conserve cash, the company slashed its dividend earlier this year to 5 cents from 55 cents a share.
One bright spot in an otherwise bleak picture, analysts said, was the company's smaller diesel engines, used in automotive and off-road vehicles, and its widening profit margins for these products.
But the continuing losses are eroding the $250 million in cash the company received last year from the Ford Motor Company, Tenneco Inc. and the Kubota Corporation. "If the market does not come back the way they hope, they could end up in a real tight cash position," Mr. Colbert of Prudential Securities said. He added that this might force the company to take financial actions that would dilute the value of its shares.

HEADLINE: Bush Returns to Prepare for Moscow

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
President Bush returned to Washington today to prepare for a summit meeting in Moscow next week. Officials say Mr. Bush wants the session to mark the start of an era in which economics and cooperation on regional issues dominate Soviet-American relations.
The formal purpose of the meeting is to sign the first treaty that would reduce long-range nuclear missiles, which Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded at their meeting in London last week after nine years of negotiations. 
 The two leaders will also talk about a new phase of arms control, including more possible reductions in nuclear arms, and about Soviet-American cooperation in halting the spread of nuclear weapons around the world, a senior Administration official said today.
But the official said: "The headline is clearly not going to be arms control. This has to be the summit where you begin defining the relationship for the 90's, when the dynamic is going to shift more to economic and political and regional issues. That, certainly, will be the bulk of the summit next week."
 
Tentative Outline
 According to tentative plans outlined by American officials today, Mr. Bush is to leave Washington for Moscow early on Monday morning for Moscow, where he will meet with Mr. Gorbachev the two next days. Administration officials here said today that Mr. Bush was expected to travel to Kiev on Thursday, Aug. 1, as part of his effort to foster relations with leaders of the individual Soviet republics.
Walking a fine line between encouraging opposition groups in the Soviet Union and supporting Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush is also expected to meet with a group of Soviet republic leaders, including representatives of the Baltic region, and to talk separately with Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Federation.
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the President's travel plans were not final and that the White House was considering other side trips, including one possibly to Leningrad. The President is expected to return to the United States on Aug. 2.
The ceremony surrounding the signing of the strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start, will provide much of the pomp and the most evident historical moment of the Moscow meeting. Because the details of the treaty were ironed out by the two leaders in London last week, the signing is likely to be overshadowed by other issues at the core of the new Soviet-American relationship.
 
New Cooperation
 Testing the new cooperation between Moscow and Washington that was demonstrated by the Persian Gulf war, the two leaders will talk about joint efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute, officials said.
To that end, they said the White House announcement today that Mr. Bush wanted an answer from Israel about an American proposal for a Middle East peace conference before he gets to Moscow was in part an effort to make as much progress as possible before the summit begins.
Economic and trade issues will also dominate the agenda for the Moscow talks, although officials said Mr. Bush was no more prepared to offer Mr. Gorbachev major financial assistance than he was when the Soviet leader met with the heads of the seven largest industrial democracies in London last week.
"Gorbachev went away from London saying he was satisfied enough, but clearly he wanted more," a senior official said today. "Our job is to convince him the things he wanted, like a stablization fund or debt restructuring, are putting the cart before the horse and that what he needs is first of all a program that is accepted by the international and business community."
With Mr. Bush under pressure from some allies to accelerate financial aid to the Soviets, American officials said they expected Mr. Gorbachev to press for a more concrete program than Mr. Bush was willing to offer.
 
I.M.F. Program Sought
 "Gorbachev's view, understandably, is something like, 'I've got to convince the political leadership and all the rest falls into place,' " an official said. "What Bush has to convince him of is that it isn't he, President Bush, that Gorbachev needs to talk to, but the bankers and businessmen. That means going to the International Monetary Fund and coming up with with a specific program."
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev plan to touch on regional issues apart from the Middle East, officials said, including Afghanistan and Cuba. Administration officials said planning for the session demonstrates how closely the United States is being drawn into Soviet affairs, including the elaborate arrangements for Mr. Bush's meetings with republic leaders.
Mr. Yeltsin, who has already been received in the White House, will be given a private meeting with Mr. Bush, officials said. But other republic leaders will meet the American President in a group in a more social setting, perhaps a dinner at Spaso House, the American Ambassador's residence in Moscow, officials said.
"We don't want to become part of the problem, but when you're dealing with the Soviet Union these days you're flirting almost by definition with internal problems," a senior official said.
"Take the Kiev trip," he said. "We want to show our interest and respect but we don't want to leave the city having made more difficult a solution to the problems they have with Moscow."
This delicate equation also will come into play when the two leaders talk about the civil strife in Yugoslavia.
Although the Soviet Union has been generally cooperative, a senior official said, the two countries have clear differences over Yugoslavia. The Soviet Union has stressed the country's "territorial integrity," while Washington could accept some partitioning as long as it is done peacefully and democratically, the official said.

HEADLINE: New Head of Nuclear Commission Seeks Change

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Declaring that he was not content to "watch industry stagnate as it has for the last dozen years," the new chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today that he wanted to lay the groundwork for resuming construction of nuclear power plants, with safer and more economical plants.
But the chairman, Ivan Selin, an engineer and management expert who took office at the beginning of this month, said in his first extended meeting with reporters that much, including the industry's public image, would have to change before a utility could order a new reactor. 
 "There isn't any real future for the industry unless power plants are safe and unless the public understands how they're safe," he said, echoing remarks he made to the commission staff last week. The industry's needs are changing, he said then, and while "strong public support was not needed to maintain the status quo" it would be needed for new plants.
All the nuclear plants ordered since 1974 have been canceled, but two manufacturers are seeking approval for new designs, which they say would be cheaper to build and easier to operate than the current plants.
 
Making Waves in First Weeks
 Mr. Selin has made waves in his first three weeks in office by his interest in the safety of a Massachusetts nuclear plant that a watchdog group wants closed and by slowing development of a new rule allowing plants to renew their operating licenses. His actions have drawn praise from some members of Congress and caused concern in the industry.
He acknowledged today, "My tenure has started off with a little more momentum than I had intended."
A week after taking office, Mr. Selin visited the Massachusetts plant, Yankee Rowe, with a group of Congressmen, including Representative Peter H. Kostmayer, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Interior Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment.
The last commission chairman, Kenneth Carr, had "become an advocate for the industry," Mr. Kostmayer said in an interview, adding that he felt that was "entirely inappropriate" for a regulator. Mr. Kostmayer said Mr. Selin appeared to be taking a more open view.
But a nuclear watchdog group has already taken issue with the way Mr. Selin handled his tour of Yankee Rowe. Robert Pollard, a safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, pleaded unsuccessfully with the commission to be allowed on the tour. He gained access only by persuading Mr. Kostmayer that it was unfair for Mr. Selin to meet privately with Yankee Rowe's operators while the commission was hearing his group's case against the plant. Afterward, Mr. Pollard expressed little hope that Mr. Selin would enforce commission regulations any more vigorously than his predecessors.
Yankee Rowe, at 31 years old, is the oldest operating nuclear power plant in the country, and critical steel parts have become brittle because of radiation. Mr. Pollard's group maintains that the reactor's owners have failed to complete safety analyses to demonstrate that the plant is safe, and that commission rules stipulate that it must close.
Mr. Selin has tentatively scheduled a vote of the four commissioners on that subject on July 31.
The industry is also somewhat apprehensive about the new chairman, a former Under Secretary of State for Management. Plant owners were concerned about Mr. Selin's decision to slow the process of developing regulations to extend plant licenses. As Mr. Carr's term ended in June, the commission voted to adopt ground rules for extending the licenses of power plants but left the details to be worked out by its staff. Mr. Selin has decided the commission must review the final language. He said the earlier approval "looked like unseemly haste."
 
A Different Background
 Mr. Selin's background is markedly different from that of the last two chairmen, both of whom were retired admirals. Although Mr. Selin has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering fro Yale University, he is stressing management.
For example, he said today that the nuclear industry was not only inefficient to run but also difficult to regulate. He noted that there were 111 operating plants, with 80 designs. And even "the ones that are the same are different," he said. Applying regulations consistently is therefore difficult, he said.
He has also approached complex issues with a touch of humor. At a recent briefing on Yankee Rowe, he interrupted a commission staff engineer whose presentation was particularly thick with acronyms and technical language. Mr. Selin, who speaks six languages, said, "At the risk of setting a standard we can't live up to in the future, could you repeat that in English?"
In his session with reporters today, he said one problem facing the industry was the bad public image of everything nuclear since the collapse of the Energy Department's nuclear weapons complex. Civilian radioactive waste can be safely stored for decades in casks outside reactor buildings, he said, but the bomb makers have had trouble containing their wastes.
"High-level waste is high-level waste, and if the Government doesn't handle the waste properly, we're going to have a serious problem in both safety and perception," he said.
He listed the priorities of his five-year term as establishing a procedure for extending the licenses of older plants, developing a small number of standardized reactor designs that would be licensed generically and establishing a streamlined process for licensing new plants. This last point is already the center of intense debate, with some citizen groups saying that the leading proposals would eliminate public input.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Former BMC Chairman Assumes Posts at Case

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Since April, when James K. Ashford resigned unexpectedly as chairman of the J. I. Case Company, the heavy-equipment unit of Tenneco Inc., analysts have wondered who would replace him. And since last week, when Robert J. Carlson, 61, resigned as chairman of BMC Industries, analysts have wondered where he was going.
Yesterday, both mysteries were solved. Tenneco named Mr. Carlson as Case's new president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. Election to the board is scheduled for the near future. 
 "Sure, we had plenty of good young managers in place, but we needed someone with strong industry background, and Carlson fit the bill," said Christine LeLaurin, a Tenneco spokeswoman. Apparently, Case fit the bill for Mr. Carlson, too. As he put it: "I like jumping into alligator ponds."
That may be an apt description of Case right now. A combination of the recession and mismanagement of inventories resulted in a loss of $147 million in the first quarter. Rick James, a Case spokesman, conceded that the company would probably report a loss for the year.
Analysts, too, predict losses. "Case has been a problem child for decades, and Tenneco finally realized it had to bring someone in with a strong personality and real industry knowledge to run it," said Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
Mr. Carlson's last 12 years have been evenly split between the United Technologies Corporation and BMC, a manufacturer of electronic and optical products. He spent the first 29 years of his career at Deere & Company, Case's much larger, and consistently profitable, competitor.
Case currently is less concerned with losses than with clearing out its high inventory. The company has been furiously discounting, a practice that has depressed prices but, Mr. Carlson said, is "finally cleaning up the balance sheet."
Since Tenneco has mandatory retirement at 65, Mr. Carlson has four years to turn Case around and groom his successor. He speaks of "bringing some discipline to procedures" and focusing on "new philosophies in dealer and distributor relationships."
Mr. Carlson has a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Minnesota. He and his wife, Joann, who have four children, recently moved to Racine, Wisc., six minutes from Case's office.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Amoco, ARCO and Ashland Report Declines in Earnings

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 22

 BODY:
Two large oil companies operating mainly in the United States, the Amoco Corporation and ARCO, said profits fell sharply in the second quarter. Net income fell by 37.2 percent at Amoco and by 37.1 percent at ARCO.
Ashland Oil Inc., the nation's second-largest refiner after the Sun Company, said net income declined 33.3 percent in the quarter. 
 Amoco and ARCO said their refining and chemical units were hurt by the weak economy, which reduced demand and pushed prices lower, and by tumbling natural gas prices. Amoco has the largest natural gas reserves in North America and is one of the largest gas producers.
ARCO, another big supplier of natural gas, posted lower profit in gasoline marketing because of a pricing war on the West Coast, where it is the market leader. Amoco does not sell gasoline west of the Rocky Mountains.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Amoco
Net income dropped to $238 million, or 48 cents a share, from $379 million, or 75 cents a share, in the comparable quarter last year. Revenues for the nation's fifth-largest oil company fell 9.4 percent, to $6.74 billion from $7.44 billion. The Chicago-based company said its profits were reduced by $68 million in special charges in the recent quarter, which included $43 million to close a filament plant in Bainbridge, Ga.
Costs for paring the work force in its Canadian operations, to 3,055 employees from 4,550 by the end of 1993, accounted for another $25 million.
Unlike many large gas producers, Amoco increased output in the quarter, by 10 percent in the United States, to 2.3 billion cubic feet a day. Natural-gas prices during the quarter fell to an average of $1.21 for 1,000 cubic feet, from $1.42 in the comparable quarter a year ago, according to Natural Gas Intelligence, a trade publication. Amoco did not disclose its average gas price.
Amoco's share price rose 37.5 cents today, to $53.375, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
ARCO
Net income declined to $246 million, or $1.51 a share, from $391 million, or $2.36 a share, in the second quarter of 1990. Revenues rose 5 percent, to $4.24 billion from $4.04 billion.
Profits in oil-and-gas production rose sharply in the quarter, to $163 million from $96 million. ARCO's average crude price, which reflects an average transportation cost of $6 a barrel, rose to $12.66 a barrel, from $10.61 in the period last year.
Natural-gas output fell 15.5 percent in the United States, the location of most ARCO gas reserves, while worldwide production of crude and natural-gas liquids rose 4.8 percent.
In refining and marketing, however, profits fell by more than half, to $85 million from $175 million, largely because of a bitter pricing war with the Chevron Corporation and the Unocal Corporation in the West. The 1991 profit would have been much lower without $37 million added from a favorable tax adjustment in Brazil. ARCO, based in Los Angeles, had posted its biggest profit in refining and marketing in the 1990 second quarter.
ARCO's share price fell by $1.50 today, to $123.125, in trading on the Big Board.
 
Ashland Oil
Net income declined to $66.7 million, or $1.19 a share, from a company record of $100.0 million, or $1.79 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. The Ashland, Ky.-based company said revenues rose 4 percent, to $2.33 billion from $2.24 billion.
Refining profits fell to $79.5 million, from $127.1 million, but the Valvoline oil marketing unit posted a sharp gain, to $15.5 million, from $7.0 million a year ago, as sales rose by 28.6 percent, to $235.5 million. Chemical profits rose to $26.6 million from $22.8 million.
Ashland Oil's share price rose 25 cents today, to $30.875, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: PLAN WOULD LET BAGHDAD SELL OIL

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is drawing up a plan to allow the Security Council to remove some sanctions against Iraq to allow Baghdad to sell petroleum, senior Administration officials said today. The profits would be used to pay for food and medicine, war reparations and the destruction of weapons.
The plan, which was drafted by the State Department, is being circulated for review within the department and at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency. Officials said that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was expected to approve it. It would also need President Bush's approval before it could be presented to the United Nations Security Council as the basis for a resolution. 
If the Bush Administration puts the plan forward, as many officials expect, it will represent a major shift in policy. Currently, Iraq is not allowed to sell its oil because of stringent United Nations sanctions imposed after the invasion of Kuwait, and until now the Administration has argued that Iraq had hidden assets in its Central Bank as well as gold reserves that should be used to buy food and medicine, which are not covered by sanctions.
Administration officials said the examination of a new approach reflects a growing realization that the postwar economic strangulation was hurting the Iraqi people rather than weakening President Saddam Hussein's grip on power. The plan is a response to reports by independent medical teams, United Nations officials and the news media of widespread malnutrition and disease in Iraq, as well as an attempt to counter calls for a more sweeping removal of economic sanctions on humanitarian grounds, the officials said.
"We don't want to see more reports about massive starvation and disease in Iraq," said one senior Administration official who is working on the plan. "We know we will eventually have to go this way. We're not there yet, but we'll have to get there." Another senior official described the plan as "a good way to maintain the bulk of sanctions and not be on the wrong side of a potentially emotional issue."
The sanctions review comes at an uncomfortable time for the Administration, which charged again today that Iraq has not disclosed all the details of its secret nuclear program. "We are still very skeptical about their disclosures and believe they have more to tell us," the State Department's deputy spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said at the State Department briefing today.
Several days ago the five permanent Security Council members -- the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China -- gave Iraq until July 25 to declare a final inventory of its nuclear sites. But one senior Administration official today described the date as "an artificial deadline, not necessarily a turning point." The United States had threatened to resume bombing if Iraq did not comply.
 
'Absurd and Indefensible'
 The move to ease sanctions against Iraq was pressed at the United Nations today by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the head of a United Nations Commission that is assessing Iraq's humanitarian needs. The Prince told the Security Council's sanctions committee about a worsening crisis for Iraq's civilian population and suggested that the country be allowed to sell oil to import food, medicine, and some agricultural and industrial materials.
Prince Sadruddin later told reporters that it was "absurd and indefensible" for the United Nations to pay for Iraq's humanitarian needs, "when numerous other urgent crises and disasters, from Bangladesh to the Horn of Africa, cry out for our attention." He added, "Iraq has considerable oil reserves and should pay to meet these needs herself."
The United States has found itself increasingly isolated in the Security Council as other members and officials have made a two-pronged argument: first, that the only way to force Iraq to pay for war reparations and for the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction, both mandated by Security Council resolutions,is with its own oil revenues; and second, that the Security Council should force Iraq to buy much-needed food and medicine with oil profits that could be monitored or even disbursed inside the country through the United Nations.
 
Special Account Suggested
 The first hint of a change in United States policy came in testimony last Thursday by John R. Bolton, the assistant Secretary of State for Interational Organizations, before a House foreign affairs subcommittee. Mr. Bolton described a new mechanism to provide humanitarian assistance "under a regime of tight controls and strict monitoring." He said that the United States was consulting with members of the Security Council and its coaltion partners "on the appropriate operational ways to do this."
One likely scenario would be for the United Nations to control Iraq's oil revenues through a special account or accounts. Thirty percent of the revenues would pay for reparations for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August, a formula worked out by the Security Council's sanctions committee, and the rest would pay other bills.
Administration officials stressed that oil sales would go forward only if strict conditions were met, and that the details of the plan still have to be worked out and discussed with coalition partners. Because an international body would control the funds, the officials argued that the plan does not reflect a weakening of international sanctions or of the Administration's resolve to continue to exert maximum pressure on Baghdad.
 
Policy About-Face
 But the plan is a significant departure from public statements by Mr. Bush and some senior officials in recent months that Mr. Hussein had to be punished. On May 7, Robert M. Gates, the deputy national security adviser and the nominee for Director for Central Intelligence, said in a speech that "Iraqis will pay the price while he is in power." Mr. Gates added: "All possible sanctions will be maintained until he is gone." On May 20, Mr. Bush acknowledged to reporters that while there are some instances in which Iraq must sell its oil to comply with United Nations resolutions, "my view is we don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power."
But Administration officials have said, albeit quietly and reluctantly, that Mr. Hussein has successfully consolidated power since the end of the Persian Gulf war and may remain President of Iraq for years.

HEADLINE: Delta Insists That Its Bid Is Better

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 22

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines confronted the joint bid by T.W.A. and American for much of Pan Am by standing pat and calling its own $260 million offer a better one.
Delta executives said that if Pam Am accepted a separate United Airlines offer of $190 million for its South American and Caribbean operations, the total price with Delta's bid works out to the same $450 million that T.W.A. and American would pay for virtually the same assets. 
 "We think we have a deal that will be in the best interest of Pan Am's creditors," said Neil Monroe, a Delta spokesman. Pan American World Airways has accepted Delta's offer, but the ultimate decision will be made by a Federal bankruptcy court. Delta has also offered to invest $60 million in Pan Am to enable it to continue its Latin American operations.
 
Says It Has the Cash
 Despite three straight losing quarters, Delta says it has cash on hand to finance the purchase of Pan Am's European, African and Asian routes, plus the Northeastern shuttle. Delta completed a $476 million stock offering this year. Delta will not announce its results for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 until later this week, but Mr. Monroe said the airline was "well beyond" its war-related losses.
But some airline analysts still question the airline's financial strength. "Delta is healthy compared to the rest of the industry," said Daniel A. Hersh, an analyst in Denver with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "But they are not particularly healthy compared to other corporations."
Delta's efforts to capture Pan Am's routes come after years of such cautious expansion abroad that many in the industry wondered whether Delta was losing out to its rivals. The airline's executives say they are merely understated, not under-motivated.
 
'We Can Move Fast'
 "We don't make a lot of noise about what we're doing," said W. Whitley Hawkins, president and chief financial officer of Delta. "That probably gives us a reputation for being somewhat slower than we really are. When we need to, we can move fast."
Mr. Hawkins said the pace of events had left some of Delta's top executives a bit dizzy. Last week, a few of them could not even name all of the cities that the Pan Am deal would add to Delta's route map. "I'll bet there are some Pan Am executives who can't name all those cities either," Mr. Hawkins said with a laugh.
Three destinations that every Delta executive can name are Washington, New York and Boston. Mr. Hawkins said Delta had wanted a Northeast shuttle for years, but sat on the sidelines as the former Eastern Shuttle changed hands.
Ronald W. Allen, Delta's chairman and chief executive, said Delta's interest in a Northeast shuttle increased last year after the airline began New York-Los Angeles flights. "If some of those transcontinental travelers are going on to Boston or Washington, we don't want to lose them to another carrier," he said.
 
Started in Crop Dusting
 Delta, based in Atlanta, may extend its reach as far as Bombay and Moscow with the Pan Am deal, but it still boasts of never straying too far from its roots. The company always holds its annual meeting in Monroe, La., the town where the company was born in 1924 as a crop-dusting operation.
Virtually all of the company's top executives are home grown. Mr. Allen has been with Delta 27 years, joining even before he received his undergraduate degree at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Mr. Hawkins began with Delta in 1955 as a transportation agent in Lexington, Ky. He insists that the company retains something of its small-town culture, despite growing to 66,000 employees, from fewer than 5,000, during his years there. "I don't think our corporate culture has changed in all that time," he said.
 
Avoided Labor Troubles
 With few unionized workers except pilots, Delta has avoided the kind of labor strife that contributed to the demise of Eastern Airlines this year. Several years ago, employees chipped in to buy the airline a $40 million Boeing 767-200 in gratitude for being spared layoffs during a recession.
Adding Pan Am employees would help Delta improve its international service, said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York. "Pan Am's in-flight service has heaps of tradition," he said. "Their pilots' average age is 51. They've got flight attendants with a tremendous amount of international experience. There is a lot Delta can learn from them."
Delta has won respect for the quality of its domestic service. It tied for second place in a recent Consumer Reports magazine rating of domestic airlines, the only one of the largest airlines in the top five.
At home, Delta is moving to cement its dominance of Atlanta, buying the Eastern gates closest to the main terminal and seeking to buy Eastern's abandoned maintenance hangar. The hangar purchase would make it still more difficult for a rival to establish an Atlanta hub.
But ask Delta executives about these moves, and they say their aims are friendly. "We've always said we welcome another carrier to establish a hub here in Atlanta," Mr. Hawkins said. "We've told the city we would be glad to help them attract another airline."

American Express Says Profit Falls 20%; Revenue Is Up

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its second-quarter profit fell 20 percent, to $256 million, or 53 cents a share, from $320 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenues rose nearly 5 percent, to $6.36 billion, from $6.06 billion in the 1990 period. 
 Profits at the company's charge-card business fell only slightly and two other units, IDS Financial Services and the Information Services Corporation, performed strongly.
After an unexpectedly troubled first quarter, in which American Express's charge-card business fell 25 percent, the latest overall performance was better than Wall Street expectations. Some analysts had expected profits to fall to 40 cents or less a share. The stock nevertheless slipped 75 cents yesterday, to close at $23.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The second-quarter results reflect a large write-off related to the stake Shearson Lehman Brothers held in a Los Angeles insurance company that invested heavily in "junk bonds." Shearson, American Express's troubled Wall Street investment house and its largest subsidiary, is taking a previously announced $144 million pretax write-off for its investment in the insurer, the First Capital Holdings Corporation.
 
$41 Million Tax Benefit
 Alison A. Deans, who follows American Express for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said the second-quarter performance was helped, however, by an unexpected $41 million tax benefit from Shearson writing down the value of its First Capital investment. "I had expected it to be zero," she added, referring to the tax benefit.
Shearson posted an overall loss of $48.8 millon, compared with a gain of $26.5 million a year earlier. Second-quarter revenues rose more than 7 percent, to $2.81 billion, from $2.62 billion the year before.
Travel Related Services, the charge-card business that is the heart of American Express and its biggest profit contributor, reported a net income of $241 million, down 3 percent from $249 million a year ago. Revenues rose more than 2 percent, to $2.41 billion, from $2.35 billion.
Last April, when American Express reported first-quarter earnings, it surprised analysts and investors with the extent of the downturn at Travel Related Services. The first-quarter profit for the unit dropped 25 percent, to $162 million.
Ms. Deans of Smith Barney cautioned that the charge-card business in the second quarter was performing about as expected, but that the seeming improvement was mainly because of a first-quarter provision for bad-credit losses.
What surprised Ms. Deans, however, was an actual shrinkage in the number of American Express cardholders. Cards in force in the second quarter totaled 36.6 million, or 100,000 fewer than in the first quarter. But the figure was nearly 2 percent larger than the 35.9 million in the second quarter a year ago.
Charge-card volume, the total of goods and services purchased with American Express cards, was flat at $27.7 billion. The number of cards in customers' wallets and purses rose 1 percent in the United States, to 25.9 million, and 4.2 percent abroad, to 10.7 million.
This means, however, that actual purchases per card, an important measure of American Express's business, declined nearly 2 percent worldwide, to $756.83 from $771.58 last year.
 
Gain for IDS Financial
 IDS Financial Services, which mainly provides financial planning counseling, posted a 19 percent increase in profits, to $61.4 million. Revenues rose more than 12 percent, to $630.2 million.
The Information Services Corporation, which processes credit-card transactions and provides other computerized financial services, had a 16 percent rise, to $25.3 million. But revenues rose only 3 percent, to $219.9 million, reflecting some growth in new accounts despite the recession, American Express said.
At American Express Bank, the company's international commercial bank aimed at wealthy customers, profits fell nearly 20 percent, to $25.5 million, because of $155 million in nonperforming loans. That compared with a $37 million profit a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Hawaii Shows It Can Offer Health Insurance for All

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU

 BODY:
Residents of the Hawaiian Islands, more than 2,400 miles from the American mainland, have long complained that they are left out of major debates that ripple across the nation.
But on at least one big issue -- how to provide adequate medical care to all citizens -- health policy analysts say Hawaiians are well ahead of the rest of the country, and their state is being studied in Congress and by other state governments as a potential national model. 
 The 50th state is the only one that can boast of near-universal health care. Under a 17-year-old program that requires employers to pick up the cost of insurance premiums for any person working more than 20 hours a week, most of Hawaii's 1.1 million people have some kind of medical insurance. The unemployed, seasonal workers and those whose job does not include insurance are taken care of by state medical subsidies.
 
Some Special Circumstances
 In all, 98 percent of Hawaiians have some kind of medical insurance. By contrast, in the country as a whole, 14 percent of the population, or 34 million people, lack medical insurance and get no government subsidy. Most are wage earners who work for small or low-paying businesses.
Perhaps most surprising to many experts, the near-universal access to health care here has not led to soaring costs. While Hawaii ranks near the top of the states in cost of living, its average health insurance premium is near the bottom. For example, a family in Hawaii pays a premium of $263 a month, nearly half that of other states.
To be sure, Hawaii differs from the other 49 states in many important ways. The population is small, the climate is healthful, and the state has a long tradition of providing generous benefits to workers, most of whom belong to unions.
Even during the current recession in tourism, Hawaii has the lowest unemployment rate of any state, 2.8 percent; its insurance companies have to pay little compared to other states for hospital care for the unemployed. Its insurance industry is dominated by a few big companies, which can exercise strong bargaining power to keep doctors' and hospitals' fees down.
It is in the middle of an ocean, so businesses that might object to paying health care costs -- up to $1,000 a year per employee -- cannot simply move across a state line.
But while these oddities help explain Hawaii's success in keeping rates low while providing care to nearly everyone, advocates here and experts on the mainland say the state has much to contribute to the current national debate.
"One criticism I hear is that we are different, as if we're all sipping mai tais on the beach and dancing in coconut shell bras," said Dr. John Lewin, Hawaii's director of health. "We have a lot of poor people in Hawaii. We have all the health problems of the rest of the states. But what makes us different is that we decided to do something about it."
Dr. Lewin, energetic and outspoken, has become a sort of evangelist for universal health care, which he calls a basic human right. He has spoken to numerous Congressional officials and to leaders in states like California and Washington, where similar plans are under discussion. The thrust of his argument is that the states can provide health insurance for all citizens and keep costs down if preventive care is emphasized, and if there is competition among the major insurance companies to go after the uninsured.
Dr. Karen Davis, a professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University, agrees. "What Hawaii has demonstrated, to a lot of people's astonishment," she said, "is that they have covered all their people while minimizing economic disruption."
By contrast, Massachusetts's plan for universal health insurance, also considered a pioneer of sorts, has stalled amid concern over the state's soured economy. Small-business owners, who starting in January would be required to offer employees insurance or pay the state to do it, are lobbying for a delay or outright repeal of the plan.
 
A 'Cost of Doing Business Here'
 The Hawaii plan took effect in 1974, when much of the country was in a severe recession. The world of health care was much different then. For one thing, mandatory insurance coverage by employers was not considered particularly radical; one of its leading advocates was the Nixon Administration. For another, no one had heard of AIDS, crack addiction or the host of high-technology advances that have driven up the cost of medicine. Before Hawaii's plan went into effect, 17 percent of its residents were without medical insurance -- a greater percentage than that represented by the 34 million Americans who now lack coverage.
In the Hawaii plan, the employee pays a portion of the insurance: no more than 1.5 percent of a person's gross wages, or half the premium, whichever is less. For someone making $2,000 a month, the fee can work out to around $30 a month. The requirement applies even to people who hire domestic workers for 20 hours a week or more, and any business that does not comply can be fined or shut down. State officials say they have had few problems with compliance.
Some business groups still complain about the cost. "For the smaller businesses, it's somewhat of a problem," said Mary Jane Van Buren, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce. "It can make a difference, for some people, between going under and staying profitable." But she added, "People accept it, like everything else, as the cost of doing business here."
 
A State of Small Businesses
 As Congress debates a Democratic-sponsored bill to require employers who do not provide health coverage to pay premiums for uninsured workers, the main argument used against the measure is that it puts too much of the burden for national health care on small businesses. It could lead to higher inflation, the critics say, and create still more bureaucracy to bedevil small businesses that are already snagged in Government-generated red tape.
But Hawaii's example, experts here say, belies the argument.
The state's economy is run by small businesses; more than 90 percent of Hawaii's 27,271 individual enterprises employ 50 people or less, according to the state labor department.
Jean Pinc, who runs the B & L Bike and Sport Shop in Kona-Kailua, on the Big Island of Hawaii, says the additional cost of paying health insurance for three full-time employees has not been a drag on the business. "We want to keep our good people, and one way to keep somebody loyal is to give them good benefits," she said. "Everybody who runs a small business is pretty much in the same situation."
Not everyone is covered by the Hawaii requirements. In the most important exception, employers do not have to pay for care of dependents. But business people here say the competition for workers is so strong that most dependents are covered.
There are ways to get around paying insurance premiums. Some businesses hire only part-time workers, avoiding the 20-hour threshold.
"We could do that if we wanted to, and I know some people do," Ms. Pinc said. "But again, it comes down to trying to run a business with people who will stay loyal and do a good job for you."
The fact that Hawaii has virtually full employment means that companies have to compete, with various benefit packages, to keep good workers. As it is, "some employers are desperate for workers," said Rich Budnick, a spokesman for the Labor Department in Honolulu.
Last year, a second part of the Hawaiian health plan, intended to cover the 5 percent of the population that falls between the cracks, went into effect. People who otherwise have no insurance pay a small fee for each doctor visit and a portion of the insurance premium. The rest is picked up by the state. The poor are covered by Medicaid, the state-Federal program, as in other states.
The 1990 plan, called the State Health Insurance Program, is runnning below its projected budget cost -- insuring slightly more than 10,000 people at an annual cost of under $1,000 per person. But it provides only basic benefits, covering no more than five days in a hospital per year and limiting care in other ways.
 
A Pound of Prevention
 The question most frequently asked about Hawaii's system is how the state has managed to control costs. With Hawaii's isolation and expensive real estate, the cost of living is about 30 percent above the national average. But its health insurance premiums, for a single person per month, average about $94 a month -- well below the $154 average cost for a similiar policy in New York, California's $141 premium and the $282 average for Kansas.
The infant mortality rate, down 50 percent from its high of 16 per 1,000 in 1974, is among the nation's lowest. Life expectancy, at 78 years, is near the top.
"The secret of our success, the secret that many in the American medical establishment do not want to hear, is prevention," Dr. Lewin said. "We have twice as many outpatient visits, that is, people see their doctors several times a year, and half as many hospital stays, as the national average."
People are encouraged to go to the doctor early and often, he said, thus minimizing the chance of costly operations for maladies that could have been prevented. "The emergency room is not the place to get prenatal care," Dr. Lewin said.
Another cost-saving aspect is that the pool of workers covered by a given insurance plan is not drawn from a single workplace but from the entire population. If the premiums were based on the health of 10 people at one office, and 2 of those people had life-threatening diseases, the costs for everyone else at that office would skyrocket. But because the risk pool comprises all state residents, the costs are much lower.
"This has reduced the administrative expenses for insurers, and together with the spreading of risk, made insurance premiums affordable for all but a handful of small employers," wrote Molly Joel Coye, the head of California's Department of Health Services, in the Summer, 1991 edition of Issues in Science and Technology.
But just as Hawaii is being studied by people outside the state, Dr. Lewin fears that a new Federal system proposed by Senate Democrats, a "mega-Medicaid," as he calls it, will be imposed on Hawaii. The proposal would eventually require all employers to provide health insurance for their employees or to or pay into a health-care fund. Although Dr. Lewin likes aspects of the bill, he worries that the additional Federal bureaucracy would set Hawaii back.
The Federal Government should establish a minimum set of benefits, Dr. Lewin says, then step aside and let the states craft their own programs.

HEADLINE: Israel Tells U.S. It Will Consider Mideast Conference;
Shamir Says He Will Consider Mideast Conference

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 22

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today that because of Syria's agreement to attend a peace conference and negotiate with Israel, his Government would reconsider its opposition to the meeting and give Washington an answer soon.
After a second round of talks with Mr. Baker, Mr. Shamir told his Cabinet that judging from what the Secretary of State brought from Damascus, there appeared to be a "revolutionary change" in Syria's position, even if it was for only tactical reasons, Yossi Ahimeir, an important adviser, said. 
 Later tonight, when asked if he believed that a peace conference could start within the next few months, Mr. Shamir told a reporter for Israeli television that "it's very possible that talks could be held in the framework of peace negotiations between us and the Arab world."
 
Reconsideration in Israel
 As a result of the recent Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian commitments to attend talks with Israel, Mr. Baker said that Mr. Shamir, who only six weeks ago wrote President Bush rejecting American terms for the conference, was now rethinking that position.
"The Prime Minister indicated that he would respond shortly to our proposals," Mr. Baker said, adding:
"I think that this is a moment of historic opportunity. For 43 years, Israel has sought direct negotiations with its neighbors, and it has been right to do so.
"Direct negotiations are the only way to solve problems and the only way to secure peace, and now there is a real opportunity to get to these face-to-face negotiations."
A senior Israeli official said it was quite possible that Mr. Shamir would find a way to drop his earlier procedural objections to the conference.
 
U.N. Role Opposed
 These were his opposition both to the attendance of a United Nations observer and to the provision that the conference could occasionally reconvene after Israel and the Arab countries had begun direct negotiations.
The Israelis have opposed reconvening the full peace conference because they prefer direct talks with individual Arab countries, the kind of forum in which they think it less likely that the superpowers or Arab nations would be able to press them to accept unwanted compromises. Israeli leaders are also uncomfortable with a continuing United Nations role, recalling resolutions adopted in the past at the world organization that Israelis considered unfavorable.
Mr. Baker did not appear to get anywhere with Mr. Shamir on another issue -- a proposal endorsed by Egypt and Saudi Arabia to exchange an end to the Arab economic boycott of Israel for suspension of the building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
"He's not enthusiastic about that approach," Mr. Baker said. "That may be an understatement. We have a disagreement on that issue which is quite separate and apart from the peace process."
Before deciding on the peace conference question, Mr. Shamir is seeking clarification on the role the United Nations observer will play at the conference. The Israeli leader also wants to know which Palestinians will attend the conference. And he wants to more firmly establish the sincerity of Syria's commitment to peace.
Until Israel receives those clarifications, it will not respond, officials said. In light of that, Mr. Baker left his top Mideast adviser, Dennis Ross, chairman of the State Department Policy Planning Staff, in Jerusalem while he went to Malaysia to meet Southeast Asian foreign ministers.
President Bush, flying back to Washington from Turkey, spoke by telephone with Mr. Baker. Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One that "I think the President is encouraged that there wasn't a rejection." He also said that Mr. Bush would like Israel's response by the time of his summit meeting in Moscow on July 30 and 31. That would allow him and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to announce the conference and issue invitations.
Senior Israeli officials said that of all the outstanding issues, Mr. Shamir plans to take the hardest line on the question of which Palestinians can take part in the talks.
In particular, the official said, Mr. Shamir will hold to his insistence that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem be allowed to take part on the ground that this would imply that the eastern part of the city, captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 war and since annexed, is subject to negotiations.
He will also continue to insist that the Palestine Liberation Organization have no direct involvement with the Palestinian delegation.
The Israeli Government's insistence on maintaining the unity of Jerusalem is an emotional one in Israel and among Jews worldwide. Thus, if Israel is to hold out on one issue, that would be the strongest one for Mr. Shamir.
He would also enjoy considerable support for adopting a tough line at eventual negotiations with the Syrians.
 
Golan Compromise Opposed
 The Jerusalem Post today published a poll by the Smith Research Center, conducted a month ago, which found that only 7 percent of Israelis were ready to give up all of the strategic Golan Heights in return for "real peace and security guarantees."
A former Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, in an interview with Israel radio today, said that the Golan Heights are "ours and will remain so."
Geula Cohen, a leader of the far-right Tehiya Party and an important member of Mr. Shamir's coalition, warned the Prime Minister today that the moment he signals Washington that Israel is prepared to take part in the conference on America's terms, her party will bolt the Cabinet. So would the other far-right parties, she predicted.
If all seven far-right members of Mr. Shamir's coalition left, that would leave him with only 59 seats in Parliament -- two shy of a majority. But Parliament adjourned for the summer today and will not reconvene until the first week of October.
As a result, it is now impossible to bring a motion of no confidence against the Government for the next two and a half months, which means that Mr. Shamir cannot be ousted from office, even if some coalition members quit.
Mr. Shamir was quoted by Israel Radio today as saying that Mr. Baker told him the conference would likely convene in October, with each country represented by its foreign minister. Israel wants the conference in Washington; the Arabs want it in Cairo.
 
Palestinians Staying Flexible
 As objectionable as the Palestinians find some of Mr. Shamir's conditions, they are refraining from stating categorically that they will not take part in the conference unless people from East Jerusalem are in the delegation and unless the P.L.O. has a role.
Their strategy, according to prominent Palestinians in the territories, is to wait and see what Mr. Shamir does. They want him to move first.
If he spurns Mr. Baker, they think, the blame will fall on him and they will have given away nothing. If Mr. Shamir agrees to drop all his procedural objections and focuses on the Palestinian representation issue, however, then the Palestinians will likely try to find a way to swallow his conditions and go to the conference. They will be able to argue to their people that while they are making concessions, they will be get peace talks in return.
Hanan Ashrawi and Faisal al-Husseini, two of the West Bank Palestinian leaders who have met with Mr. Baker six times in the last three months, said at a news conference today that they believe that no talks should start without a Palestinian delegation including people from East Jerusalem. But when repeatedly pressed as to whether this was a condition for participation, they would not go that far.
They also declared that while the Palestinians believe that they are entitled their own delegation at the conference, they might consider attending as part of a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation, as Mr. Baker prefers, if the United States would declare that "the Palestinians are a people with a right to self-determination."
 
Opposition to Talks in Jordan
AMMAN, Jordan, July 22 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Jordanian Parliament has issued a tough statement condemning American peace efforts in the Mideast. The action on Sunday came just hours after King Hussein told Secretary of State Baker that Jordan was ready to attend a peace conference and that it supported Egypt's proposal to end the boycott of Israel.
The statement rejected peace talks "that would enhance Israel's occupation of Palestine and bring to an end its enmity with surrounding Arab states."
It also rejected the proposal for an end to the Arab boycott in exchange for a suspension of the building of new settlements in the occupied territories.
Several members of Parliament, in telephone interviews today, said they did not expect Parliament's action to affect the policies of the King or Prime Minister Taher Masri, whose Government won a vote of confidence in Parliament last week despite stiff oppostion from members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who form the largest parliamentary grouping.

Hot Times
A subtropical shroud covered the city like a dirty old coat, turning fashionable people into human puddles. These are the horse latitudes of fashion, when it's O.K. not to think about clothes, if only for 15 minutes. 
 Several of the chic small stores on Madison Avenue have closed for vacation. Others, particularly luxury retailers with a clientele that summers by the sea, are closed on Saturdays till Labor Day.
In the department stores, there is a general atmosphere of not much business being done, although they are excellent places to sample air-conditioning. The coolest places to see clothes are action movies. In the future, as Arnold Schwarzenegger has demonstrated, robots will have a great sense of style.
The heat does gives rise to a certain fashionable languor, especially among the legions going to work. Among working women, one summer trend has been readily apparent: the return of the sleeveless shift dress. More and more women go to work in such easy styles: cool, crisp and unfettered.
By contrast, the men slogging toward the subway in their stifling suits seem a trifle absurd. If design is still vaguely related to function, their uniform is the inferior one. Note that after 5, the first thing the men do when they go home is slip into a long, loose tank tops, worn over a pair of extra-baggy Bermuda shorts, just above the knee.
If you squint your eyes and look at this outfit, regarding it purely as a silhouette, it resembles nothing so much as, well, a sleeveless shift dress. Don't tell anyone, but this may be the secret desire.
 
Boston Fashion
 While New York fashion has been mired in the hot season, Boston is in the midst of trying to kick-start its own garment industry. On Thursday, the Boston Designer's Collective, an industry group formed in February, is putting on a group show of about 30 designers at the Marine Industrial Park on the South Boston waterfront.
The show is part of a joint city-state effort of the kind that New York fashion designers have been lobbying for, unsuccessfully, for years. The Boston Designer's Collective Press Expo, as the event is called, is being underwritten with the help of the City of Boston's Economic Development and Industrial Corporation and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
The aim is to develop Boston into an internationl fashion center for tailored and specialty apparel, said Geoffrey B. Small, a Boston designer who helped found the Boston Designer's Collective. It is modeled on the strategic industrial plan used in Antwerp, Belgium; Barcelona, Spain, and Milan, Italy, to promote those cities' fashion businesses, Mr. Small said.
As in New York, the number of people employed by Boston's once-vibrant garment industry has declined sharply, to 1,200 from 3,000 in the last 10 years, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union said.
 
Hopalong Hip-Hop
 "The jean is dead," said Francois Girbaud, which is a funny thing coming from half of the French design team that makes some of the most popular jeans in America.
The Y-back and suspendered overalls with the Marithe and Francois Girbaud label are now the rage on city streets. But they are jeans with a different attitude, not so much James Dean as hip-hop. While many traditional jeans styles have faltered in the market, Marithe and Francois Girbaud jeans have soared, with sales of $120 million in 1990, up from about $70 million in 1989.
Mr. Girbaud, who learned about jeans in the 1960's by shopping Paris flea markets, regards his work as similar to couture. "I'm a cowboy in my mind," he said.

HEADLINE: Global Investors -- a special report: EMERGING MARKETS;
Big Profits, Large Risks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Outside the world's developed economies, a host of stock markets in developing countries from Mexico to Malaysia, Thailand to Taiwan and India to Indonesia offer the opportunity for substantial profits. But the price of those profits is increased risk, for these markets are volatile and generally lag far behind in the rudimentary measures required to protect investors.
In terms of basic accounting standards, the International Finance Corporation of Washington, which has established regulatory criteria for 20 of these emerging stock markets, found in a recent survey that only 7 nations -- Brazil, Chile, Mexico, India, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines -- have accounting standards that are acceptable by international standards. Nine nations have standards that are merely "adequate," the I.F.C. found, and Greece, Jordan, Taiwan and Indonesia have poor accounting standards that are in need of reform, it said. 
In terms of investor-protection regulations, Taiwan, Greece and Turkey got poor ratings, while 11 other nations -- Argentina, Columbia, Venezuela, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Jordan, Nigeria, Portugal and Zimbabwe -- were rated "adequate."
Only Brazil, Chile, Mexico, India, South Korea and Malaysia were given good ratings.
Some of those highly rated markets -- notably, India, where Bombay is the dominant stock exchange -- limit the ways foreign investors can participate, restricting them to a few mutual funds. These country funds, even in weakly regulated markets like Taiwan, have proved extremely popular with Americans.
But even in countries with the highest ratings, the markets still have a long way to go. "Over all, Mexico has probably the strictest laws and enforcement power of any emerging market but still lags far behind industrial country standards," said Gary Kleiman, an adviser on emerging markets who runs Kleiman International Consultants of New York.
 
Better Informed Than Others
 Insider trading can still be a problem because of concentrated family holdings or cross-ownership between banks and corporations. "One has got to fear that some people acting in the market are better informed than the minority shareholders," said Josiane Pain, director of the Greece Fund, which invests in Greek stocks.
In general, even if a country has a structure and rules that seem to provide the framework for adequate protection, the markets may not work that way in real life.
"These markets have little of the tradition of supervisory independence, which enables S.E.C.-type agencies to perform their duties free of ministry interference," Mr. Kleiman said. "Even when autonomous structures exist in legal form, practice has not yet evolved to reflect their mandate. You cannot look at the legal framework on paper. It is much more complicated than that."
Recent scandals in some countries, like Indonesia and Thailand, have prompted calls for more independent enforcement. Some rules on disclosure and listing of stocks have been tightened. But the new laws do not always help. Mr. Kleiman said that in Indonesia companies often kept three sets of books, trotting out the one best in a given situation. In Thailand, where supervision is split between the Securities Exchange of Thailand, the central bank and the Ministry of Finance, market scandals have prompted legislators to consider establishing a separate agency like the S.E.C.
A broker in Mexico, who asked not to be identified, said: "We are quite far down the road in terms of regulations and laws. But the problem is that when it comes to the supervision of the regulations it is not consistent, which is typical when it comes to a developing country."

HEADLINE: Children Of Divorce: Steps to Help Can Hurt

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
WITH two children in five now growing up in divorced families, researchers who have studied the long-term effects of marital dissolution are raising serious questions about the value of popular measures that are widely believed to ease the burden of divorce on children.
In fact, some steps long thought to be helpful, including no-fault divorce, delaying divorce until the children are older and court-ordered joint custody, may actually add to the already severe trauma many children suffer in the wake of divorce and sometimes for a decade or more after their parents' marriage ends, the studies suggest. 
 These concerns are emerging from research in this country and in Europe, including studies that follow families for years, starting well before signs of marital discord appear.
The commonness of divorce -- half of marriages contracted in the 1970's will not last -- may have reduced societal scorn and parental shame, but shows no signs of alleviating the anguish of children. In families split by divorce, the findings suggest, children do best if both parents are consistent in their upbringing and remain physically and emotionally involved in the youngsters' development. But the commitment and cooperation that facilitates such involvement is often lacking among divorced parents, the research indicates.
When both parents fail to maintain close parental relationships with their children after divorce, the children often do better if the father drops out of the picture altogether, a national survey of 1,423 children indicated. Among those surveyed by Dr. Frank F. Furstenberg Jr. and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, children from divorced families who had not seen their fathers in five years were doing better behaviorally and academically than those who had more frequent or recent paternal contacts.
With time, many divorced fathers become increasingly detached from their children. In the national survey, for example, the researchers were startled to discover that 23 percent of fathers had had no contact with their children in the last five years and another 20 percent had not seen their children during the preceding year. When fathers fail to play an active role in the children's upbringing, the best predictor of their healthy adjustment after divorce is a good relationship with the custodial mother, researchers have found.
A father's financial contribution to his divorced family can also have a major effect on the children. Many children felt abandoned by their fathers when the divorced family's finances suffered, when child support payments stopped on their 18th birthday and when fathers -- often themselves professionals with advanced degrees -- failed to contribute to the children's college education.
"The lack of adequate economic support has a devastating effect on the children's self-esteem and aspirations," said Dr. Judith S. Wallerstein, a California psychologist who has been studying divorce since 1971. "The children are enormously angry at being lost in the shuffle. They feel they are paying for their parents' mistakes."
Dr. Wallerstein's review of seven major studies and more than a dozen smaller ones of the long-term effects of divorce on children was published in May in The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
 
Repercussions in Adulthood
 "The good news," she said, "is that by the third decade of life, a lot of kids do manage to pull their lives together, albeit after much blood, sweat and tears and often therapy." But for about half the children of divorce, the unhappy baggage of their parents' battles remains a lasting legacy.
 Dr. Wallerstein said her in-depth study of 60 middle-class families for up to 15 years after divorce revealed that since parental conflicts often center on the children, many youngsters mistakenly assume they caused their parents to split. Others maintain a fantasy for years of bringing their parents back together, even when they know rationally that the two are ill suited or do not get along.
Furthermore, she said, the frequency of divorce has raised anxieties among children in intact families. Occasional disagreements between otherwise happily married parents often lead to fears of divorce among their children.
Dr. Wallerstein summarized her findings in "Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade after Divorce," written with Sandra Blakeslee and published in 1989 by Ticknor & Fields ($19.95). The book concludes, "We are allowing our children to bear the psychological, economic and moral brunt of divorce."
No-fault divorce, which has eased the way for couples who decide to end their marriage, does not necessarily reduce the ongoing conflicts between parents that can be highly destructive to children whether or not the marriage continues. Instead, by helping to make divorce more common, no-fault divorce may place more children at risk, Dr. Wallerstein said in an interview.
 
'A Disaster for Children'
 "Divorce on demand has turned out to be a disaster for children," she said, especially since "parents have no idea how to alleviate their children's anxieties when they divorce."
Although it has long been assumed that older children have an easier time understanding and accepting divorce, the findings suggest that parents who postpone divorce for the sake of the children may make it harder for children to adjust to the eventual split.
Younger children, especially young boys, often seem most distressed in the immediate aftermath of divorce, several studies have shown, but they generally recover faster and show fewer long-lasting effects than do children who are older when their parents separate.
Divorce has been found to be most traumatic in the long run to children who are pre-adolescents or teen-agers at the time of the split. From the ages 8 to 16, Dr. Wallerstein noted, children normally go through stages of identification with and separation from parents that can be seriously complicated by divorce. In addition, she said, delaying divorce exposes children longer to a model of an unhappy marriage and may make it more difficult for them to later establish a healthy, committed relationship of their own.
Furthermore, a new study of 17,000 British families and an ongoing study of 110 American families have shown that for years before their parents' divorce, many children show the same developmental disturbances typical of children of divorce.
These studies suggest that parental conflict during the marriage as well as after it ends is a major cause of youngsters' behavioral and academic problems. To the extent that divorce limits children's exposure to such conflict, it may reduce stresses that foster abnormal development.
"The notion that divorce will probably be devastating for children has influenced many couples to remain unhappily married until their children are grown," said Dr. Jack Block, his wife, Jeanne H. Block, who has since died, and Per F. Gjerde, the authors of the American study.
"Yet many of the behavioral problems boys especially exhibit at the time of divorce or subsequently are in fact present years before parental separation actually occurs," the psychologists from the University of California at Berkeley wrote in the journal Child Development.
The Berkeley team was among several research groups to note that parental conflict and divorce seem to have a more devastating, or at least more obvious, adverse effect on boys than girls, who generally are more resistant to environmental stresses.
But in her in-depth study over the years, Dr. Wallerstein found that while girls from divorced families at first adjusted about as well as girls from intact families, they encountered far more difficulties as older teen-agers and young adults. Depression commonly marred the teen-age years of girls from divorced families. Fearing rejection or betrayal by men, many became involved at an early age in short-lived sexual relationships, sometimes with older men.
 
Harmful Effects on Girls
 The British study found that girls from divorced families were more likely to become unwed mothers, to marry and have children at a young age and to get divorced than were comparable girls from intact families. Among white American women whose childhoods were marred by divorce, the divorce rate is 60 percent higher than for the general population.
In an interview, Dr. Wallerstein, who directs the Center for the Family in Transition in Corte Madera, Calif., cautioned divorcing parents against assuming their daughters were taking the split in stride. Her studies suggest that many need professional help as teen-agers or young adults if they are to be able to form meaningful and lasting relationships with men.
When divorcing parents battle over custody of the children, court-ordered settlements that require hostile parents to share custody can place children in the middle of continuing conflicts that are ultimately detrimental to their development.
According to Dr. Wallerstein's review of the literature, "there is evidence from many studies that intense parental conflict poses severe threats to the psychological health of children, whether the family is divorced or remains married."
In a study of 100 children and their families who were involved in custody disputes, Dr. Janet Johnston and colleagues at the Center for the Family in Transition found that fewer than 5 percent of the children were shielded from verbal or physical abuse between their parents.
The study found many instances in which parents displayed an "extraordinary disregard for the children's safety." These children were often exploited, enlisted by parents as battle allies, or even kidnapped by a parent. Several mothers even rammed their cars into the autos of former husbands while children were in the cars.
The children in the Johnston study were highly distressed, frightened, anxious and inhibited. Younger children and those who had witnessed physical violence between their parents were especially disturbed.
Major changes in behavior, including "zombie-like behavior and severe withdrawal," occurred when the children had to switch from one parental home to the other. The children seemed even more disturbed when they were interviewed again two and a half years later.
Four and a half years after their parents separated, children from these high-conflict families who lived in both parental homes because of court orders or mediation decisions "were significantly more depressed and more withdrawn" than children living with only one parent.
A Stanford University study of adolescents who were caught in the middle between divorcing parents found that even four years later, both boys and girls were more likely to suffer depression and anxiety and to engage in deviant behavior like drinking, smoking or skipping school.
The researchers, directed by Dr. Christie M. Buchanan, concluded that dual-residence arrangements were harmful when there was a lot of conflict between divorced parents.
Still, Dr. Wallerstein noted, there was considerable variation in the youngsters' response to parental conflict. "A good 40 percent of the youngsters whose parents showed high levels of discord had been able to maintain their emotional distance from the ongoing parental fray," she said.
In her own study, Dr. Wallerstein found that when the agreed-upon custody arrangement was not working well for the children, many parents seemed unwilling or unable to change it.
She concluded that this lack of flexibility could inhibit a child's development, particularly in adolescence when activities with peers take on primary importance and are sometimes disrupted when the child moves from one parental home to the other. Very young children also had difficulty adapting to frequent switching of households.
 
Strains From Remarriage
 When divorced parents remarry, yet another stress is introduced into the lives of their children.
In a six-year study of 180 families by Dr. E. Mavis Hetherington of the University of Virginia, when parents remarried their relationships with their children underwent a radical shift. Mothers and daughters, who got along best after divorce, often began fighting with one another when the mother remarried, while boys, who typically were most disturbed after the divorce, tended to settle down soon after acquiring a stepfather.
Dr. Hetherington reported that girls were hostile to their stepfathers no matter how hard the stepfathers tried to establish a good relationship. But stepfathers did better with boys, especially when the stepfathers supported the mothers' child-rearing efforts by acting as friends and confidants rather than disciplinarians of their stepsons.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Industry's Earnings Running in Circles

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
New York ran its 612th and final race of the summer season at Belmont Park yesterday and headed for five weeks of racing at Saratoga with the gnawing news that attendance at Belmont had slipped 6.2 percent and betting 6.5 percent during the 68-day meeting.
The racing scene will switch to Saratoga tomorrow afternoon for a five-week run before returning to Belmont on Aug. 28. But the horses will be accompanied by the hard facts of racing life: fewer people betting fewer dollars at the track and placing their bets instead at offtrack locations. 
 In Belmont's spring and summer meeting, which opened on May 8, attendance declined to an average of 12,431 customers from 13,259 the year before, continuing a slide of recent years. Betting at the track declined to an average $2.7 million a day, from $2.9 million a day the year before.
Even away from the track, the betting business generally retreated from last year's levels. Offtrack betting offices in New York City reported that betting had slipped slightly to $2.6 million a day from $2.7 million a day a year before, a drop of 2.6 percent. On Long Island, the decline measured 2.8 percent; at upstate OTB offices, 2.7 percent.

 But one betting location thrived: Yonkers Raceway handled bets on races televised from Belmont Park for its full meeting, and reported a rise of 237 percent in bets, to an average $446,562 a day this year from $132,619 a day last year.
Since Belmont receives a share of offtrack bets, the bottom line for its 66-day season managed a slender gain. Last year, $7.41 million a day was bet on the average; this year, $7.42 million.
"We are happy to see business reach this level," Gerard J. McKeon, president of the New York Racing Association, said in a statement focusing largely on some of the season's memorable races. "The thrilling finishes in the Belmont Stakes and the Mother Goose gave racing fans everywhere a weekend to remember. The rematch between Lite Light and Meadow Star in the Coaching Club American Oaks was icing on the cake.
"The slippage on track can be directly attributed to the resumption of the Yonkers simulcast. With Yonkers in operation for the full meet this year, it figured that ontrack business would suffer somewhat. We now look forward to what promises to be a memorable Saratoga meeting, including hopefully a rematch between Strike the Gold and Hansel in the Travers Stakes."
 
Extra Factor
 But his deputy, Gerald Lawrence, the executive vice president of New York racing, said that the extra week at Saratoga might dilute any immediate gains.
"We are moving into uncharted waters," Lawrence said. "We've never run a five-week meet upstate before. We aren't sure what effect the poor state of the economy will have on vacationers, and we certainly don't know the type of weather we will have. All of those will have a significant impact on attendance and handle for the meet."
Saratoga usually draws more people and money than Belmont. Last year, after Belmont had averaged $7.41 million in bets during its spring and summer season, Saratoga averaged $10.1 million during its four-week season.
Bets on the races at Saratoga also can be placed at the otherwise empty Aqueduct track in Queens, which will open each afternoon just to handle wagering on races televised from upstate. Parking and admission are free, and concession stands will be open. But the horses will be racing 200 miles to the north.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Course for Israel

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and its Arab allies have strewn the field with traps. Just the same, the best available course for Israel seems to be to move toward direct talks with the Arab states, walking with exquisite care every step of the way and ready to cut out at the first sign of betrayal.
Israel, deliberately and outrageously being isolated and squeezed by Washington, faces one of the most difficult decisions in its lifetime of difficult decisions. Those who wish Israel well owe it to her and themselves to separate out the ingredients of the Middle Eastern stew -- hope from hypocrisy, truth from lie, opportunity from suicide. 
 The assumption that every Israeli or friend of Israel should make is that Hafez al-Assad of Syria, that clone of Saddam Hussein in aggression and terrorism, has not suddenly surrendered his goal: the eventual destruction of Israel. The assumptions must also be that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has not overnight moved from political medievalism into the age of enlightenment and that King Hussein of Jordan remains available to the highest bidder, never for sale but always for lease.
Sadly, it also remains true that the Bush Administration still has a spiritual affinity for Arab rulers and oil men but bares its teeth when Jerusalem shows independence of mind, otherwise known as intransigence.
So Israel is asked to enter talks with its sworn enemies, under the sponsorship of the U.S., which never has been less friendly, and of Moscow, which never was friendly, and with the attendance of the U.N., which is rancid with anti-Israel passions.
What's worst, the present U.S. Administration would prefer Israel pushed back to its pre-1967 borders. From those borders, Syrians fired down incessantly from the Golan Heights -- and Jordanian troops took pot shots at Israelis from across the street in East Jerusalem.
So why even suggest that Israel now accept the American plan for a quick conference, to be followed by direct negotiations? The reasons are at least four:
l. Because Israel has always said that the only way to reach peace is through direct negotiations with the Arab countries. To refuse outright now would wither something Israel has cherished that is almost unknown in the Mideast: trust in its word.
2. Because there is the possibility, however meager, that direct talks with Palestinians would give some of them the courage to break from the murderous Palestine Liberation Organization and lead Palestinian Arabs to the solution of self-government. (That in itself would be a risk for Israel, which would have to make sure that it did not turn into the independence that could be the launch for Arab attacks.)
3. Because someday Mr. Assad will outsmart himself. The Syrian President, who murdered thousands of his own subjects in the city of Hama, will wind up dispensed with by his countrymen. Then it would be easier for his successors to deal directly with the Israelis if the precedent had already been set by Mr. Assad himself. That could be the beginning of the real Mideast turning point.
4. Because accepting the American plan might prevent Israeli-haters in the U.S. Government and the weeping-crocodile "friends" of Israel among American Jews from crippling Israel economically and forcing it to turn away Jews fleeing Communism, or African and Arab dictators.
Those are my own opinions. But it is important to me that when I called him I found they were also the conclusions of the man whose thoughts probably mean most to foreign supporters of Israel, Jew and non-Jew -- Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Laureate and a friend.
While on friendship: It may be that Prime Minister Shamir thinks differently and turns down the U.S. plan, or later sniffs the air and walks out. Most of the American press, plus the hate-Israel mob and the crocodiles, will howl for the U.S. to put the boot to Israel. Then it will be the duty of the friends of Israel and of political democracy to oppose them.
No, that is not because we support Israel right or wrong. It is because Israel will still be the only democracy in the Middle East, because it has political and ethical ties with America that the hero of Hama could never understand, and because it is better to trust a democracy even at times of disagreement than a mass murderer -- anytime.

Of Three Unlikely Allies and Their Conflicts

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

The Big Three
Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin in Peace and War
By Robin Edmonds
608 pages. Illustrated. W. W. Norton. $27.95.
 
The Juggler
Franklin Roosevelt as Wartime Statesman
By Warren F. Kimball
304 pages. Illustrated. Princeton University Press. $19.95. 
 For the generation that came of age during the cold war, it must be hard to imagine that there was once a grand alliance between Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union. During World War II, people in these countries mourned one another's military losses and cheered one another's victories against Nazi Germany. The Iron Curtain had not yet descended over Europe, and Stalin was sometimes referred to (half-jocularly and half-ironically) as Uncle Joe.
The event that forged the alliance was Germany's invasion of Russia in June 1941. Before then, the cynical Soviet-German nonagression pact of August 1939 had been greeted with fear and dismay by Britain and the United States. After that pact, the attitude toward Hitler and Stalin, the two dictators, was best summed up in David Low's brilliant cartoon of Sept. 20, 1939, titled "Rendezvous." It showed Hitler, standing on corpses, bowing to Stalin, saying, "The scum of the earth, I believe," and Stalin, bowing in return, replying, "The bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?"
In "The Big Three," a well-documented history, Robin Edmonds had the bright idea of explaining the war through the personalities and activities of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin. Mr. Edmonds, who fought with the British Army in the African and Italian campaigns and later held high posts in the British Foreign Service, including Assistant Under Secretary of State for American affairs, uses his strong background to good effect. The book deserves praise for its readability as well as for its usefulness as a reference work.
To illustrate the opposition that Churchill had to overcome in Britain even while it was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, Mr. Edmonds recalls some of his own personal experiences. Just before Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he was present at a dinner given by a prominent Tory, Charles Londonderry, who was an open admirer of Hitler's Third Reich. Londonderry presented Mr. Edmonds with a copy of a book he had written in defense of appeasement; it expressed his gratitude to Hitler, Hermann Goring and Joachim von Ribbentrop "for their repeated kindnesses and hospitality." The story makes the point that members of the appeasing aristocracy tried to undermine Churchill.
Mr. Edmonds assesses the three wartime leaders. Stalin remains a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. Nevertheless, the three worked together, despite their occasional clashing views about military operations and, especially, about the shape and colors of the map after the war: a New World Order for their time.
The political differences between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin were not confined to the obvious gulf over Marxist ideology. Mr. Edmonds says that had Roosevelt lived, he and Churchill would hardly have seen eye to eye about the postwar role of the British Empire. Roosevelt regarded Churchill's view of colonial matters as "mid-Victorian."
The American President's attitude toward Stalin was laced with pragmatism. Optimistically, he thought the United States and the Soviet Union could work out their political and economic differences. As for Stalin, his attitude about the military aspect of the alliance was best expressed a few days after the Second Front had finally been opened by the Anglo-American invasion of Normandy in June 1944. Of D-Day, Stalin said, "History will record this event as an achievement of the highest order." But as postwar events proved, political dominance on Russia's borders was another matter to Stalin.
Taking the long view, Mr. Edmonds says the Big Three's two main achievements should not be overlooked: Hitler's Germany was defeated and a world body was created, the United Nations, that the author sees growing in influence and respect today.
President Roosevelt receives high marks for his wartime statesmanship from Warren F. Kimball in "The Juggler." In a bold analysis, Professor Kimball, who teaches history at Rutgers University, advances the notion that while Roosevelt often seemed to be inconsistent, he was actually a Wilsonian idealist with a fixed vision for a more democratic world. He described himself as a juggler in 1942 to Henry Morgenthau Jr., his Secretary of the Treasury, but explained that even if he appeared inconsistent, he was willing to mislead and tell untruths to help win the war.
The author says that despite the efforts of some historians to turn Roosevelt into "a belated but convinced cold warrior," he, unlike Churchill, took a conciliatory approach to avoid an East-West confrontation. In a memorandum to Churchill shortly before he died, referring to conflicts over German surrender talks at Bern, Roosevelt said, "I would minimize the general Soviet problem as much as possible because these problems, in one form or another, seem to rise every day and most of them straighten out as in the case of the Bern meeting." In contrast, Mr. Kimball says, once Harry S. Truman succeeded Roosevelt, "there was a sharp reversal of Presidential policy" toward the Soviet Union.
The great might-have-been is whether postwar Soviet-American relations would have been different had Roosevelt lived. All through "The Juggler," Professor Kimball is unafraid to speculate -- and give President Roosevelt the benefit of any doubt. His lively history draws this conclusion:
"It is easy to mock and condemn Roosevelt for his attempts to create a cooperative relationship with the Soviet Union, particularly in the light of Stalin's crude brutality. Even if the cold war was inevitable because of Stalin's actions, which is by no means certain, F.D.R.'s attempt to work with the Soviet Union makes more sense than the belligerent, confrontational approach that was the alternative."

HEADLINE: Blacks Are Found to Be Still Scarce in Advertisements in Major
Magazines

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Two decades after the civil rights movement began prodding the communications media to increase and diversify their depictions of members of minorities, blacks remain nearly invisible in the advertising of major national magazines, a comprehensive study has found.
 Although blacks make up 12 percent of the United States population and more than 11 percent of all magazine readers, they appear in only 4.5 percent of all magazine advertisements and constitute a little more than 3 percent of the 
characters in those advertisements, according to a study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.
 In some periodicals, including Time, Esquire and Vogue, the proportion of advertisements featuring blacks has actually declined over the past 20 years, and in most magazines, a large proportion of the blacks are depicted as athletes, musicians or objects of charity.
 Concluding that "stereotyping, under-representation and de facto segregation continues to exist" in advertising, the Department of Consumer Affairs said it would ask the nation's magazine publishing companies, the largest of which have their headquarters in New York, to establish goals for improved representation of blacks and other minority members.
 
Who Makes the Choices?
 The slippage in black representation in magazine advertising lends support to a theory heretofore cautiously advanced by marketing experts: Marketers' improving ability to reach specific consumer targets in specialized media is leading to the disappearance of minority images in many media with broader appeal.
 Publishing and advertising agency executives said that any responsibility for
changing minority representation in print advertising resided with the agencies, not the magazines.
 "Magazines don't create advertising," said Michael A. Clinton, the publisher of GQ, the men's magazine. "The creative choices fall in the hands of the ad agencies. They determine who the talent is, what the target is and what the image should be."
 Several publishing and advertising executives questioned why the city's Department of Consumer Affairs felt that a study of national magazines was within its jurisdiction.
 Mark Green, the commissioner of consumer affairs, responded that it was within his department's mandate to investigate the issue because "minority consumers are being hurt, and so many magazines and ad agencies are located in New York."
 "It affects the way whites and blacks see each other," he added. Mr. Green did an earlier study that found that people in poor neighborhoods in New York pay more for food in local groceries than do other consumers.

 
Resisting 'Police' Role
 Mr. Green said he would send letters this week to 17 magazine publishers in New York and ask them to take "a visual-image pledge to integrate their content."
 But several magazine executives interviewed said it was not their role to police advertising.
 "He will have a very receptive audience among magazines for the message of this study, but the hot button is with the agencies and the advertisers," said James R. Guthrie, the executive vice president of the Magazine Publishers Association. "What they're talking about here is the message -- do you have a fair, representative proportion? For that, you talk to the people who are manufacturing the message."
 The report, which is scheduled to be released today but was provided in advance to The New York Times, comes at a time of particular sensitivity over the portrayal of blacks in the media. In several cities, including New York,
Baltimore and Chicago, angry black inner-city residents have painted over billboards promoting cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to black consumers.
 
Ruling Is Appealed
 And last January, a Federal appeals court ruled that The New York Times could be sued for racial discrimination under provisions of the Federal Fair Housing Act because of the lack of minority members in its real estate advertisements. The ruling came in a case filed against The Times in 1989 by several advocates of open housing.
 The Times has appealed the ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to the United States Supreme Court, said George Freeman, a senior attorney for the newspaper. A similar suit filed against The Cincinnati Enquirer was dismissed by the lower court but is under appeal to the Sixth Circuit.
 Advertising executives and marketing experts offered several explanations for the scarcity of minority faces. Some cited the continually improving ability to segment the consumer audience into small demographic slices and to direct
advertising at these niches through specialized publications and other media. Such "narrowcasting," as this targeting process is called, may allow marketers to ignore minority members in advertising designed for their broader market, which the advertisers tend to think of as white.
 "The argument is always on the side of going with the white images in the white media," said Caroline R. Jones, the president of Caroline Jones Advertising, a New York agency that specializes in marketing to black consumers. "People want to talk to the consumers they want rather than the consumers they have or the consumers they could have. And the consumers they want are 'people like me.' "
 
A 'Best Efforts' Clause
 In television, minority members are more prevalent in advertising. Blacks constituted 7.5 percent of all actors in television commercials in 1987, according to the Screen Actors Guild. The agreement between the guild and its sister union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, and the American Association of Advertising Agencies contains a clause requiring that "best efforts" be made to cast minority members in commercials.
 John E. O'Toole, the president of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies, said that because most magazine ads were created for publication in many periodicals but use only a single character marketers tended "to choose the model that reflects the majority of their constituency, which for most consumer products is white."
 Still others said the low representation of blacks in magazine advertisements was due to the spirit of the times. Roy J. Bostock, the chief executive of the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles advertising agency, which represents General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Burger King, said he believed that "sensitivity to the representation of minorities in advertising" existed in the early and mid-1970's, but "that sensitivity waned somewhat for some agencies and advertisers during the Reagan years."
 
Economic and Social Sense
 Mr. Bostock added that increased minority representation in advertising made economic as well as social sense for their clients.
 "The mythology of the American family being a white Mom and Dad and two kids living in the suburbs is just that -- mythology," he said. "The Hispanic population is growing. The Asian-American population is growing. Blacks are
becoming more significant economically. It's very important for marketers to track these population trends and reflect them in the advertising they create. It increases the persuasiveness of the advertising."
 To reach its conclusions, the Department of Consumer Affairs surveyed all the advertisements with photographs or drawings of people in 27 national magazines, randomly selecting nine issues of each published from July 1988 to July 1991. In cases where a given issue of a magazine contained a small number of advertisements, extra issues were added to the survey. A total of 11,391 advertisements, with 21,607 models, were reviewed.
 Only 674 of these models, or 3.15 percent, were black. One hundred ninety-five -- less than 1 percent -- were Asians, who constitute 3 percent of the American population. Of the 11,391 advertisements, 10,725 featured only white characters.
 
Lagging Behind the Readers
 The study found a similar dearth of black and Asian models in catalogues from mail-order companies. Of 22,685 models featured in 157 catalogues, 4.6 percent were black.
 For some magazines, the depiction of blacks lagged far behind their
representation among the readership. Almost one-quarter of the readers of GQ are black, according to the Simmons Market Research Bureau; yet only 2.9 percent of the models in the magazine's advertisements were black. In the women's fashion magazine Vogue, only 1.6 percent of the advertising models are black, compared to 14.6 percent of the readers.
 The study found a significant decline in some magazines in black advertising representation in the past decade. A review of 24 randomly selected issues of Time from 1988 to 1991 found that 7.6 percent of the advertisements featured blacks. A separate study, published in the research journal Public Opinion Quarterly in 1984, found that in 1980, 11.4 percent of Time's advertisements featured blacks.
 The magazines surveyed were Better Homes and Gardens, Business Week, Cosmopolitan, Esquire, Family Circle, Fortune, GQ, Good Housekeeping, House and Garden, Ladies' Home Journal, Lear's, Life, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Money, Newsweek, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, New York Woman, People, Self, Seventeen, Sports Illustrated, Time, Vanity Fair and Vogue.

Goodyear Reports Fuel-Saving Tire

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, July 23

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company said it had developed a new automobile tire that would help the environment by reducing fuel consumption and related exhaust emissions. Goodyear said the new tire, called the "Invicta GFE," for greater fuel economy, employed a new rubber chemistry that allowed a 4 percent reduction in gasoline usage by cutting rolling resistance. 
 The company said it would introduce the tire in September in several large markets. Goodyear said the tire would be priced slightly higher than its most popular consumer tires. The tire will be produced at plants in Lawton, Okla.; Union City, Tenn., and Valleyfield, Calif. Goodyear's stock fell $1.25 a share, to $37, today on the New York Stock Exchange.

A Country Is Plucked Clean, and the Feathers Fly

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, July 19

 BODY:
Here in one of Africa's poorest countries, tens of thousands of people have suddenly found their pockets even emptier than usual. As it happened, they were tricked into practically giving their money away.
They were among those who placed their faith -- and the equivalent of millions of dollars in savings -- in an investment swindle that promised returns of up to eight times their original money. 
 A few won big, but far more were losers in what is being called the most spectacular financial debacle in this Central African nation's history.
The investment-swindle story in Zaire has everything -- big money, violence, a whiff of political scandal, reputations being made and unmade overnight. Above all, the scandal is expected to have an influence on whether Zaire's longtime President, Mobutu Sese Seko, remains in office.
 
Some Lose Their Homes
 "Everybody invested money, and I mean everybody," said Jerome Nelson, a longtime resident here who is president of the Zaire-America Chamber of Commerce. "I know people who lost their homes, their jewelry. "They sold their furniture and their cars. They would have even sold their souls if they could."
The swindle began in January when Michel Bindo Bolembe, a 32-year old small-time businesman, opened a shop in La Cite Indigene, the sprawling district where most of Kinshasa's nearly four million people live.
The lure was deceptively simple: people who deposited money in Bindo shops were promised a 100 percent return on their investment in four days, or 800 percent in 45 days.
And at first it worked.
"I played it and won three times, but lost the fourth time," Mr. Nelson said, "and the truth is, a lot of other people won a lot of money."
In fact, according to charges recently brought against Mr. Bolembe, it was a classic pyramid scheme, with money from new investors used to pay off old ones.
In Zaire, as in most countries, such "Ponzi schemes," as they are commonly known, are illegal. But here as elsewhere the gullible find the lure of easy money difficult to resist. This time, it seems that a substantial part of a nation was fooled.
"In a country as poor as we are, someone who promises something for nothing is irresistible. " said Buana Kabwe, chairman of the Zaire League of Human Rights. "A lot of people invested their life's savings."
 
More Money Pours In
 Before long, as news spread that some people were indeed being paid huge sums, more money poured in. At its height, the swindle's popularity was so great that people reportedly slept outside Bindo shops to keep their place in line.
In his dizzying rise, Mr. Bolembe, at first a rather mysterious figure, became something of a folk hero. The Government-controlled news organizations gave his scheme fawning coverage, and his credibility was enormously enhanced when he became a regular guest of Mr. Mobutu at the President's luxurious country estate in Gbadolite.
The fraud cascaded out of control on May 13 when the Bindo offices suddenly stopped paying. Within hours, the main office on the Avenue de la Victoire was burned down.
The next day, rioting broke out among students who feared -- with some justification -- that they might have thrown away their meager scholarships in hopes of easy riches.
At one point, the rioters seized and dragged Isalu Isanga, Zaire's Minister of State for Primary and Secondary Education, from her car. She was stripped beaten, reportedly raped and paraded through a campus. In addition, three students were reported to have been killed and two soldiers burned alive.
Western diplomats here say that the Bindo fraud has added fuel to an already overheated national economy. Inflation in Zaire, by some accounts, is running at 600 to 800 percent a year.
 
President May Be Loser
 A big loser may have been President Mobutu, who has ruled this country of 36 million since coming to power in a coup 26 years ago. The seizing of power by Mr. Mobutu, then a major general, followed five years of fratricidal fighting among post-independence leaders considered either pro-Soviet, pro-Western or even neo-colonial.
"There's no way this could have happened without Mobutu being involved, no way," said Nguza Karl-i-Bond, a former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, who over time has become one of President Mobutu's severest critics.
It is a refrain increasingly heard here from those who complain that the Government never expressed concern about Mr. Bolembe's frantic activity or unusual behavior, even when he began buying time on the state-controlled radio and television stations. One jingle ran: "Take part in Bindo promotion and solve all your problems!"
 
Mobutu Denies Involvement
 Mr. Mobutu has adamantly denied any involvement in the scheme and spokesmen emphasize that the Government took swift action against Mr. Bolembe as soon as it had hard evidence that his business was a sham. Mr. Bolembe was arrested and is awaiting trial.
But the scandal could hardly have come at a worst time for the Mobutu Government. Here in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, there have been rising protests in recent months against Mr. Mobutu, and the Bindo fiasco appears to have given critics added ammunition against his autocratic rule.
For now, the Government has sought to mute the rising criticism of its handling of the episode by promising to refund the money of all who invested in the swindle, a promise that skeptics highly doubt, given the parlous condition of Zaire's economy. Some investors have got their money back from Zaire's central bank, but by all accounts they are few in number.
"There's no way the Government can pay those people back," Mr. Kabwe said, "and a lot of people are going to be very angry when they find they've been duped again."

The Truths About Welfare

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
TO paraphrase Will Rogers, only one person in 1,000 knows how to untangle the welfare mess -- and you meet him every day.
Most Americans, it is safe to say, have strong views about the system that supports impoverished single parents and their children. But only in the last decade have social scientists generated hard evidence about what works in getting the poor off the dole, and what does not. 
 Now the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, the remarkable nonprofit organization behind most of this research, has summarized dozens of these studies involving tens of thousands of welfare recipients. And while the underlying message of "From Work to Welfare," to be published next month by the Russell Sage Foundation, is optimistic, it will not reassure those who want to believe that welfare dependence can be eliminated at little expense to taxpayers.
Social science research typically is not very scientific because it cannot be. Practitioners rarely have the luxury of comparing what is with what might have been -- the way, for example, cancer researchers test the effect of a new drug by comparing it with a placebo.
But the Manpower research corporation, created by the Ford Foundation in 1974, is anything but typical. Its research has been exclusively built on experiments in which programs are evaluated by comparing their effect on randomly selected participants with control groups. And the results of these experiments in the 1980's, analyzed by Judith Gueron, the president of the corporation, and Edward Pauly, a senior researcher, are striking.
A very modest public investment -- typically, help looking for a job, combined with a little work experience -- pays off handsomely. Arkansas's WORKnot an acronym, peter sez program, for example, spent an average of only $118 for each participant. But the public's savings in reduced welfare outlays averaged $503 a person over the first three years.
The catch is that welfare recipients themselves did not gain much: their average increase in earnings barely offset their loss in welfare payments. Indeed, Ms. Gueron notes, it is remarkable how many welfare recipients are eager to take jobs that leave them little better off.
Equally sobering, most of the beneficiaries were short-termers with just one foot in the welfare camp. Chronic welfare recipients, who absorb 60 percent of the total welfare budget, were largely unaffected.
The Manpower group evaluated the more ambitious Saturation Work Initiative Model, known as SWIM, in San Diego, in which a mandatory basic education and job training program was added to the simpler job search approach. At $919 a person, SWIM was relatively expensive. But it saved that much in welfare payments in just two years. And it cut a little more deeply into the welfare population, increasing people's earnings by $658 in the second year of the program alone.
Ms. Gueron suggests that SWIM was very well managed and that it is not yet clear whether its success can be matched elsewhere. But even if SWIM can be duplicated, there are obvious limits to the potential impact on poverty.
At best, SWIM-style programs gear up people to find and keep full-time unskilled jobs -- minimum-wage jobs that do not come close to raising out of poverty a mother with a child or two. Thus, if work is to be the primary answer to poverty, welfare-to-work programs are going to have to do more than teach people to read, write and punch a time clock.
The Welfare Reform Act passed in 1988 allotted about $1 billion a year for state-run experiments with programs likely to have a greater impact on chronic welfare recipients. Some of that money will be spent on variations of SWIM, to see if it works as well outside San Diego and if the payoff can be enhanced by tinkering with the components. Some will go toward even more ambitious efforts, in which states try to give welfare recipients the skills and motivation to fight their way into the middle class.
But these efforts are bound to require far greater public investments up front, and will take longer to pay off. The immediate worry is that state legislatures, pressed by budget deficits and record welfare caseloads, will not come up with the matching funds for expensive long-term experiments. Roughly a third of the Federal grant money available, Ms. Gueron notes, is not being used.
A longer-term worry -- for the moment, hypothetical -- is that taxpayers will balk. Expensive welfare-to-work programs may pay big social dividends. But unlike bare-bones job-search programs, much of the benefit may go to the poor rather than to taxpayers. And it is unclear whether Americans would support successful antipoverty programs that raise the cost of government. Finding out may prove the biggest experiment of all.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower After Day of Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most major currencies yesterday in a second day of light, uneventful trading.
Gold prices rose domestically after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery gained 50 cents, to $368.10 an ounce. Republic Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $367.50, up 15 cents. 
 Dealers said the dollar closed lower as traders sought direction on the state of the United States economy and the prospect for lower interest rates. Lower rates would tend to drive down the value of the dollar.
"There's been no incentive to either buy the dollar or sell the dollar or kick it out of this range we've been in for the past day or so," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston's New York office.
He said some movement could come today with the release of durable-goods figures for June and auto sales for mid-July.
Some dealers sold dollars after remarks by Michael Boskin, the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, about the prospect for lower interest rates. Mr. Boskin told a Congressional committee that the Federal Reserve would feel pressure to push rates lower if credit remains tight.
"I don't think there's anything immediate that could be taken from his statement," Mr. Lawrie said. "But I think the dollar started to look at the downside of the range."
Traders overseas said the dollar was hurt in European dealings by the release of higher German inflation figures. The report renewed speculation that the German central bank would raise interest rates to curb inflation. That would weaken the dollar against the mark.
In New York, the dollar slipped to 1.7575 marks from 1.7620 marks late Monday. In London, the dollar slid to 1.7555 marks from 1.7587.
The British pound strengthened to $1.6825 from late Monday's $1.6795. In London, sterling was quoted at $1.6845, up from Monday's $1.6810.
The dollar also dropped against the Japanese yen in New York, to a closing 137.25 yen from Monday's 137.65. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 137.52 yen from Monday's 136.65 yen, while in London, it was quoted at 136.95 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.5255 Swiss francs, unchanged.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
4 Big Agencies Will Share Work for Northwest Airlines

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
NORTHWEST AIRLINES joined the ranks of giant marketers using more than one large advertising agency when it announced yesterday that it would create a four-way "communications partnership" for worldwide advertising, marketing and promotional campaigns.
Northwest is hiring this shop quartet: the J. Walter Thompson Company, New York; Ogilvy & Mather, New York; FCB/Leber Katz Partners, New York, and McElligott Wright Morrison White, Minneapolis. 
 Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, would not discuss billings, but it is estimated that they could reach $90 million in the next year. Northwest's spending has fluctuated between $20 million and $60 million in the last three years, varying with the economy's ups and downs and the Persian Gulf war.
"It became obvious to us we needed to present a face, and communicate, on a global basis," Christopher E. Clouser, senior vice president of communications and advertising, said in a telephone interview from Northwest's offices in Minneapolis. The joint task of the four agencies, he added, will be "to produce the operating and communication strategy for a global brand."
While specific assignments for each agency are still to be determined, Mr. Clouser described this general lineup: domestic and international advertising aimed at consumers, to Thompson; the Trump Shuttle, assuming Northwest's deal to manage it goes through, and a second, undisclosed project, to Ogilvy; direct-marketing campaigns aimed at business travelers and frequent flyers, to FCB/Leber Katz, and corporate identity, to McElligott Wright.
Hiring two or more agencies to work on huge accounts has become popular in the last couple of years. Among those doing so are McDonald's, which splits its account between the Leo Burnett Company and DDB Needham Worldwide; I.B.M., which employs Wells Rich Greene BDDP and Lintas New York, and Burger King, which has on its roster Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising and D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles.
"This is a pretty bold experiment," said Tony Wright, president of McElligott Wright, "to choose four agencies to work together to come up with big global ideas." Mr. Wright, who worked on the British Airways campaigns in Britain, said he would welcome the partnership because it was "tough to do great advertising that crosses borders."
 At Ogilvy, Bill Hamilton, executive vice president and creative head, said, "We're going into this with the idea we're going to work together to leverage the entire Northwest brand." It can work, he added, "if you have your head screwed on right and don't play N.I.H. games" -- meaning accepting the others' ideas instead of resisting them as "not invented here."
To help make the partnership work, top executives of the agencies will meet quarterly with Northwest officials. All will become members of a new communications board the airline will create. Mr. Clouser hopes new ads can appear in the next 90 days.
Northwest's decision ends a seven-year relationship with Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, New York, which handled Northwest's consumer account. "We're very proud of what we did," said Ed Wax, president and chief executive of Saatchi. "But this is a business where change is inevitable." The ad community had been speculating about an agency change since April, when Mr. Clouser and Peter Hoult, senior vice president of marketing and sales, joined the airline. Indeed, the company acknowledged in May that it was reviewing the status of its account.
Once Northwest decided to rethink its marketing communications in worldwide terms, Mr. Clouser said, that presented a conflict for Saatchi. Its British parent, Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., represents British Airways internationally.
 For Ogilvy, the assignment means "we're back in the airline business," Mr. Hamilton said. Its relationship with Eastern Airlines ended when Eastern went out of business this year. The Trump Shuttle account, which billed as much as $7 million to $9 million under Donald J. Trump, had been handled by Scali, McCabe, Sloves, New York.
Northwest's decision also puts Thompson back in the airline business for the first time since it handled USAir's account from 1978 to 1986. "It's exactly what we've been looking for," said Donald Sullivan, executive vice president of Thompson. The agency is known for its Pan Am campaigns from 1942 to 1978, including "Pan Am makes the going great."

HEADLINE: Yields on Short-Term C.D.'s Show a Mild Drop in Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on short-term certificates of deposit took another mild decline for the week ended yesterday. This followed a drop the week before.
The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., said the decline came despite an uptick in the rates on the Treasury's three-month bills. 
 "There is definitely a flat picture ahead for the nation's savers," Robert K. Heady, the publisher, said yesterday.
 
Yields on Treasury Bills
 The yields on the three-month Treasury bills were 5.6 percent yesterday, up from 5.57 on Monday, while the six-month bills held almost steady, at 5.74, a basis point below the 5.75 yield on Monday.
The largest change among banks in the New York area was made by Marine Midland, which raised the yields on its six-month C.D. by 15 basis points, to a yield of 5.6 percent. A basis point is one hundredth of 1 percent.
In additiion, Marine Midland cut 10 basis points from its yields on money market accounts, dropping them to 5.12 percent.
Dollar Dry Dock, a large savings bank in New York, lowered its three-month certficates by 6 basis points, to 5.81 percent.
Among commercial banks, the average money market account fell by a basis point, to 5.14 percent, while six-month certificates on average were up by a basis point, to 5.65.
Depositors at savings institutions saw the average yield on six-months certificates of deposit fall by 2 basis points, to 5.99, and the yield on three-month certificates of deposit dropped by a basis point, to 5.73 percent.
Yields on money market accounts tended not to change from the recent 5.54 percent level.
By comparison, at the 20 large regional banks around the country outside of New York, the average yields on money market accounts were down by 2 basis points, to 5.21 percent. For the six-month certificates of the 20 banks, the average was 5.71 percent.

HEADLINE: BUSINESSES AVOID SOUTH AFRICA TIES

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Despite President Bush's recent decision to lift economic sanctions against South Africa, most American companies that once owned businesses there say they have no plans to return soon, if at all.
Some companies that sold their businesses in South Africa, like the Coca-Cola Company, moved important operations to neighboring countries like Swaziland, and say they can serve the South African market from there. 
 Other companies, like the International Business Machines Corporation, sold their operations to local groups and signed agreements promising not to return and compete against their former operations.
"We have restrictions on whom they can sell to that we monitor closely, but we have no buyback arrangement and no right to compete with them," said Thomas Belz, an I.B.M. spokesman.
 
More Attractive Markets
 Many corporate executives also say that with the opening of Eastern Europe and markets elsewhere in the developing world, they find more promising opportunities for investment than in South Africa.
And many executives expect the 75 American city and state governments that have policies against doing business with companies that have ties to South Africa to keep those restrictions in place until South Africa extends equal voting rights to all citizens.
Indeed, on the day President Bush ended the sanctions, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York announced broad new rules that would limit city business with banks that have ties to South Africa. And Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, among others, said the President had acted too soon.
Groups opposing apartheid are also continuing to keep pressure on businesses to adopt a wait-and-see stance.
"If pressure at the state and local level continues, it just won't be worth it for a lot of companies to go back to South Africa," said Richard Knight, a researcher at the American Committee on Africa in New York. "And Bush's action angered some groups enough that there could be more pressure to pass local laws against involvement in South Africa, not less."
 
Move by Big Banks
 Against this backdrop, Citibank and other major banks immediately responded to Mr. Bush's move by restating their policies against making new loans to South Africa. And J. P. Morgan & Company, which only two months ago yielded to anti-apartheid pressures in deciding to halt trading in American depository receipts that represent shares of South African stocks, said it was not ready to resume normal relations.
In similar fashion, Coca-Cola said it would continually review its options but had no plans to return to South Africa. It withdrew from the country in 1986, selling a number of assets, including 30 percent of a large bottler and an 80 percent interest in a canning plant. It also closed a sales and marketing office.
Today, Coke continues to supply beverage concentrates to bottlers in South Africa and eight other African countries from the plant it built in Swaziland, a tiny nation surrounded by South Africa.
 
Agreements With Buyers
 I.B.M. and the Mobil Corporation said they have agreements with the buyers of the businesses they formerly owned in South Africa not to return and compete against them. Mobil's non-compete agreement with Gencor Ltd., a South African conglomerate that bought its 1,200 service stations and other assets, runs through 1995.
In general, the poor economic outlook for the near term and fears of violence are likely to discourage reinvestment by the companies that left and to curb investments by newcomers.
The Ford Motor Company, which had a 42 percent stake in Samcor, a company that employed 6,500 workers at a Port Elizabeth assembly plant, gave more than half its investment to a worker-owned trust and sold the rest to the Anglo-American Corporation in 1987.
At the time Ford pulled out, its operations had been only marginally profitable at best for more than a decade, and the company has no plans to go back, a company spokesman said.
 
'A Long Way to Go'
 That stance is shared by many other companies. "We enthusiastically welcome President Bush's action, but there is a long way to go before we get what everyone wants," said Sal G. Marzullo, administrator of the Industrial Support Unit Inc., a coalition of 57 American companies that have maintained operations in South Africa and 22 others that pulled out but still support American investment there.
The lifting of sanctions provides one immediate benefit for American companies in South Africa: the restoration of their right to receive Federal tax credits for taxes paid to the South African Government.
Under legislation introduced by Represenative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, the South African subsidiaries of American companies had been limited in taking deductions for such payments since sanctions began in 1986. That tax penalty was cited by companies like Mobil as a major factor in their decisions to pull out.
 
Expanding Relationships
 The end of sanctions might also encourage companies that had been developing trading relationships with South African companies to expand their activities.
"We had already been seeing a steady increase in the number of companies with licensing, distribution and franchising agreements," said Alison Cooper, senior analyst with the South Africa Research Service at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. "Some of that was from companies selling their operations, but it includes a number of computer companies that had never had operations there."
Most companies that stayed, like Johnson & Johnson, say their current investments are sufficient to serve the local market.
Another disincentive to investing in South Africa is the better opportunities elsewhere. Eastern Europe and many developing countries are competing for the same investment dollars. And some companies are heavily indebted or under severe competitive pressures in markets that are far more important to them than South Africa.

HEADLINE: Soviets, in Surprise, Apply for Full World Bank Status

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
In a move that surprised the White House and put new pressure on Western Governments to help the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government has applied for full membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The Soviet action, which was taken late Monday and announced today by both lending agencies, came less than a week after the leaders of seven industrial democracies endorsed in London a more limited "special association" with the I.M.F. and the World Bank for the Soviet Union. 
 Full membership would allow the Soviet Union, which is struggling to cope with a sharply shrinking economy and a growing foreign debt, to borrow from both institutions. Associate status would only permit the I.M.F. and the World Bank to offer technical assistance, such as the training of Soviet officials and advice on how to rebuild industries and create free-market institutions such as a modern banking sytem.
An Administration official said today that it was not clear to the United States why Moscow took the action at this point.
 
A Week in the Mail
 The letter, an I.M.F. official said, was dated July 15 -- the day before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union arrived in London. The Administration official said that the United States does not know why it took the Soviets a week to deliver the letter.
The United States opposes the Soviet move and still agrees with the views of Britain's Prime Minister, officials said. "Our position is as John Major outlined it in London -- that we would favor associate membership status and that full membership is premature," one official said.
The Soviet application has been sent for review by the 22-member executive boards of each institution. If they approve it, the application would then be considered by all of the 155 member countries of each agency.
A series of technical details concerning the size of the Soviet contribution to each agency would still need to be settled if membership is approved. The United States, which provides a fifth of the I.M.F.'s money and a little more than a sixth of the World Bank's money and has corresponding votes at each institution, could not block the Soviet application by itself.
 
Procedure for Associate Status
 By contrast, associate status for the Soviet Union could be approved by a majority vote of the executive board alone.
An I.M.F. official said a Soviet application to join that institution as a full member did not conflict with plans to offer associate status. Applications for full membership take one or two years to process even for small countries, he pointed out, and the I.M.F. could grant associate status in the meantime.
The timing of the Soviet application could not be worse from the Administration's perspective, coming as it does just a few days before the scheduled summit meeting between Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush and at a time when the United States is interested in giving the Soviet Union things, not denying them. "This letter raises the ante a bit more than we're comfortable with," an official said. "It's a bit awkward for us. The last thing we want to be doing at this point is denying something to the Soviets."
 
U.S.-Soviet Trade Treaty
 At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Union were redoubling their efforts to broaden their commercial ties by removing the last obstacle to ratifying a trade agreement that was signed here last year giving the Soviet Union favorable tariff treatment. Mr. Bush has not yet sent the treaty to the Senate for its approval.
After the agreement was signed, the Soviet Union passed laws on copyright protection that were stricter than those envisioned in the trade pact. But American officials said today that the two countries were working on a document in which the Soviet Union would guarantee that those provisions never take effect and promise to revise them with future legislation. If that commitment is given in the next few days, Mr. Bush is prepared to send the trade pact to the Senate before heading to Moscow, officials said.
In another issue of concern to the Bush Administration, the United States is insisting that the Soviet Union account for all of its intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe. The White House said today that the Soviet Union misled the United States about how many of these missiles it had deployed in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria before it signed the 1988 treaty that banned them. "This is not a new issue, but it is a real outstanding issue and we continue to press it," said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
 
How Many Soviet Members?
 Full membership poses a major policy issue for the I.M.F. This is whether the Soviet Union would join as a single country with one central bank or whether special deals would be struck with one or more of the Soviet Union's increasingly fractious 15 republics, some of which are trying to assert control over monetary and economic policies within their borders.
Another issue is the convertibility of the Soviet ruble. Although the I.M.F. does not require that a country's currency be convertible for the counry to join, it then makes convertibility one of its first goals.
Soviet membership in either institution would pose several thorny bureaucratic issues that could take months or years to resolve, I.M.F. and World Bank officials have said.
The World Bank, for example, has a fixed number of shares, and the Soviet Union would have to find a nation willing to part with some of its shares in order to join the organization. Industrialized nations own most of the shares and have traditionally been reluctant to give them up because their representatives on the World Bank's executive board carry votes in proportion to their countries' holdings.
 
U.S. Blocked Loans
 The United States controls 18 percent of the votes on the board now, and has used its resulting influence to block World Bank loans to unfriendly countries and to push for changes in the World Bank's environmental and other policies.
The I.M.F. does not have a limited number of shares. Instead, new members are simply asked to contribute a sum of money corresponding to the size of their economy, so that the total capital base of the I.M.F. is increased. New members also gain votes on the I.M.F.'s 22-member executive board in direct proportion to their contributions.
But the size of the Soviet economy is unclear, because Soviet statistics are unreliable and because much of the Soviet Union's output is of such poor quality that it cannot be traded internationally.
In addition to the size of a Soviet contribution to the I.M.F., it is also unclear what currencies the Soviet Union would use and how it would raise the money. The I.M.F. has traditionally required that new members pay a portion of their contribution in an internationally traded currency such as the American dollar or the Japanese yen.
The Soviet Union's reserves of gold and foreign exchange are not known in the West, but the country has been borrowing large sums abroad while Soviet enterprises have encountered increasing difficulty this year in raising money to pay the interest on their foreign debts.
The Soviet economy needs technical and humanitarian aid, a senior I.M.F. official who insisted on anonymity told reporters in April, because it had performed worse than the Fund's worst-case scenario in a major study completed only a few months before.

HEADLINE: Pepsico Earnings Up 8.8% in the 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Pepsico Inc., the soft-drink, restaurant and snack-food giant, said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 8.8 percent over the quarter last year.
Earnings were $318.3 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with the net income of $292.5 million, or 36 cents, in the comparable quarter last year. 
 The earnings were roughly in line with analysts' expectations but investors seemed worried about the recession's effects on Pepsico's varied businesses. On the New York Stock Exchange, Pepsi's stock closed at $29 a share, unchanged.
Sales in the quarter ended June 15 rose 11 percent, to $4.68 billion from the year-earlier $4.2 billion.
Hugh S. Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers, one of the most bearish of analysts covering Pepsico, described the company's performance as being helped by lower borrowing costs because of lower interest rates. Its net interest expense totaled $101 million in the latest quarter compared with $120 million the year before. But unforeseen factors hurt, as well, including a potato shortage that raised ingredient costs and thus hurt snack-food profitability by about $16 million in the quarter.
 
Restaurants Are Strong
 The strongest-performing sector of Pepsico's business was its restaurants, with the exception of Kentucky Fried Chicken, which reported a profit decline on an increase in sales. Soft-drink earnings performed well, although sales rose weakly in the United States market.
The worst-performing sector once was snack foods, which accounts for a third of operating profits. Pepsico's Frito-Lay products dominate the market with such brands as Doritos tortilla chips and Ruffles potato chips, but price discounting by smaller but growing rivals like Borden, Anheuser-Busch's Eagle snacks unit and Keebler have forced Frito-Lay to cut prices, too, thus hurting earnings.
Worldwide profit for the Pepsico's snack foods declined 7 percent in the quarter, to $206.3 million, with a 9 percent decline in the United States, to $158.2 million. Snack-food sales rose 12 percent, to $1.32 billion, with much of that rise attributed to strong growth -- 20 percent -- in the smaller foreign business; foreign profit, however, rose only about 1 percent.
 
Discounting Troubles
 Mr. Zurkuhlen of Salomon said that despite Frito-Lay's dominance of snack foods, the unit will find it difficult to maintain profits because of heavy discounting in supermarkets.
"Unless you've got them addicted in some way," Mr. Zurkuhlen said, "you can't continue to charge customers high prices, which is something McDonald's and Procter & Gamble are finding in the markets they dominate."
Restaurants performed well, led by Pizza Hut. Profit for the restaurant business grew 14 percent to $154.8 million, but Pizza Hut's earnings grew 22 percent, to $78.4 million. Taco Bell's increase was close behind at a 19 percent increase, but Kentucky Fried Chicken's sales declined 5 percent, despite a 17 percent rise in sales. Pepsico cited heavy price discounting in fast-food restaurants that sliced profit margins at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
 
Change at Pizza Hut
 Pizza Hut prospered despite the fact that company-owned stores open for at least a year had a sales increase of only 1 percent for the quarter and only 2 percent for the six months.
One factor is the growing Pizza Hut delivery business, which now accounts for an estimated $400 million in the second quarter out of perhaps $1.8 billion in sales at company-owned and franchised stores. Pizza Hut typically earns more money from a delivered pizza than a pizza in a restaurant.
While there are heavy start-up costs to buy automobiles and train drivers, the cost of a Pizza Hut delivery outlet, with smaller square footage and capital costs, is perhaps $300,000, compared with $600,000 to $800,000 for a sit-down restaurant, Mr. Zurkuhlen said. Labor costs are lower, too.
Soft-drink earnings, still accounting for more than 40 percent of profits, rose 10 percent to $256.3 million, on an 8 percent rise in sales to $1.72 billion.
The American soft-drink business performed fairly well, but second-quarter earnings rose 12 percent to $214.6 million, partly because year-earlier earnings were hurt by a $4.5 million bad-debt charge, principally for the troubled Circle K convenience-store chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year .

HEADLINE: Soviets Plan to Sell 30% Interest In Big State-Owned Auto Maker

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In a step toward capitalist reform, the Soviet Union is planning to sell a large stake in a big industrial corporation to a foreign investor, advisers to the Soviet Government said yesterday.
The state-owned company, the Volga Automotive Plant Association, is the country's dominant producer of passenger cars. Its no-frills Lada sedans, sold throughout Europe and Canada but not in the United States, are the Soviet Union's leading manufactured export. The Government intends to sell at least 30 percent of the company, a holding that recent Soviet press reports have speculated may be worth more than $1 billion. 
 Joint ventures involving foreign partners are numerous in the Soviet Union. But the sprawling Volga plant in the industrial heartland of Russia, where 120,000 workers turn out more than 700,000 cars a year, has been singled out to become the first big Soviet industrial company with large direct investment by a foreigner.
The planned privatization stems from talks between the Soviet Government and Fiat S.p.A., the Italian auto maker, which helped build the Volga plant in 1967; those talks have been reported in the Soviet and European press. And Fiat remains the front-runner to buy the stake of 30 percent or more of VAZ, the Russian abbreviation for the Volga auto works.
 
Help From Wall Street
 Yet the Soviet Government last month hired Bear, Stearns & Company, the Wall Street investment bank, to assist with the sale of the VAZ stake. The move is seen not as a rebuff to Fiat, but as a bit of capitalist savvy on the part of Soviet bureaucrats eager to obtain the highest possible price.
"The Soviets just want to make sure there is a free-market process for getting an industrial partner," said Brian Murray, a senior managing director of Bear, Stearns.
To date, privatization in the Soviet Union has been confined mainly to small, typically family-run establishments like restaurants, shops and trading firms. Proposals have circulated in the Soviet Parliament calling for the sweeping privatization of as much as two-thirds of the economy, but these are mostly just grist for debate.
Moscow trails Eastern European neighbors like Poland and Czechoslovakia in selling state-owned companies, largely because it lacks a popular mandate for bold reforms. To many Soviet citizens, a free-market economy is still associated with black marketeers and price gouging.
Accordingly, analysts say they doubt that the Volga deal will soon pave the way for a flood of similar transactions. Instead, they view the Volga works as an extraordinary property -- at least by the humble standards of Soviet industry -- that can attract a foreign investor despite the political and economic uncertainties in the country.
"It's unlikely that broad-scale privatization with foreign partners is going to take place in the environment in the Soviet Union today," said David Lipton, an economist for the World Institute for Development Economics Research in Helsinki.
Fiat recently hired Morgan Grenfell & Company, a London merchant bank, to help it place a value on VAZ. "It's all part of the game," said Gualberto Ranieri, a vice president of Fiat U.S.A. Inc., referring to the introduction of investment bankers in the negotiations. "But, clearly, Fiat is on the front line for this deal."
In April, Paolo Cantarella, president of Fiat's automobile operations, signed an agreement with the Soviet Government laying out guidelines for negotiations on the sale of the VAZ stake. But the Soviets are not prevented from talking with other interested companies, Government advisers said.
 
Close Ties to Fiat
 Fiat's links with the Volga works are deep and longstanding. The factory at Togliatti, 700 miles southeast of Moscow, was largely designed by Italian engineers and its first product, built in 1970, was a Soviet version of the Fiat 124, a small economy car. The city of Togliatti, which was formerly called Stavropol, is on a plain near the Volga River and was named for the Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, who died in 1964.
The relationship with Fiat remains a close one, including recent joint work on the development of new models. But with the thaw in cold war tensions, VAZ has broadened its links with Western auto companies.
Last year, VAZ selected the General Motors Corporation's A. C. Rochester division to supply emission-control systems for its export models. The five-year supply agreement, running from 1992 to 1997, is expected to be worth about $1 billion. VAZ needs the upgraded emissions-control technology to meet tighter pollution standards in the European Community, an important export market for the Lada. The new standards take effect next year.
The interest of Western auto companies besides Fiat in bidding for the VAZ stake is unclear, and Bear, Stearns said it had not yet approached other companies.
"We're always interested in opportunities, but we have not looked at other investments or projects in the Soviet Union other than supplying the emission systems," said John Pekarek, a spokesman for G.M.'s international operations.
 
Trying to Set a Value
 The sale of the VAZ stake will probably take place sometime next year. The delay will allow time for the lengthy legal and financial work needed to place a value on a big company in a nation where the concepts of pricing and private ownership are unsophisticated by Western standards.
Bear, Stearns must first work on valuing the automotive operations of VAZ, separating those from the workers' housing, hospitals and schools that VAZ provides for its employees in the company town. And the American investment bankers regard the estimates of the likely price on the VAZ stake that have appeared in the Soviet press as "sheer speculation at this stage."
Several layers of government must be consulted on the deal, including ministries of both the central Government and the newly vigorous Russian republic. And the uncertain political environment in the Soviet Union will be an additional risk for any Western company, whose hard-currency investment will go to VAZ for building new assembly operations and developing new models.
Still, for a patient company willing to bet that the Soviet economy will improve -- raising the living standards of its vast population -- and that the Government will make its currency convertible, the investment in VAZ could turn out to be lucrative indeed.
VAZ exports more than a third of its production, with most models selling for $8,000 to $10,000 in their foreign markets. By Soviet standards, it has been a pioneer, being one of the first factories, for example, to experiment with self-financing under which enterprises pay most of their own expenses and investment costs from the profits they generate.
But it badly needs foreign investment and know-how to catch up with Western auto companies and stay even with new competition in its export markets. Those rivals include the Proton automobile from Malaysia, designed with help from Mitsubishi of Japan. The Proton has been taking sales from Lada in some European export markets.
In the Soviet Union, by contrast, consumers wait for years for delivery of a Zhiguli, as the Lada is known in the domestic market.

HEADLINE: Democrats Use a Hearing To Berate Bush Economist

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
Sounding what is sure to be a campaign theme next year, Democratic lawmakers today berated Michael J. Boskin, the Bush Administration's chief economist, accusing the Administration of ignoring the nation's economic problems and of being callous to the plight of the unemployed.
While Mr. Boskin sat mostly silent before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, looking somewhat like a teen-ager being dressed down by the high school principal, one prominent Democrat after another criticized especially the Administration's policy of opposing unemployment benefits for people out of work more than six months. 
 "I hope you'll take the message back to the President," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, the committee chairman. "I mean, these people are hurting. These are Americans. The President reacted when he saw people abroad hurting. We ought not to do any less for our own people in this circumstance."
Some of the Democrats, demanding lower interest rates, also provided a preview of the Senate's hearings on the confirmation of Alan Greenspan for another four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
But Mr. Boskin, who like others in the Bush Administration has at times criticized the Fed's tight money policy, did not jump at the bait this time. He said the Fed should adopt a "wait-and-see attitude" on interest rates for the time being but should be "prepared to move" if the recovery proved more sluggish than expected.
Although Mr. Greenspan's current term expires Aug. 11, the Senate will not vote until after Labor Day to confirm him for another term.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Banking Committee, said in an interview today that his panel was so preoccupied with banking legislation that it would not have time to consider the Greenspan confirmation until Congress returned from its August recess.
Mr. Riegle said that while some witnesses representing organized labor would testify against Mr. Greenspan, and some Senators would criticize the Fed's policies, he did not know of any Senators who planned to vote against confirmation.
Mr. Greenspan will serve as acting chairman between the time his term expires and he is confirmed for another term, and the operations of the Federal Reserve are expected to proceed without change.
 
Rates Discussed in Passing
 Interest rates and the Federal Reserve were discussed in passing at today's hearing. Most of it dealt with the Administration's economic policy in general and unemployment benefits in particular.
The Joint Economic Committee, comprised of senior Senators and Representatives, does not have the authority to propose legislation itself, and its Democrats are thus freer than those on most other committees to criticize the Administration without accepting responsibility for specific alternatives.
Today, with Mr. Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, as their foil, the Democrats came prepared to challenge the Administration's argument that the recession was short, shallow and now over.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the end of the recession was news to the tens of thousands still out of work in New England and accused the Administration of "standing by while the economy has been staggering."
Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland, declared, "Oppression, deprivation, denial and disprivilege still remain very real impediments to millions of people in this country who, again, don't feel buoyed by the rosy forecast that you've painted."
The Democrats repeatedly pressed Mr. Boskin on the plight of about three million workers whose unemployment compensation has been exhausted. Normally, workers who lose their jobs get benefits for 26 weeks. In every other recent recession, Congress and the Administration have approved another 26 weeks of benefits for those who are still jobless, but the Bush Administration opposes an extension of benefits.
Congress may to vote this fall to extend Federal unemployment payments for an additional six months, but Mr. Boskin said he would recommend that President Bush veto the measure unless the spending was offset with cuts elsewhere.
"Are you prepared to offer any suggestions as to programs that might be cut in order to provide an offset?" asked Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn.
Mr. Boskin replied: "I think that's Congress's responsibility. You know, the priorities setting, et cetera. I wouldn't presume on that."
Mr. Solarz then said, "It's absurd to say that this is solely the responsibility of Congress. The President submits a budget every year in which his priorities are established."
 
Distinct Disadvantage
 Mr. Boskin was at a distinct disadvantage in such exchanges. On the one hand, while his advice on economic matters is highly regarded within the Administration, the policy is mostly set by others. On the other hand, he is savvy enough to know that it does no good to argue with lawmakers out to score political points.
In addition, the Republicans on the committee by and large did not come to Mr. Boskin's defense, although at one point, Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire said that "there's enough blame to go around" and that "to come down as hard as you have this morning, gentlemen, on Mr. Boskin is a little bit out of line."

HEADLINE: A Women's Chain Beckons to Men

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
When Sara Lee bought the Coach Leatherware Company in 1985, there were 6 company-owned stores selling mostly traditional sturdy handbags. The company has opened 48 more stores and stocked them with added luxuries like silk scarves and leather luggage.
Now, with some gentle prodding from its parent, which knows a thing or two about building brand names, Coach is moving to conquer the market for expensive accessories and extend the Coach appeal to younger consumers. At the same time, it has opened its first stores intended specifically to woo the affections of men. 
 True to its reputation for fastidious understatement, Coach is avoiding flashy advertisements and celebrity endorsements. Instead the company is hoping its boutiques will work as its main marketing tools and laboratories for new products like more shapely handbags in peacock blue, golden yellow and coral.
In May, the flagship Coach for Business store opened on the corner of Madison Avenue and 44th Street in Manhattan, and became the company's calling card to men. Regular Coach stores have long carried leather wallets and other small items for men, but the new store and another in Boston are the company's first with mostly men's goods. The store has sturdy leather attaches, briefcases, appointment books and desk accessories at $16 to more than $600.
Trying to expand a prestigious brand's market share is always risky, as companies like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent can attest. But corporate image consultants said that adding products and stores was a good if somewhat limited way to capitalize on the Coach name.
"Although it's not terribly well known, it's tremendously admired by those who do know it," said Stewart Owen, executive vice president of Landor Associates, a San Francisco marketing consulting firm. "That would certainly suggest to us that making the brand name better known is a good strategy."
The Madison Avenue store, with its stark neoclassic storefront and intimate interior lined with dark mahogany display cases is a discreet "Ahem!" aimed at the bankers, lawyers, journalists and business people who frequent Brooks Brothers, Paul Stuart and J. Press, the staid and starchy men's stores that are its neighbors.
At lunch hour, customers fill the slate-and-marble floor of the tiny shop. Many are fingering the silk ties, peering into the pockets and recesses of briefcases and surreptitiously sniffing the scent of new leather.
At least half the shoppers are women, perhaps not surprising since the company is betting that Coach for Business will both introduce more men to its products and increase sales to women.
 
The Numbers Are Good
 The company said the store has rung up sales of $3,000 to $4,000 a square foot since it opened, numbers retail sales experts say are impressive even by pre-recession standards.
Even so, Coach executives maintain that sales are not really the store's raison d'etre.
"Of course we're interested in strong sales there, but we're more interested in sending a message," said Lew Frankfort, who is Coach's decidedly unstarchy chief executive, despite his navy blue braces. "Coach for Business is a showcase that says while we're still a handbag business, we are now a full-range accessories company for men and women."
For those who want some visible sign of status, a tiny, detachable leather label stamped with the Coach logo does dangle from the straps or handles of many bags. But for true Coach aficionados, leaving the tag on is, well, gauche.
Although Coach probably contributed only $150 million to $200 million to Sara Lee's estimated $12.5 billion in sales for the year ended June 30, the parent company is grooming Coach's name in much the same way it cultivated Hanes, once a small hosiery company that analysts say is now probably Sara Lee's single biggest source of income.
Mr. Owen, the marketing consultant, said companies gained more control over the exclusivity of their brand name by opening shops that market their products. He noted that Hermes and Dunhill, two of Coach's competitors, used similar strategies.
By contrast, Gucci, with its interlocking G's, and Yves Saint Laurent, widely known by its YSL logo, gave licenses to too many products and outside manufacturers, shattering their cachet, Mr. Owen said.
"When YSL was on $2,000 and $3,000 dresses at the same time it was on a $19.95 men's polyester dress shirt, it destroyed the exclusivity of the brand," he said.
Mr. Frankfort views the mail order catalogue that the company started in 1980 as another good way to spread the name into the nation's most affluent homes.
"We'd continue the direct marketing even if it wasn't profitable because it gives us great access to the homes of those predisposed to buying Coach," Mr. Frankfort said.
Analysts say the hallmarks of Sara Lee can be seen in the new stores, the foray into the accessories business and Coach's recent switch to Kirshenbaum & Bond, the New York advertising agency that signed Donna Rice to endorse No Excuses jeans and has a reputation for innovative, offbeat concepts. Sara Lee bought Coach from its founder, Miles Cahn, in 1985.
 
Global Growth Potential
 "Coach clearly fits Sara Lee's strategy as a branded consumer product with international growth potential," said Paul Fulton, president of Sara Lee.
Coach's sales are expected to grow by 20 percent this year, but the company is not likely to challenge Hanes's leading position within Sara Lee. "The opportunity to make it enormous like Hanes is probably limited because of the high-priced, high-quality positioning of the product," said Nomi Ghez, who follows Sara Lee for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But it's still a very nice, fast-growing, prestigious business for them to be in, and they still have plenty of room to expand overseas."
Coach already has two stores in London and one in Stuttgart, Germany. Mitsukoshi, the prestigious Japanese retailer, has Coach boutiques in 19 of its stores in Japan, where Coach is the fourth most popular brand of handbag, after Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hunting World.
Coach sales in department stores increased by 5 percent last year, and now account for more than 60 percent of the company's total sales, Mr. Frankfort said.
Karen Katz, vice president and divisional manager for leather accessories at Neiman Marcus, said sales of Coach handbags had increased steadily over the years, although higher-priced purses by Chanel and Bottega Veneta are the stores' best sellers.
"Although it's basically the lowest-priced bag we carry," she said of Coach, "it offers the customer a powerful price-value relationship. It delivers a very high quality at a lower price."
 
Attention to Detail
 That quality is guaranteed by excruciating attention to detail. The cattle whose skin is used in Coach luggage, introduced in some stores last spring, are deticked daily and dine from special feeding troughs that keep them from bending their necks lest their leather be marred by wrinkles.
But even high quality is no guarantee that every new line will work out. One collection of understated men's ties and suspenders and ladies' scarves had to be sent back to the drawing board after Coach started selling them in 1987. Emblazoned with bridles and stirrups and other horsey paraphernalia, they too closely resembled Hermes scarves.
"We don't think imitation is the best form of flattery," said Mr. Frankfort, perhaps recalling the lawsuit Coach brought against Ann Taylor for producing a bag remarkably similar to a Coach. "But it was a compliment to know our American-made Coach products are good enough to be mistaken for a very fine European luxury."

HEADLINE: Anti-Japan Din in France Softens a Bit

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 23

 BODY:
Having upset Japan with repeated gibes and alarmed French fashion houses that sell to Japan, Prime Minister Edith Cresson made a point of asking to sit next to the wife of Japan's Ambassador to France at the first haute couture show of the season here this week.
As a public relations gimmick, it was a bit obvious. As a political insight, it was more telling. For the first time since taking office nine weeks ago, Mrs. Cresson seemed to recognize that her penchant for speaking her mind was the source of her growing troubles. 
 Strained relations with Japan is just one result of what has become known as her "langue crue" -- her "raw tongue." She has also questioned the sexuality of Anglo-Saxon men, sniped at her predecessor and provoked protests from stockbrokers and human rights groups with her choice of words.
 
Conservatives Drink It In
 The conservative opposition is delighted. But President Francois Mitterrand, her worried friend, mentor and boss, has dispatched a team of image-makers to advise her, while her own colleagues in the Socialist Party cringe every time she speaks in public.
Polls show that her popularity stands lower than any Prime Minister's in a generation; in the latest survey, just 18 percent said they were satisfied with her performance. Many women who welcomed the appointment of the first woman to serve as France's Prime Minister now express disappointment.
But by all accounts her problems stem less from what she has done. Even her political foes concede that she inherited an economic recession, labor unrest, an explosive immigration issue and no easy answers. Rather, the political issue of the day has become what she says and how she says it.
An elegant, strong-willed 57-year-old, she has never minced her words. And after she took over on May 15, her past frankness came back to haunt her. In a 1987 interview that was published only in June, for example, she proclaimed that 25 percent of English, American and German men were gay.
Complaints that it was unfair to dredge up old statements were soon forgotten. Her opening statement to Parliament disappointed her Socialist colleagues, but television viewers were more taken aback to hear her describing her male critics in the National Assembly as "machos and hyenas."
In a television interview, she also said she "didn't give a damn" about the Paris Stock Exchange, while she stirred a political storm in her own party and among human rights groups by using the word "charter" to describe special flights to be used to deport illegal immigrants.
Even her predecessor and fellow Socialist, Michel Rocard, did not escape her tongue. She said repeatedly that she was bequeathed problems that his Government had chosen to ignore; on one occasion, she raised eyebrows by indirectly questioning his patriotism.
Her views on homosexuality also got a fresh airing on the ABC News program "Prime Time Live" on July 18, when she noted in perfect English that "it exists more in the Anglo-Saxon tradition than in the Latin one." She added, "Well, it's a fact of civilization."
But nothing has caused more controversy than her attacks on what she describes as Japan's strategy of expanding its economic power to embrace Europe. "They are in a position to destroy any industrial target that they decide to destroy," she said last month.
On "Prime Time Live," offering an opinion more often thought than voiced in the West, she said Japan believed that "the Japanese market is ours and the rest of the world is for us also." She denied calling the Japanese "ants," but added, "I say they work like ants."
And she went on: "But we don't want to live like that. I mean, in the small flats, with two hours to go to your job and -- we want to keep our social security, our holidays, and we want to live as human beings in the way that we've been always used to live."
In Japan, her remarks prompted demonstrations outside the French Embassy, and on Bastille Day, July 14, rightist protesters decapitated her in effigy. Now, fearful of a backlash against their products, French fashion, perfume and liquor exporters are also complaining about her bluntness.
 
As for You Men . . .
 Until she sat next to Yukiko Kiuchi, the wife of Japan's Ambassador to France, at the Torrente fashion show on Sunday, Mrs. Cresson has given no hint that she is having second thoughts about the effectiveness of her style.
Rather, she has preferred to fault France's male-dominated society. "It has always been more difficult for a woman to do anything in France," she said. Asked if she believed that France was ready for a woman as President, she responded, "No, I don't think so, not for another 100 years."
One man, however, has been quick to jump to her defense. In a television interview on July 14, President Mitterrand said, "It is healthy to have a Prime Minister who speaks clearly, who faces up to problems and has the courage to deal with them."
Asked whether her appointment was not "a bad good idea," Mr. Mitterrand insisted that he was relieved to hear someone speaking the language of the people "after 15 years of technocratic language." He added, "There are plenty of people who are against her, but I am for her."
Increasingly, though, the question being asked here is, for how long? With legislative elections due before 1993, Mrs. Cresson was named to replace Mr. Rocard in the hope that her energetic approach would revive the Socialists' flagging fortunes. So far, Mr. Mitterrand has seen his own popularity slip to its lowest level in years.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
3 Media Companies Report Lower Profits in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Three big media companies, the Washington Post Company, Knight-Ridder Inc. and McClatchy Newspapers, reported lower second-quarter earnings yesterday, partly because of the soft advertising market.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 

Washington Post
The company said its profit tumbled 37 percent in the quarter, also reflecting one-time expenses for staff reductions at the flagship newspaper.
It earned $35.1 million, or $2.95 a share, for the quarter, down from $55.9 million, or $4.60 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 6 percent to $356.6 million, from $379.6 million.
The newspaper division's revenue dropped 10 percent. Advertising volume at The Washington Post declined 16.3 percent. Revenue fell 6 percent at Newsweek magazine and 9 percent in broadcasting, but rose 11.5 percent in the cable television division.
Earnings were also cut by a one-time $6 million charge for severance pay and related costs from the reduction of about 80 jobs at The Post.
The company's class B shares fell 50 cents each yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $223.50.
 
Knight-Ridder
Knight-Ridder, a newspaper and information services company based in Miami, reported a drop of nearly 7 percent in its second-quarter profit and said it might be unable to post a 16th straight year of growth in earnings per share.
Earnings were $41.6 million, or 82 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $44.6 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell nearly 4 percent to $569 million, from $592 million.
"The outlook for 1991 as a whole is clouded," said Robert Singleton, the company's chief financial officer. "We had hoped to have better results from our newspaper operations by now."
Newspapers in large markets are still struggling with advertising cuts resulting from the recession. Mr. Singleton said the company's performance for the year would depend on signs of an economic recovery.
"Unless the economy begins to show real vigor reasonably soon, the fourth-quarter improvement will not be sufficient to give us another year of earnings-per-share growth," he said.
The newspaper division's revenue was down 5.3 percent, to $486 million. Advertising revenue was down 9 percent, to $369 million, but the decline was partly offset by an 8.6 percent increase in circulation revenue, to $109 million.
Knight-Ridder publishes 29 daily newspapers, including The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Its shares rose 75 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $51.875.
 
McClatchy Newspapers
The newspaper and newsprint company said its profit fell 19.2 percent, mostly because of a fire at rental property it owns in Sacramento, Calif., where the company is based. McClatchy said the weak economy and a new California tax on newspaper circulation could hold its earnings for the year below the 1990 level.
Earnings fell to $6.3 million, or 22 cents a share, in the second quarter from $7.8 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. But revenue edged up 1.7 percent to $109.4 million, from $107.6 million.
Erwin Potts, the chief executive, said advertising volume continued to be soft in most markets.
The company, which publishes 11 daily and 8 nondaily newspapers, said 60 percent of the decline in earnings per share stemmed from a $1.3 million nonoperating loss before taxes resulting from a fire and cleanup at the rental property next to The Sacramento Bee's office.
McClatchy's stock fell 12.5 cents a share yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $21.625.

HEADLINE: Killing of 4-Year-Old Is Linked to Dispute at Pool

BYLINE: By JOSH KURTZ

 BODY:
A 4-year-old girl who was shot to death in a blaze of gunfire that left three others injured was the innocent victim of a feud that may have started at a swimming pool, the police said yesterday.
The child's pregnant mother, Eva Cade, and two other people were wounded in the drive-by shooting Monday night at 154th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Harlem. The shooting came the same day that Mayor David N. Dinkins announced plans to deploy extra police officers in neighborhoods plagued by shootings of children. 
 Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said one of the three people wounded in the dispute, Kevin Thompson, 17 years old, may have been the target in the shooting, which apparently stemmed from a dispute at a swimming pool. Mr. Thompson, who was shot in the head, was listed in stable condition but had not regained consciousness last night so police were unable to question him.
The third person wounded in the shooting, Sandra Page, 36, was treated for a minor gunshot wound to the leg and was released yesterday from Harlem Hospital Center.
Neighbors and relatives said the mother of the slain 4-year-old was particularly devoted to the child, whose name was Jameeka but was often called Meeka
"She wouldn't go anywhere without Meeka," Ms. Cade's sister, Ethel Frazier, said yesterday in the lobby of Harlem Hospital Center, where Ms. Cade, 36, of 2900 Eighth Avenue, was listed in stable condition with two gunshot wounds to the leg.
Ms. Cade was going to the grocery store to buy some medicine when she and her daughter were shot, her sister said. Ms. Cade, a widow, was unemployed, and her life revolved around her five children, who range in age from 1 to 19.
"I would always see her walking around with the little girl," said Mary Jones, a 15-year resident of the block where the Cades live. "She would take her to school, take her shopping, everywhere." Neighbors said Jameeka seemed to enjoy her special status as her mother's constant companion.

HEADLINE: Weicker Veto Withstands Vote in House

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 23

 BODY:
The Connecticut legislature failed tonight to override Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s veto and pass a budget for the fiscal year that began 23 days ago, shattering the two-party coalition that had backed the plan.
With no new budget plans in the wings, the outcome of the vote also pushed the state toward what some lawmakers described as a degree of chaos and turmoil that had not yet been seen in the state's budget struggles. 
 "It seems to me it's this or shut the state down," said Representative Robert Farr, a Republican from West Hartford, in an anguished speech on the House floor urging members to override the Governor's July 1 veto.
"Without an override of the veto today, I personally see little resolution of the problem," said the Deputy Speaker, Dean P. Markham, Democrat of East Hampton.
 
14 Votes Short
 The budget plan, which was originally passed on June 30 by simple majorities in the House and Senate, needed 101 votes in the House, or two-thirds of the 151 members, to override Mr. Weicker's veto. But only 87 lawmakers voted for it.
By sustaining the veto, the House, which is led by Democrats, killed the budget, which had been formulated mainly by the Republican minority. The Republican leader in the House, Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., said after the vote that many of his party members had said they would now walk away from the process and the idea of a bipartisan solution.
Mr. Weicker praised the vote sustaining his veto, saying that the House had done its job and that the key to the solution now rested entirely in the hands of the Senate, which has blocked every attempt at passing an income tax. Mr. Weicker proposed a wage tax for the state in February and has vetoed two budgets that lacked the income tax. "We've seen 'No! No! No!' in terms of the ideas or the action being taken," Mr. Weicker said in a news conference in his office after the 9:30 P.M. vote. "My hand is extended."
The Speaker of the House, Richard J. Balducci, Democrat of Newington, said he was not sure what kind of budget might be considered next, or even whether another two-week budget could be passed by the House to keep the state running.
The Senate earlier tonight approved a two-week resolution that would maintain state spending commitments through Aug. 11, and the House is to take up the measure on Wednesday. Many lawmakers said tonight that they would vote against another temporary spending plan, to exert pressure to find a solution by the time the current resolution expires on Sunday.
Mr. Weicker also said he was hopeful. "There is no reason under the sun why the State of Connecticut and the legislative branch cannot produce a budget," he said.
The day leading up to the vote was filled with last-minute warnings from Mr. Weicker's budget office about the "flaws" in the legislative budget and anxious appeals by income-tax opponents trying to gather the last crucial votes needed to build the necessary two-thirds majority.
Mr. Weicker's office, in pushing to sustain the Governor's veto, issued a four-page critique to lawmakers outlining what it called the "bad balancing," "bad policy," "bad planning" and "bad business" elements of the plan.
The critique said that unspecified and overly optimistic spending cuts, increased borrowing and additional business taxes would all work to give the state a worsened economy and a budget that would be out of balance from the first day of passage.

HEADLINE: Manor Offers Lessons On the Lives of Slave

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
For the fifth graders, it was an eye-opening discovery to learn how slaves lived and labored in New York's colonial era.
"Slaves were not treated like humans, even though they worked hard and were skilled in many ways," said 10-year-old Jeanne Marie Vinchiarello, after a visit to Philipsburg Manor, a restored 18th-century farm here. "They prepared all the food but were not permitted to sit down and eat." 
 Other students were impressed that 23 African slaves virtually ran the farm and gristmill for the often absent Dutch owner -- precisely the type of lesson that an organization called Historic Hudson Valley wants to teach as it reinterprets early American history to focus more on the contributions of African slaves, Indians and Caribbean traders.
"We've always used the Hudson Valley properties as a way of presenting 250 years of history, but the perspective was too narrowly focused on the industrious Dutch and English colonists," said John H. Dobkin, president of the organization, which has restored four landmark sites. "Now we have corrected the balance, based on years of research and created a more inclusive 'living history' of our region."
In fact, a state-appointed panel of teachers and scholars recently recommended sweeping changes in the teaching of American history in public schools to give more emphasis on the roles of nonwhite cultures.
Acting long before the report, Historic Hudson had adopted its new approach. The organization, Mr. Dobkin said, was expanding research, rewriting brochures and sending staff members into local schools like St. Joseph's in Millbrook, where Jeanne Marie and the other fifth graders are students. The group also arranges for students to visit the properties and learn about early American customs from the organization's interpreters, 60 men and women in period dress.
 
Major Gifts Pledged
 These activities coincide with another goal, to increase Historic Hudson Valley's endowment by $20 million to $42 million, said Nancy Gold, the organization's marketing director. The money will help support Philipsburg Manor, Van Cortlandt Manor at Croton-on-Hudson, Montgomery Place at Annandale-on-Hudson and Sunnyside, the Tarrytown home of Washington Irving.
Two major gifts have been pledged, $7 million from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest fund managed by New York Community Trust, and an additonal $5 million from Laurance S. Rockefeller, chairman emeritus of Historic Hudson Valley. Mr. Rockefeller has sought to broaden the group's financial base in much the same way as the support of Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia was expanded from a Rockefeller family activity to a more widely financed undertaking. Both the New York and Williamsburg restorations were begun by Mr. Rockefeller's father, John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Williamsburg also served as a model for the Hudson Valley preservation. Historians and staff members from Virginia helped the New Yorkers restore the properties, plan tours for visitors and set up an education program for schools.
The focus at Philipsburg is the interaction of Africans and Europeans, which has been largely ignored in history studies, said Radiah Harper Sumler, director of education for Historic Hudson Valley.
"Few people know trading ships from the Caribbean regularly sailed upriver with spices and cloth," she said. "Eighteen languages were spoken on the wharf. We had the seeds of New York City's multiethnic society long before we had an Ellis Island."
She is insistent on getting across that lesson to students, saying, "We owe it to the children we serve, African-American as well as white, to provide them with a sense of their heritage, so they can stand next to a buddy and know with pride they have a history and a proud past."
When Lee Hart, a 66-year-old interpreter, leads students through the barn where wheat is threshed and winnowed, Mrs. Sumler points out how the process resembles traditional African methods.
From Peter Curtis, a 41-year-old interpreter dressed as an 18th-century grist miller, students learned that some slaves were brought to the Hudson Valley because they were skilled in making farm tools.
"I can tell from the eye contact, they are surprised to learn slaves were not just field hands," Mr. Curtis said, "but they go home with an understanding that slaves had an important role here and, after the Emancipation, many likely gravitated toward work in the cities."
Historic Hudson wants to investigate further the history of the Philipsburg slaves with the help of scholars, including A. J. Williams-Meyers, executive director of the New York African American Institute at the State Univer sity of New York at Albany.
"Historians tend to focus on slavery in the South and glide over New York even though slavery existed here 40 years after the American Revolution," Professor Williams-Meyers said. A Federal census in 1790 found 21,324 slaves in New York, only 8,000 fewer than in Georgia, he said. The New York Legislature banned slavery in 1827, but some owners like the Van Cortlandts freed their slaves years earlier.
"Records at Philipsburg Manor give us a comprehensive look at their involvement -- they were carpenters and ship builders, millers and tool-makers -- and they helped New York develop one of the most prosperous economies of the time," Professor Williams-Meyers said. "It is important we recognize the interrelatedness of these people who shaped and developed our democratic society."

HEADLINE: Oregon to Stress Job Training In Restructuring High School

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Oregon has approved an education plan that would be the first in the nation to establish a statewide apprenticeship program and would make students choose between job training or a college preparatory curriculum after 10th grade.
The plan for Oregon's high schools, the most radical component in an extensive state effort to overhaul public education, grew out of increasing concern among legislators and some educators that public schools have done a poor job of serving students who do not go to college. 
 The plan was also intended to attack the state's dropout rate of 25 percent in high school (the national rate is 28 percent, according to the United States Department of Education) by giving all students more options. State legislators and business leaders also hope the plan will improve the quality of Oregon's work force.
"We don't have serious technical programs to prepare students for a high-performance work world in the 1990's," said Ira Magaziner, a consultant in the development of the Oregon plan and co-author of a study last year for the National Center on Education and the Economy that offered a model for professional and technical curriculums. "In our view, this is a significant step forward."
The legislation also provides for Oregon's primary schools to be ungraded, with students from kindergarten through third grade grouped by their abilities rather than by age; for expansion of early childhood education programs, and for allowing parents to choose to send their children to any public school in the state.
 
Introduction in Stages
 The education package, which was approved last month by the Legislature and is scheduled to be signed next Wednesday by Gov. Barbara Roberts, is to be installed in stages through the year 2010.
Despite its passage by the Legislature and the Governor's enthusiastic support, the plan has drawn much criticism, particularly for the dual-track idea for high schools.
Many educators express concern that it has the potential to stigmatize students who are guided into the job-training track or to discourage young people from pushing themselves to attempt the academic track.
But Vera Katz, a state representative who was the legislation's chief sponsor, said the bill carried an provision calling for the creation of a state monitoring committee to insure that students were not steered to various curriculums because of social or economic factors.
"The last thing we want to do is perpetuate tracking," said Ms. Katz, a Democrat from Portland.
Under the Oregon plan, loosely based on western European models, high school students would be required to demonstrate competency by the 10th grade in math, science, reading and other academic courses, using new assessment tools being designed by the state, not the usual standardized tests.
 
Movement Between Tracks
 After demonstrating competency, the students would receive a certificate of initial mastery. They would then proceed, with advice from parents and school guidance counselors, into either a college preparatory curriculum or one of several vocational, business or professional curriculums in health, computer operations and other fields.
Students who do not demonstrate competency in the academic subjects would receive extra attention and continue to work until they are able to demonstrate it, education officials said.
Once students enrolled in their chosen curriculum as 11th graders, they would be free to move between the academic and the job-training curriculums if they are unhappy with their initial decisions.
In the revamped high school, students would then receive a certificate of advanced mastery upon completing the 12th grade, although state education officials said it might take some students longer to receive their final certificates depending on the rigor of their selected curriculums.
"It's quite innovative, and there is much to be said for this approach," Bob Palaich, director of policy studies at the Education Commission of the States, an education research and policy organization based in Denver, said of the apprenticeship component.
"We have been fighting the dropout problem, and this approach essentially says, 'Let's try to get kids up to speed by the 10th grade and then give them options,' " he said.
 
Similarities With Bush Plan
 The Oregon education package has many features similar to the "Education 2000" plan of the Bush Administration, such as allowing parental choice rather than zoning children into neighborhood schools.
But the state's plan for high schools "goes a little further and is a little more expansive than the Bush plan," said Joyce Reinke, director of personnel development for the Oregon Department of Education who will oversee implementation of the plan.
Although educators generally support the idea of overhauling education, they and other critics have maligned the legislation's pay-as-you-go provision, under which the financing of each stage depends on future legislatures. That, critics assert, would allow officials to abandon aspects of the plan, such as early-child programs that are needed but may also prove unpopular among voters because they are expensive.
Critics have also opposed the bill's school-choice component. They maintain that choice programs require heavy spending to accommodate students whose parents cannot afford transportation costs to other schools without aid.
Given the pay-as-you-go feature, critics question the future resolve to pay transportation costs.
But the high school plan has triggered the most debate among residents, educators, legislators and the business community. The Oregon plan, supporters said, will better prepare students for life after high school, particularly those who plan to move into the workplace immediately rather than attend college.
"Our current system isn't working very well, so we might as well give this a shot," said Gary Carlson, vice president of Associated Oregon Industries in Salem, which represents the state's 14,000 to 15,000 businesses. "It sounds like a realistic approach."
Companies have become increasingly alarmed by the growing gap between the quality of high school graduates and the skills needed for a variety of positions that do not necessarily require a college degree but require more skills than current high school graduates have.
Indeed, a study last year by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics projected a healthy growth rate in jobs in the technical, professional and health areas, but many high school counselors say and students themselves acknowledge they lack the background to step into those positions.
 
Work in Both Tracks Envisioned
 State education officials and business leaders are still discussing how to set up the apprenticeship part of the plan, but they said they envisioned students in the business and professional track continuing to take academic courses while also enrolling in courses that include work-site training.
It is not the state's responsibility to guarantee jobs after graduation for students in the vocational track, said Julie Brandis, a legislative assistant for Associated Oregon Industries, the state's largest business group, which will help in writing the business and professional curriculums.
But, she added, "once business owners can see that these students can do the job that student is going to be hired."
The law allows participating businesses to take part in setting the curriculum for students who take their training from the businesses, state education officials said. Although it is likely that companies will have to spend some money for vocational courses, the education officials said many companies would welcome the opportunity to help tailor training programs.
 
Skepticism About Training
 But some educators and state officials said the business and professional component places unrealistic expectations on public schools.
"It is impossible for a public school to be an apprenticeship program for a particular profession," said William Liebert, special assistant to the superintendent of Salem Public Schools who oversees the district's vocational curriculum. Partly because of the expense, "we have not been able to keep up with the technological and changing workforce," he said. "That's a tremendous problem."
The Salem school district, with 28,000 students and the state's second- largest school system after Portland, currently has 15 vocational offerings, from woodworking crafts to health professions to office management skills, which cost an average of about $1 million a year.
Mr. Liebert could not estimate how much more money might be needed to expand and improve the program, but other educators and state officials say the sum will be significant.
Mr. Liebert is also among those who are concerned about the idea of two tracks in high school.
"I have a huge concern about kids being sterotyped as plumbers," he said. "Our school system is very concerned that our kids don't get stigmatized."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
REMEMBER the last time you picked up a numbingly expensive bottle of French, or Italian, or German wine and asked yourself: "How can they get away with this?"
The answer is, they don't always. Impact, a respected newsletter for people in the wine and spirits business, recently came out with figures that, it says, explain why. 
 They show that imports of table wines -- the kind drunk with meals -- were off 12.4 percent in 1990, better than three times the decline the same category of wines suffered in 1989. It was a bad year for the wine importers. And, to a lesser degree, for the people who made the wine they imported. Lesser because they do have other markets, some perhaps, more affluent then Americans are.
The figures for total imports are dramatic. In 1970 they came to 8.6 million cases. By 1980 they were up to 37 million. Five years later, in 1985, 47 million cases were imported. Then, in 1990, they plummeted to 21.3 million.
As usual, figures don't lie, but they don't tell the whole story, either. According to Impact and the United States Commerce Department, Italian wine imports were off 9 percent last year with shipments of almost 9.3 million cases of table wine. A lot of wine, you say. Yes, but bear in mind: the United States imported almost 25 million cases of Italian wine in 1985.
From 1970 to 1980, imports of Italian wines rocketed from 1.6 million to just under 23 million cases. Imports didn't stop going up until 1986, at which point they began to drop rapidly. In fact the decline was so precipitous that it averaged out to almost 9 percent a year for the decade. In a brief four years, Impact calculates that Italian wine imports to this country plunged well over 50 percent, to about 10.2 million cases.
What went wrong? The figures would seem to indicate some major disillusionment with Italian wines, a lemminglike flight to French wines, perhaps, or Californian. In fact, many good Italian wines did well all through the debacle and have continued to do so. What suffered so badly was one single type of wine: lambrusco, a semisweet, slightly fizzy concoction that is consumed cold, like beer and soft drinks.
The biggest name in lambrusco is Banfi Vintners ' Riunite. Last year, Banfi imported 2.5 million cases of Riunite into the United States, down 16.5 percent from 1989's 3 million. But in 1984, Riunite's apogee, Banfi brought in 11.3 million cases of lambrusco, almost as much as all the table wine imported that year from France. And Riunite was only one of several lambruscos with annual sales in the millions of cases during those golden years for the importers.
And where did all those lambrusco lovers go? Did they take the pledge, or switch to Perrier? No. They switched to white zinfandel, a California product best described as a semi-sweet, slightly fizzy concoction that is consumed cold, like -- but you already know the rest of the line.
 Wine enthusiasts, people who drink traditional dry table wines and sparkling wines, are only marginally affected by the marketplace tribulations of lambrusco, white zinfandel, apple wine, wine coolers, cold duck and other similar amusements. Often, in years when the overall picture for imported wines looked particularly dark, premium wines, including the most expensive, did well. People who buy rare Burgundies and famous Bordeaux may complain about prices, but they buy.
French imports were off 19 percent in 1990, dropping in one year from 7.5 million cases to 6.1 million. German imports were off 20.7 percent, Portugal 29.4 percent and Spain, which never shared in the boom of the early 1980's, was off 16.6 percent last year. In 1970, 876,500 cases of Spanish wine were imported. The figure was down to 687,000 in 1980 and 631,000 in 1985. Last year it was only 407,000 cases.
The winners were Australia and Chile. Australia's meteoric rise in the early 1980's has slowed considerably, but a 15.8 percent increase last year over 1989 was certainly respectable. Total cases: 491,000.
Chilean imports posted a whopping 57.1 percent increase last year over 1989, with 921,000 cases, making it the fourth largest table wine exporter to the United States after Italy, France and Germany. Almost a third of all the Chilean wine, 315,000 cases, came from one company, Concha y Toro .
It will be interesting to watch these wines over the next few years. They are good wines, some of them excellent, but their chief attraction is price. Wine enthusiasts have been snapping up good Chilean cabernets and sauvignon blancs for $5 and $6. But some Chilean producers are growing restive; they want to see retail prices at $10 and more.
In that range, competition is fierce. California, France, Italy and Spain all produce excellent wines in that price category and, as the Australians discovered when they pushed their wine prices up 30 percent and more, American wine consumers are very price conscious.
Importers acknowledge the flight to white zinfandel, but they also blame the slump on the weak dollar, the recession and the war in the Persian Gulf.
If high prices are at all a factor in the drop in imported wine sales. we may take some comfort in what might be called a retaliatory strike. Recently, Manfred Esser, the president of Cuvaison Winery in California, noted that the Restaurant Girardet, near Lausanne, in Switzerland, had his 1987 chardonnay on its wine list for $88. (Cuvaison is owned by a Swiss family.)
Mr. Esser was obviously pleased that Girardet, which is touted by some as the world's best restaurant, had chosen to add his and half a dozen other California wines to its list. We can all share in his pride and perhaps take some comfort in what Girardet's clients will be set back for these bottles: 1986 Grgich Hills chardonnay, $120; 1984 Grgich Hills cabernet sauvignon, $92; Robert Mondavi 1987 Opus One, $264.
 
TASTINGS
Landmark Vineyards Chardonnay, Alexander Valley 1989, Demaris Vineyard; about $17.
Landmark Vineyards was the first commercial California winery to make only chardonnay. Landmark was founded in 1975 by William Mabry in Windsor, in northern Sonoma County. In 1989, with once-rural Windsor turning into a split-level heaven, Landmark left. Because of money from the new principal owner, Demaris Etheridge, Landmark has a magnificent new winery in Kenwood, central Sonoma, not far from Chateau St. Jean. Landmark Vineyards Cardonnay, a single-vineyard wine from a 56-acre vineyard in the Alexander Valley, was one of the last wines made at the old winery. It presages good things for the new $5 million plant. The wine was fermented in oak barrels rather than large steel tanks. It's concentrated without being heavy-bodied. There is plenty of fruit, a minimum of oakiness and a variety of subtle flavors, none of which mar the overall impression of an exceptionally well-made wine. If your name is going to be identified with only one type of wine, it had better be good. If this wine is any example of what's to come, Bill Mabry is on the right track.

 BODY:

Single Portions
There are a number of new sources for prepared foods in and around the city. And what is striking about them is their emphasis on serving sizes for singles. One shop sells salads and such in small containers only by the portion, not the pound. 
 The Washington Market, 162 Duane Street (at Hudson Street), could be called the Washington Market Redux because it occupies the same space as a market of the same name that closed a few years ago. The new market opened last week.
Among the prepared dishes, some standouts are torta rustica of pastry filled with spinach, peppers, ham and cheese ($3.50 a portion), roasted peppers ($9.50 a pound), "Surprise" meatloaf with a hard-cooked egg inside ($5.95 each) and bacon, lettuce and tomato pasta salad ($9.50 a pound). Chicken salad with fennel and artichokes ($11.50 a pound) was light and summery, but needed seasoning.
In Chelsea, Food for All Seasons, 132 Ninth Avenue (18th Street), is a pleasantly rustic shop and cafe that sells everything in single portion sizes and does not post prices. The grilled vegetables ($2.75 a portion) are excellent, as is a cold puree of Swiss chard soup ($2.50 for a 12-ounce cup). Lentil salad ($2.75 a portion) needed seasoning and the lentils, like so many of the legumes used in salads around town, were undercooked.
Cucina and Company, specializing in prepared Italian food in the lobby of the Pan Am Building, 200 Park Avenue (45th Street), sells hot dishes cafeteria style, large or small portions of salads, sandwiches and pastry.
The sandwiches are the best, among them a New Orleans-style muffuletta with meats, cheese and marinated vegetables ($5.75); a roast beef sandwich with garlic puree and horseradish mayonnaise on peasant bread ($5.75) and an escalivada made with grilled vegetables and goat cheese on onion ficelle ($5.95).
And in Southampton, the Market at 75 Main, 75 Main Street, sells imaginative sandwiches and appealing salads like orzo with sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts ($7.50 a pound), a delicate cole slaw ($6 a pound) and a black-bean salad that tastes better than the coating of creamy dressing makes it look ($9 a pound). Excellent brownies are $1.75 each, a peanut butter and jelly muffin that needs nothing spread on it is $1.10 and superb fruit tarts are $1.75 to $3.50.
 
City Cakes
Breads baked by E.A.T. have been available in the Hamptons for a couple of years. Now William Greenberg Jr. Desserts is providing another taste of Manhattan with its cakes and pastries.
Trucks make weekly deliveries on Thursdays to Barefoot Contessa, 46 Newtown Lane, East Hampton; Wainscott Produce Company, Montauk Highway, Wainscott, and, occasionally, to Hampton Epicure, 103 Main Street, Westhampton Beach. These shops will accept special orders for the weekend if they are placed by Wednesday morning.
 
Coyote Food Shop
Mark Miller, the chef and owner of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., has opened a food shop adjacent to his restaurant. The Coyote Cafe General Store specializes in ingredients for Southwestern cooking. Gift baskets and kits for making fajitas or cornbread are also sold.
The store takes mail orders. For a catalogue, write to the store at 132 West Water, Santa Fe, N.M. 87501, or call (505) 982-2454.
 
Blueberries for the Picking
Blueberries are the easiest berries to pick. No stooping, no thorns. At Blueberry Park, Route 21, Wingdale, N.Y., in Dutchess County, Ed and Anna Thomkins have 50 acres of blueberry bushes for picking.
Their wild, high bush variety yields smaller but more intensely flavored berries than the cultivated kind. Mr. and Mrs. Thomkins say the bushes have not been sprayed or treated with chemicals. They provide buckets for picking but urge visitors to bring containers to take the berries home. The fee is 80 cents a pound for the berries on a pick-your-own basis.
The farm is open every day from sunrise to sunset and Mr. Thomkins expects that the berries will be available through the first week in August. For directions and picking conditions, call (914) 724-5776.
 
Kitchen Closeouts
Williams-Sonoma has just opened an outlet store selling closeouts and overstocked items from its stores and from catalogues including Pottery Barn, Hold Everything, Gardener's Eden and Chambers. Discounts of 30 to 70 percent are offered.
The 15,000-square-foot store, which takes up three floors, is at 231 Tenth Avenue (23d Street).
The Chefs Catalogue is offering 10 percent off every item in its catalogue through Aug. 9. Customers must mention the discount to operators taking telephone orders or use the order forms in the catalogue. To obtain a catalogue or place an order, call (800) 338-3232.
 
Suffolk Party
 Twenty-six restaurants and five wineries are participating in a party Aug. 3 from 5 to 8 P.M. to benefit the Family Service League of Suffolk County, a group that provides services for families and individuals with emotional and economic problems. The event, a Taste of the Hamptons, is being held at a private estate in Southampton. Craig Claiborne is the honorary chairman.
Tickets are $75 each and will not be sold at the door. Send checks payable to Family Service League of Suffolk County in care of Jane Iselin, Cat's Cradle, Box 449, Bridgehampton, N.Y. 11932. Reservations cannot be guaranteed for checks received after July 30. For information, call (516) 427-1768.
 
Freshly Bottled Milk
OLD-FASHIONED whole milk in bottles, with an inch or so of cream on top, is being sold in the Union Square green market on Saturdays. On July 1, Ronny Brook Farms in Ancramdale, N.Y., in the Hudson Valley, a farm that was started 50 years ago, began bottling its pasteurized but unhomogenized milk instead of selling it to a cooperative. The milk is $1.50 a quart, plus $1 deposit for the bottle.
The farm also sells a particularly rich-tasting skimmed milk, also $1.50 plus the deposit, and has started selling half liters of heavy cream for $3.75 plus the deposit.
It sells for $9 a special canvas bottle tote made for the milk bottles by a group of mentally retarded adults in Columbia County. The tote has inner pockets that make it good for transporting wine as well as milk.
The milk also sells in Poughkeepsie at Adams Fairacre Market, in Kingston at Mohican Market, in Pine Plains at Teck's Market and in Millerton at Protta's.

Saratoga Extends Offer to Spend An Extra Week in the Country

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., July 23

 BODY:
The 124th season of racing in the countryside will open on Wednesday at the Saratoga Race Course and will continue for five weeks in an experiment to test the curative powers of this famous old spa for the ailments troubling thoroughbred racing.
The Saratoga season normally runs four weeks, but was extended by a week to lengthen the most successful part of the racing year in New York State in the continuing search for answers to the recession that has stalked the sport in recent years. 
 More than 27,000 people went to the Saratoga track every day on the average last year, which is double the attendance this season at Belmont Park. And the thoroughbred business would like to know whether they were drawn here by the charms of the countryside, the summer seasons of the ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra or the quality of the racing itself.
 
Burst of Youth
 Whatever the reason, the racing will start with the customary burst of young talent in the opening-day fixture, the Schuylerville Stakes for 2-year-old fillies, a race that can launch careers.
The race is a Grade II stakes with 13 fillies racing six furlongs over a track they have never tested, and it is the first of five stakes races scheduled for the opening week alone.
The cast will be headed by Celeste Cielo, a daughter of Conquistador Cielo, the star colt of a decade ago. The filly made a splashy debut at Belmont Park in June when she set a track record by zipping five furlongs in 56 4/5 seconds.
But she got a dose of racing reality in her next start on July 3 when she struggled over a muddy track and lost by two lengths. So, whether she is a good filly or a great filly has not yet been established. But a solid clue may surface in the Schuylerville, when she runs with Angel Cordero Jr. in the saddle.
The same question confronts Ms. Copelan, who has raced twice and won twice. Her trainer, Alan Seewald, agreed with the general feeling that she was special, and said: "She schools well and ships well. She's a sensible filly. She acts like a 10-year-old mare."
But, taking no chances, he signed a senior jockey, Jerry Bailey, one of the stars of the Belmont Park meeting of the last two and a half months, to try to keep his filly's winning streak alive.
Once the Saratoga season is started, the quaint old track will trot as many stars across its stage as the nearby Performing Arts Center. The summertime meeting at Saratoga forms the ideal bridge between the Triple Crown races for 3-year-old horses and the autumn stakes leading to the year's ultimate prize, the Breeders' Cup series of championships and million-dollar purses.
In the first week alone, D. Wayne Lukas has nominated 29 horses to compete in stakes races. They won't all go to the post, but he can select carefully from his large stable and call his shots.
But Lukas is likely to run his precocious 2-year-old colt Salt Lake in the Saratoga Special on Friday and his star 3-year-old filly Withallprobability in the Test stakes on Saturday.
But the highlight of the opening week figures to be run on Sunday, when a pair of old rivals stage a return match at a mile and an eighth in the Jim Dandy Stakes, the steppingstone to the $1 million Travers, the dramatic high of the season on Aug. 17.
They are Fly So Free, last year's champion juvenile colt and last winter's favorite to win the Kentucky Derby, and Strike the Gold, who outran him in both the Bluegrass Stakes and the Kentucky Derby.
Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Fly So Free for the music publisher Tommy Valando, said that he also was disappointed in the colt's third-place finish in the Dwyer Stakes two weeks ago.
But Fly So Free still had a long list of credentials, including three consecutive victories in Florida in three months earlier this year and another in the Riva Ridge at Belmont in June.
Nick Zito, who trains Strike the Gold for Giles Brophy and his partners, Bill Condren and Joe Cornacchia, pointed toward his star colt and said with the proper mix of pride and caution:
"The 3-year-old picture will be clearer as the summer goes along. But this one is the champ, there's no question, if he stays together. Knock on wood."

The Three O'Reillys Walk Alike, Talk Alike

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y., July 23

 BODY:
Terri O'Reilly had her turn on the court today, and she did more than her one-third share. She pinned Chanda Rubin to the baseline with an aggressive topspin game, drubbing her 15-year-old opponent in the first round of the Westchester Ladies Cup at Manhattanville College, 6-2, 6-0.
 O'Reilly walked off the court and met two more of herself, Patty and Christine. Together again. Identical triplets, Team O'Reilly, making their way in this very individual sport. 
 "We are just as good as anyone up there," Terri O'Reilly said. "And we have a lot of marketing possibilities."
 With each victory, the O'Reilly triplets of Ridgewood, N.J., become more than a small-tournament sideshow novelty. That is the goal, anyway. Terri's ranking has zoomed 350 places since January, when the three sisters turned professional, to No. 423 in the world. After today's success, she is assured of reaching at least the low 300's. Patty is ranked 387. As doubles players, Patty and Terri have a shot at making the United States Open draw. Christine will have to wait her turn, because three into two does not go.
 
Three of a Kind
 "We're all in this together," said Christine, who is expected to get her first singles ranking after this tournament. "We share the winnings. And we're sure that if one of us makes it, the other two are going to be close behind."
 The three women, 23 years old, all played for Duke University and graduated in May with majors in economics. They all suffered injuries to their knees and backs during rigorous college careers, which is one way to tell them apart: Terri, a right-hander, wears two knee braces. Patty, the only left-hander, wears one. Christine does not wear any.
 "We haven't pulled any tricks yet, no switching," Terri said. "But we always say, 'Not yet.' We want to keep the umps alert."
 They travel the tour together, share the same hotel room to cut down on expenses. Sometimes they must face each other on the court. In fact, Terri upset Patty in the qualifiers of the Ladies Cup to earn a spot in the main draw.
 They don't often fight, although Terri was getting impatient today at Patty's emphatic courtside cheers. "Come on, T.," Patty screamed. Terri waved her off. "I didn't need her then," Terri said, later. "I was doing fine."
 Patty is the oldest, born in Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, to Dee and Gene O'Reilly 15 minutes before Terri, who was born 14 minutes before Christine. When they needed coaching tips this spring, they went to a twin, Tim Gullickson, because he understood their mindset.
 Today, against Rubin, Terri O'Reilly's mindset was where it belonged: on the court, focused on the ball and on Rubin's backhand.
 "I didn't want to hit it to her power zone, I wanted to mix up my shots," Terri O'Reilly said. "I figured she had a lot of tournament experience, despite her age, because she has sponsorship from the United States Tennis Association."
 There is no such sponsorship for the O'Reillys, who are far too old to be considered hot prospects by any tennis federation. But after Terri O'Reilly's victory today, a tournament official made a point of asking all three sisters to come by and try to qualify for his event.
 Sorry, the O'Reillys said, in unison. Previous commitment.
 
 
MATCH POINTS
 JOHN KORFF, tournament director for the recently completed Pathmark Classic exhibition event at Mahwah, N.J., paid a visit Tuesday to the rival Ladies Cup tournament. He said the Women's Tennis Association is expected to levy fines totaling $92,000 against all the players who competed in his unsanctioned tournament. . . . MONICA SELES's fine has been announced at $20,000. Korff said he would help the players appeal the fines to the Women's International Professional Tennis Council and would pay whatever penalties were upheld.

HEADLINE: Don't Ease the Squeeze on Iraq

 BODY:
Should Iraq be allowed to resume limited oil exports in order to pay war reparations and finance compelling humanitarian needs at home? Not as long as Saddam Hussein continues to flout the U.N. cease-fire resolution that requires him to disclose all details of Iraq's secret nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs.
To accept human suffering as a diplomatic lever is tormenting -- but preferable to leaving the Persian Gulf allies with no credible way to compel Iraqi compliance except resuming military attacks. 
 There are other ways to address Iraq's emergency humanitarian needs. With the July 25 allied deadline for full Iraqi nuclear disclosure now at hand, it's exactly the wrong time to be hinting at partial lifting of the oil embargo.
 Making Baghdad come clean on nuclear supplies won't be easy. The embargo was originally designed for the less ambitious task of containing Iraq's arms buildup. Rolling back existing programs requires greater pressure.
Nor is the alternative of renewed air strikes fully satisfactory. The massive, unopposed air raids of the gulf war apparently failed to destroy Baghdad's nuclear hoard. With allied force levels now reduced, new air raids could involve far greater risk to pilots, with no more success.
The best available course is to maintain maximum economic and political pressure on Baghdad while holding the threat of renewed military action in reserve.
The human suffering Baghdad cites in seeking permission to resume oil sales is real and wrenching. Yet Saddam Hussein's regime showed scant concern for the suffering it caused its own people through eight grueling years of aggressive war against Iran and the devastating defeat in Kuwait.
Honorable arguments can be made for easing the oil embargo. Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. official in charge of monitoring Iraq's humanitarian needs, argues that precious international relief funds needed for Africa and Bangladesh should not be diverted to help oil-rich Iraq.
U.N. diplomats also point out that for Kuwait to receive the reparations it is entitled to, Iraq needs some way to raise funds. And a long series of U.N. resolutions anticipated humanitarian exceptions to the embargo. Limited relief now could help prevent a total erosion of sanctions later on.
The Bush Administration, which long resisted any easing of sanctions, seems to be shifting. The President, declaring that innocent women and children should not suffer, hinted yesterday at possible approval for a U.N. move to allow limited oil sales.
We, too, were once moved by these arguments, but this is the wrong time to relax the embargo. Once Iraqi oil is allowed back on the international market, even if the revenues remain under U.N. control, it will be difficult to make distinctions. How can the immediate needs of food and medicine be distinguished from the longer-term rebuilding of distribution networks and power plants that serve humanitarian needs and the Iraqi economy?
Easing the embargo now would give Baghdad a psychological lift, possibly reinforcing its defiance. A more straightforward way to provide humanitarian relief is to do just that, through an internationally financed effort limited to milk, food and medicine. A bill for the assistance could be presented to Iraq for later payment from oil revenues.
Easing sanctions prematurely could one day leave no choice except winking at Saddam Hussein's defiance or going back to war. There's a wiser course.

HEADLINE: Saudis Won't Ditch OPEC for Our Sake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The suggestion by Edward L. Morse, publisher of Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in "How to Make OPEC Obsolete" (Op-Ed, July 1) that the United States enter into a bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia on oil for "reciprocal security" is highly unlikely, to say the least. 
 We should not forget that in 1960 Saudi Arabia was the main architect of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which brought unprecedented wealth and power to that kingdom. Saudi Arabia, with its huge overhang of crude oil supply and proven reserves, still polices OPEC's price and production quotas, and works as the glue that holds the cartel together. To expect the Saudis to give away that lever in the name of some amorphous benefits is unrealistic.
Also, history belies this optimism. It was Saudi Arabia, under the guise of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, that imposed the oil embargo against the United States and its allies in October 1973. The embargo was deadly in hardships put on the people and economy of the United States. Who could forget the long lines in front of gasoline stations, with the rationing of two gallons at a time, an odd-even plate-number system to buy gas on alternate days, flags flying at gas stations to indicate whether or not they had some gas for desperate motorists?
Even in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, Saudi Arabia has not lurched toward anything close to an open society and is trying very hard to maintain the status quo. Today OPEC is weak because of its action in raising the benchmark crude oil price from $12.70 a barrel in 1979 to $34 a barrel in 1981. At that price, demand for oil was not so inelastic, and production from non-OPEC areas increased considerably. Now OPEC has a hard time holding the price of benchmark crude even at $18 to $20 a barrel, with the spot price sometimes plunging much below that and baring the softness of the world oil market.
OPEC will be obsolete only when production from non-OPEC regions works as a deterrent, when Saudi Arabia as a producing country is effectively marginalized, when price cheating and volume discounts among the member nations will be virtually impossible to control and when alternative energy sources make a substantial dent in the world energy market.
Only then will OPEC declare itself dissolved. We may not live to see it, but we foresee it.

HEADLINE: To Reagan We Owe A Catastrophic Debt

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Edwin Meese 3d credits President Reagan with producing "the longest peacetime economic expansion in modern history" (letter, July 9). 
 President Reagan's tax and defense policies produced an eight-year increase in the national debt of $1.9 trillion (up 186 percent), the foundation for this false prosperity. While blaming Democrats for "tax and spend" politics, Mr. Reagan directed a "borrow and spend" spree, stealing from America's future well-being to promote a shortsighted agenda.
Every household in the United States went $20,000 more in debt, and interest payments on that debt tripled to $240.9 billion a year in 1989. To call Mr. Reagan "a successful President" for this fiscal disaster is like claiming a Cabinet officer who can leave office without being indicted is a success.

HEADLINE: Majority Rejects Race Preference

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To Tom Wicker's question in "Riding the Quota Wave" (column, July 4) -- "in the face of a history of discrimination, is rigid evenhandedness to be the test of a candidate's or party's devotion to American values?" -- the answer from the overwhelming majority of the American public seems a resounding yes. 
 The Gallup organization has polled on preferences five times since March 1977 and has consistently found that more than 80 percent of respondents favor a strict meritocratic system in employment and university admissions over a system in which "women and members of minorities" are given preference "to make up for past discrimination." On no occasion (the last poll was December 1989) has support for preferential treatment exceeded 11 percent of the general population.
Similar results have been obtained in other polls, the most instructive perhaps being a Newsweek poll last April in which 72 percent of white respondents rejected racial preference even in a toss-up situation between equally qualified people ("Do you believe that because of past discrimination against black people, qualified blacks should receive preference over equally qualified whites in such matters as getting into college or getting jobs, or not?").
The public, I believe, understands something about justice and fairness that Mr. Wicker and other supporters of compensatory preferences based on race and ethnicity have not understood: such preferences in employment involve outrageously unfair systems of benefit allocation and burden sharing. Since ethnic groups as a whole cannot apply for jobs, but only individuals, those who may themselves not have been heavily victimized may (and often do) receive benefits at the expense of others who were neither beneficiaries nor perpetrators of past wrongdoing.
Affirmative action programs do not work like the scheme devised to compensate the unjustly interned Japanese-Americans of World War II. There, monetary compensation was victim-specific, and the burden of paying for the scheme was widely diffused throughout the tax-paying public. Affirmative action programs, rather, often benefit those who do not deserve benefits (the sons of Jamaican physicians or wealthy Cuban businessmen, for instance) and require that an arbitrarily selected subset of the population pay the cost.
I think it no accident that virtually all supporters of preferential employment policies who are not themselves in the beneficiary categories are people who enjoy comfortable middle- or upper-middle-class status (or the academic credentials and family resources to enable them to obtain such status). The opposition to race- and ethnicity-based preferences by poor and lower-middle class white people (non-Hispanic) is virtually unanimous, and it would seem they have something very important to tell us on this matter.

HEADLINE: Money Funds Keep Too Much Cash Idle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A market economy requires customers with money to buy its products. Too many potential customers have reduced spending and investing, and are putting their surplus income into money funds. A money fund is like an idle checking account or demand deposit in a bank. It buys no goods and provides no employment. 
 The excessive growth of money funds takes money out of circulation, reduces demand and is a cause of recession. It should be discouraged, but instead is rewarded by as much as 4 percent tax-exempt interest, derived mostly from short-term lending in competition with banks.
Although money funds don't appreciate or provide a hedge against inflation, they have grown to more than $500 billion! Five hundred billion idle dollars! No wonder our economy is in recession.
So what should we do? I am a capitalist myself and own shares in a money fund. But I realize that to restore prosperity we will have to make it unprofitable to hold money idle in banks or money funds. We know that what keeps a capitalist economy going is the steady spending and investment of money by individuals, business and government.
This means that private savings that can't find profitable investment must be taxed and spent by the government. The alternative is recession.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 29.74 in Heavy Program Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Heavy waves of program selling by professional traders toppled stock prices yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 29.74 points, or just a little less than 1 percent, to 2,983.23. 
 Smaller stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, sank a little more than 1 percent.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 160.2 million shares, from 149.1 million on Monday.
Only 180,000 shares of the Big Board's total volume came in the extra hour of trading that was added by the exchanges in June in a move to keep business from drifting to other markets.
The exchanges were also planning to add an additional half-hour of trading in the morning, opening at 9 A.M. instead of 9:30 A.M.. But officials from the over-the-counter market said yesterday that they would oppose the earlier start, noting that the plan would make it more difficult to talk to clients at that time of the day. The officials said, however, that they would comply if other exchanges opened earlier.
 
6 Waves of Selling
 Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said it spotted six waves of selling -- particularly between 9:48 and 10:03, and between 10:43 and 10:57. It said the heavy selling sliced almost 32 points off the Dow, meaning that the professionals accounted for the entire decline in the blue chips. If not for a small amount of buying, the Dow might have fallen even more.
Jack Solomon, market technician for Bear, Stearns & Company, said the stock market's weakness was a result of the soft bond market, program selling and the heavy flood of Treasury refinancings coming to market.
"When the market didn't succeed in attacking and surpassing the old high -- 3,035.33 -- in the last three days, disappointed sellers came in," he explained. "This drove the market down, with very few buyers around because of the lack of economic news."
Slightly more than half of the decline in the blue chips came from five stocks -- Minnesota Mining, off 3 3/8, to 89 5/8; Procter & Gamble, off 1 5/8, to 78 3/8; International Paper, off 1 3/4, to 69 1/2; Goodyear Tire, off 1 1/4, to 37, and I.B.M., off 1 3/8, to 100 5/8.
Among the most-active Big Board stocks, American Express rose 1 5/8, to 24 3/4, with a little more than three million shares changing hands. It reported that second-quarter profits fell 20 percent, but analysts said results were better than expected.
3M reported that second-quarter profits fell 12.6 percent.
 
Estimate Is Cut
 Alex Henderson, photography analyst at Prudential Securities, said he cut his 3M earnings estimate yesterday, and after talking with the company, might cut it a bit more. He said 3M's revenue patterns going into the third quarter "look flat at best."
Quaker Oats, another big mover, reported yesterday that second-quarter profits more than doubled, but its stock price tumbled 4 1/8, to 59. There did not appear to be any news to account for the drop.
Kimberly-Clark, the paper company, reported a sharp rise in second-quarter earnings, but its stock fell 3 3/4, to 100.
Monsanto, a standout in a weak chemicals group, rose 2 3/8, to 72 1/2, in heavy trading, after reporting higher-than-expected second-quarter profits. Reuters reported that Nicholas Filippello, Monsanto's chief economist, said the company might buy back more of its stock.
Along with a rise in gold prices, gold shares advanced, with Newmont Mining up 1 5/8, to 41, and Newmont Gold up 1 3/8, to 39 7/8.
High-technology stocks fell sharply, with Aldus, a computer software company, down 2 3/4, to 37 1/2, and Chiron, the biotechnology company, down 3 1/4, to 51 1/2, in heavy trading.
Aldus fell after it told analysts that earnings estimates might be too high.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 25, 1991, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about stock trading on Tuesday referred incorrectly to the earnings and stock price of Quaker Oats. The company did not report second-quarter earnings yesterday; it will do so in early August. The company's stock on Tuesday rose 50 cents, to $59 a share; it did not fall $4.125. Tuesday was the first day of trading for Quaker Oats without its Fisher Price unit, which was spun off.

HEADLINE: ITT Earnings Down by 20%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The ITT Corporation said on Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings were only about half the level of a year ago, when a one-time gain increased its earnings.
Even without the gain, ITT's profits were 20 percent below those in last year's second quarter. 
 The New York-based conglomerate said it had earned $206 million, or $1.62 a share, in the three months that ended on June 30, compared with $397 million, or $3 a share.
Its revenues totaled $5.1 billion, down slightly from $5.2 billion in the 1990 period.
The results from the second quarter of last year were increased by $139 million after taxes from ITT's sale of 7 percent of Alcatel N.V., a European telecommunications company, to Alcatel Alsthom. ITT retains a 30 percent stake in Alcatel.
Rand V. Araskog, ITT's chairman, said the lower profit resulted from the recession, which he said had hurt results in the automotive, forest products, financial services and hospitality businesses in which the company operates.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, ITT's stock was unchanged, closing at $55.50.

2 State Offerings Raise $400 Million

 BODY:
Two states have issued tax-exempt bonds in a buoyant market where good investor demand, a shortage of supply and improving economic news have combined to bring more favorable rates for issuers.
The Florida Board of Education's $200 million issue yesterday was won by Merrill Lynch & Company with a bid of 6.8331 percent. 
 The general-obligation bonds have been priced to yield 4.7 percent for the 1992 maturity, and 6.828 percent for the 2012 maturity. A longer maturity of 2021 yields 6.888 percent, at a price of 98.25.
The State of Connecticut, which is having budget problems, has issued $200 million in general-obligation temporary notes. Goldman, Sachs & Company, the lead underwriter, said yesterday that the notes would bear a 5 percent coupon and be priced at about 100.042 to yield 4.75 percent.
The bonds have not yet been rated by Moody's Investors Service Inc. or the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Edward Bodman, 69, An Investment Banker

 BODY:
Edward Dunham Bodman, an investment banker who worked earlier in his career for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in China, died yesterday at his home in Stonington, Conn. He was 69 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
He died of intestinal cancer, a spokesman for the family said. 
 He was a graduate of Harvard College and later attended the Columbia University School of Business Administration. After graduating from college, he worked in Beijing for the United Nations relief agency from 1945 to 1947. He returned to work for the Economic Cooperation Administration, traeling extensively in China. After the fall of the Nationalist Government in China, he went into investment banking.
From 1951 to 1958, he worked for Milmine, Bodman & Company in Manhattan in investment management and export-import financing, and from 1958 to 1966, he was with the Crocker National Bank in San Francisco. From 1966 until he retired in 1982, he was with the Empire Trust Company, now the Bank of New York, in Manhattan.
He was a member of the boards of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Associaton and of the American Bureau of Medical Assistance to China and in retirement was a recruiter for the International Executive Service Corps.
He is survived by his wife, the former Rosamund Reed Veit; a daughter, Beaufort Butler of Concord, Mass.; a sister, Violet Coffin of Stratford, Vt.; a brother, Herbert Bodman of Chapel Hill, N.C., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: HONG KONG BUOYED BY AIRPORT ACCORD

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 24

 BODY:
After two bleak years in which it has lurched from one crisis to the next, exhaling confidence the way a punctured tire loses air, Hong Kong finally seems to be feeling good about itself again.
A new agreement was reached at the beginning of this month between Britain and China about a new airport to be built here -- and more broadly about how the territory will be governed until the hand-over to China in 1997 -- and it has elicited an enormous sigh of relief. 
 Spirits also rose today after the United States Senate vote Tuesday on trade benefits to China. Because Hong Kong depends a great deal on China for its economic livelihood, the vote, which makes likely the prospect of unconditional extension of the benefits, touched off even greater business optimism.
 
Stock Market at a High
 For two straight days now, the Hang Seng stock market index has hit a new high, closing today at 4,028.77, up nearly 19 points from Tuesday's record. Housing prices are also estimated to have risen at least 10 percent since the airport agreement was announced on July 4. And for the first time since the Army crackdown in Beijing two years ago, there seems to be a measure of hope in the air here.
Hong Kong's confidence has been shaken not only by the political repression and ideological orthodoxy on the home turf of its future landlord, but also by the arrests of Hong Kong visitors on the mainland and a rising number of mainlanders sneaking into the territory and committing robberies. Emigrants continue to flee the territory at a pace of over 1,100 a week.
Now, with major uncertainties removed, politicians, business executives and bureaucrats here are turning to the nuts and bolts of the airport and port project, which is expected to dominate the economy until 1997 and cost more than $16 billion.
 
Caution and Foreboding
 As with all bouts of optimism in Hong Kong in the last decade, however, this one is mixed with caution and a foreboding that China's verbal assaults may once again cloud the skies.
The agreement provides that China will support the construction of the airport in Hong Kong and will honor Hong Kong's debts after 1997. In exchange, Britain agrees to consult Beijing on all matters relating to the airport that will have an impact after 1997. Academics and politicians say the document is a crucial annex to the original joint declaration in 1984, which provides the basis for the handover of power. Some say it could set a precedent for power-sharing on all matters straddling 1997.
"China got what it wanted -- it got a formal acknowledgment of their role prior to 1997," said a diplomat in Hong Kong. The Chinese, he added, are believed to have suggested registering the memorandum as a treaty with the United Nations, as was the case with the 1984 Joint Declaration, but the British said no.
 
Risk of Imported Labor
 As companies enter the contract bidding in the next few months for certain parts of the airport project, the Government is suggesting that the construction activity will add more than a full percentage point to Hong Kong's economic growth estimates in the near future. Costs for the airport and rail and bridge links will be $12.7 billion and billions more for the port development.
Although the political uncertainty may be removed for the moment, some economists and analysts say the endeavor will still stumble. For instance, a construction boom could be inflationary, unless the Government allows the import of labor. Another major risk that investors and bankers must consider is that all the connecting parts, such as the rail link, the suspension bridge and the airport, must be completed before any one can be used.
For the moment, the general public is busy with Hong Kong's favorite pastime: making money. Last week, the first Government land sale since the memorandum brought a price that was more than double the one reached for a similar plot in the same area last November. And there are some indications that the small investor also wants to keep investing in Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Baker Asks Asians to Move Warily on New Pacts

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 24

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d urged major Southeast Asian countries today to move cautiously on proposals to create new trade and security alliances that would replace "tried and tested frameworks" involving the United States.
Speaking at the annual meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Mr. Baker appeared to react warily to proposals made at the meeting to create an East Asian trading bloc that did not include the United States, and to begin regular regional meetings on military issues. 
 He was also apprehensive about a suggestion that Soviet and Chinese representatives be included in future meetings of Asean, which is made up of Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.
"We have had a remarkable degree of stability in this region," said Mr. Baker, referring specifically to security cooperation in Southeast Asia.
"We ought to be careful about changing those arrangements and discarding them for something else unless we're absolutely certain that the something else is better and will work," he said at a news conference.While Mr. Baker received a warm reception this week from the Asean foreign ministers, a central theme of the Kuala Lumpur meeting was that the non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia must integrate their economic and security planning, even if that means asserting more independence from their old ally in Washington.
Asian diplomats said there was general agreement on the need for closer economic ties within Asean in response to trading blocs being created in Western Europe and in North America, and on the need for new cooperation on military issues in light of the reduced American presence in the region. Not one of the proposals that had most worried American officials was adopted by the Asean foreign ministers at the meeting this week, although all remain under consideration.
Among them is a Japanese plan for formal regional meetings on defense issues. American officials say they are wary of the proposal because it might weaken a string of bilateral military agreements between the United States and nations in Asia and the Pacific.
Like the United States, Japan is invited as a "dialogue partner."
The most serious disagreement between the United States and its Southeast Asian allies at the gathering appeared to center on Myanmar, formerly Burma, and whether economic sanctions should be imposed on that nation to end human rights abuses.
American and other Western nations have for some time been urging Asean members to use their influence to persuade the Burmese to hand over power to civilians leaders elected last year.
"We would like to see Asean use whatever influence they have, individually or collectively, in order to move the Burmese Government toward greater respect for human rights, greater respect for political process, freedom for political prisoners," Mr. Baker said.
Southeast Asian nations have been wary of Western attempts to impose human rights standards on Myanmar, if only because many of their own governments are also subject to criticism about human rights abuses.
Asean officials said today that the Philippine Foreign Secretary, Raul Manglapus, would soon travel to Myanmar on behalf of the association to discuss human rights. But Asian diplomats at the Kuala Lumpur meeting insisted that Mr. Manglapus's trip was not a response to Western pressure.
"This will be a cordial meeting between Manglapus and the Burmese," said one diplomat. "We believe that friendly, constructive persuasion -- not bullying -- will be most effective in bringing about change in Burma."
Several Asean officials drew comparisons this week between the association's policy on Burma and the Bush Administration's policy on China -- continued contact despite concern over human rights violations.
At the news conference, Mr. Baker said the United States continued to hope for better relations with Vietnam, but that normal relations were not possible until Hanoi helped bring about a settlement in the Cambodian civil war.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines on Report Of Weak Factory Orders

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday after the Government released an unexpectedly weak report on factory orders to the nation's manufacturers.
The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods slipped 1.6 percent in June after three months of gains. Some analysts said the report could rekindle talk of a double-dip recession. That could put further pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an attempt to help the economy. 
 Lower interest rates weaken the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities less valuable.
"The market was already pushing down" before the durable-goods report, said Andrew Hodge, chief corporate trader at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York. But the report extended the decline even further, he said.
Mr. Hodge said the dollar had been trying to correct itself after lengthy efforts by foreign central banks this year that served to strengthen the United States currency against the German mark.
In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7375 marks, from 1.7575 marks late Tuesday. In London, the dollar slipped to 1.7365 marks, from 1.7555.
The dollar rose against the yen on a belief that weakness in the Japanese economy could lead to interest rate cuts in Japan, Mr. Hodge said.
The dollar gained 0.25 yen, to close at 137.50 yen in New York. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.65 yen, to close at 136.87 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 137.35 yen.
The dollar fell against the British pound. The pound strengthened to $1.6920 in New York, from $1.6825 on Tuesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.6935, from $1.6845.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.5125 Swiss francs, down from 1.5255; 5.9059 French francs, down from 5.9665; 1,294.75 Italian lire, down from 1,310.50, and 1.15325 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15445.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Fund Yields Unchanged in Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds showed virtually no change in the week ended yesterday, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which regularly monitors the leading funds.
Yields on bank money-market accounts that compete for the public's interest in short-term investing were 5.23 percent, compared with 5.25 percent the week before, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index. 
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said the Federal Reserve had shown little intention of lowering rates further, "and it is the short-term rates that affect money market yields."
 
Few Municipal Issues
 "I suspect yields were dropping quite sharply until this week because of a lack of supply of new municipals," he continued. "States have been having budgetary problems and postponing some issues, and there has been seasonal factors like the June fiscal-year end, which for many states led to juggling times of issuing new tax-exempts."
This week, he said, some yields increased slightly because of an increased supply of municipal securities.
Recent improvement in economic indicators has raised the possibility of another Federal Reserve move to lower interest rates, he explained. "I think it is premature to think about now," he said. "The recovery is alive and well," he said, adding he thought the decline in money market yields had essentaiially ended.
The seven-day simple yield for taxable funds dropped a basis point, to 5.46 percent, and the seven-day compound yield dropped to 5.61 percent from 5.62, according to Donoghue's. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. The 30-day simple yield was 5.47, down from 5.48, and the 30-day compound yield was 5.62, down from 5.63.
Assets of the taxable funds were virtually unchanged, rising slightly by a net of $145 million, to $451.4 billion. Institutions accounted for a rise of $800 million, to $111.3 billion, which means an outflow of money belonging to small investors. "The public is still looking for higher yields elsewhere," Mr. Frank said.
Total assets of the tax-exempt funds declined by $605 million, to $88.5 billion, continuing a slide in the previous week. "I think that was due mostly to the lower yields," Mr. Frank said. Days to maturity of holdings by the funds averaged 58, down from 59 the previous week.
Thirty-day simple yields were 3.66 percent, off 2 basis points, and the 30-day compound yield was also down by 2 points, to 3.73.
But the seven-day simple average yield for the tax-exempt funds was 3.71 percent, up 25 basis points from the previous week. The seven-day compound yield was 3.77 percent, also an increase of 25 basis points.
 
Fund on Top Again
 For the 13th week in a row the top- yielding tax-exempt fund was the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Management Inc. of Milwaukee. On the seven-day basis it yielded 4.84 percent, up 13 basis points from the previous week. Some of its investments are in securities that might be subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax for some investors.
The top-yielding tax-exempt fund in New York for the week was Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market fund, with a seven-day compound return of 4.28 percent.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Cuomo Seeking the Presidency? Yes, He Isn't, Maybe He Is

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 24

 BODY:
Since putting the state budget to rest three weeks ago, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has appeared on national television to belittle the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and has told a convention of black Baptists that the national debate on quotas reflects a Republican strategy to make an issue of race.
He has issued a news release saying that President Bush's economic policy "lacks any formula for sustainable, long-term growth" and has told reporters that the Republican economic agenda "is zero." 
 He has invited photographers from Life magazine to document a day in his life and has directed his staff to find places for him to deliver speeches attacking the White House, including one at the American Stock Exchange on Thursday morning.
But please do not ask the Governor whether he is acting like a Presidential candidate. Such suggestions generate an expression of boredom and contempt usually reserved for Republican foes in the State Senate.
 
'No Plans to Make Plans'
 "Why should it be," he snapped at a forum of the New York State Broadcasters Association in Saratoga Springs on Monday, "that if you happen to have eight and a half years as Governor, having all that background, having a platform to discuss national issues, if you do it in any plausible way then it follows you should be running for President?
"And if you're not, then there's something wrong with you. Either you've got a Mafia uncle hidden away in a closet or you've got some serious illness or you've got some psychic indisposition. Why should that be?"
Such is the curse of being Mario Cuomo, a burden that has not been lifted by his poor showing at the polls last November, his state's dire fiscal troubles or his unbending insistence that he has "no plans and no plans to make plans" to run.
Those closest to the Governor take him at his word. Of 13 current and former Cuomo aides surveyed in the last week, none said they believed that Mr. Cuomo would run for President. But many also believe there is a method to his high-profile approach to national politics.
"My gut tells me he's not going to do it, but I don't think it hurts for people to think he might," said one top Cuomo aide. "With the Legislature, it's certainly better than them thinking that this will be his last term and that he's a lame duck."
Mr. Cuomo's popularity is lagging after a budget fight that ended with a record delay, severe spending cuts and a broken pledge against raising income taxes. He is caught in the middle of a dangerous political impasse with Mayor David N. Dinkins over how to rescue New York City from severe service reductions and projections of mounting deficits.
Against that political backdrop, the Governor has set out to use New York's fiscal crisis to illustrate the Federal Government's abandonment of its obligations to the states and cities. Mr. Cuomo does not mind if the perception of him as a potential candidate adds power to his message.
His message may also help mend fences with constituents who are stewing about this year's combination of deep cuts and higher taxes.
Mr. Cuomo's speeches on Federal economic policy effectively shift the blame for the state's budget travails from Albany to Washington. He received a standing ovation last week at Union Baptist Church in Hempstead, L.I., when he told a black audience that Republicans were raising the quota issue to divide the electorate along racial lines.
The Governor's practice of leading the intellectual charge against the Republicans while avoiding the hand-to-hand combat of a campaign has become a familiar one since 1984, when his speech to the Democratic National Convention made him an instant celebrity within his party.
He has been consistent -- at least since announcing in February 1987 that he would not run in 1988 -- in maintaining that he is not considering the 1992 race.
But he has allowed speculation to continue by not veering from his carefully crafted "no plans" disavowal and by announcing last year that he would not promise to serve out his third four-year term, which began in January. Late last year the Governor rejected the advice of a top aide that he use his 1991 State of the State speech to declare that he would not be a candidate.
Knowing that there is skepticism about his intent, Mr. Cuomo has even started arguing the case against a Cuomo candidacy. This week he advised the Democrats to find a "nonthreatening" candidate, and said that "distinct ethic types," like himself, did not always fit that category.
He also said in an interview that if he were going to run, he would have had to establish a campaign structure by now.
The Governor has expressed increasing irritation at the notion that he, like all politicians, must want to be President.
"The American idea is you have to be the star, you have to be the leader, you have to keep going up even if you don't feel like it, even if you're satisfied, even if you think you've arrived at a level where you think you can make an intelligent contribution," he said on Monday. "God forbid you want to be a member of the chorus and not a quarterback."

HEADLINE: Bush to Meet With Soviet Opposition

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 24

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Bush would address the Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine and meet with members of the emerging democratic movement in Moscow as part of a diplomatically tricky effort to foster contacts with the Soviet Union's emerging opposition.
Because of its political sensitivity and symbolic importance, this foray by Mr. Bush into the volatile world of Soviet politics could end up overshadowing the formal centerpiece of his trip to the Soviet Union next week: the signing of a treaty reducing nuclear weapons and a two-day summit conference with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
 In a further departure from the historic tenor of Soviet-American summit meetings, with their heavy emphasis on arms control and military competition, a major focus of Mr. Bush's trip will be the expansion of commercial ties between the nuclear powers.
A senior Administration official said today that a trade treaty with the Soviet Union that will include favorable tariff treatment is essentially ready to be sent to Congress and that Mr. Bush would discuss a Soviet role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank while in Moscow.
 
Criticism From Brady
 But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady sharply criticized the Soviet Union's application for full membership in the I.M.F. and World Bank, a sign that the two countries have yet to work out some of the most basic principles of their changing relationship.
Saying he was "completely surprised" by the Soviet move, which came late Monday, Mr. Brady told reporters that it was "counterproductive," and added, "We have advised them to the point of boredom not to apply for membership."
In London last week, the United States and the six other leading industrial democracies offered Moscow a limited "special association" with those two financial institutions, while the Soviet Union drafts the specific plan for economic reform that the United States is demanding as a condition for full membership and any big increase in economic assistance.
While in Moscow, Mr. Bush will meet with a group of democratic opposition leaders that the senior official said is likely to include Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the former Foreign Minister, who resigned last year with warnings of a Kremlin dictatorship and then became a founding member of the Democratic Reform Movement, created to challenge the Communist Party orthodoxy.
The President will also meet privately with Boris N. Yeltsin, the combative and politically powerful President of the Russian federation, and deliver a second major address in the Soviet capital, a senior Administration official told reporters today.
 
Yeltsin and Protocol
 The Moscow speech will focus on Soviet-American relations in a more traditional sense. The speech in Kiev will be devoted to the changing relationship between the United States and the Soviet republics, the official said.
The senior official, whose remarks were part of a series of pre-summit briefings at the White House, said Mr. Bush would meet with Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday. He said it was not clear whether he would go to see Mr. Yeltsin at his offices, which in protocol terms would represent a more significant recognition of the Russian President than inviting him to meet with Mr. Bush at the American Embassy or the Ambassador's residence, Spaso House.
Asked if Mr. Bush would meet with Mr. Shevardnadze, the official said: "The President will be seeing a broad range of people, in Moscow and Kiev. I imagine we'll see Mr. Shevardnadze."
That session is expected to be less formal than the one with Mr. Yeltsin, perhaps a dinner at Spaso House, and is expected to include representatives of the Baltic region and of the Soviet Union's other fractious republics.
These meetings and the President's plan to visit Kiev represent the most dramatic moves in an effort by the Bush Administration to foster relations with Soviet political figures outside the traditional center of Kremlin power.
 
Complex Pressures
 In taking these steps, the United States has been trying to strike a balance to avoid antagonizing national leaders in Moscow, undermining Mr. Gorbachev's power, violating diplomatic niceties or encouraging opposition groups to take action toward greater autonomy that the United States might not be willing to support.
In his briefing today, the senior official alluded to these complex pressures, saying the choice of Kiev over any other republic's capital was not a sign of American approval of the relation between the Ukraine and Moscow.
But it was significant that Mr. Bush chose not to visit the Baltic republics -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- which have been the most vocal in their demands for independence. The United States has never recognized their incorporation into the Soviet Union.
"We're not issuing seals of approval on internal affairs," the official said. "We think that as this society opens up, we're going to need contacts with the republics as well as the center. We want to do it in a way that doesn't affect relations with the center, but expands relations to the republics."
In Kiev, for example, the official acknowledged that Mr. Bush was likely to encounter members of the Ukrainian independence movement who are members of the republic's legislature. But he said the President will not have a "stand-alone meeting" with them.
In Moscow, the Bush Administration is inviting a broad range of opposition figures to dinner with the President but is screening out members of the more right-wing radical groups, like Pamyat, the Russian nationalist movement that is sometimes accused of espousing racist doctrines.

HEADLINE: RJR Nabisco Posts Second Profit in Row

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
RJR Nabisco Inc., whose products include Winston cigarettes and Oreo cookies, said yesterday that it had posted a profit for the second quarter in a row and further improved its balance sheet, significant achievments for history's largest leveraged buyout.
But analysts regarded the performance as being at the low end of their expectations, and some said the stock was overvalued. 
 RJR Nabisco said net income in the second quarter totaled $79 million, in contrast to a loss of $108 million a year earlier. After paying preferred-stock dividends of $56 million, the net income is equivalent to 3 cents a share. In the first quarter, it reported a profit of $5 million after more than two years of losses.
 
Bondholders vs. Shareholders
 The tobacco business improved considerably, aided by stronger international sales, especially to Europe and the Russian republic, but domestic unit sales continued to decline. Food sales improved as well.
"From the bondholder's point of view, RJR Nabisco is doing just fine," said Charles S. Lemonides, a high-yield bond analyst at Gruntal & Company. "I just need for RJR to not go broke and I still get paid. But from a shareholder's point of view, it's not doing as well. Somebody owning stock has got to see more growth to sustain this valuation."
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, RJR Nabisco's stock closed at $11, down 50 cents, on heavy trading of 3.8 million shares.
Mr. Lemonides said RJR stock was trading at the "high end" of a fair valuation of $8 to $12 a share. And he noted that operating cash flow rose only slightly, to $1.06 billion, from $1.01 billion a year earlier.
 
9.3 Percent Rise in Sales
 Sales in the quarter rose 9.3 percent, to $3.78 billion, from $3.46 billion a year earlier, a relatively strong performance at a time when many packaged-goods companies are having trouble selling their products during the recession.
Tobacco sales in dollars rose nearly 10 percent, to $2.21 billion, and operating profit rose 1.4 percent, to $728 million. Food sales in dollars rose nearly 9 percent, to $1.57 billion, and operating profit rose nearly 14 percent, to $226 million.
But tobacco unit sales, the actual number of packages of cigarettes, continued to be weak in the United States, where the bulk of business is, and strong overseas. American cigarette unit sales declined 6.8 percent, while foreign sales rose 27 percent, RJR Nabisco said. Without sales to Russia, foreign sales rose 21 percent.
Debt to equity, the ratio of what the company owes to how much it is worth, has improved sharply. RJR Nabisco owed about $2.70 for every $1 of net worth on June 30, compared with $4.40 for every $1 of net worth a year earlier.
Lower interest costs, an important factor in any company but critical to one deep in debt, helped RJR Nabisco considerably. RJR has been replacing its high-interest long-term debt, some $9 billion, mostly with publicly owned common stock that pays no cash dividends. Moreover, short-term interest rates have dropped sharply, mainly because of the recession.
As a result, total interest expense in the quarter dropped by nearly a third, or some $229 million, to $541 million.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Silver Hits 11-Week Low As Recession Fears Grow

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Silver prices fell yesterday to their lowest level in more than 11 weeks, as renewed recession fears and a lack of inflation prompted heavy selling of futures contracts on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Silver futures settled 27.6 cents to 32 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in July down 27.6 cents at $3.984 an ounce, the lowest settlement of a near-term silver contract since May 3. 
 Gold futures finished $3.80 to $4.20 lower on the Commodity Exchange, with August at $364.70 an ounce. Platinum futures plunged $12.30 to $12.80 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the July contract settling at $364.50 an ounce.
Silver had slipped about 6 cents an ounce in each of the two previous sessions. It lost its footing completely Wednesday after the Commerce Department reported an unexpected 1.6 percent decline in orders for durable goods in June.
It was the first pause in three months in the manufacturing economy's recovery and suggested that "the possibility of a double-dip recession is upon us," said Peter Cardillo, research director with Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York.
"People are wondering if we are going to wind up again in a recession," Mr. Cardillo said.
He said silver and platinum were hit harder than gold because they have more industrial uses, making them more sensitive to economic data.
 
Soybeans Drop Sharply
 On the Chicago Board of Trade, grain futures prices fell, led by a sharp drop in soybean values as cooler weather in the Midwest tempered fears of crop damage.

HEADLINE: 2d-Quarter Earnings Drop For 2 Subsidiaries of G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 24

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation, whose automotive earnings have been hit hard by the recession, saw the second-quarter profits of two important non-automotive subsidiaries decline. G.M.'s finance subsidiary and electronics and aerospace units both posted lower profit yesterday, in large measure because they are dependent on automotive sales.
A third unit, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, showed a strong increase in profits. 
 G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, is expected to announce lower second-quarter profits over all tomorrow. Following are the details of the subsidiaries earnings:
 
G.M.A.C.
 The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, one of the nation's largest financial institutions, posted a second-quarter net profit of $283 million, a 6.3 percent drop, from $302 million during the 1990 period.
G.M.A.C. said the lower earnings were mostly attributable to lower receivables, but were partially offset by lower borrowing costs. The lower level of receivables was caused by soft automotive sales, and the maturing of automotive financing contracts from 1986 and 1987, which were popular because of 2.9 percent and 1.9 percent subsidized finance rates.
As of June 30, G.M.A.C.'s earning assets totaled $96.6 billion, down from $103 billion a year ago. The average interest rate on borrowed funds was 7.73 percent in the second quarter, compared with 8.6 percent a year ago. During the quarter G.M.A.C. financed or leased 458,000 new vehicles in the United States, compared with 541,000 a year ago. Leasing grew to 59,000 vehicles in the quarter, compared with 22,000 last year.
 
E.D.S.
 The Electronic Data Systems Corporation unit posted a 12 percent increase in second-quarter profit on a 15 percent revenue increase.
Profit for the quarter reached $139.8 million, compared with $125.3 million last year. Revenue rose to $1.68 billion, from $1.46 billion last year. The earnings of G.M. class E shares, which represent an interest in E.D.S.'s dividend payout, were 58 cents a share, up from 52 cents a share last year.
The data processing company said revenue related to work at G.M. amounted to $833.2 million, or about 49.6 percent of total revenue, compared with $799.3 million, or 54.7 percent of revenue last year.
 
GM Hughes Electronics
 Second-quarter profit for the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation dropped 39.6 percent, to $114.3 million, from $189.5 million last year. Revenue was $2.9 billion, compared with $3 billion last year. The earnings of GM class H shares, which represent an interest in the unit's dividend payout, were 29 cents a share, compared with 47 cents last year.
Robert J. Schultz, chairman, said the lower revenue and profit reflected a 16 percent drop in G.M. vehicle production. The company's Delco Electronics business manufactures radios and other electronic components.
The company's Hughes Aircraft Company unit received several important contracts during the quarter, including a $585 million contract to supply air-to-air missiles.

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANS TO BUILD NO NEW SHUTTLES

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it planned to build no more space shuttles, concentrating instead on creating new family of rockets to succeed the 30-year-old designs now being used.
A plan was announced by Vice President Dan Quayle in a speech at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. "In all probability, we have purchased the last space shuttle," he said. 
 The policy also includes converting some military missiles to launch satellites and developing unmanned vehicles that can be modified later to carry astronauts.
"The space launch policy proposes to extend the life span of the shuttle fleet; to maintain the capacity to produce spare parts, and to operate the system conservatively," Mr. Quayle said. "But the policy does not envision acquiring new orbiters."
Mr. Quayle, who is the head of the National Space Council, which sets national space policy, added: "It is time for a new phase in space launch. I am here to announce that as of today, we have entered that new phase."
 
Making Actions Official
 The announcement puts into effect some recommendations made last December by a 12-member committee that studied future of the nation's space program.
The announcement also made official some actions already in progress. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense have been working together to design a new national launching system; NASA had asked to buy a new orbiter in the next fiscal year and was turned down, and the Air Force has been studying whether to release surplus ballistic missiles for civilian use.
President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union are to sign a treaty in Moscow next week to reduce their nations' long-range nuclear weapons by approximately 30 percent.
The number of missiles that will be available for conversion to civilian use is potentially in the hundreds, but the new policy specifies that "due regard to economic impact on the commercial space sector" will also be considered. Three rocket builders now form the core of America's commercial industry.
The cost of developing a new family of launching vehicles able to carry medium and heavy payloads into orbit has been estimated to be as high as $11.5 billion. The goal is to reduce current launching costs from $3,600 a pound to about $300.
 
Commercial Role Considered
 The technology effort, Mr. Quayle said, will go into all phases of a launching system, from engines, structures and materials to exotic concepts like the National Aerospace Plane and a single-stage rocket that could reach orbit.
The space launching strategy will actively consider commercial space launching needs, and the directive said the space agency and the Defense Department "should actively explore having private industry take part in the new rocket plans." The two agencies and the Department of Energy are to submit a 10-year plan by Dec. 1.
Mr. Quayle told his audience at Vandenberg that the strategy would lead to a new commercial launch vehicle "as good or better than those of our foreign competitors."
 
Shuttles to Stay in Service
 The Administration said it did not intend to phase out the shuttle fleet, which will have four vehicles when Endeavour begins flying next year.
"The production of spare parts should continue in the near term to support the existing shuttle fleet and to preserve an option to acquire a replacement orbiter in the event of an orbiter loss or other demonstrable need," the policy says.

HEADLINE: Exxon Net Up Slight 2.7%, Bucking Oil's Downtrend

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 24

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation, the nation's biggest oil company, said today that net income in the second quarter rose 2.7 percent, as profits from oil and gas production and foreign operations barely offset downturns in other parts of its business.
Exxon was unusual among major oil companies in posting higher income for the quarter. Yet its profit was half its first-quarter total of $2.2 billion -- the highest of any quarter in Exxon's history. 
 The surge was tied to the Persian Gulf war, which caused demand and prices to soar for refined products in the Middle East and Europe. Profit margins in those regions fell sharply after the war.
Texaco Inc., in an earnings report more typical of current industry trends, said today that its profit fell 23.8 percent in the second quarter.
Analysts said that the Exxon and Texaco reports had few special gains or losses and that the companies' operating profits were in line with Wall Street forecasts.
Exxon's stock rose 37.5 cents, to $58.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Texaco shares slipped 50 cents, to $63.75.
Weak demand for gasoline and other refined products, as well as for natural gas and chemicals, depressed operating income for most diversified oil companies in the quarter, even though oil prices were generally a few dollars a barrel higher than in the spring of 1990.
Mobil, Amoco, ARCO and Phillips Petroleum posted lower quarterly earnings earlier this week. Analysts expect Chevron to announce sharply lower earnings on Friday.
"There really isn't much developing to boost income in the second half of the year" at most major oil companies, said George F. Friesen, senior oil analyst at the Deutsche Bank Group in New York. "Comparisons will be the most negative for the fourth quarter."
 
Exxon
 Net income was $1.13 billion, or 90 cents a share, compared with $1.1 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue rose 4.6 percent, to $27.3 billion, from $26.1 billion.
Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman and chief executive, said lower interest rates and debt totals helped Exxon to increase profits. Exxon has the lowest amount of debt as a percentage of total capital among major oil companies.
The company, based in Irving, Tex., increased output of refined products, with global output of gasoline, jet fuel and other products rising slightly to 4.8 million barrels a day. Natural gas sales rose in Europe, where spring weather was unusually cool, and declined in the United States.
Profits from oil and gas production in the United States more than doubled because of higher crude prices, to $179 million, from $81 million, but were flat at $463 million in foreign drilling activities. Spending for exploration, plant expansions and other projects rose to $2 billion, from $1.9 billion in the period a year ago.
 
Texaco
 Net income fell to $269 million, or 94 cents a share, from $353 million, or $1.26 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Revenues increased 3.4 percent, to $9.03 billion, from $8.72 billion.
In a statement, James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive, confirmed Wall Street views that market demand for refined products remained weak and that profit margins had narrowed further in the United States.
He said Texaco, based in White Plains, was seeking to control costs to maintain its rising capital spending program.
Profits from oil-and-gas production in the United States rose to $111 million, from $66 million, with oil prices averaging more than $2 a barrel higher in the quarter, at $16.48 a barrel, than in the spring quarter of 1990. Production products abroad rose to $78 million, from $67 million.
Results in global refining, marketing and transportation plunged to $194 million, from $328 million, and global chemical profits fell by 73.3 percent, to $8 million. Capital spending rose to $831 million, from $654 million.

HEADLINE: Troubled Workers Transport Urban Woes to the Catskills

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

DATELINE: KIAMESHA LAKE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Bill W. left New York in the spring last year because trouble was following him. It can be that way in the city, he said. Men roam the streets looking for or waiting for something bad to happen, and the tension from this can make you tired and old. When the bus from the Concord Resort Hotel came to his homeless shelter to recruit workers, he slipped on. "Drugs got me," he said. "I needed a place where no one could find me. My own escape."
His first day in the Catskills, working in the kitchen of the Concord Hotel, he washed close to 500 dishes. Then, he said, he walked down the road to his small room in a falling-down bungalow, closed the door and removed a small pipe and some crack from a pouch. Outside, he heard two men arguing. Someone was throwing stones against the side of the bungalow. It sounded like Jerome Avenue in the Bronx when he was homeless. Nothing was happening. Just drugs and drink and the idle feeling that in a flash, something could turn wrong.
 
No. 3 in Per Capita Crime
 Hundreds of people like Bill, homeless and penniless or in trouble have come to the Catskills either on their own or as recruits of the big hotels to fill minimum-wage jobs. Some have come to escape the strife of urban life but others have brought with them some of its grimmest symptoms, chiefly drugs and violence. 
 The presence of the transient workers is a large reason that the county ranks behind only Manhattan and Erie County in the state for crimes per capita, said the Sullivan County District Attorney, Stephen F. Lungen. Records indicate that the county's felony rate nearly doubles during the summer months, he said.
The issue has stoked a complicated debate in a region that is only now beginning to climb out of a deep economic slump that saw many of its old-time hotels go bankrupt. Minimum-wage jobs may well be a necessity, and besides, the hotel owners say they cannot attract any workers to do the "non-glamour" labor left over after they hire college students to do the "front" jobs, waiting tables, working as lifeguards and the like.
So sometimes working with employment agencies and homeless shelters, the hotels bring the men up, generally to have them work in the kitchen or as porters.
There was a time when the transient employees were part of the Catskills lore, bringing with them a kind of roguish charm that fit in with the borscht belt sensibility that liked its edges rough. They would shoot dice in the stairwells and play all-night poker games and no one minded.
But over the last few years, romantic ideas about these employees have vanished. Many of them, Mr. Lungen said, are working by day and then using or selling drugs by night.
Their desperate need for money for crack has led to more burglaries and violent crimes. But, Mr. Lungen said, the hotels, accustomed to hiring as if it were 30 years ago, have been slow to respond to the change. Instead of sending buses to the Bowery as they did years ago, the hotels now send buses to homeless shelters. They do not follow up, Mr. Lungen said, by screening the men, who are simply put to work.
The owners of the Pines and Kutsher's said that because their staffs are relatively small and a high percentage of their employees work the year round, they generally do not have a problem with transient workers. Brown's recently hired Sgt. G. W. King of the Sullivan County Sheriff's Department to screen applicants.
"You don't see card games between the workers anymore," he said. "You see drugs. They want it cleaned up."
The Concord, by contrast, expands its summer payroll by about 400 jobs to serve the guests who fill its 1,225 rooms.
Some local officials as well as advocates for the homeless say that the Concord may have logistical problems that the other hotels do not, but that the hotel's managers have created an underclass by recruiting workers from homeless shelters with fliers and phone calls. The officials said the Concord put them in rundown quarters and took too much money for room and board.
 
Ethical Questions
 "We are only allowed to do so much by law," said George N. Parker, an owner and the general manager of the Concord. "Every resort community in the world has this problem. We can't fingerprint people, and the college kids don't want to work in the kitchen.
"And besides, where do you think some of these people would be if it were not for their jobs here? Some of them have made a life out of this."
The executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless for Westchester, Anthony Wynne, said the Concord had recruited from the men's shelter in New Rochelle and elsewhere, often in emergencies, like the day after payday, when many of the transients leave without notice.
"I have some very strong ethical questions about importing poor people, paying them minimum wage and then taking more money out," Mr. Wynne said. "How can anyone move on from there? How can they purchase any goods, besides drugs and alcohol? More than anything else, this is slave labor."
The debate, Mr. Lungen said, has remained a quiet one because the drugs and violence have "never affected guests" and because most people in the community know that they depend on the survival of the hotels. Some officials who were interviewed called the issue too "politically hot" to talk about.
"The hotels are up against it, but there is no question that the transients make my job tougher," Mr. Lungen said. "It's not that we don't have local people committing crimes. We do. But because of the transients, our jails are more crowded and the feel is closer to that of a big city."
Three employees have been killed in the staff quarters of the Concord in the last 16 months, one in a stabbing by another worker in May and two in March 1990 in a fire set by another employee. Mr. Lungen said these incidents had received little attention "because as usual they happened amongst the employees."
But on a recent hot afternoon, state police investigators trudged from one door to another in a group of disheveled bungalows that house much of the Concord's staff. Their mission: handing out notices of a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrests and convictions of the killers of Miriam and Lazar Papier, an elderly Hasidic couple slain earlier this month in their own summer bungalow only a mile away. Investigators believe the slayings started as a burglary.
While Mr. Lungen and Capt. Michael F. Cahill of the state police have said they are not ruling out any possibility, both have also said that the Concord staff bungalows are a focus of the investigation, if only for their proximity to the scene of the slayings.
Bill W., who is 47 years old, sat in his room under a sign that said "Drugs won't work here." He said he did not want to give his full name out of fear of losing his job. A slight figure with a gaunt face, he held up his pay stub for two weeks' work. Though he had worked 80 hours at $4.25 an hour, he was left with $206, once room and board and union dues were taken out. He said he spends nearly all of his pay on crack, marijuana and alcohol.
He said he had come to the Concord because he was in trouble and homeless. He found out about the job through the La Guardia Men's Shelter in Chester, N.Y. He said he was concerned about the hotel's "loose hiring practices" because the "drugs keep pulling me down." But over all, he said, he was satisfied with the arrangement.
"This is good to get back on my feet," he said. "I don't have a lot of money, but then I don't have a lot to spend it on. I have no electric bills, no extra food bills. They give me my uniform for work. And it's very beautiful here."
He added one more note. "The violence doesn't bother me," he said. "People are upset with three or four murders in two years. But where I come from that happens before nightfall."

HEADLINE: Japan, to Rescue Bank, Will Tap Deposit Fund

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 24

 BODY:
Shedding new light on how they intend to consolidate the Japanese banking industry, Government officials said today that that they planned to tap the deposit insurance fund to help a healthy bank acquire a dying mutual savings bank.
With its paternalistic style of regulating banks and coercive but quiet methods for managing financial problems when they crop up, Japan has never before touched its bank deposit insurance fund. 
 But the regulators have now decided that the country has too many banks -- there are currently about 150 banks in all of Japan, compared with some 12,000 banking institutions in the United States -- and that the weaker and smaller must merge to survive in the tough financial environment of the 1990's.
"With financial deregulation and other pressures the financial environment is sure to worsen," one banking regulator said.
 
Sums Involved Are Modest
 The sums involved in the current case are modest. The deposit insurance fund is expected to make low-interest loans of some $80 million to encourage the Iyo Bank to acquire the Toho Sogo Bank, both modest-sized institutions on the largely rural island of Shikoku, in southwest Japan.
The Government officials said that the money would probably be provided in the form of loans at rates well below market levels, perhaps around 3 percent.
But the policy implications of the deal are more significant, as Government officials conceded that the highly publicized arrangement was intended to signal that the Government was now carrying through on its efforts to weed out weak banks and force them into combinations.
Robert Zielinski, a banking analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities here, said the move had sent a message "that all the fun is over and that there are going to be serious bankruptcies."
There have been two mergers of major city banks in the last two years and more are expected.
The deal has also illuminated the principal policy followed by the regulators in dealing with major financial problems at certain institutions -- it lets them slide.
The United States and many European countries have tough rules on when a bank must write off or make provisions for bad debts. In Japan there is a great deal of flexibility, giving banks years to try to work out problems.
A debacle like the collapse of the American savings and loan system may never happen in Japan, if only because the Government has shown no inclination to force sick institutions to face up to their problems quickly if speedy action would hurt public confidence or the public Treasury.
The Toho Sogo Bank is a good example. Toshio Tsubouchi, a wealthy industrialist, bought control of the bank in the early 1970's. It was used then to lend heavily to Kurushima Dock, a major shipowner with which he was affiliated.
With the depression in the shipping industry around 1980, Toho Sogo's loans to the company turned sour. But the bank has not had to face the problem head on until now, about 10 years later.
Toho Sogo must sell off about 20 of its 44 branch offices, according to news reports.
 
Committee Will Decide
 After that, the deposit insurance fund will form a committee of 10 composed of officials from the Bank of Japan, the Finance Ministry and the financial industry. These executives will then have several months to determine precisely how much aid Iyo Bank will receive for acquiring what remains of Toho Sogo.
In the past, mergers of ailing banks were generally supported by other banks under the guidance of the Government regulators.
The new approach shows that the Government is taking a more active role in eliminating the sick and leaving Japan with fewer, but presumably healthier, banks.

HEADLINE: President Out At Selectronics

 BODY:
Selectronics Inc., a developer and manufacturer of hand-held electronic Bibles and other reference products, said yesterday that its president and chief operating officer, James Finke, had resigned.
Mr. Finke was hired last year to expand the company's retail business, but Selectronics has since been restructured to focus on contracts with a few big distributors. 
 Because of this change, "it seemed timely for him to pursue other interests," Michael L. Weiner, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
During the recession, the Minneapolis-based company has seen many of its retail customers go bankrupt or fall behind in their payments. Selectronics said its fiscal-year results, to be reported later this month, would show "a significant loss."
To focus on big distributors, Selectronics has expanded in Europe in a venture with a large French distributor, Euro Direct Marketing. Selectronics said it was seeking a similar opportunity in Japan.

HEADLINE: Orders for Durables Drop 1.6%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
New orders for long-lived factory goods fell 1.6 percent in June and were not as strong in May as previously estimated, the Commerce Department reported today.
The unexpected decline in June's orders fanned doubts about economic recovery and caused bond prices to rise, but it did not force analysts into a fundamental reappraisal of the outlook. They noted that the report on orders for durable goods is one of the most erratic of the Government's statistical series. 
 "We were disappointed," said Paul W. Boltz, economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, when asked about the report, which had been expected to show a modest increase. Yet Mr. Boltz said he continued to expect the economy to grow at a 2.5 to 3 percent pace during the second half of the year.
 
Confidence Remains
 Nor did the June decline, which was four-tenths of 1 percent when the military sector is excluded, shake the confidence of Thomas F. Carpenter, chief economic at ASB Capital Management in Washington. Although some analysts worry that the economy may have pulled out of recession only to soon slip back again, Mr. Carpenter said this remained unlikely.
"I'm not in the double-dip camp," he said, adding that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be stampeded into a resumption of interest-rate cuts by a few weak economic reports.
Today's report, moreover, included some bright spots, including a 3.6 percent rise in new orders for primary-metals goods and a 3.7 percent rise for transportation equipment that was the second straight increase after four declines.
 
Shipments Advancing
 Shipments of durable goods -- which are products, from desks to destroyers, that are expected to last at least three years -- posted their third straight monthly advance after falling from November through March.
Shipments are considered a gauge of current economic conditions, while new orders and unfilled orders, or backlogs, are predictive indicators. Unfilled orders fell 1.1 percent in June, the fourth straight decline.
Orders for all types of durable goods totaled $116.5 billion last month, 1.6 percent below May's $118.4 billion and 7.7 percent below the level of June 1990.
The bulk of the new-orders decline last month was in two categories -- electronic and other equipment, which fell 10.1 percent, to $15.2 billion, and industrial machinery and equipment, which fell 4.7 percent, to $20 billion.
The rise in transportation equipment orders resulted from a jump in orders for aircraft that more than offset a decline for ships and tanks, the Commerce Department stated.
Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods fell 3.3 percent,after rising 1.1 percent in May and 5.9 percent in April.
Over all, the May increase for orders for durable goods is now put at 2 percent, down from 3.8 percent initially reported and from 3.4 percent after an early revision.
 
Behind the Revision
 The downward adjustment reflected a smaller gain for transportation equipment, which a month ago was put at $30.6 billion but is now put at $28.8 billion.
Within the capital-goods industries, new orders for nonmilitary products rose 4.2 percent, to $29.2 billion -- the first increase in six months -- but much of this consisted of aircraft that for the most part will not be built for years. If aircraft and parts are not counted, new orders for nonmilitary goods dropped 5 percent in June, while shipments rose eight-tenths of 1 percent and backlogs fell 2.4 percent.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV'S PLAN ON POWER SHARING WINS WIDE ASSENT

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 24

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced today that he had reached agreement with most of the country's republics on a draft treaty for a drastically decentralized system of power sharing in the Soviet Union.
By achieving a draft accord with nine of the 15 Soviet republics, Mr. Gorbachev has achieved a signficant political success on the eve of an important Communist Party central committee meeting, and next week's meeting in Moscow with President Bush. 
 Given Mr. Gorbachev's urgent efforts to encourage Western and Japanese investment and economic aid, the unity treaty will make it easier for Mr. Bush and other leaders to discuss such help more concretely. One problem in the past has been uncertainty by foreign governments and companies whether such funds should be given to the central Government or the separate republics.
The Soviet leader said the proposed treaty, one of the keys to his hopes for the political and economic reconstruction of this battered nation, would settle all major differences between his central Government and the republics except the precise system of tax sharing.
 
Gorbachev Delighted
 The taxation formula is supposed to be worked out in special negotiations within the next day, said Mr. Gorbachev, who was obviously delighted to announce progress toward liberalizing the nation as he faced a week of Communist Party intrigues and superpower summitry.
The White House said today in Washington that on his trip to the Soviet Union next week President Bush would address the Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine and meet with members of the emerging democratic movement in Moscow. [Page A10.]
The party hierarchy gathers in private session on Thursday to again vent their frustration at how the Gorbachev strategy is undoing their power monopoly. On Tuesday, President Bush arrives to seal the strategic nuclear weapons treaty as the latest success in the Soviet leader's disarmament compromises.
For all his optimism, Mr. Gorbachev still faces a series of obstacles to his hope for fast final approval of a new union treaty. There is the insistence by some republics such as the Ukraine to put off republic parliamentary debate until September, and there is the thorny taxation issue as well.
Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian federation republic and a key figure in the attempted compromise, stressed in remarks that the tax dispute -- how much the central Government coffers would yield to the republics' desire to control the revenue flow -- was a critical issue that had not been worked out.
Speaking on the eve of a Communist Party central committee meeting that is expected to again criticize his courting of Western economic alliances, President Gorbachev nevertheless pronounced the negotiations a success. In particular he hailed the decision of Armenia, one of the six republics that originally boycotted the treaty talks, to rejoin the discussions this week.
Mr. Gorbachev emerged early this morning with the announcement after a final 12-hour burst of negotiations that capped a three-month process of seeking compromise with the restless, sovereignty-hungry republics on a blueprint for a new Soviet Union.
 
Gorbachev Hails Treaty
 He hailed the treaty as "a very deep reforming of our federation and a serious redistribution of powers in favor of the republics."
"The most important thing is that we have finally reached agreement," the Soviet leader declared this morning. He said the next phase in the process is that the treaty would be open for signing after additional consideration by the nine republics that negotiated it with him.
In addition to Russia, the keystone republic with most of the the country's population and wealth, the republics involved in the original negotiations in April were the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Khirghizistan, Tadzhikistan and Turkmenistan. Not taking part were the three Baltic republics demanding outright independence -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- plus Georgia, Moldavia and Armenia, which have been vowing independence at a slower pace.
The Armenian President, Levon Ter-Petrosian, who has scheduled a fall referendum in his republic on eventual independence, appeared at the discussions on Tuesday and has not yet commented on how attractive the proposed draft treaty might have become in the negotiating process of give and take.
President Gorbachev said he hoped the treaty would prove inviting to all the republics. "I am for the deep sovereignty of the republics within a framework of a new union," he said.
 
Fresh Problems and Doubts
 Fresh problems and doubts have arisen regularly across the three-month negotiating process, a pattern likely to continue into the next phase. But President Gorbachev was obviously pleased to be able to claim progress as he moved midway between last week's economic summit meeting, with its concern for the failing Soviet economy, and the summit meeting here next week with President Bush to sign the strategic arms reduction treaty.
The decentralization of political power and economic life has been the main goal of the republics in the treaty negotiations. Mr. Gorbachev at first resisted their pressure but then yielded last spring when the national economy approached a state of breakdown and he turned from the traditional reliance on the centralized monolith of state Communism to try and spark economic life.
With his strategy now cast more with the republics, President Gorbachev has won greater support from the world's free-market democracies, whose leaders, the Group of Seven nations, promised him technical aid and an ongoing subsidiary role last week at their London summit meeting.
 
New Political Force
 His closer alliance with the republics also clearly appeals to Mr. Gorbachev as a new political force to buttress him against the complaints and threats of Communist Party hard-liners. They have been thrashing about more lately as they see their role shrinking under the strategy of President Gorbachev, their own party leader.
After announcing the draft agreement, Mr. Gorbachev turned to the coming full gathering of the party central committee on Thursday and Friday, saying he wanted to liberalize the old party platform and "help the party get its second wind."
The meeting is expected to be interesting mainly as a measure of the resistance, or the atrophying, of the party elite in the face of Mr. Gorbachev's accelerating strategy of trying to democratize life and to build a Soviet role in the world's free economic market.

HEADLINE: Strong Overseas Sales Lift McDonald's Profits

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation, the world's largest restaurant chain, reported yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose 8 percent, to $232 million, or 63 cents a share. That compared with profits of $215.8 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
McDonald's is embroiled in a domestic price war with competitors, and much of the rise in the second quarter came from strong foreign sales. But analysts said the earnings were more sluggish than they had expected. 
 In the second quarter, sales for the company were nearly flat. Quarterly revenue rose less than 1 percent to $1.67 billion, from $1.66 billion in the 1990 period.
Systemwide sales, which includes nearly 8,400 franchised restaurants, rose 6 percent to $4.96 billion, from $4.66 billion a year earlier.
On the New York Stock Exchange, McDonald's stock closed at $33.125 yesterday, down 12.5 cents a share.
 
'Far Weaker' Than Expected
 Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery Securities, one of the more bearish restaurant analysts who follow McDonald's, said, "I was anticipating a weak quarter, but this is far weaker than I think anyone expected."
He said that while McDonald's lower-priced entrees, known as its "value menu," had succeeded in attracting new customers, it was disappointing in view of McDonald's large advertising and marketing expenses in the last six months.
Operating income from restaurants within the United States actually declined 1 percent in the first six months to $490.2 million, from $494.2 million. And revenue in the United States declined 5 percent in the period, to $1.83 billion, from $1.92 billion.
But Mr. Mueller noted that some of the revenue decline was actually a healthy sign because it was a result of McDonald's selling poorly performing company-owned restaurants.
 
Growth Abroad
 Strong growth at foreign restaurants helped. Operating income outside of the United States in the first six months rose 21 percent, to $303.1 million, from $250.9 million. Six-month foreign sales rose 12 percent, to $1.4 billion, from $1.25 billion.
In a statement, Michael R. Quinlan, McDonald's chairman and chief executive, said that despite the weak sales the company was convinced that its "value menu" had improved customer perceptions of McDonald's. Mr. Quinlan said the number of orders at restaurants had risen, although he was not specific.
"There is no clear sign," he said, "of economic recovery impacting consumer spending levels in several major markets, including the United States, and yet our top-line sales and transactions are improving, slowly but steadily, in economic environments which are not."
A spokesman declined to say how well the McLean Deluxe, the low-fat burger introduced this year, was doing. He said, however, that it was selling better than the McDLT, the poorly received lettuce-and-tomato burger that McLean replaced.

HEADLINE: Brazil Wins Skirmish With I.M.F.

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 24

 BODY:
President Fernando Collor de Mello has scored a populist victory here in a shouting match with the International Monetary Fund, which acceded to his demand yesterday that Jose Fajgenbaum, an Argentine economist, be removed as head of the fund's negotiating team in Brasilia. He is to be replaced Thursday by Sterie Baza, an American.
In the morning, demonstrators greeted the President, waving signs reading, "Long live Collor! I.M.F., Respect our people!" and "Brazil is not a colony!" Headlines proclaimed "I.M.F. backs down," and "I.M.F. heeds Collor."
 
Debate Over Motives
 In more sophisticated circles, analysts were debating today whether Brazil's shouting match with the fund actually represented a new, populist turn in economic policy, or a clever piece of political theater. Some suggested that Mr. Collor might have stage-managed it to make an eventual accord with the fund more palatable at home. Debt-rescheduling talks with the fund resumed today after a three-day suspension. 
 The confrontation between Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, and the fund started last Thursday when the Jornal do Brasil, a newspaper, reported that Mr. Fajgenbaum had said Brazil could straighten out its finances only when it changed clauses in its Constitution that mandate generous federal revenue sharing with states and muncipalities.
"He's the one who should get his own house in order," President Collor snapped in response, demanding Sunday that the Washington-based organization recall him. "For someone from outside to come and give us tips is inadmissible."
 
Statements Are Denied
 Mr. Fajgenbaum denied that he had made the statements, but his denial had no effect.
Many analysts here suggest Mr. Collor's highly confrontational stand was intended to defuse future left-wing opposition to constitutional changes of the kind the Fund representative was advocating.
"He is playing up a basically insignificant thing to show the domestic audience how tough he is," one Brazilian businessman said, noting that by law Mr. Collor needs the Senate's approval for debt-rescheduling agreements.
But other analysts feared the verbal sparring could signal a new phase of Brazilian intransigence that could slow Brazil's return to the good graces of the international banking community.
An agreement to reschedule $8.5 billion in overdue interest has been reached with representatives of foreign commercial banks, but must be endorsed by 95 percent of the creditors before it takes effect. The pact, which is the only debt rescheduling of Mr. Collor's 16-month-old Government, has been ratified by 280 banks, or about half the total.
"People here are very concerned; they don't want the arrears deal to fall through," Riordan A. Roett, a Brazil expert, said today from New York where he is a bank consultant.
Brazil's left views the fund as a meddling policeman for capitalist banks. Now, Mr. Collor, a free market conservative, is taking the same view, giving rise to such anxieties.
"The Government should reject this inadmissable interference and send this technician out of the country on the first plane," said Roberto Freire, a Congressman for the Brazilian Communist Party.
Brazil has not had an agreement with the fund since early 1989. A new accord could involve the disbursement of up to $2 billion in low-interest loans to Brazil over 18 months. But the true significance of an accord is that it signals private bankers that Brazil's finances are in order.
 
Talks on $52 Billion in Debt
 Next month, talks are to start in New York over rescheduling Brazil's $52 billion medium- and long-term foreign debt. Without an I.M.F. accord, there is little chance that the bankers will sign an agreement.
In constrast, Argentina's Central Bank president, Roque Fernandez, announced today that the fund is to approve a $1 billion standby loan to Argentina on Monday.
Brazil's progress on debt talks -- and Mr. Collor's position -- will no doubt be of considerable interest to an American business mission scheduled to arrive in Brasilia in two weeks, led by Vice President Dan Quayle and by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
In recent days, Mr. Collor has openly expressed frustration with a perceived lack of support from the developed world.
 
Plan for Rain Forests
 During last week's summit meeting in London, Brazil expected that the Western powers would give Brazil $1.5 billion for a three-year rain-forest protection plan. Instead, they gave $50 million.

HEADLINE: ECONOMISTS ASSESS ARAB-ISRAEL MOVE

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
If Arabs and Israelis decide to make deals, not war, how much does the Israeli economy stand to gain?
Nobody has a remotely reliable estimate, said Michael Bruno, governor of Israel's central bank. Nobody is suggesting, said Dan Halperin, an Israeli consultant in Tel Aviv, that "lifting the boycott today will have a major impact tomorrow." 
 And while an Israeli business group said this week that the boycott has cost Israel more than $36 billion since 1948, some Government officials, like Amnon Neubach, the Israeli economic counselor in Washington, say they are not sure that the Arab ban has hurt Israel measurably.
Egypt and Saudi Arabia had proposed ending the 43-year-old economic boycott of Israel if Israel freezes further settlements in the West Bank. Israel has rejected that proposal, but if the talk about peace produces any agreements with Syria and Jordan, the boycott could start to come down.
The Arab ban covers all direct trade with Israel, dealings with most companies that do business with Israel, as well as with firms that buy or sell to, or invest in, companies that do business with Israel.
 
Boom Not Expected
 Economists, investment experts and executives, including Mr. Bruno and Mr. Halperin, argue that, in time, ending the boycott could lift confidence among foreign investors, stimulate more service ventures, and improve the prospects for Palestinian exporters in the West Bank and in Gaza.
To be sure, economists are not predicting an Israeli export boom in the region. Most Israeli exports -- diamonds, electronics, pharmaceuticals -- are geared to upscale markets in Europe and the United States, not to neighbors like Jordan or Syria whose living standards are roughly one-tenth of Israel's.
Trade between Israel and Egypt, except for oil, remains negligable more than a decade after Egypt broke ranks with other Arab nations and dropped out of the boycott. Besides, the most eager buyers and sellers on either side of the Israeli-Arab divide are already finding ways to make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transactions regardless.
The biggest benefit for the Israeli economy, said Walter P. Stern, a New York investment adviser, is likely to be an intangible one, greater investor confidence. The end of the boycott would be "a long term signal of Israel's re-entry into the world as a legitimate place to trade and invest."
 
'Psychological Barriers'
 Jean Abi Nader of the United States Arab Chamber of Commerce said, "It would lift psychological barriers to companies that want to do business in both markets."
Multinationals that have refrained from making investments in Israel -- especially Japanese, Korean and French firms -- may take a second look, Israeli economists say. With a few exceptions like I.B.M. and Motorola, foreign direct investment is small.
"You would see the involvement in Israel of more multinational companies, especially in industries where you don't see them at all," said Dan Halperin an Israeli consultant in Tel Aviv. "It will also become easier for Israeli firms to buy knowhow from international companies."
What is more, Israel's credit rating could get a welcome boost, Mr. Bruno said. Lenders, he said, would likely be less reluctant to risk their funds. Israel is struggling to create jobs for hundreds of thousands of new Soviet immigrants and is looking to the rest of the world to supply some of the needed investment.
 
High-Skilled Labor Advantage
 Consumers in Saudi Arabia or Syria may not be about to start stocking up on Israeli brands for which there are easy substitutes, economists say. But, Israeli services, from computer programming and insurance to medical services and tourism and agricultural may find a more ready reception.
"Israel has a comparative advantage in services because of its high skilled labor," said Leonardo Liederman, an economist at Tel Aviv University. With the influx of Soviet doctors, engineers and scientists, such services are apt to become even more affordable and abundant.
The total volume of imports and exports could swell by $1 billion if the boycott ends, said Haim Ben-Shahar, professor of economist at Tel Aviv University. Total trade last year was about $37 billion.
Surprisingly, some of the biggest winners of a cease-fire in the Arab economic war against Israel could be Palestinians in the Gaza and West Bank. Small businesses there produce things that Arab neighbors can afford to buy -- fruit, vegetables, olive oil, cut stone, clothing and shoes.
"These are natural traders," said Howard Rosen, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The boycott hurt Palestinian trade much more than Israel's."
Palestininas now find their exports to Arab countries blocked for a variety of reasons related to the boycott, like relying on Israeli ports, using inputs made in Israel or being required by the Israeli Government to sell produce through Israeli cooperatives.
"I could imagine an export boom," said Peter Gubser, president of Near East Refugee Aid. "You'd see a lot of products with some Israeli inputs going out under a West Bank label."
A spurt in export-related production on the West Bank and in Gaza would be blessing because, due to the Palestinian uprising as well as the Soviet immigrant wave, unemployment among Palestinians is rising.

HEADLINE: Peru's Ex-Leader Enmeshed In Scandal Over Failed Bank

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, July 20

 BODY:
This month's closing of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has diverted the attention of Peru from its poverty, malnutrition and terrorism to a bizarre drama involving former President Alan Garcia, the mysterious financial network of the bank, and allegations that Mr. Garcia looted the country with the bank's help.
Investigations led by a commission of the Peruvian Congress and involving two American private investigative companies have turned up preliminary evidence -- which Mr. Garcia has rebutted -- that during his presidency he siphoned away as much as $50 million from the country and used B.C.C.I.'s Panama branch as a conduit for the funds. 
 One report said Mr. Garcia was introduced to B.C.C.I. Panama by Manuel Noriega, the deposed Panamian dictator, who was a close friend and ally of Mr. Garcia's and an important customer of the bank.
The congressional commission has also found that for two years during Mr. Garcia's presidency -- for reasons no one here can fully explain -- B.C.C.I. Panama was Peru's private banker, even though the bank paid a lower interest rate on deposits than other banks.
Early in Mr. Garcia's five-year term, which spanned the period from mid-1985 to mid-1990, the Peruvian central bank kept more than half of the country's cash in B.C.C.I. Panama, at a time when officials within the central bank were warning that B.C.C.I. was losing huge sums. In effect, Peru's deposits were propping up the bank.
In the aftermath of the bank's closing in nearly 70 countries, there are investigations -- both formal and informal -- as regulators, depositors and politicians try to resolve questions about the bank's dealings.
In Peru and elsewhere, those who are sifting through the bank's past are finding that its penchant for privacy and its unwieldy international structure make it difficult to reach any conclusions quickly.
The United States has long had a distaste for Mr. Garcia's politics because of his nationalization of an American oil company and because he led a movement in Latin America to resist paying foreign debts. It is intensely interested in the fate of the investigation and has encouraged the effort, which is being led by an ambitious, 32-year-old member of the Peruvian Congress, Fernando Olivera, who ran on an anti-corruption, anti-Garcia platform.
American diplomats have told the commission that information exists that could shed light on Mr. Garcia's dealings, yet they cannot share it with Peruvian authorities until the Peruvian Government votes to lift the immunity from prosecution that is bestowed on all former presidents.
 
Public Theater
The Investigator Becomes a Hero
 The theater for this investigation has been Peruvian television, which has broadcast the allegations and the denials in detail. That kind of visibility has fueled debate throughout the country and made Mr. Olivera a temporary hero.
This week, for instance, as hundreds marched through a dusty, narrow street here following a religious procession led by two life-sized silver images of the Virgin of Carmen, a peasant woman approached Mr. Olivera to cheer him on.
"We're praying to the Blessed Virgin that you'll get our money back for us," she said. She squeezed his hand and then disappeared into the crowd.
Most of the Peruvian people are puzzled, however. Recent polls found that 70 percent believe Mr. Garcia profited illegally while in office, but only 40 percent believe the charges by Mr. Olivera's commission. One reason for their confusion is that it does not seem plausible that a former president can afford two luxurious homes here, expensive travel and other luxuries on his modest income of $2,500 a month from a charitable foundation and as a member of the Senate.
"There is just no doubt among anyone you talk to that his salary could not have supported such a life style," said a very senior Western diplomat. "That's a given."
 
Letters From Banks
 Mr. Garcia, who left Peru after the bank was seized and is traveling, has denied allegations including that he had secret bank accounts in the United States. He says he has no savings and never had such accounts overseas. Appearing on national television, he has produced letters from B.C.C.I. offices and other banks where he allegedly had deposits saying no Garcia accounts ever existed.
Since one of the detective companies hired by the commission was based in Florida, Mr. Garcia filed a complaint with Florida officials seeking to examine the company, Larc Investigative Services. The state acted quickly, bringing charges of malpractice against Larc.
The counteroffensive seems to have worked. A Congress that two months ago seemed ready for the first time in modern history to lift immunity from a former president, is now in retreat. The House is scheduled to vote in August, and politicians say there is at least a 50 percent chance it will end the inquiry into Mr. Garcia's personal finances.
"What you have here is a cultural assumption that a Latin American head of state must be corrupt, but when you check out the allegations, there is nothing there," said Jerome I. Levinson, Mr. Garcia's lawyer at Arnold & Porter in Washington. "The hostility in this town towards Alan Garcia is palpable. I have a certain sympathy for the guy."
Mr. Levinson said he asked Mr. Garcia in their first conversation if he had any bank accounts abroad, even ones that might have not been named by the Olivera commission.
"He said he had no accounts, either direct or indirect, and that he had nothing to hide," Mr. Levinson said.
Mr. Olivera admits his commission has suffered a big credibility setback and is casting about for new evidence. And Mr. Garcia's supporters are quietly claiming victory and talking about a possible Garcia presidency in the next elections in 1995.
"I think the investigation has been very poorly managed," said Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos, an economist and one of the country's leading pollsters. "The accusations were premature, not conclusive, so Garcia could shoot holes in them. He's done a superb public relations job. He can now say that it is the bankers and foreigners who are trying to get back at him."
 
Tallying the Expenses
Houses and Trips On $1,500 a Month
 A year ago, it did not seem this grim to Mr. Olivera. As Mr. Garcia left office, the country was in shambles. Inflation had been two million percent. Peru was an outcast in the financial community. Foreign investment was nonexistent and terrorism on the rise.
What bothered many members of Congress was Mr. Garcia's life style -- the new house he bought in the fashionable section of Chacarilla, the beachhouse he built to the south, the restaurants he visited and the trips and vacations he took. After all, as President, Mr. Garcia's salary was only $1,500 a month.
And some are now wondering how he can afford such expensive legal defense.
After the investigation was begun, the commission tallied every known expenditure and source of income for Mr. Garcia, relying heavily on income tax statements. By November, it found that from 1977 through June 1991, Mr. Garcia's spending exceeded his income by $500,000.
"That in and of itself should be enough to prosecute him," said Lourdes Flores, another member of the investigative commission.
 
Americans Are Hired
 But the commission, tipped off that Mr. Garcia might have had foreign bank accounts, hired American investigators -- Kroll Associates of New York, famous for finding the secret bank accounts of Saddam Hussein, Ferdinand Marcos and the Duvalliers, and the little-known Larc, headed by Rafael N. Garcia (no relation to President Garcia).
By April, Mr. Olivera thought he had the evidence. A letter from Kroll describing "interim findings" said that in the failed Western Federal Savings and Loan Association of Dallas, which was folded into Sunbelt Federal Savings by regulators in 1988, there had been an account under the name of Alan Garcia Perez, but that it was closed by the end of 1989.
In reference to B.C.C.I., Kroll wrote, "We have been informed by sources we consider reliable that they believe it probable that Mr. Garcia had a personal account or accounts at B.C.C.I. and Mr. Garcia had accumulated substantial monies while in office."
 
Transfers Abroad
 A five-page Larc memorandum said Mr. Garcia had been introduced to B.C.C.I.'s Panama office by Mr. Noriega, Larc also said Mr. Garcia probably had diverted $50 million through the B.C.C.I. Panama bank into British, Belgian, Spanish and American institutions. Some of the accounts were in his wife's name, Maria N. Bodereau, and transfers were made from a Belgian bank to the defunct Bank of New England to an account held by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the bankrupt Wall Street investment firm, the report said. Calls to Larc seeking more information were not returned.
Account numbers were provided, information similar to the Kroll report was given about accounts at Western Federal, and a report was made of an account at the Centrust Savings Bank in Miami, another failed institution whose largest individual shareholder was Gaith Pharaon, a Middle Eastern businessman and a suspected connection for B.C.C.I. investments in the United States.
With great fanfare, Mr. Olivera announced the results before the Peruvian Congress last April. The country gasped. Mr. Garcia's powerful American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party shook at its foundation.
 
The Counteroffensive
Mustering Support From Old Allies
 Mr. Garcia struck back by hiring Arnold & Porter and calling into service Jorge del Castillo, former mayor of Lima and an old political ally. He also solicited letters from all the banks named by Larc and Kroll as to whether he held accounts there.
The rebuttal arrived: A letter signed by Ajmal Afzal and Khalid Zaidi, managers of B.C.C.I.'s Luxembourg branch, said no account existed. Likewise, B.C.C.I.'s branches in the Cayman Islands and Panama also denied existence of Garcia accounts. Sunbelt Federal Savings wrote that no Garcia account could be found, and the Bank of New England said no Drexel account with the number 092074392 existed.
These were presented on national television news shows as proof of Mr. Garcia's veracity.
Mr. del Castillo paid a visit to Florida, where he met with state officials and asked them to investigate Larc.
Within a month, the state had accused Rafael Garcia, Larc's president, and a former official of the Drug Enforcement Agency, of refusing to cooperate with their investigation, giving conflicting statements about the investigation to state officials, and not having a proper license to operate a branch office.
It also found that Mr. Garcia had been warned that the information he had received had not been verified. And state officials told the sources involved in gathering information for the Larc report not to talk to the press.
John M. Russi, director of Florida's division of licensing, also permitted two Peruvian television stations to tape an explanation of the charges against Larc given by Florida officials to Mr. del Castillo. The tape was widely broadcast on national television in Peru.
 
Claiming Victory
 The impact was significant; Mr. Garcia's allies began claiming victory. "We have showed that these accusations are lies, falsehoods and vicious statements with no basis," Mr. del Castillo said in an interview. "It should be absolutely clear that the former President has done nothing wrong."
Not everyone agrees. What they do agree on is that time is running out for Mr. Olivera and his commission.
In early August, the Peruvian House will vote on whether there is enough indication that Mr. Garcia was involved in wrongdoing to justify lifting his immunity.
If it does, then the Senate, of which Mr. Garcia is a permanent member because he is a former President, must take similar action. Only then, will the Peruvian Supreme Court consider lifting the immunity and begin prosecution.
One hope for the investigators had been the banking regulators in the United States. Since both the Larc and Kroll reports cited reports of a Garcia account at Western Federal Savings, they hoped regulators could find evidence of it.
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corporation, who examined the records of Sunbelt and Western Federal, say they found one suspicious $2 million transfer, but they could not link it to Mr. Garcia. They also checked the books of Centrust, but found nothing. Just last week, they closed the case.

HEADLINE: Siblings: Growing Up And Closer

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE

 BODY:
ADULT siblings inhabit a twilight zone of family relationships. They have no roles, no rituals, no clear-cut patterns of behavior, a few proscribed but no prescribed ways of relating -- no relationship at all, sometimes, since as freewheeling adults theirs is a voluntary association.
"Sometimes it seems like little more than that -- an association," said Janice A. Cummings, publisher of Memory Lane Magazine for radio station KXAM in Scottsdale, Ariz., and the eldest of five siblings age 22 to 35. "I mean, sometimes I can't believe that we were all raised under the same roof. I look at my brothers and sisters as adults and think, 'Who the hell are you?' " 
 Now, it seems, Mrs. Cummings and tens of millions of other American adults are going to have to find out. Demographic trends show the emergence of a generation of grownups with more siblings than children.
Steve W. Rawlings, a family demographer for the United States Census Bureau, projects that as many as 10 percent of the adult population may not marry during their lifetime, up from 5 percent in recent years. Of women born in the early 1950's, he said, 17 percent are remaining childless in their lifetime, up from 9 percent of women born in the 1930's. Mr. Rawlings also noted that overall family size has been steadily declining.
With Americans living longer, the importance of siblings as potential care-givers looms large. Their role is further underscored by the economic downturn and the AIDS pandemic, which are sending many adults to family members for support. That makes siblings "the ultimate insurance policy," says Deborah T. Gold, a medical sociologist at Duke University Medical Center.
"They are the only people with the potential to know us from birth to death," she said. "They can meet us on an equal footing not possible in a parent-child relationship. And they are the only ones who can help us look over the chaos of our lives and make it make sense."
More often than not, the summons for help is likely to be answered. Researchers say and siblings agree that there is a deep-seated sense of obligation for brothers and sisters lurking between the biblical mandate that they are one another's keepers and the hope that if worst came to worst, they would come to one another's aid. And there is a shared family history.
These ties, however, can often be buried by adulthood.
"The adult sibling relationship is a revocable detachment, a kind of dormant emotional tie that we can mobilize when we choose," said Ingrid Arnet Connidis, an associate professor in the sociology department of the University of Western Ontario.
The tie seems to operate independently of the relationship at times. "After our father died, it seemed that she was the grieving widow, not my mother," Donald G. Bauchner said of his sister. Mr. Bauchner, 50 years old, who is president of the Perfumer's Workshop in New York, said, "We had a major breakup over this."
But he said he always knew she was there if needed. "I just didn't want to put our bond to the test."
That bond is begun in childhood, with parents writing the script. "Many years ago, after her divorce, Mom selected my sister as the one who would help raise us -- a mini-mom," said Dana Wood, associate beauty editor for W magazine and Mrs. Cummings's 28-year-old sister. "I always felt like I could never be as good as her."
Psychologists say many parents inadvertently place children in comparative categories. "One is 'the smart one,' another 'the responsible one' in a unidimensional labeling that can stunt sibling growth," said Renee A. Cohen, a clinical psychologist in West Los Angeles.
Issues of rivalry and favoritism during childhood can be played out later in grownup terms, says Matti K. Gershenfeld, president of the Couples Learning Center in Jenkintown, Pa. Popular avenues, Dr. Gershenfeld says, are money -- who has more and how that largess is given and received among siblings -- and the comparative success of children.
But these childhood roles can be tossed aside, as Dr. Gershenfeld knows. Born six years after the accidental deaths of the first children in the family, she was the "miracle child" in her family. "I was 10 before I realized that breathing wasn't special," Dr. Gershenfeld said. "Two years after me, my sister was born. She has had to live with that."
So the sisters "intentionally took separate paths to outgrow our parents' definition of me," Dr. Gershenfeld said. "We did not attend the same college. We don't even belong to the same synagogue."
Not all such sibling baggage is as easily disposed of. Dr. Gold says she and her colleagues see about 80 percent of siblings age 65 and older in varying degrees of closeness, 10 percent more in neutral relationships and the remaining 10 percent in negative relationships.
Research, mostly among older adults, suggests, for example, the importance of family size, with larger families producing closer sibling ties, and the relative insignificance of birth order.
A family's race and ethnicity, even its gender composition, help shape the nature of the sibling bond throughout its life cycle. And sibling relationships do have a life cycle.
"In some ways my younger brother, Jerry, and I led a Beaver and Wally existence as kids, if you consider that normal -- sometimes best friends and sometimes worst enemies," said David Zucker, a director whose latest film is "Naked Gun 2 1/2." Jerry Zucker is also a film director.
Adolescence, however, created a break. "We didn't even have a rivalry," Mr. Zucker said. "We just had . . . nothing."
The turnaround, he said, came in college: "The first time I came home during freshman year, we had a long talk. I remember that conversation because it signaled the end of one period and the beginning of another, when we began to be equal."
Adulthood, says Victor G. Cicirelli, a professor of developmental and aging psychology at Purdue University, reduces emotional distances after a period of individual family and career building; a collapsing of age differences under the weight of events that all adults can experience: marriage, divorce, children, jobs.
"Today, my younger brother and I can greet each other as adults in our 40's, with respect for the separate tracks we took in life," said Barbara G. Nye, vice president of strategic planning and development for Jostens Inc., a maker of education and training products in Minneapolis.
But the same adulthood events that can strengthen the sibling bond can readily weaken it.
Their mother's death, which could have come between Mrs. Cummings and Ms. Wood, led to reunion. "We can have some fun with each other when we see each other, now that we no longer have to please someone who was hard to please," Ms. Wood said.
 But for Mr. Bauchner, his sister's marriage pushed them apart. "I never cared for any of her husbands," he said.
But the need to care for elderly parents has become a shared concern for Ms. Nye and her brother. "We've talked about him doing the bulk of the work," she said. "But I see him more clearly now as an adult, and I appreciate the fact that he is more patient with them than I would be."
Seeing siblings as adults and renegotiating roles, psychologists say, are tools with which even damaged relationships can be improved.
The starting point is a continued tie to shared memories, even painful memories, said Stephen P. Bank, an adjunct professor of psychology at Wesleyan University, and an author of "The Sibling Bond" (Basic Books, 1982).
 The search for common ground, Dr. Cicirelli says, can be a challenge. "Siblings are brought up to share certain similarities, values and interests, but life circumstances can weaken that glue," he said. "Operating counter to that, however, is what I believe to be a basic drive to preserve the relationship."
 It is that drive that Mrs. Cummings sees in many adult sibling relationships.
"As adults, we've all been undergoing a renegotiation of roles," she said. "Some of us have been successful, and some of us not. We all have the capacity to have incredible arguments, and then get in touch. In the end, we all seem to come back to each other."

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
A Feint or a Force?

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
At the London economic summit meeting, George Bush was impressed by the commitment of other leaders to aggressive action on environmental issues -- a commitment that appears to have been considerably stronger than the President's own.
His Administration, with the major exception of its support for a new and innovative clean air bill, has not been an active environmental advocate, either at home or abroad. Yet the U.S., with its uncounted automobiles, its near-universal refrigeration and air-conditioning and its vast accumulations of toxic wastes, is one of the world's great polluters. 
 During a 45-minute White House meeting with his new Commission on Environmental Quality, the President remarked that he had been surprised by his summit associates' interest in the subject. He specifically mentioned Chancellor Helmut Kohl's concern for preservation of the threatened Brazilian rain forest.
Mr. Bush also confessed that he had found himself under pressure from other summit leaders to attend a global environment conference to be held under United Nations auspices at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.
Whether his experience with other leaders will push him to a more aggressive environmental policy remains to be seen. He has not yet agreed to go to Rio, for example, but is holding open the dates. Somewhat similarly, it's not clear whether his Environmental Commission, which met for the first time this week, is a feint or will become a force.
Appointing such commissions is a well-known, time-honored tactic by which many Presidents have appeared to be doing something about problems they didn't actually intend to tackle. At first glance, the large number of industrialists and businessmen in the new environmental group appears to put it in this "for show" category. So does Mr. Bush's stated hope to use the commission to help develop environmental responses other than "regulatory solutions," at reduced expense.
That sounds suspiciously like an effort to back away from enforcement of environmental regulation, which can be both costly and unpopular with industry and unions. The Bush White House often has been charged with seeking relief from, rather than firmly enforcing, rules and regulation -- blocking, for example, proposals by the Environmental Protection Agency that municipal incinerators be required to set up recycling programs.
On the other hand, a number of executives named to the commission have taken an active interest in environmental protection -- for example, William D. Ruckelshaus, twice a director of the E.P.A. and now chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries; Allen F. Jacobsen of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which has established a program to stop pollution from its plants; and Frank P. Popoff of Dow Chemical, a leader in the industry's environmental efforts.
The panel also includes prominent environmental advocates like Patrick F. Noonan of the Conservation Fund, Kathryn Fuller of the World Wildlife Fund and Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Some in the environmental community believe, moreover, that the group's formation was engineered by Michael Deland, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, in an effort to strengthen White House policy. Mr. Deland also will serve as commission chairman.
Thus it's at least possible that Mr. Bush's appointees may push him further than he expects, or wants, to go. At its organizational meeting, for example, Richard A. Clarke, the head of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, proposed that "concrete goals" be established for the reduction of pollutants in the atmosphere -- carbon dioxide, in particular.
Coming from an executive of the largest utility in the U.S., which would be directly affected by such a goal, this was a strong proposal. If adopted, moreover, a goal of restricting carbon dioxide emissions would be a direct challenge to John Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
High levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are believed to be the major cause of the so-called "greenhouse effect," which results in global warming. Mr. Sununu has been highly skeptical of evidence that the earth is heating up, and has used his considerable authority to limit Administration action against a problem he has not been willing to acknowledge.

HEADLINE: Protect Consumers, Not Dairy Farmers

 BODY:
Milo Minderbinder, the famous wheeler-dealer in Joseph Heller's antiwar novel "Catch-22," "enriches" himself by buying high and selling low. With a similar spit-in-your-eye logic, the House Agriculture Committee proposes to protect American consumers -- by cutting back production of milk, thereby driving up its price by as much as 50 cents per gallon. Get it? Put plenty of milk on every breakfast table by cutting back production and raising prices.
That's a proposition that only Milo, or one of 200,000 dairy farmers contributing a total of $2 million a year in campaign contributions, could love. But it's a punishing proposition for millions of poor parents struggling to feed their children. Ordinary logic and fairness dictate a no vote when it comes to the House floor, as early as this week.
The bill would raise next year's milk price supports, the minimum price the Government guarantees dairy farmers, by 25 percent. That would reverse the 30 percent slide in milk prices during the past year. To prevent higher prices from leading to oversized surpluses, which the Government would be required to buy, the bill would penalize farmers who expand production. The idea is to drive up prices without driving up the deficit.
That's clever, but wrongheaded. It isn't Congress's responsibility to guarantee dairy farmers -- or house painters, taxi drivers or locksmiths -- a decent living. If the milk market is glutted, some farmers will have to exit. Indeed, the movement off the farms will intensify as technological advances allow fewer farmers to meet the nation's needs.
Congress could help distressed dairy farmers the same way it helps other displaced workers: job relocation and retraining. It could provide more unemployment compensation, even welfare. But forcing poor parents to skimp on milk purchases to bail out well-off farmers makes sense only in "Catch-22."

HEADLINE: Not Too Late to Keep From Making the Fare-Card Blunder

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Before New York's straphangers allow the subway to switch from tokens to magnetic fare cards (news article, July 2), learn from Washington. I have lived in Queens and in the District of Columbia, and I'm not surprised that magnetic cards are popular with municipal governments -- they let subway systems squeeze more money from riders.
For more than a century a New Yorker has been able to go to the farthest reaches of the subway system for one fare, and every increase in the fare has been made only with considerable deliberation. With the magnetic card system, each rider's fare depends on where the trip begins and ends -- it will no longer be so economical to live in or visit the outermost parts of the boroughs.
It will also be painfully easy to raise the fares, needing only a slight modification in the computer program that deducts values from the magnetic cards at the turnstiles. There is also a Big Brother aspect to the magnetic card system: the card you carry shows your (or, more precisely, its) travel history of where trips began and ended.
People who persist in using private cars should defray the expenses for those who use the more environmentally considerate mass transit system. Don't raise the price for bus and subway, but raise parking rates, gasoline taxes, tolls, license plate fees and the other expenses associated with clogging the streets and polluting the air. And offer a lower fare for rush hour as an additional incentive to ride mass transit to and from work.

HEADLINE: Poles Teach U.S. on Employee Ownership

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Poland Outcapitalisms America" (editorial, July 8) puts the American attitude toward capitalism in perfect perspective. We seem to say that capitalism works for everyone else, but not in our backyard.
As Poland casts aside Communism, employee stock ownership plans have emerged as the most effective tool to promote economic freedom. Expanding employee ownership offers an ideological alternative to Marxist-Leninism by advancing a democratic capitalist platform of expanding ownership and democracy.
Marx and Engels stated that you could sum up the entire philosophy of Communism in a single sentence: Abolish private property. The democratic alternative offers an open system that promises working people everywhere what Communism could never provide: political freedom and control over their economic destinies. In many emerging democracies, employee co-ownership of the companies for which they work lends substance to the rhetoric of freedom and opportunity for all.
While most Americans hail the advances toward capitalism in Eastern Europe, they fail to support similar opportunities and measures in the United States. Representatives Beryl Anthony, Cass Ballenger and I have introduced H.R. 2410, a bill promoting employee stock ownership plans. It provides incentives for expanding employee ownership that will give Americans a stake in the company for which they work.
Historians, economists and philosophers alike attribute the economic strength and stability of the United States to our commitment to individual rights, private property and free enterprise. While we have widespread property ownership, the average citizen has not fully participated in ownership of our country's corporations. Our tax structure facilitates corporate enterprise but not the widespread ownership of capital. As a result many American workers feel detached from their workplace and at times disenchanted with free enterprise. Expanding employee stock plans would make participation in the system possible for those who have lacked access to capital and credit.
As the United States searches to promote productivity and improve national competitiveness, we should look to the almost 9,000 privately owned companies that have transferred stock to employees. Most of these -- a few brought back from the brink of bankruptcy -- are successful money makers. If Poland and other Eastern European countries can take bold entrepreneurial steps to expand democratic capitalism, shouldn't the United States be willing to take similar steps to expand ownership to all Americans?

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Opens Discussion of Iraq Sanctions

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 25

 BODY:
The Security Council began informal discussions today on a plan to remove sanctions against Iraq, enabling it to sell oil to buy food and medical supplies, which United Nations officials say are desperately needed by the Iraqi people.
But diplomats cautioned against expecting any quick response to Iraq's needs. They cited the complex problems in creating and monitoring a program to feed millions of people, as well as the efforts of some Council members, notably the United States and Britain, to link the question of sanctions with other components of the cease-fire agreement ending the Persian Gulf War. 
 These include full disclosure of Iraq's nuclear program and of its currency and gold reserves, its contributions to a compensation fund to cover the costs of the war, payments to cover the cost of destroying weapons of mass destruction, payments to Kuwait for property stolen during the war, and its share of the cost of a commission determining the Iraq-Kuwait border.
But the Americans and the British, other diplomats said, are not convinced that Iraq really needs a lifting of the sanctions, believing that it has sufficient foreign currency and gold reserves to cover its food and medical requirements for some time.
"How much money they need will, of course, be determined by how much they have," said Sir David Hannay, the British representative to the United Nations. So far, he said, the Iraqis have provided "an incredibly low figure for currency reserves and no figure at all for gold."
 
A Work in Progress
 Thomas R. Pickering, the American representative, added, "I think it's early to talk about a resolution, but people are looking into all the various components that might go into any action by the Council."
Sir David said, however, that "yes, the Council is working on a resolution," and insisted that "the other aspects of 687" -- the cease-fire resolution -- must be taken into consideration.
Asked about the propriety of linking other aspects of the cease-fire resolution to aid, Sir David replied: "The suffering of the Iraqi people over the sanctions is the fault of Saddam Hussein, and that has been clear from the beginning. There is no question of culpability on the part of the international community, which has been trying to restore international law. The culpability rests quite firmly on the Government of Iraq."
He noted that Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who headed a team investigating shortages of food and medicine in Iraq, reported earlier this week that there is not a crisis in Iraq now, but rather an impending one, "and that we need to take action now in order to avert it."
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who attended the Council's informal meeting, said he would soon set up a commission to work out the details of a program to provide help to Iraq.
This could be highly complex and expensive, other diplomats said. It would involve monitoring the sale of the precise amount of oil permitted, setting up an escrow fund to accept foreign-currency payments, overseeing expenditures for food and medical supplies, and then monitoring the distribution of those supplies to insure that they go to the people who need them most.
Still to be decided is the question of whether any profits from oil sales should be used to satisfy other requirements in the cease-fire resolution. These would include payments for the expenses of the special commission charged with destroying Iraq's nuclear and biological weapons.
 
Deadline Passes Uneventfully
 The Security Council meeting today came on the deadline set by the five permanent members -- the United States, the Soviet Union. Britain, France and China -- for Iraq to disclose all facets of its nuclear program.
For several weeks, there have been threats of new military action against unspecified Iraqi installations if the deadline was not met.
But the deadline came and went, with the inspection teams of the International Atomic Energy Agency still dissatisfied with the information supplied.
Diplomats here today evaded questions on the deadline without acknowledging that it seemed unenforceable through diplomacy alone.
Mr. Pickering, the United States representative, took shelter behind a statement released by the White House that noted that the deadline had passed.

HEADLINE: McDonnell Earnings Rise by 35%

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 25

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation today reported a 35 percent increase in earnings for the second quarter, led by a sharp improvement in its commercial aircraft business.
McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, said it earned $77 million, or $2.01 a share, compared with $57 million, or $1.49 a share, in last year's second quarter. Revenues increased 22 percent for the period, to $5.04 billion. 
 The earnings report came one day after a Congressional subcommittee disclosed that McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest military contractor, had asked the Pentagon in January for a $1 billion loan to help it through a cash squeeze.
McDonnell Douglas withdrew the request several months later, saying its financial prospects had improved. But even making the highly unusual request suggested that McDonnell Douglas had come closer to a financial crisis than it had previously admitted.
 
Some Major Problems Remain
 McDonnell Douglas still faces major problems, including the possibility of huge cost overruns on its contract to build the Air Force's C-17 transport plane. It also faces the termination of several important combat aircraft programs in the next few years, including the F-15 fighter.
But today's earnings report indicated that the immediate crisis may be behind the company. Not only did it benefit from increased deliveries of commercial aircraft, it managed to pare its debt to $2.9 billion, from $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. The debt, which excludes borrowing by the company's financial services subsidiary, now stands at its lowest level in a year and a half.
The company's stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $51.50 a share.
In a letter to employees, John F. McDonnell, the company's chairman, attributed much of the improvement to cost cutting over the last year that included slashing its work force and reducing its dividend.
 
Higher Aerospace Earnings
 McDonnell Douglas said operating earnings increased in all three of its aerospace segments.
The transport aircraft segment earned $34 million, compared with a loss in last year's second quarter of $33 million. It was the third consecutive quarter of profitability for the division, which had been plagued by losses from the high costs of developing a new commercial jetliner, the MD-11, and from cost overruns on the Air Force's C-17 transport plane.
McDonnell Douglas began delivering MD-11's to airlines at the end of last year, and delivered nine in the second quarter. The company said the transport aircraft division, based in Long Beach, Calif., also benefited from lower costs.
The combat aircraft segment earned $125 million, compared with $77 million in the second quarter last year. Revenue for the segment was flat, the company said, but the division benefited from cost savings, which presumably included a lack of development expenses for two big aircraft projects -- a new Air Force fighter plane and an attack plane for the Navy. McDonnell Douglas lost a competition to build the new Air Force fighter, and the Navy canceled its contract to build the attack plane, the A12.
The missiles, space and electronic systems segment earned $59 million in the quarter, compared with $42 million last year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in Broad Advance; Gold Prices Remain Flat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced yesterday in a largely technical session that saw the currency recover some of its losses from the previous day.
Gold prices were basically flat, down slightly in New York, after small declines in Europe. Bullion was quoted at $364.25 an ounce late yesterday at Republic National Bank, down 10 cents from late Wednesday. 
 Analysts said the dollar was correcting itself after Wednesday's drop, which followed a weaker-than-expected report on June durable-goods orders.
 
Worry Overseas Aids Dollar
 Some traders bought dollars to cover exposed positions, while others were prompted by speculation about Germany's economic problems and their effect on the German mark, said Curtis Perkins, a vice president of foreign exchange at Chemical Bank.
He said trading also may have been influenced by concerns about the recent stock brokerage scandal in Japan, as well as by growing questions about the Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A., the big Luxembourg-based bank that was shuttered recently amid fraud allegations.
"You have a lot of stories flying around, and it sort of interferes with what was a technical market," Mr. Perkins said.
Analysts said some dealers also may have bid up dollars ahead of the Government report, due today, on the second-quarter gross national product. Many analysts are expecting growth of between eight-tenths of 1 percent and 1 percent, although the durable-goods report has cast some doubt about the strength of the economy's recovery from recession.
General weakness could step up the pressure for lower interest rates, which would reduce the dollar's attractiveness.
 
Dollar Gains Against Yen
 In New York, the dollar rose to 138.85 Japanese yen from 137.50 yen. Earlier in Tokyo, it rose to a closing 137.60 Japanese yen, from 136.87 yen, and in London, it rose to 138.90 yen.
The dollar gained against the British pound. Sterling in New York fetched $1.6730, down from Wednesday's $1.6920. In London, the pound fell to $1.6750, from $1.6935 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Step Right Up to a County Fair!

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
THE county fair. The one and only. The smoky, seductive pall of frying sausage, wafting across the fairground and mingling with the sweet country perfume of fresh hay. The self-satisfied gaze of blue-ribbon Holsteins in the livestock barn. The urgency of barkers. The distant shriek of humanity on thrill machines being rocked and shaken, bumped and thumped, tossed into the air and whooshed back down. The county fair, where the soda always seems fizzier, the beer beerier and the hot dogs, arguably, hot-doggier.
These are the mature days of July, just about hot enough for the county fair to assume its traditional role as the summer's dominant amusement, still holding its own quite nicely, thank you very much, in this era of cable readiness. 
 From the Fourth of July weekend through Labor Day, you can find a county fair roistering at a fairground near you. This weekend, one of the stars of the bill is the 151-year-old Orange County Fair in Mechanics town, N.Y., on the outskirts of Middletown, about an hour-and-a-half drive from New York City. The 12-day fair, which had more than 300,000 visitors last year, ends Sunday night.
The best county fairs are not cute; they are reveling, sweating, mooing, neighing, high-fat bucolic festivals that flaunt their own rinky-dink charm. Last year, more than 100 million people across the United States attended county fairs, 4.5 million in New York State alone, according to the New York State Association of Agricultural Fairs. That compares with a New York attendance of 3 million in 1980.
For many, in a year of recession and tentative economic recovery, the local county fair, with its weekend admission fee of $7 or so -- half-price or less for children -- may be the cheapest, roaringest family fun this side of Disney World.
The most successful find a way to mix four popular elements: agriculture, vendors with products to sell, food and entertainment. These days, real county fairs work hard to be more than carnivals-on-a-fairground. "All the surveys we've done show that the reason most people go to county fairs is for the agricultural component and for the exhibit areas," said Peggy Lipinski, who will become president of the New York agricultural fair association in 1993. "People say the next most popular reason is for the fair food, and after that it's the entertainment. The carnival element ranks below that in popularity."
Increasingly, the trend at the best fairs is to present agriculture as both curriculum and entertainment, transforming somnolent, fly-specked exhibition barns into educational centers chock full of participatory events like calf feeding and goat milking, and demonstrations like sheep shearing, wool spinning and horseshoeing. "These things outpull anything in the midway," said Mrs. Lipinski.
At the Orange County Fair, as at every respectable fairground, the symphony of sounds, sights and scents is worth the price of admission alone. The aroma of frying onions and peppers blends with the sound of sizzling sausage and the spatter of frying dough. In the distance, a chorus of carnival barkers, bleating sheep, and clanging arcade bells harmonizes with the basso profundo of drag-racing at the fairground speedway. Every once in a while a disembodied voice essays a public-address-system solo, burbling a fairground announcement.
Though the basic elements of fairs are the same -- how different can Jersey cows, Tilt-a-Whirls and Slice-o-Matic demonstrations be? -- each fair has its own character. For example, the ingratiating honky-tonk bustle of the Orange County Fair creates its own distinctive personality. In comparison, there is the lovable agricultural ambiance of the Ulster County fair in New Paltz, N.Y. (Wednesday through the following Sunday), and the sprawling rustic beauty of that glorious megafestival near the Hudson, the Dutchess County Fair in Rhinebeck, N.Y. (Aug. 20 to 25).
Fair food can also be highly variable. If nothing tastes worse than sticky, stale cotton candy in the noonday sun, it is also true that nothing on the planet can compare to the taste of fresh-squeezed county-fair lemonade on a hot day, even if it costs $1.50 a cup.
Fair food could not accurately be described as low-cal. But even Weight Watchers group leaders might be ravished by the smell of simmering kielbasa. One of the best inexpensive feasts at the Orange County Fair is the home-cooked meal prepared in the 4-H barn; for $6.50, fairgoers get honey-barbecued spare ribs, a baked potato, salad, bread pudding and a soda. For post-dessert gorging, you might stroll over to one of the distinctive octagonal kiosks to purchase the classic, sinfully gooey, Bob Maxwell's Walk-Away Sundae ("Dipped in Chocolate -- Rolled in Nuts").
 
Meet the Animals
 To work off the calories, head with aerobic briskness toward the Grange building. There, if you're lucky, a friendly young 4-H-er will adopt you and take you around the neighboring buildings on a tour of the animal sheds -- and then sell you a ticket to the Bossy Bingo Raffle.
Also on display there are prize kohlrabi, corn, squash, beans, cauliflower and beets; winning floral arrangements; prize quilts, dresses and dolls, and blue-ribbon fudge, breads, jams, jellies and coffee cakes. Each of the last group has a little piece cut out of it, of course, where the judges took a taste.
There is no charge for any of these homestead exhibits, and, characteristically, the best fairs offer a lot of other free entertainment. At the Orange County Fair, a star free attraction is the raucous performance of Hale's Racing Pigs. The 15-week-old porkers -- racing under names like Elvis Pigsley, Michael Jordham, Soo-ee Jesse Raphael and Roseanne Boar -- scramble and squeal around a 100-foot-long wood-chip track, heading to their food trough at the finish line.
Animal-rights protesters have been picketing another free act -- Tim Rivers's High Diving Mules -- but so far seem to have generated publicity, and larger crowds, for Mr. Rivers, whose mules have been jumping 18 feet into a 6-foot-deep trough of water at fairs since 1957. Another of the free entertainments at the Orange County Fair is that decidedly noncontroversial perennial, the lumberjack show, in which brawny woodsmen in plaid shirts generate a lot of noise and sawdust while engaging in displays of chain-saw carving, ax-tossing and log-rolling. In other surroundings the urban sophisticate might find such entertainments primitive at best, but at a county fair it is great fun to see acts that are not slick, sophisticated or even scripted.
Some of the attractions at county fairs in 1991 are so basic that they recall the roots of fairground tradition. For example, at the Orange County Fair last week, there was an exhibition of Belted Galloways, brawny beef cattle from Scotland. This entrepreneurial display was a throwback to the first moments of the American county fair when, early in the 19th century, Elkanah Watson, a wealthy farmer, tethered a few imported merino sheep to a tree near his barn in Pittsfield, Mass. The locals came over to oh and ah over the superior merino wool, thus creating, some historians say, the first county fair.
 
Rural Celebration
 The Orange County Fair was founded in 1841, in an era when the county fair became a highlight of the farming year. It was a community celebration, a time when farmers showed off their prize animals to improve the breed; soon, farm families were also showing off their crafts and needlepoint and Sunday pies to improve the evolution of domestic arts. The best-of-breed animals, and the blue-ribbon recipes, went on to competitions at the state fair.
After rampant suburbification, the agricultural component has declined at many fairs. Nevertheless, there is an active attempt to keep it flourishing. "Across the nation, fairs are returning to their agricultural roots," said Mrs. Lipinski, "'because people say that's what makes a county fair a county fair."
Outside the precincts of the agricultural-exhibit buildings, the county fair takes on a shape that shifts with the time of day. There is the daytime fair, with its livestock judging and English and Western horse shows and family ambiance. And then there is the neon-lit night-time fair, an alternate world of loud noise and brilliant light and lurking fun. After sundown, the fair is the place where people go to be scared in the spook house and to be thrust topsy-turvy on glittering machines under the garish lights of the midway. They buy tickets to watch bands like Huey Lewis and the News, or sit in the grandstand to see stock-car racing, their bodies shaking with the elemental thrum of the engines as the cars skid around the dirt track.
At night, families sit with their exhausted children at free entertainments, or savor ice cream cones sitting at picnic tables under the stars. At the Orange County Fair, many know that night is the best time to visit the high-ceilinged, 27,000-foot commercial exhibit building where barkers hawk Golden Touch Jewelry Cleaner, Instant Heat Gel, Naturally Beautiful Nails, Worley's Wonder Cleaner and yes, a free, absolutely free, five-minute mini-lesson at the Wurlitzer organ.
Also on display: more karats of cubic zirconium than at any other location this side of the Home Shopping Channel studios. In fact, to tour this building is to realize that the Home Shopping Channel has aped the American county fair exhibit building in its roster of products, its high-decibel volume and its frenzied presentation.
What else can you do, day or night, at the Orange County Fair? You can swing the hammer like a he-man to hit the bell; you can have your choice of merry-go-rounds, scooter cars and Ferris wheels; you can try your luck at skee-ball, ring-toss and softball-throw, and you can hurl darts at balloons. And yes, you can aim a compressed-air cannon that splatters paint pellets on the dodging form of a carnival worker in a Saddam Hussein costume.
And last but not least, when you're truly exhausted, you can sit on the foot-rejuvenating Footsie-Wootsie machine ("The Ultimate Foot Massage, Still 25 Cents").

Pack Sun Block And a Hat
Here are some tips for getting the most out of a county fair:
Hell is only marginally hotter than a fairground parking lot. If you arrive in full sun and you'll be leaving before dark, deploy a sunscreen to shade your car windows, or your fingers will sizzle when they touch the steering wheel.
If you favor the organized approach to county fairs rather than the lightning-fast slash-and-burn strategy, phone a few weeks in advance (fairground offices are listed in the phone book). Ask about the event schedule; some fairs will mail a brochure to your home. If you're traveling a long distance to the fair, ask about reduced-rate arrangements at local inns and motels.
Unless you're truly mad about the roar of the crowd (the smell of the greasepaint isn't often a problem at the fairground), visit county fairs on a weekday. Then, fair admission fees are cheaper, crowds are thinner, petting-zoo lines are shorter and parking lots are emptier.
Since a respectable fair takes a whole day and night to enjoy, visit the agricultural judging and exhibits, the horse contests, and the free shows during the day; save the midway rides, the T-shirt browsing and the vendor exhibits for the evening. Then, the buildings are cooler, the vendor-area crowds are smaller and the salesmen have lost their pit-bull edge.
Pack up the sun block, sun glasses and sun hat. Leave home your pets, your rigid schedule, your cares, your woes.
 
Where and When
To get to the Orange County Fair in Mechanicstown, N.Y., from New York City, find your way upstate to Route 17 North. Take Exit 122 and follow the signs to the fair. Weekday admission is $5 for adults and $2.50 for children; weekend admission is $7 for adults and $2.50 for children over 6; under 6, free. The fair runs through Sunday, noon to midnight. Information: (914) 343-4826.

HEADLINE: Democrats Move to Seize Jobless Benefits as Issue

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill moved today to extend unemployment insurance payments to people who have been out of work for more than half a year, and Republicans raised questions but not much opposition.
Administration officials have threatened a Presidential veto of any move to extend jobless benefits, saying it is not needed because the recession is ending. 
 But when the Senate Finance Committee voted this morning, 5 of 9 Republicans on the committee joined all 11 Democrats in supporting temporary legislation, costing $5.8 billion. That vote suggested that the bill would carry by a wide margin when it comes before the full Senate on Monday or Tuesday.
 
Political Soft Shoe
 Today's developments seemed to show clearly that the Democrats, after months of political tiptoeing, had seized on a central political issue that might unite them and embarrass Republicans.
Under current law, the basic 26 weeks of benefits can be extended for 13 weeks when unemployment among insured workers in a state reaches 6 percent or when it exceeds average state levels by 20 percent. Only three states are now eligible.
The proposal by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat who heads the committee, would make workers eligible for 20 more weeks of coverage when total unemployment in a state exceeds 8 percent, 13 more weeks when the level exceeds 7 percent and at least an extra 4 weeks in all states.
Also today, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who head the House Ways and Means Committee, bowed to pressure, from Democratic leaders as well as members, and introduced a similar bill. His committee is expected to act early in the week, with the full House voting before Congress goes on vacation next Friday.
That would enable Democrats to leave town having made a case against President Bush's handling of the recession, although for several months they have been reluctant to make any case on unemployment, their fundamental issue since the Great Depression.
Slightly less than nine million Americans are unemployed. Experts in Congress say that without the legislation, as many as three million will have exhausted their unemployment compensation by the end of September.
 
New Direction on Recession
 The recession has had hardly any effect on Capitol Hill all year, as Democrats have shied away from criticizing President Bush or voting for more taxes to pay for more benefits. But in the last week or so, they have given an orchestrated series of speeches arguing that under current law benefits beyond the ordinary 26 weeks are too restricted. Moreover, they have criticized President Bush for supporting aid for foreigners while opposing help for Americans.
For example, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said in today's committee meeting that the Bush Administration this year had called for aid for the Kurds and for Eqypt, Turkey, Israel, the Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola and Bangladesh. "The Administration is quite prepared to find these emergencies all over the world," he said. "But they're not willing to see the emergency here at home and provide the money for our own people."
Today's Senate bill, instead, declares that Americans whose unemployment benefits have been exhausted face an emergency. This is a budget act category that allows for spending more without raising taxes or cutting spending.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, complained at the meeting that declaring the unemployment situation to be an emergency amounted to a repudiation of last year's budget act and was "trying to dismantle it piece by piece."
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, today sent a letter to Congressional leaders saying it was not the time to "abandon pay-as-you-go discipline." He said Mr. Bush's senior advisers would recommend that the President reject such a declaration. The President could take such a step on his own without exercising a regular veto, which could be overridden by two-thirds majorities in both Houses.
 
Giving Bush a Choice
 The Rostenkowski measure would allow the President to choose between declaring an emergency and imposing higher taxes on employers to pay for the broadened benefits. Mr. Rostenkowski said he preferred the "pay-as-you-go" approach that includes higher taxes, but acknowledged that some colleagues thought this was not the time to raise taxes.
"That is why the bill offers the President a choice. When the time comes, the President can consult with his economic advisers and choose the prudent course," Mr. Rostenkowski said in a statement accompanying the introduction of his bill. He had 14 co-sponsors, including Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Long Island Democrat who in March pushed legislation for extended benefits, and one Republican, Representative Raymond J. McGrath, also of Long Island.
On the Senate Finance Committee, five Republicans voted for Senator Bentsen's proposed bill. They were Senators Bob Packwood of Oregon, John C. Danforth of Missouri, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.
Mr. Dole was joined in opposing it by three Republican colleagues, Senators William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, Steve Symms of Idaho and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah.
Mr. Bentsen argued that his bill was simply proposing to tap a trust fund already established to finance extended benefits. He said the triggering mechanism of the current law did not work to allow those benefits where they were needed.
Under existing law, only in Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico are the unemployed eligible for extended benefits, lasting 13 weeks. Under the Bentsen and Rostenkowski proposals, workers in those four states as well as Mississippi, Massachusetts, Michigan and West Virginia would also become eligible for 20 additional weeks of benefits because the unemployment level in those states is at least 8 percent.
California, the nation's most populous state, would be among 10 others and the District of Columbia whose unemployment levels of at least 7 percent would make their long-term unemployed eligible for 13 additional weeks under Mr. Bentsen's bill and 15 under Mr. Rostenkowski's. New York, New Jersey and Texas would be among 19 more states with at least 6 percent unemployment and whose jobless would be eligible for seven extra weeks of benefits under Mr. Bentsen's bill and 10 under Mr. Rostenkowski's.

HEADLINE: On Wall St., Cuomo Lashes Out at White House

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo accused the White House yesterday of complacency in attacking the country's economic problems and then proposed a series of Federal tax changes that he said would hasten a recovery by spurring long-term capital investment.
The Governor's proposals, which he outlined in a breakfast speech to about 80 business executives at the American Stock Exchange, included a corporate tax credit for investments in newly bought equipment and machinery. He also said that a cut in capital gains taxes on long-term investments should be coupled with an increase in Federal income taxes for top earners. 
 He drew a distinction between his proposals and President Bush's plan to cut capital gains taxes for all payers. The Bush proposal, he said, "would provide an enormous windfall for a narrow band of Americans."
The Governor's speech was the first of several critiques of Republican fiscal policy that Mr. Cuomo plans to deliver in the next month or two. While he hopes the speeches will help formulate a Democratic message for the 1992 Presidential race, he maintains that he is not planning to be a candidate.
 
Attacks Bush Domestic Policy

Speaking to an attentive but unresponsive audience in the Stock Exchange's wood-paneled board room, Mr. Cuomo minced few words in arguing that the Bush Administration has ignored domestic policy.
"Washington appears content to believe that it doesn't have to act, that however hard life is now," he said, "the hardships felt by millions of Americans will dissipate as soon as the cyclical economic gods choose once again to smile upon us."
"I don't think you can wait. Not when nearly 10 million Americans are out of work. Not when the nation has had virtually zero economic growth since 1989. Not when living standards for most Americans have been declining for more than a decade."
He depicted the supply-side philosophy of the Reagan and Bush Administrations as a failure that generated wealth but not investment, and that inflated the national debt.
The tax credit proposed by Mr. Cuomo would grant a credit of perhaps 10 percent for investments in newly bought productive machinery and pollution-control equipment. Under the capital gains plan, Mr. Cuomo said tax rates would be increased on gains earned in less than a year -- perhaps from 28 percent to 33 percent -- and decreased on investments held for more than seven years -- perhaps from 28 percent to 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Marchers Seek Special Inquiry in Police Killing

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, July 25

 BODY:
About 300 people marched through downtown Jersey City tonight demanding the appointment of a special investigator in the fatal shooting of a 23-year-old man by a police officer last week.
"One of us was killed, a member of our community, a very nice guy," one marcher, Frank Rivera, 40 years old, said of the victim, Maximino Cintron. "We want this cop to pay for what he did." 
 After the crowd marched about 10 blocks from the scene of the shooting to City Hall, City Councilman Jaime Vazquez made a speech urging Gov. Jim Florio to appoint a special investigator.
Mr. Cintron, an unemployed meat packer, was shot to death by Officer John Chiusolo on July 16 after the policeman and his partner, Christopher Henne, gave Mr. Cintron a summons for applying tinted plastic sheeting to the windows of a car parked a half-block from his home.
 
Questions Being Asked
 Since the shooting, questions have arisen about the officers' decision to stop to give the ticket while they were transporting another man to jail and about whether applying the tint on the street is a violation of a city ordinance banning major vehicle repairs on the street.
Before the march, the New Jersey Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, said through a spokeswoman that he would not intervene to change the course of the investigation.
"The Attorney General has confidence in the prosecutor to conduct a fair and responsible investigation," said the spokeswoman, Ann Crawford. She said that Mr. Del Tufo's top aides had frequently been in touch with Paul M. DePascale, the Hudson County Prosecutor, and had offered him assistance over the course of his inquiry.
Under state regulations, police officers may fire their weapons in self-defense, "when they reasonably believe that deadly force is necessary to protect themselves against death or serious bodily harm."
In interviews, two witnesses contended that the shooting was unjustified.
One witness, Jose Quinones, who said he had been helping apply the plastic tinting, said Mr. Cintron had his arms outstretched at his sides and said, "What are you going to do, shoot me?" just before he was shot.
Jose Torres, the 28-year-old prisoner whom Officers Henne and Chiusolo were taking to night court, said three men tried to remove Officer Henne's forearm from Mr. Cintron's neck.

HEADLINE: GORBACHEV OFFERS PARTY A CHARTER THAT DROPS ICONS

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 25

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today proposed a new charter for the Communist Party that rejects some of its most hallowed principles, even the sanctity of Marxism-Leninism.
Speaking at the opening of a two-day session of the party's Central Committee, Mr. Gorbachev, who is both President of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the party, criticized "fundamentalists" in the party and threw his lot in with reformers seeking to replace the militant utopianism of old with a broad Social Democratic platform. 
 Declaring that the Communist Party would "lose any claim to participate in political life if it stepped away from the course of reform," he also called a full party congress for November, at which both the new program and his leadership would be judged. The unexpected move seemed to pre-empt an expected assault on Mr. Gorbachev from party hard-liners, who have used past party meetings to demand his resignation and criticize his policies.
 
Bush Is Due Next Week
 The proposed program also stood to bolster Mr. Gorbachev's credentials as a reformer before the visit here by President Bush next week. Western leaders declared a readiness last week to help the Soviet Union, but have been looking for concrete evidence of progress before committing substantial funds.
Introducing the draft of a new "party program," Mr. Gorbachev declared that previous programs "set goals not so much in accordance with reality, but with the then-popular understanding of the Communist ideal." The result, he said, was "raw ideology" irrelevant to the concerns of society.
He noted that there had been proposals to drop the name Communist and rename the party as a Socialist or Social Democratic party. But he said any changes in the name should await the November congress.
 
Market Economy Promoted
 The new program, he said, bases the party's goals on the experience of perestroika, on transforming the Soviet Union into a democratic federation of sovereign republics, on introducing a market economy and on integrating the country into the global economy.
Reaching to the very heart of the old ideology, Mr. Gorbachev declared, "In the past the party recognized only Marxism-Leninism as the source of its inspiration, though the tenet was utterly distorted to suit the pragmatic needs of the day, becoming something of a collection of canonical texts."
"Now it has become necessary to include in our arsenal of ideas all the riches of our own and the world's socialist and democratic thought," he said.
It would have been inconceivable even just a few years ago for the head of the Soviet Communist Party to denigrate Marxism-Leninism and to suggest that the party could be run with competing ideologies. One of the frequent forms of denunciation in the past was to accuse someone of falling under the influence of "bourgeois ideology."
Mr. Gorbachev said many participants had probably noticed that the program barely mentioned the creation of a Communist society, once the central goal of Marxist ideology.
In the original thinking of Marx and Engels as modified by Lenin, a society would go through different transitions until it reached the state of Communism, which was the theoretical goal of the party. Its basic features were supposed to be the end of private property, of any social classes and of the state, and it would follow a system of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."
"Our experience, and not only ours, does not give enough grounds for believing that this aim can be realistically achieved in the foreseeable future," Mr. Gorbachev said.
 
On Class Struggle and Religion
 He also made these points in outlining the new draft program:
*On a market economy, once considered incompatible with socialism, he said, "The entire world's experience of the past decades points to the conclusion that it is not possible to achieve the principle of each according to his work without a market economy."
*On class struggle, Mr. Gorbachev declared, "The time has long come to acknowledge that the epoch when the masses had no means of improving their lot except by storming the Bastille or the Winter Palace has gone into the past."
*On religion, he said a member of the party had the right "to freely profess his own views, to be an atheist or a believer." In the past it has been forbidden for any party member to be anything but an atheist.
*On party discipline, he said the party no longer required, as it did in the time of revolutionary struggle, "iron discipline, essentially on a militarized structure."
While jettisoning many of the dogmas of the past, however, the program offered only broad and general affirmations of perestroika and democracy for the future.
"This program cannot be called either Communist or Social Democratic," Boris Gidaspov, head of the Leningrad party organization, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. "It's just liberal, and it would suit anyone from Social Democrats to those who hold Communism as a sort of social idea."
That, some participants said, may have explained why the program did not draw greater fire from hard-core ideologues. Participants at the session reported that the first day's proceedings proved surprisingly tame, with most of the 27 speakers supporting the basic lines of the draft program.
On the eve of the Central Committee meeting, many members had expected a bitter assault on Mr. Gorbachev from party leaders frustrated at the erosion of their power. At the last meeting three months ago, hard-liners had mounted a concerted attack to unseat Mr. Gorbachev.
The text of the party program presented today was made public earlier in the week. But Mr. Gorbachev's detailed support of the document signaled his intention to try to fashion the foundering Communist monolith into a party capable of competing in free national elections envisioned by the new union treaty drafted by Mr. Gorbachev and nine republican leaders, including Boris N. Yeltsin, President of the Russian republic.
 
Treaty Almost Ready
 Two days ago, the Kremlin announced that the treaty was all but completed. Though the draft has not been made public yet, it is known to devolve primary governing authority to the republic governments in a federation of sovereign republics, with the central Government accountable to them. The pact calls for a new national constitution by next spring and new national elections next summer.
In expectation of the new order, various liberal forces have already begun shaping new political movements and parties, each hoping to attract defectors from the Communist Party.
There had been speculation that Mr. Gorbachev himself would leave the party. Instead, he has evidently chosen to try to reshape it into a broad Social Democratic force and to stem the tide of departures.
Underscoring the urgency of the effort, Mr. Gorbachev reported that party membership fell by 4.2 million in the last 18 months, and was now estimated at its 1973 level of 15 million.
Signaling his own renewed identification with liberal forces in the party, he harshly denounced hard-line factions in the party that are called the Bolshevik Platform and the Communist Initiative. By contrast, he noted without adverse comment the rise of the liberal Communists for Democracy movement.

HEADLINE: A Sharp Rise In Failures

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Fifty percent more businesses failed in the first six months of this year than in the first half of 1990, reflecting the impact of the recession, the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation reported yesterday.
The biggest increase was among transportation and utility companies, where failures increased 54 percent, to 1,894. Failures in the service sector grew 51 percent, while the number of failing manufacturers rose 36.5 percent, the business information company said in a survey. 
 "Business failures continued to climb across the U.S. during the first half of the year, particularly along the East and West Coasts," said Joseph W. Duncan, the company's corporate economist. But he said the rate of increase has slowed, with failures in June up only 31 percent, compared with 52 percent in May.
Dun & Bradstreet said it defined failures as companies that went out of business owing money or sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
Over all, 43,014 businesses failed in the first six months, Dun & Bradstreet said, up about 50 percent from 28,669 in the first half of 1990.
The biggest increase was in New England, up 93.8 percent, to 2,675 failures. Bankruptcies in the Middle Atlantic states were up 79 percent, while failures in the Pacific states grew 75 percent.

HEADLINE: Cost Cutting by Goodyear Helps Return to Profitability

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, which has in recent months sharply reduced its work force in an effort to regain profitability, yesterday reported second-quarter net income of $22.5 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $9.4 million in the year-earlier period.
 The earnings improvement was largely the result of cost cutting and came in the face of a 2.8 percent drop in tire sales, the company said. Sales for the quarter slipped 3 percent, to $2.79 billion, from $2.87 billion in the second quarter of last year. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange, Goodyear's stock was up $1.625 yesterday, closing at $38.
 
Improvement in Two Units
 Goodyear said that operating income in its tires and related business segment increased to $157.7 million, from $108.9 million in the year-earlier quarter, which had included $21.4 million in unusual charges. Operating income in the general products segment rose to $56.3 million, from $40.9 million in last year's comparable period, which included $15 million in charges.
Like other international tire producers, Goodyear has been bruised by a number of difficulties, including intense price competition, a sluggish automobile market and narrow margins.
Goodyear has also suffered from operating an unprofitable 1,750-mile crude oil pipeline between California and Texas, which it bought in 1985 as a way to diversify. The company reported an operating loss of $13 million in the quarter from its oil transportation segment, which includes the pipeline, compared with $12.8 million in the year-earlier quarter.
 
Cost Cuts Said To Be Working
 Harry W. Millis, an independent tire analyst in Cleveland, said the earnings indicated that "the cost cutting Goodyear has put in place in recent months is having an effect."
He added that he was surprised by the strength of the domestic market for replacement tires and that sales in Europe had been stronger than expected.
"After a drop in the first quarter, sales in Europe came back and improved in the second quarter," Mr. Millis said. "It looks like the European recession is going to be more shallow than ours was in the United States."
Stanley C. Gault, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive, said, "Our tire and general products businesses continued to reflect the severely depressed auto industry and the weak economy in the United States."
Mr. Gault added, however, that "we are extremely pleased that earnings in the latest three-month period were back on the positive side and that we were able to reduce selling, administrative and general expenses 5 percent, compared to the year-earlier period."

HEADLINE: June Home Resales Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes jumped 1.4 percent in June to the highest level in two and a half years, a real estate trade group said today. It was the fifth straight monthly advance.
All regions of the nation posted gains except the Midwest, which experienced a sales surge in May that analysts said could not be sustained. 
 The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned single-family homes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.59 million, up from a revised 3.54 million a month earlier. The May rate was first estimated to have been 3.51 million.
The association said the June rate was the highest since January 1989, when the rate reached 3.66 million. It also was 6.5 percent higher than that of June 1990.
"This is a good, solid sign of recovery," said Harley E. Rouda, the association president.
Most analysts believe the housing recession ended in January. Sales of both existing and new homes have risen since then.
Mr. Rouda also noted that sales increased despite a slight gain in interest rates.
"When rates go up, people often will go ahead with their purchases, rather than risk further increases," he said.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said 30-year conventional, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.61 percent in June, up from 9.47 percent a month earlier.
The association said the median price of an existing home was $101,900, up 3 percent from the June 1990 price and eight-tenths of 1 percent above the median price in May. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less.
The South posted the biggest sales gain, up 6.4 percent, to 1.49 million units. The median price was $90,800, up 1.6 percent from June 1990 and 1 percent from May.
Sales in the Northeast jumped 3.6 percent, to 570,000 units. The median price was $142,800, down 3.7 percent from the previous June and 1.4 percent from May.

HEADLINE: Gasoline at Low Price, But Benefits May Fade

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A year after Saddam Hussein sent tanks into Kuwait and fear and anger into the hearts of American motorists, the price storm is over and the cost of gasoline is at historic lows, when inflation is taken into account.
A new study by Cambridge Energy Research Associates concluded that the pretax price at the pump is now the lowest since 1947, after adjusting for inflation. Even with a one-third increase in recent years in Federal and state taxes, which now average 36 cents a gallon, gasoline today is only about 8 cents a gallon higher than it was in 1988. 
 "The good old days, when it comes to gasoline prices, are now," said Daniel Yergin, the oil historian and author of the report.
 
56% Below Peak
 Adjusting the price at the pump to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, the average price in the first five months of this year, $1.15, was 6 percent lower than it was in 1972, the year before the Arab oil embargo. The current price is 56 percent of the peak price in 1980, in the panic that followed the Iranian revolution. Stated in today's dollars, the average price in 1980 was $2.04 a gallon, Mr. Yergin said.
During the Kuwait crisis, gasoline prices rose to a peak about 30 percent above the prewar price. Now, despite an increase in Federal and state taxes, prices are within 10 percent of the year-ago level.
The low price may surprise the public but not specialists, said David L. Morehead, vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Association, a trade association in Washington.
"The oil industry, let's face it, is an industry that people love to hate," he said. "I'm sorry to say that people are not going out and hugging gasoline dealers. Everybody notices when prices go up, everyone talks about it and Congress calls hearings. But when they go down, not much is said about it."
 
'A Dream World'
 David L. Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan Business School, called the current price "a dream world," adding, "You just can't expect gasoline to stay this cheap indefinitely."
Professor Lewis suggested that while a low price is good news for consumers in the short run, it may set the country and the auto industry on a perilous course. Low prices in the 1970's led American auto makers to specialize in big cars, and when the gasoline crunch of 1979-80 came along, consumers wanted small, fuel-efficient models and only the Japanese manufacturers had them.
"That's the lesson which does not seem to have been learned," he said.
The low price misleads consumers, too, said Glenn P. Sugameli, a specialist in energy issues at the National Wildlife Federation. "If there was a consistent trend toward higher gasoline prices, the consumer and auto companies would have a clear signal that more efficient cars is where they should be going," he said. Because price will not provide that signal, a strong auto-mileage bill is more necessary than ever, he said.
Congress is now sifting through several proposals on what Detroit should be building as part of a debate over national energy policy. One would force the auto makers to improve the fuel economy of new cars to 40 miles a gallon by the turn of the century.
But at today's low gasoline prices, investments to make cars more efficient pay for themselves slowly if at all, and that means the economics alone do not now encourage spending large sums to save gasoline.
Another proposal, sponsored by the Bush Administration, would direct fleet vehicles to use fuels other than gasoline, in part to clean the air. But the cost penalty of this switch would rise as the price of gasoline fell.
Mr. Yergin, in a telephone interview, said, "With prices down, it takes a lot of the fuel out of all the energy debates."

HEADLINE: U.N. Has $500,000 Frozen in B.C.C.I. Banks in Africa

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., July 25

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretariat said today that about $500,000 of United Nations money was frozen in accounts in branches of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International in two African countries.
Francois Giuliani, the chief spokesman for Secretary General Xavier Perez de Cuellar, also said that Mr. Perez had twice taken trips on private planes owned by Gaith R. Pharaon, a Saudi billionaire and a major shareholder in B.C.C.I. who had numerous business dealings in the United States. 
 Mr. Pharaon is a longtime associate of Aga Hassan Abedi, who founded the bank 19 years ago and had numerous contacts at the United Nations with third world governments.
Among his contacts was Andrew Young, who represented the United States at the United Nations in the late 1970's. Mr. Young later had a retainer arrangement and a credit line with Mr. Abedi's bank.
Mr. Giuliani was responding to an inquiry from The New York Times.
The Economic Commission for Africa, part of the Economic and Social Council, and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees maintained accounts in B.C.C.I. branches in Cameroon, Mr. Giuliani said. The refugee commission's account contained $12,000, he said; the amount in the economic commission's account was not immediately available.
In Sierra Leona, Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, maintained an account with "less than $400,000," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani noted that the sums in the B.C.C.I. branches were small in terms of what the United Nations programs actually spend in those countries. He noted, too, that there is a serious dearth of operating banks in some African nations and that the United Nations must use those that are available. He said that the accounts had been frozen with the worldwide closing of the bank earlier this month and that the United Nations was making other arrangements to continue financing its operations in Cameroon and Sierra Leone.
Mr. Giuliani said the Secretary General first used a plane provided by Mr. Pharaon on a trip to Haiti in 1986 when he was accompanied by a group of journalists and needed a larger aircraft than what had originally been provided.
 
'A Helpful Gesture'
 The second trip was to Peru in 1987. Mr. Perez de Cuellar is from Peru, where a Government investigation is looking into whether former President Alan Garcia looted as much as $50 million of the country's funds while he was President from mid-1985 to mid-1990.
"The plane was accepted as a helpful gesture both for security reasons and because the United Nations was at the height of the U.S. financial crisis," Mr. Giuliani said. The financial crisis to which he referred was brought on, in large measure, by the United States' refusal to pay its share of the world body's budget.
"At that time, we were always fishing around for cost-cutting schemes," Mr. Giuliani said. "Somebody wanted to be supportive at that time of crisis." The United States resumed its contributions after the United Nations agreed to cut its staff and make other administrative changes.
 
U.N. Chief Has No Aircraft
 The United Nations does not have its own aircraft for the Secretary General. Generally, United Nations officials use commercial aircraft or planes supplied by governments. On rare occasions, chartered flights are used, the spokesman said.
In 1979, after he had left the United Nations, Mr. Young provided B.C.C.I. with contacts in more than a dozen third world countries. Mr. Young also had a modest trade business that had a credit line from the National Bank of Georgia, which Mr. Pharaon purchased from Bert Lance, the former budget director in the Carter Administration. The following year, the credit line was transferred to B.C.C.I.
Recently, the Federal Reserve Board charged that Mr. Pharaon was acting as a front for B.C.C.I.

HEADLINE: T.W.A. Forges a Deal To Elude a Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
T.W.A. survived another close brush with bankruptcy yesterday after its chairman, Carl C. Icahn, forged an eleventh-hour deal with bondholders that granted them new concessions.
The airline's secured creditors had threatened to go to court yesterday to seek immediate payment of overdue payments on bonds that are backed by spare parts and landing slots. If the creditors had done so, or if they had sought an injunction in court to seize the collateral behind the bonds, the airline would most likely have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection. 
 A hearing had been scheduled yesterday by the bondholders before Judge Gerard Goettel in Federal District Court in White Plains, where T.W.A. is based, but it was postponed until Tuesday after Mr. Icahn offered the new terms. The court must now review and approve the agreement.
 
Flirting With Bankruptcy
 Trans World Airlines has been flirting with bankruptcy for many months and Mr. Icahn's brinkmanship has repeatedly managed to snatch the carrier from that fate. The troubled airline, which recently made a surprise bid to acquire the remnants of the bankrupt Pan American World Airways in partnership with American Airlines, stopped making payments on its bonds in February.
The holders of about $236.4 million in secured bonds that pay 15 percent in interest are owed roughly $12 million in accrued interest.
As part of yesterday's rough outline of the new agreement between the two sides, Mr. Icahn agreed to give bondholders about 25 cents on the dollar in cash and improved collateral to back the bonds, and in exchange the interest rate on the bonds would be reduced from 15 percent to 7 to 8 percent.
On Monday, T.W.A. had canceled a tender offer it had previously made for most of its outstanding debt. That canceled offer, which would have paid out 65 cents on the dollar to the holders of the 15 percent secured bonds, came to be widely viewed by the bondholders as well as T.W.A. as untenable because it would have drained the company of so much cash that the airline would not have been able to continue operating.
"What I've been trying to do in these negotiations is to keep the cash in the company," Mr. Icahn said. "It's very hard for an airline to raise cash today."
But the adventure in revamping the airline's debt is far from over. It is expected to last all weekend as the holders of the senior unsecured notes and the subordinated unsecured notes wrangle over how much equity in the company they will each get. Mr. Icahn himself owns about a third of the subordinated notes, which pay 12 percent in interest.
The holders of about $334 million of senior unsecured bonds that pay 16 percent and 17 1/4 percent are expected to receive some debt as well as some equity, people close to the deal said. They will probably also seek to get some collateral as part of the final deal.
Holders of the subordinated 12 percent notes are expected to receive equity in the restructuring.
Much of T.W.A.'s troubles can be traced to the complex series of financial transactions surrounding Mr. Icahn's acquisition of the airline. The financier borrowed heavily to take the airline private in 1988, three years after he first took control of it, and in that transaction he ended up with about $469 million for himself, which was more than $440 million above what he had previously paid for his interest in the company. In addition to that, Mr. Icahn got control of 90 percent of the airline's stock.
The airline's operating results have been deteriorating for more than a year, in large part because of the recession and the Persian Gulf war. With the heavy debt load that Mr. Icahn put on the company in 1988, it was ill-prepared to weather a downturn in the industry and the war-related increases in fuel costs. A substantial portion of the debt that was issued in 1988 began requiring cash interest payments earlier this year.

Profits Down 30.6% at Disney

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 25

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that its net income for its third fiscal quarter fell 30.6 percent as the recession cut attendance at its theme parks.
Disney said it earned $165.5 million, or $1.24 a share, in the quarter ended June 30, down from $238.4 million, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped 1.8 percent, to $1.51 billion, from $1.54 billion. 
 Disney's earnings were depressed in part by the weak performance of two films, "The Marrying Man" and "One Good Cop." But most of the company's problems were in the theme park business, which Disney said was hurt by the recession and a general decline in air travel.
Operating profits for the theme park and resorts segment fell 39 percent, to $176.4 million. Disney said the decline was a result of lower attendance at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California. Revenues for the segment declined 12 percent, to $759 million.
In the film entertainment division, operating profits increased 8 percent, to $79.1 million. Earnings were bolstered by the release of the home video version of "The Jungle Book," the company said. Disney also released "The Rocketeer" and "What About Bob" during the quarter, helping to push the segment's revenues up 7 percent, to $597.1 million.
Disney's shares fell $1.50 yesterday, to $117.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Lost Work at G.E. Will Mean Layoffs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, N.Y. July 25

 BODY:
The loss of a $50.5 million Navy contract means more layoffs and additional cost-cutting measures for General Electric's Syracuse operations, a company spokeswoman said. G.E. lost the contract last week to the International Business Machines Corporation, the spokeswoman, Connie Grasso, said. 
 The contract was to develop a processor to take signals from underwater listening devices and send the information to Navy ships and submarines. Earlier this year, G.E. announced it would close one of its three Syracuse area plants by 1992, a move that will eliminate 1,300 jobs. The company employs about 5,500 people in Syracuse.

Du Pont Plans to Trim Expenses by $1 Billion

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., July 25

 BODY:
The E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said today that it would cut costs by $1 billion over two years by reducing staff and trimming its chemicals and specialties businesses in the United States. The announcement comes a day after Du Pont reported a 21 percent drop in second-quarter earnings.
Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the company's chairman, said costs were hurting the chemical giant's ability to compete worldwide. The reductions will not affect Conoco, Du Pont's energy subsidiary, based in Houston. Net income for the quarter was $549 million, compared with $694 million for the corresponding quarter in 1990. The decline was attributed largely to the recession. 
 Mr. Woolard declined to be specific about how many jobs would be cut. "We don't have a specific goal," he said. "Our goal is to reduce $1 billion, and we have a number of ways to do that. We need to get going as soon as possible."
Mr. Woolard said the $1 billion reduction represented about 10 percent of the fixed costs in chemicals and specialties, like the fibers sector. Among the costs to get special attention are travel, entertainment, redundant computer systems, consulting and contractor expenses, he said.
Du Pont employs about 140,000 people worldwide, and about 26,000 in Delaware. The company is based in Wilmington, Del.
Mr. Woolard said the company could achieve its goal "by changing the way we work and by eliminating some of the things we do."
He said the company would reduce the work force mostly through enhanced pension payments or lump sum payments to employees. In cases where employees are laid off, Mr. Woolard said Du Pont would help workers find other jobs.
Mr. Woolard met for about two hours this morning with top managers in Wilmington, and the announcement was sent by satellite to other Du Pont locations.
Afterward, Howard Simmons, a vice president and senior science adviser for central research and development, said there would be some reduction in research, "but nothing grave."
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Du Pont shares rose $1.325, to $48.125.

HEADLINE: Agencies Reap Savings in Building Decline

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
When engineers planned the repair of Manhattan's West Side Highway from 59th to 72d Street, they estimated the cost at $85 million. But at the bid-opening in January, the winning contractor agreed to do the job for only $62 million -- a savings of 27 percent.
In a silver lining to the recession, surprises like that are being repeated across the New York region in a wide array of projects on roads, sewers, recycling plants, water lines, subways, schoolhouses, airports and bridges. 
 A decline in private construction, which has been much more severe in the New York metropolitan area than nationally, has thrust local contractors into intense competition for work, resulting in lower bids.
Many homeowners have also discovered savings on home-improvement projects. As in larger construction, shrinking business in the renovation market has sharpened competition and lowered prices, according to members of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry, a contractors' group. A Queens carpenter and remodeler, Gary Gray, said: "Things are very slow. Everybody is trying to cut your price down. Sometimes you can do it and sometimes you can't."
 
Savings of $300 Million
 The savings reaped by local, state and Federal agencies are mounting into hundreds of millions of dollars a year, as bids have dropped between 10 and 30 percent, according to officials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut who were interviewed. An informal survey of seven major government agencies in the region showed a savings of at least $300 million this year compared with the estimated costs of projects.
"We're getting more bang for our buck," said Charles E. Williams, president of New York City's School Construction Authority. John Beckman, a spokesman for the city's General Services Department, said: "It's clear the acute distress in construction has produced a benefit to the city."
But that benefit may be limited by cumbersome procedures that surround the letting of public works contracts: authorizing, planning, designing and financing projects and soliciting and awarding bids.
"While it behooves you very much to try to take advantage, it's difficult," said State General Services Commissioner John F. Hudacs. "Not only do projects need funding, they take time, especially in the design phase."
"We're making every effort to get contracts out the door at these advantageous prices," said Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "Actually, we anticipated it a bit. When we talked about the toll increase, we said it's a good time for the public sector to prime the pump, generating jobs and activity." Construction industry officials are also lobbying for speeding up projects. Not only will the public get more value for its money, they argue, but the expanded work will also help revive the battered economy.
"Quite frankly, we have encouraged the public sector to spend more," said Francis X. McArdle, director of the General Contractors Association, which represents 114 heavy-construction companies. "The public gains good prices, and the work stimulates business." The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's capital management director, William Goldstein, said: "In a down economy we like to look at ourselves as a counter-cyclical force. We're trying to move as many projects forward as we can."
 
Tens of Thousands Unemployed
 The slump in construction is especially dramatic in the New York region, because it was hit earlier and harder than others by the recession, experts say. In what should be peak construction season, tens of thousands of workers are unemployed. "They're lining up at hiring halls, waiting for jobs to come in," said Louis Coletti. He is president of the New York Building Congress, representing 500 contractors, unions and allied groups.
Nationally, the construction business was down 11 percent in 1990 from 1989, but in the New York area it declined a much steeper 28 percent, said Matthew P. Drennan, an economist at Cornell University, citing figures from surveys by F. W. Dodge, a consulting firm owned by McGraw-Hill.
When a contract is below budget the difference may be saved, reallocated for other projects or used to upgrade the project. For Riverbank Park in West Harlem, a $3.5 million savings in the bid allowed the addition of night lighting and a better ice rink.
 
No Immediate Budget Relief
 Another hurdle to speeding up contracts during the slump is the fiscal crisis in state and local government. Hit by drastic drops in revenues, some agencies are suffering cuts in the staffs that manage projects, and some are trimming capital spending.
"We wish we could take fuller advantage," said General Services Commissioner Kenneth J. Knuckles, "but the Mayor made the decision that we need to reduce our debt service."
Because public works construction is generally financed by long-term bonds, the savings offer no immediate relief to the operating deficits that many governments face. But they do offer the prospect of lower debt repayments in future budgets.
New York City, whose construction spending program ranks third nationally after the Federal Government's and California's, budgeted $4.9 billion for projects last year and $5.7 billion this year. The state budgeted $3.1 billion last year and $3.8 billion this year.
 
Savings in Road Contracts
 Examples of savings are abundant. The city's last five road contracts saved a total of $25 million. The biggest spread was on the rebuilding of Hudson Street, estimated at $34 million and bid at $24 million.
Work on the Whitestone Expressway, estimated by the state at $59 million, is being done for $44 million. Estimates on 320 state general services contracts totaled $243 million but the winning bids were $213 million.
Contracts were awarded this spring for a $276 million, 27-story Federal courthouse and a $240 million, 34-story office building in Foley Square. William Jenkins, an assistant regional administrator for the Federal General Services Administration, said the bids were well within predicted costs.
"The public works market is the only game in town," Mr. McArdle said. "There's a substantial increase in competition and a substantial decrease in prices. People are bidding very aggressively to keep work on the books and keep their work forces intact."

HEADLINE: Phone Companies Are Permitted To Provide Information Services

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
A Federal judge lifted a legal bar today that had prevented the seven regional Bell telephone companies from offering services like home banking and electronic shopping, known collectively as information services.
The decision was a victory for the so-called Baby Bells, which hope to raise profits by selling Americans many new high-technology services. But opponents, including the newspaper industry, some long-distance companies and consumer groups, vowed to fight the decision, contending the phone companies could abuse their positions as local monopolies. 
 "An alarmist would say that the implications are Orwellian," said David E. Easterly, president of Cox Newspapers, who added that he expected the newspaper industry to appeal the decision and then, if necessary, to carry the fight to Congress.
 
Call for Neutrality
 "If we are going to enter a world in which a great deal of information passes through telephone lines, then those providing the phone lines should be neutral; they shouldn't be one of the information providers," Mr. Easterly said.
The Consumer Federation of America has argued that removing the restriction on information services could prompt the local telephone companies to spend too much money on fiber-optic cables and other sophisticated equipment that is currently used most heavily by businesses. Households could then end up footing the bill because local telephone rates still depend in many states on how much money the local phone companies invest in their networks.
 
Year-Long Process
 Judge Harold H. Greene, who oversaw the 1984 breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and issued today's decision, blocked his ruling from taking effect until all appeals have been exhausted.
That process could take more than a year. But Judge Green's ruling seemed to stand a good chance of being upheld because the initial appeal would be to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has already considered the issue. The appellate court prompted today's ruling by directing Judge Greene last year to reconsider his position on ownership of information services.
Judge Greene indicated in his decision that while the appeals court's decision last year left him little choice about lifting the restriction, he remained doubtful about the wisdom of the move.
"It would hardly make sense or be in the public interest to cancel an important part of an antitrust decree forged after several decades of on-and-off litigation, and turn a key ingredient of the emerging information society over to corporations who not so long ago were involved in major violations of the antitrust laws, and who even now seem ready to engage in anticompetitive practices whenever the opportunity therefore presents itself," he wrote.
 
Need for Incentives
 The phone companies have contended that their enormous financial and technical resources make them the best qualified to offer information services like news, stock quotes and other data to home users. They contend that only by owning these services will they have adequate incentives to invest in advanced technologies and insure that the United States does not lag behind other countries in developing such services.
Mr. Easterly of Cox on the other hand, said that the most immediate self-interest impact on the newspaper industry was likely to be creation of electronic Yellow Pages that could hurt classified advertising. But he said that he expected the Baby Bells to try to expand into creating news, video programs and a wide array of electronic services that would compete with the companies who now use the phone lines to deliver such services.
His argument touches on part of the original terms of the antitrust consent decree between the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Justice Department. The Bell companies were barred from three industries to prevent them from using their monopoly control over local telephone service to subsidize new services unfairly or to bar other companies from the market. The three industries are long-distance telephone service, telephone equipment manufacturing and the creation -- but not transmission -- of information services.
 
Decision Is Praised
 Ronald F. Stowe, vice president of Washington operations for the Pacific Telesis Group, one of the seven Bell companies, praised today's decision in a statement as "a major step forward for American consumers, American business and the American economy."
But he expressed disappointment that the judge postponed the effect of his decision by issuing an immediate stay, and said that his company might ask the judge to cancel that part of his ruling.
The Bell companies own five-sixths of the nation's local telephone networks. For example, the Nynex Corporation, one of the seven Bell companies, is the parent of both the New York Telephone Company, which serves New York, and the New England Telephone Companies. The other regional Bells are Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and U S West Inc.
Today's ruling did not change the restrictions that bar the Bell companies from entering the long-distance telephone industry or manufacturing telephone equipment. But the appeals court ruling that prompted today's decision also recommended that Judge Greene apply more flexible legal standards in considering these restrictions.
The original consent decree provided that Judge Greene review the restrictions every three years. The appeals court ruled on April 3, 1990, that Judge Greene had applied the wrong section of the consent decree when, in his first review of the restrictions in 1987, he denied the companies' request that they be allowed to enter the information services industry.
The panel said that Judge Greene should have used a section calling for the aproval of attempts by the phone companies to move into new industries if the effort were "within the reaches of the public interest."
Judge Greene had relied on a section of the consent decree that allowed such moves only if they were in society's best interest.
Herb Linnen, a spokesman for A.T.& T., said the telecommunications giant had never objected to the Bell companies' entry into the information services market, provided that they remained excluded from the equipment manufacturing and long-distance industries. Smaller long-distance carriers, led by the MCI Communications Corporation, opposed allowing the local phone companies into the information-services business.
 
Some in Favor
 Some state regulators have favored lifting the information- services restriction, hoping that they would be profitable enough that local phone companies would not ask for politically controversial rate increases. But consumer groups reply that state regulators, who typically have small staffs, cannot adequately oversee local phone companies that employ thousands of people and often hire former state regulators.
Legal questions aside, many people also wonder whether the Bell companies, which are largely managed by engineers, will be adept in providing services. Jeffrey S. Silverstein, the publisher of the Information Industry Bulletin, a weekly industry newsletter, said that the Bell companies still thought like utilities rather than entrepreneurs, and were mainly interested in increasing the use of local networks, rather than thinking up new services
"Our basic feeling is that the competitive landscape is not going to change dramatically because of this decision," he said.
Newspaper publishers have been "crying wolf" when they warn that the advent of electronic Yellow Pages could someday decimate classified advertising, Mr. Silverstein added.

HEADLINE: UAL and Delta Air Lines Report Sharply Lower Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation and Delta Air Lines Inc. both reported sharply lower earnings yesterday, as the effects of the recession and the Persian Gulf war continued to hurt travel.
But the profits, however slim, were seen by some analysts as a possible sign of a recovery for the beleaguered airline industry. Last week, the AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, also posted a small profit. 
 UAL, the Chicago-based parent of United Airlines, said its second-quarter profits fell 64.5 percent from a year earlier.
Delta said its net income was down 74.1 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter. The Atlanta-based airline also said it had lost $324.4 million in its fiscal year, which ended June 30.
 
Losses in Previous Quarter
 Both airlines blamed the industry's fare wars for cutting into profits during the last quarter.
The performances of UAL and Delta in the last three months were substantially better than in the first three months of 1991, when the two airlines posted losses as a result of higher jet fuel costs and the gulf war.
These improvements were partly discounted because the first quarter is usually weak for travel, whereas the most recent quarter normally reflects heavy summer travel.
Paul Turk, a travel consultant with Avmark Inc., said UAL's and Delta's lower profits indicated that many companies that clamped down on business travel last fall had not yet loosened their restrictions that much.
Following are details of the two airline companies' results:
 
UAL
 UAL, which operates the second-largest airline after American, reported second-quarter net income of $52.7 million, or $2.23 a share, down from $148.3 million, or $6.81 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.7 percent, to $2.95 billion, from $2.74 billion.
Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of UAL, said that paying customers had flown 13.1 percent more miles in the second quarter of 1991 than a year earlier, but that domestic revenue had been held down by the fare wars and a decline in high-profit business travel.
Mr. Wolf said in a statement that United was forced to match fare cuts by "financially distressed competitors whose primary focus appears to be on cash flow in the short term."
UAL's results were also depressed because trans-Pacific travel did not fully recover from the declines caused by the gulf war until late in the quarter, he said.
"Looking ahead, we see gradual improvement, although the level of improvement will depend on the speed and the strength of the economic recovery in the United States, as well as a return to financially justifiable pricing," he said.
UAL's shares rose $3.75 yesterday, to $141.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Delta
 Delta, the nation's No. 3 airline, reported fourth-quarter net income of $19.2 million, or 30 cents a share, down from $74.1 million or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quater rose 12.7 percent, to $2.52 billion, from $2.24 billion.
Delta's net loss of $324.4 million in fiscal 1991 compared with a profit of $302.8 million, or $5.79 a share, in fiscal 1990. Revenue for the fiscal year rose 6.9 percent, to $9.17 billion, from $8.58 billion.
"Fiscal 1991's net loss reflects the turmoil the entire industry experienced during the year," Thomas J. Roeck Jr., the airline's chief financial officer, said in a statement.
Delta said growth in traffic during the most recent quarter was spurred partly by costly discount fare promotions, which caused Delta's profit yield per passenger mile flown to decline 1 percent.
The airline said its operating expenses had risen 16 percent because of its new international routes to Europe and Asia. In addition, cash expenses rose 30 percent because of higher costs for repairs and maintenance, rental and landing fees, and higher travel agency commissions.
Delta's shares rose $1.125 yesterday, to $75, on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Carol Laise, 73, Ex-Ambassador and High State Dept. Aide, Dies

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Carol Laise, an American Ambassador who was the wife of an American Ambassador and the first woman to be an Assistant Secretary of State, died yesterday at her home in Dummerston, Vt. She was 73 years old.
 Miss Laise died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said. 
She was named Ambassador to Nepal by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 and remained in the post until 1973. In January 1974 she married Ambassador at Large Ellsworth Bunker, a 79-year-old widower, in Katmandu, Nepal. She kept her maiden name professionally.
 It was the first marriage between two American Ambassadors. Miss Laise was a close friend of Mr. Bunker's first wife, Harriet Allen Bunker, who died in 1964, and it was Miss Laise's first marriage.
 For nearly six years after their marriage the couple saw each other only once a month when Ambassador Laise would take a plane provided by President Johnson and fly to Saigon, where Ambassador Bunker was trying to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam.
 
Named Director General
 In October 1973 she returned to Washington and was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Bureau of Public Affairs, the first woman to hold so high a post in the department. Before her appointment as Ambassador to Nepal she had been director of the Office of South Asian Affairs,
 In 1974 Miss Laise became director general of the Foreign Service, the highest nonpolitical job in the Foreign Service, a post she held until she retired in 1977.
 Caroline Clendening Laise began her Government career in 1940 as an occupational coder for the Civil Service Commission. In 1946 she went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1948 joined the State Department.
 From 1956 to 1961 she was an adviser to American delegates to various United Nations agencies and in 1962 was made deputy director of the Office of South Asian Affairs with responsibilty for diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India and Pakistan.
 In comparing the economic problems of Nepal with those of India, she said in a 1966 interview with Ann Terry Pincus of The New York Post, "You could explain that Nepal is like Appalachia, and India has the problems of Harlem."
 
An Adviser in New Delhi
 When Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey went to India and Pakistan in 1965, Miss Laise went along as his adviser. In the 1962-63 Chinese invasion of India, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith sent for Miss Laise for advice and she spent about a year in New Delhi.
 She was a winner in 1965 of the annual Federal Women's Award for outstanding contributions by women in government service, and in 1973 she received the Career Service Award of the National Civil Service League.
 Miss Laise, a native of Winchester, Va., was a graduate of American University and received an M.A. in political science from George Washington University.
 Her husband, Ambassador Bunker, died in 1984.
 She is survived by a brother, Frederick Laise of Santa Fe, N.M.; two stepsons, Samuel Bunker of Dummerston, Vt., and John Bunker of Wheatland, Wy.; and a stepdaughter, Ellen Bunker of Tucson, Ariz.

HEADLINE: A Reversible Air-Conditioner, Heat Pump Warms and Cools

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Heating and cooling a house used to be separate jobs, but the heat pump, a device that does both, often at much lower cost, is gaining popularity. Nearly one in three new American houses uses a heat pump, according to a recent Government estimate; in some parts of the country heat pumps are nearly universal in new houses.
A heat pump is "nothing more than a glorified air-conditioner," said Robert M. Little Sr. of the residential marketing department at the Tampa Electric Company in Florida. 
 It is glorified because it is reversible. In summer it acts very much like a central air-conditioner, with its condenser sucking in heat and ejecting it outdoors. In winter, it collects heat from outside and pushes it inside. People may wonder how a machine can draw heat from a cold place and put it in a warm one, but that is exactly what a regular air-conditioner does when it lowers the indoor temperature to 75 degrees and sends the heat into a 90-degree outdoors.
An old-fashioned electric heater turns electricity into heat when its coils resist an electric current. When it is 50 degrees outside, a heat pump would use only a third as much power to warm the house to 68 degrees as would a resistance heater. For example, Mr. Little said, a typical house in the Tampa area would use 6,000 kilowatt-hours for a year of resistance heat, but only 1,440 kilowatt-hours if it had a heat pump instead. Farther north, the difference grows smaller; north of Washington, it drops to near zero.
 
Teaming Heat Pump and Furnace

In the Washington area, some people use heat pumps on most winter days and conventional gas- or oil-fired systems for the coldest days, although the capital costs of this combination are higher. Jack Stevenson, manager of residential energy services at the Potomac Electric Power Company, described another case in which a house might have both. Some houses are too big for a single forced-air system because of the length of the ducts, he said. The solution favored by builders is to put a second system in the attic; a heat pump is preferred for safety reasons.
In most parts of the country, the heat pump's main competitor for heating is a very high-efficiency gas burner.
Heat pumps, which were introduced 30 years ago, have generated some complaints, especially the early models. They can be noisy, can create drafts and can fail to remove humidity. Recent changes have reduced those problems and lowered operating costs.
Still, heat pumps are limited by climate. Their biggest drawback is that as outdoor temperatures go down, it takes more and more electricity to gather enough heat to help indoors. Below 30 degrees Fahrenheit, a heat pump usually needs help from a resistance heater, and below 15 degrees the heat pump will be nearly useless. In addition, when the outdoor temperature is below freezing, moisture in the air will form ice on the heat pump coils, somewhat as ice forms on the cooling surfaces inside an old-fashioned refrigerator-freezer, reducing efficiency. Heat pumps solve the problem by heating the coils, which also reduces efficiency.
Millions of houses use resistance heaters, but they are generally far more expensive to operate than the alternatives: natural gas, heating oil or propane. The amount of electricity a heat pump uses is crucial because installing one can cost 10 to 25 percent more than installing an electric air-conditioner and a conventional gas furnace. According to the Department of Energy, in areas where the temperature often falls below 25 degrees a heat pump would require so much supplemental resistance heat that it might not make sense.
In places where heat pumps are economical, electric companies are usually eager to see them installed, so the local power company is a good place for a homeowner to start inquiring. Many utilities will estimate the size of the heat pump needed and calculate the operating cost. But the installation is usually done by the homeowner's contractor.
To encourage efficiency in electricity use, some utilities offer rebates to people who install heat pumps. Carolina Power & Light, for example, will lend its customers money to buy heat pumps and, for particularly efficient models, will lower the interest rate. Carolina Power and other utilities have found it is cheaper to subsidize the purchase of efficient appliances than to build new power plants to supply inefficient ones.
The efficiency of a heat pump -- that is, the amount of temperature change it produces per unit of electricity consumed -- varies with the outdoor temperature and the desired indoor temperature. The Government requires heat pumps to be labeled using a standard called the seasonal energy efficiency ratio, a measurement that combines the efficiency ratings under all conditions. (A related measure, the energy efficiency ratio, is used for conventional air-conditioners.) Check with your electric company before buying from a private contractor; many utilities pay rebates if the heat pump meets a minimum standard of efficiency.
 
Efficiency Is Improved
 New heat pump designs are far more efficient than old ones. One reason is that most are designed to run at variable speed to keep the indoor temperature at the desired level, while conventional air-conditioners or furnaces run for a while to get the house to the proper temperature, and then shut off until the temperature drifts out of the desired range. Continuous operation means greater efficiency and eliminates a characteristic that many homeowners have found objectionable, a blast of cold air from the ducts on start-up.
At Carolina Power and elsewhere, heat pump experts stress that to work right, a heat pump system has to be well thought out. Houses with forced-air heating that use natural gas are not always good candidates for conversion because the existing hot air system blows air heated to 120 degrees or so. A heat pump may produce only 90 or 100 degrees, so it will have to move more air through the ducts at higher speed, which can cause howling.
Newer heat pumps are designed to produce higher-temperature air, which can also be critical. In winter, air at less than body temperature can create a draft that feels cold, even if it is warm enough to raise the room temperature to the desired level.
Another critical problem is size. If the heat pump is too big, it will not have to work very hard to cool the house, but this has a drawback. Humidity is removed from the air when it passes over a cold coil, but if the system is too big it will lower the temperature before all the air has had a chance to go through the coil, leaving the house cool but clammy.

Diagram: "A Pump That Heats and Cools," shows how in winter the heat pump extracts heat from cool outdoor air and delivers it to the house, using a compressor like the one in an air-conditioner or refrigerator. In summer the compressor pushes coolant in the opposite direction, so the system extracts heat from indoors and sends it outside. (The New York Times;Illustration by John Papasian)

HEADLINE: Petty Feud May Have Led to Youth's Death

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Lacey Jenkins and Lamont Simmions had what the police often describe as an "ongoing dispute."
It probably wasn't over anything much, they say. Just something small. It may have even been as petty as a putdown that witnesses told them Mr. Jenkins, 15 years old, had once made about the shabby clothing worn by Mr. Simmions, 20. 
 What was certain, however, was that early yesterday morning, Mr. Jenkins walked into the dank, yellow-tiled lobby of his apartment building in Harlem and was shot once in the head by someone lurking there, the police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
 
Site of Killing Over Jacket
 Late yesterday afternoon, the police arrested Mr. Simmions, of 70 West 115th Street in Harlem, and accused him of the slaying. Last night the authorities were weighing what to charge him with, said a police spokesman, Detective Joseph K. McConville. Witnesses to the shooting led the police to Mr. Simmions, who was picked up at his residence, the detective said.
The shooting occurred at 70 Lenox Avenue in the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers, a sprawling public housing project that was the site of a similar killing last November. In that case, Bernard Richardson, 20 years old, was shot and killed over the black shearling jacket that a friend was wearing, the police said. No arrests in that case have been made, the police said yesterday.
Yesterday morning, friends and relatives wept openly near the asphalt playground outside the youth's building. His mother, Jewel Jenkins, recalled how her son rose each morning before dawn to catch a commuter bus to Hackensack, N.J., where many relatives live and where he attended Hackensack High School. Ms. Jenkins, 32 years old, said she had graduated from the school and had selected it for her son because she trusted he would get a good education there.
The youth, an average student who had just completed the 10th grade, played on the football and basketball teams at the school and dreamed of becoming a professional athlete some day, relatives said. Ms. Jenkins said her son was quiet and serious and always stayed out of trouble.
 
'I Don't Smile a Lot'
 "He had a personality all to himself," Ms. Jenkins said, her voice breaking. "People would often ask him why he looked so serious. He would say 'I don't smile a lot.' That was his way."
Like a lot of other teen-agers, Mr. Jenkins played Nintendo video games and enjoyed renting movies. "He was just talking about Robocop II on Thursday," Ms. Jenkins said.
Yesterday, the boy's relatives and friends hugged one another and cried near the playground and later inside the apartment of the youth's grandmother, Leova Jenkins, who lives across the street. Though most spoke quietly of their grief, others periodically vented their rage loudly, often to no one in particular.
"Lacey didn't bother nobody," one young woman screamed as tears streamed down her face. "Why they kill him?"
The police said they were unable to answer that question definitively last evening.
But Lieut. Robert Nardoza, a police spokesman, said witnesses had related comments they said the youth had once purportedly made about the shabbiness of Mr. Simmions's clothing. The lieutenant said he did not know when those comments were made, but that they may have been the motive for the shooting.
"The victim came from a decent family," Lieutenant Nardoza said. "He had decent clothes, nice sneakers. There might have been some comments by the victim demeaning the shooter's manner of dress."
Detective McConville, the other police spokesman, said he did not know if Mr. Simmions had a criminal record. The detective said Mr. Simmions was unemployed.
It was clothing, or at the very least the status of it, that the police said led to the killing last November of Mr. Richardson in the King Towers, a project of 10 red-brick buildings with about 3,600 residents that was the subject of a three-part series in The New York Times in February. Mr. Richardson was walking with two friends at 1:30 A.M. on November 25 when a mugger demanded their coats, one of which was made of black shearling, a popular status symbol on the city's meanest streets.
When the three men resisted, the mugger fired four shots, killing Mr. Richardson and wounding one of his friends in the shoulder.

HEADLINE: Rare Sense of Optimism Stirs Anew in Hartford

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 26

 BODY:
There was enough optimism in the air at the Connecticut Capitol today for the House, the Senate and the Governor to set a deadline for adopting a budget for the fiscal year that began 26 days ago: one more week.
The feeling that progress is being made has been felt before in this roller-coaster special session, in which legislators have at times worked through the night and over weekends only to have one budget or another defeated or vetoed. 
 And the deadline, like nearly every deadline in this long deadlock over spending and taxes, is artificial: the House and Senate approved a one-week temporary budget, to keep government going through Aug. 4, vowing their work would be done by then.
 
A Need to Compromise
 What seemed different in the rococo corridors and chambers of this Gilded-Age Capitol was a determination that every possible idea for spending and taxing was now out in the open and being discussed in both the House and Senate, by both Democrats and Republicans.
"People are starting to realize they need to reach compromise, and that's what's happening," said Representative Edward C. Krawiecki, the House minority leader from Bristol who has led Republicans in their opposition to an income tax and their insistence on constitutional spending limits.
The Senate President, John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford who has staunchly opposed an income tax, said after meeting with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., "There are a number of plans that are out there and people seem optimistic they can put something together, especially with Republican support."
 
'Spadework Has Been Done'
 And Mr. Weicker, who has said he can see no alternative to a first-ever tax on wages for Connecticut to both balance a budget and stimulate the economy, said, "We all know the facts so backward and forward that we could sit down and within 20 minutes come up with 20 cohesive programs.
"All the spadework has been done."
Governor Weicker signaled his optimism today by quickly signing the temporary one-week budget, ending the threat of another state shutdown when the current two-week temporary budget expires at midnight Sunday. He had let two previous tempo rary measures take effect without his signature, thereby furloughing 20,000 state workers for several days the first week of July when the state had no budget of any kind.
Today, the House proceeded with its one-week budget in the expectation that Mr. Weicker would take it as an indication of progress and go along. The Senate followed in little more than an hour, and Mr. Weicker began a news conference by saying, "The answer is yes, I'm going to sign it."
Mr. Weicker said he had been assured by Senator Larson and the House speaker, Richard J. Balducci, that they would do everything possible "to button up this baby" within the new one-week grace period.
 
Not Out of Woods Yet
 But he warned that he had not seen the details of any tax or spending plan. "Optimism is one thing," the Governor said. "Being out of the woods is quite another."
The sense of progress moving today's votes came from two sources: the House's failure on Tuesday to override Mr. Weicker's veto of a budget balanced without an income tax, and the subsequent release of new income-tax plans by two pairs of representatives, one Democratic and one Republican.
The Democrats, Representative. Ronald L. Smoko of Hamden and Representative. John W. Thompson of Manchester, captured attention on Wednesday by proposing a 20 percent surtax on Federal tax bills, so that someone who paid $10,000 to the I.R.S., for example, would pay $2,000 to Connecticut.
Their plan both simplified the tax process and allowed residents to take full advantage of their Federal tax deductions.
Then on Thursday two suburban Republicans, Robert Farr of West Hartford and William L. Wollenberg of Farmington, abandoned their opposition to an income tax and made their own proposal: a 10 percent surtax on Federal tax bills, coupled with a constitutional limit on the income-tax rate and a long-term reduction in the state's work force of 20 percent.
 
Republicans to Discuss Taxes
 While a few Republicans had participated in earlier income-tax proposals, this was new territory, indicating a willingness by long-time opponents to accept the new source of revenue in return for a restructuring of the spending side of the budget.
After the House vote today, Mr. Krawiecki, the minority leader, met with Mr. Weicker and told him a majority of Republicans still opposed any income tax, but that other members were interested in discussing the new plans that various legislators were working on.
He appeared optimistic that, with both sides realizing that compromise was required, Republicans could win some of the spending limits they have sought in this session, when Mr. Weicker's status as an independent governor with no party of his own has allowed them a much stronger role than usual.
Mr. Krawiecki said he doubted that any budget would pass without large spending cuts and constitutional limits on spending and tax rates.

HEADLINE: Dole Will Seek Backing of Bush On Bill Extending Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, said today that he was going to try to get the Bush Administration to agree on a plan to extend unemployment benefits for people who have been out of work at least half a year.
A $5.8 billion measure sponsored by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, will be taken up by the Senate on Monday. Mr. Dole still opposes that bill, an aide said, because he considers it too costly and because he believes it is being used as a political device to embarrass Republicans. But support for it among Republicans is growing. 
 The aide said Mr. Dole would talk with Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor, and Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, both of whom have opposed extending benefits beyond what current law provides. The aide said Mr. Dole would try to work with them to find an approach the Administration would support.
 
Only 3 States Benefit Now
 Under current law, the basic 26 weeks of unemployment benefits can be extended for 13 weeks when unemployment among insured workers in a state reaches 6 percent, or when it exceeds average levels in that state over the last two years by one-fifth. The unemployed in only three states are now eligible for extended benefits.
The Bentsen bill would make workers eligible for 20 more weeks of unemployment coverage when total unemployment is at least 8 percent; 13 more weeks when it reaches 7 percent, and 7 more weeks when it is 6 percent. In all other states, four additional weeks would be authorized.
A similar measure is to be considered Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee. A vote in the House is also planned for next week.
 
Support From Republicans
 The Bentsen bill, which won the votes of five of the nine Republicans on the Finance Committee on Thursday, picked up additional support from other Republicans today.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York said, "These are tough times and working people need protection." Referring to Mr. Darman's arguments against the additional spending as not in keeping with last year's budget agreement, Mr. D'Amato said, "When you can't feed a family and can't keep your dignity, all that business about keeping agreements, that just pales in the face of reality."
Mr. Bentsen said another Republican, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, had asked him to be included as a co-sponsor on the bill. "I'm quite encouraged," he said. "We're picking it up as we go along." Other Republcian co-sponsors are Senators Bob Packwood of Oregon, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and John Seymour of California.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Dip in Sluggish Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in light trading yesterday, as credit market participants used a weaker-than-expected report on second-quarter economic growth as an excuse to take profits.
The report showed that for the first time since last year's third quarter growth turned positive, but just barely. The increase of four-tenths of a percent was less than half what most analysts had expected. 
 Prices of Treasury securities moved modestly higher just after the report was released, but retreated later, as dealers moved to capitalize on the gains recorded over the last few days.
Aside from the urge to take profits, traders said the Treasury's refunding auctions, which will take place in less than two weeks, also acted as a disincentive to maintain positions through the weekend.
 
Awaiting Next Week's Data
 Moreover, while economic data released earlier in the week suggested to some analysts that the recovery may be stalling, a raft of fresh reports, including July employment data, are expected next week. Those reports could easily quash the notion that the economy is stalling out, traders and analysts said, which would have a negative impact on the bond market.
Recent data "point either to a slip back into recession or a very sluggish recovery," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a New York money management firm. "But market participants are worried both about supply and next week's numbers. So what we are seeing is people taking profits in an illiquid market."
Some See Strength in G.N.P. Data
Indeed, analysts said that a closer inspection of the Commerce Department's report on second-quarter growth showed that the economy was not as weak as the numbers seemed to suggest.
Specifically, economists said they were encouraged by a 2.5 percent increase in domestic final sales, a rise suggesting that consumption is beginning to gain momentum.
"On closer analysis, it became quite clear that the G.N.P. accounts confirm a turnaround in the economy," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "That in turn seems to decrease the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board will move soon to ease monetary policy further."
Most of what was a modest selloff occurred in longer-term notes and bonds. Prices of shorter-term maturities were little changed on the day.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 97 1/8, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.38 percent, up from 8.37 percent late Thursday. The benchmark issue traded as high as 97 17/32 just after the numbers on second-quarter growth were released.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 23/32 late yesterday, down 3/32, to yield 8.19 percent. The 7 7/8 percent five-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.80 percent, unchanged from late Thursday. And the 6 7/8 percent two-year notes were unchanged at a late offered price of 100 2/32, to yield 6.84 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.56 percent, up a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.67 percent. And one-year bill rates also fell by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.85 percent.
Two large corporations priced issues in the investment-grade corporate bond market.
Pepisco offered $200 million worth of three-year notes, through an underwriting syndicate led by Lehman Brothers.
The 7 5/8 percent notes, which mature Aug. 1, 1994, and are noncallable, were priced at $99.696 to yield 7.74 percent, 51 basis points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.

Encore Reportedly Plans to Shut Plant

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 26

 BODY:
Encore Computer, the troubled computer manufacturer based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is planning to shut its plant in Marlboro, Mass., and lay off nearly all of the 200 workers there, according to a person within the company.
The company, which makes and sells multiprocessing computers used for flight simulation, energy management and nuclear power plant simulation, has been hit hard recently by economic problems exacerbated by continuing delays in shipping its new Gemini computer, said the person, who asked not to be named. 
 Encore's officials, including its chairman and chief executive, Kenneth G. Fisher, who founded the company in Massachusetts in 1983, could not be reached for comment today. Charles Anderson, a corporate vice president, did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment.
Last week, William Avery, Encore's vice president in charge of technology, told Marlboro employees that the plant would be shut and that he would be leaving to create a start-up company, the person said. Mr. Avery also could not be reached for comment today.
Up to 20 employees in the Marlboro operation, which houses the research and development team building the newest computer, will be offered the opportunity to relocate to Fort Lauderdale, while the rest have been informed that the company planned to phase out the plant over 12 months, the person said. Encore has slightly more than 1,600 employees.
Encore, which lost $9.4 million, on revenues of $40 million, in the first fiscal quarter of the year, was hurt by losing a $460 million NASA contract to I.B.M. in May. Sales have dropped from $215 million last year to a projected $170 million for fiscal 1991.
The company has attributed the projected sales drop to delays in the Gemini computer series, which had been promised to customers before the end of last year and has yet to be shipped.
In 1989, Encore acquired Gould Inc.'s computer systems division and soon after moved its headquarters to Gould's Florida location.
In over-the-counter trading today, Encore's shares fell 18.75 cents, closing at $1.43 3/4.

Dollar Off After G.N.P. Data; Gold Prices Higher in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined across the board yesterday, depressed by an unexpectedly weak report on United States economic growth during the second quarter.
Gold prices rose in domestic dealings after declining overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $366.20 an ounce, up $1.70. Republic National Bank said gold rose $1.75 an ounce to a late bid price of $366. 
 The dollar fell sharply in both European and domestic dealings after the release of a Commerce Department repor showing that the gross national product, a measure of the economy's health, grew at an annual rate of four-tenths of a percent in the second quarter. That is well below market expectations of growth of at least eight-tenths of a percent during the period.
 
 Fear of 'Double-Dip Recession'

"With G.N.P. under expectations, it really gave the dollar another knock," said Randolph Donney, research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. "It lent credence to the theory that we're going to see a double-dip recession and that the Fed is going to have to lower interest rates."
He said traders were beginning to believe that despite a few quarters of growth, a turnaround was not taking hold and the economy was going to slip back into decline, prompting the Federal Reserve to ease credit to stimulate growth.
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the consulting firm IDEA, said technical moves ahead of the weekend lifted the dollar from its session lows. He noted that activity died down once the market had digested the G.N.P. report.
In Tokyo, where trading ended before the G.N.P. report was released, the dollar rose to 138.35 Japanese yen, from 137.60 on Thursday. Later, in London the dollar rose to 137.85 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 137.60 yen, down from 138.85 on Thursday.
In London the British pound rose to $1.6880, from $1.6750. In New York it cost $1.6830 to buy a pound, more expensive than Thursday's $1.6730.
Against the German currency the dollar fell to 1.7430 marks, from 1.7588.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.5220 Swiss francs, down from 1.5335; 5.9380 French francs, down from 5.9775; 1,301.00 Italian lire, down from 1,311.00, and 1.1488 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1523.
Gold prices declined overseas. In London gold fell to a late bid of $364.75 an ounce, from $365 bid late Thursday. In Zurich gold's closing bid was $364.35 an ounce, down from $364.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong gold fell 22 cents an ounce, to $365.56.

HEADLINE: No More Aid for M.B.A.'s in China

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALIAN, China

 BODY:
In a modest structure on the leafy campus of the Dalian University of Technology, just across from a huge statue of Chairman Mao leading his Communist flock, capitalism is the burning issue.
The Chinese at the school, who are not trying to outflank Communism's nemesis but to absorb more of it, are losing some ground. Despite Chinese protests, the Commerce Department has refused to renew an annual $400,000 contribution to a business school program here that has turned scores of young Chinese managers into freshly minted M.B.A.'s for service in their homeland. 
 The 11-year-old program was unique: a Government-to-Government arrangement, financed partly by each country, that offered management courses to officials from many of China's top enterprises.
It provided regular American M.B.A. degrees, under a program run by the State University of New York at Buffalo, which provided the curriculum and professors. The program at this campus in Dalian, a port city in China's industrial northeast, the region once known as Manchuria, also took senior Chinese officials and offered them midcareer training in American management techniques.
And the professors did not train the Chinese to work just in foreign ventures, as the management courses of some other countries in China do. The majority of the Dalian program's graduates returned to their state-owned enterprises, introducing American methods directly into the heart of Communist China.
But the Commerce Department's decision to stop supporting this program is a sign of the times inside China and in Sino-American relations.
The United States' decision to pull the plug on the M.B.A. program reflects the political realities as the American love affair with China continues the cooling-off that started with the killings of pro-democracy demonstrators two years ago in Tiananmen Square.
President Bush is currently struggling to renew China's favored access to American markets. An antagonistic Congress that has lost patience with what it considers China's poor human rights record voted Tuesday to impose restrictions on trade between the countries but the narrow majority is not likely to withstand a veto.
The shift in Washington is occurring as the Chinese have expanded foreign trade and encouraged foreign companies to invest in private businesses. The M.B.A. students here speak English as their second language, and use it to debate finance, marketing and labor management strategies, not class warfare.
Even with the setbacks that Western-style reform has suffered for three years, China remains eager to learn what it must to advance its hobbling economy and integrate it more closely with the industrialized democracies.
Ultimately, though, the decision to halt the program here raises the question of which measures taken by an angry United States against China really punish the country or soften its behavior, and which merely undermine the United States' goal of achieving political and economic reform.
"We admit we have a lot of problems trying to reform our system," said Zhu Shunqing, an economist who is the dean of the university's school of management. "The graduates of this school have new ideas, and they understand the thinking of foreigners. What we have to have is useful knowledge to help with the reform process, even from capitalists."
Like the dean of a Harvard or a Stanford, Mr. Zhu proudly ticked off the important government offices and corporations in which the graduates of the American program have landed, from the State Planning Commission and top provincial offices to some of China's largest state enterprises. President Ronald Reagan praised the program during a visit to China in 1984 and Henry Kissinger spoke at one of its graduations.
That record of success has only increased the dismay over the Commerce Department's decision to kill the program. The department has decided that it can spend the $400,000 a year it contributes to better effect elsewhere, perhaps in Eastern Europe.
"This is painful for me because I started the program 11 years ago," said Richard W. H. Lee, the Commerce Department's director of science and technology programs in East Asia. "Everyone considers it a great success, but it is a matter of priorities. The department's priorities have changed."
 
 'The Wrong Information'

Mr. Zhu, too, acknowledged the apparent shift in priorities. "The Department of Commerce said they wanted to change their emphasis from China to Eastern Europe," he said. "They said they didn't think we would reform our economy. I say they have the wrong information."
Many who have been involved in the program concede it had shortcomings; some of the young M.B.A.s found there was little use for their new skills in hidebound state-owned enterprises, for instance.
Mr. Zhu said some graduates were frustrated when they returned to a Chinese environment. Some were relegated to jobs as translators without real influence. But he said those problems were declining because the students were being chosen with more care.
But almost all felt that the positive aspects outweighed those flaws, and that the good will it generated for the United States was important.
 
 Better Business Relations

"It's a tragedy," said Joseph A. Alutto, the dean of Buffalo's business school until earlier this year, when he moved to Ohio State University. "You could not find a more cost-effective way of developing better business relations. And the need for this expertise and these relationships has never been greater."
Added David B. Matthews, the resident administrator of the program for the State University of New York: "We really do have an impact on the senior level of managers in the Chinese economy. If you close it down you lose that."
Although Commerce Department officials prefer to say the annual grant is just being suspended, the program's administrators say the likelihood of reviving it is slim because of the long lead time to attract students and professors.
The American Government has encouraged American corporations to consider picking up the program's decidedly modest cost. There is already an advisory counsel made up of some of America's biggest companies, including I.B.M., Xerox, Citicorp, General Electric and Coca-Cola. The companies have provided internships for the Chinese students and other forms of backing.
 
 Where Government Has Clout

But most agree the corporations could never replace the Government as chief sponsor. The fact that the course was Government-to-Government gave it clout in a country where the Government so tightly controls the economy. If it were a corporate program it would lose that important status, and possibly the backing of the Chinese Government, Mr. Zhu said.
"Part of the whole reason this has been so successful is the kind of students it draws, and that's because it's Government to Government," Mr. Lee said.
Mr. Zhu said: "China has really opened to these ideas. It is not a good choice for you to close that door."

HEADLINE: Economy Turns up With Gain of 0.4% in the 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
In its first expansion since last summer, the economy managed a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent at an annual rate during the April-June quarter as inflation pressure subsided, the Commerce Department reported today.
The Bush Administration was quick to hail the advance, which was marked by a surge in consumer spending, as confirmation that the economy has pulled out of the recession after a cumulative decline of 1.1 percent in the gross national product. That is about half the severity of typical postwar downturns. 
 "This further indicates that the recession appears to have ended in the spring and a recovery has begun," Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, said in a briefing. "We expect the recovery to continue and gain momentum."
 
Less Than Wall St. Expected
 Although the rise in G.N.P. was at the low end of the range expected by Wall Street and other private analysts, most also seemed inclined to view today's report in a largely positive light.
Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, found the upturn in personal spending and a further reduction of business inventories particularly encouraging. "The basic dynamics required to lift the economy off and give it some momentum are at work," he said.
At the same time, analysts were aware that five of the eight previous recessions since World War II have had at least one quarter of growth before finally ending.
 
Series of Positive Reports
 Today's report is the latest in a series of mostly positive or improved economic results so far this summer, covering, among other things, industrial production, employment, housing starts and the Government index intended to predict the economy's course -- which has risen for four straight months. At the same time, prices have remained in check, rising by only two-tenths of 1 percent at the consumer level in June while declining at the producer level.
This week, on the other hand, some analysts grew more edgy about a possible economic relapse on reports of a downturn in orders for manufactured durable goods, disappointing car sales and a rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance.
In an appearance today before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic counselor to Data Resources-McGraw Hill, pointed to various structural factors that he said would inhibit, perhaps threaten, recovery. They were high levels of private debt, weak income growth, an oversupply of commercial buildings, tighter lending standards and budget deficits at all levels of government.
But according to Walter D. Fackler, a professor of business economics at the University of Chicago, the only significant negative factor in today's G.N.P. data was a decline in the international trade sector. Exports grew at a modest $5.9 billion rate, aided by a return to normal levels of tourist spending and air fare receipts following the war in the Persian Gulf, but this gain was largely offset by lower profits from the foreign operations of American companies.
 
Oil Profits Decline
 A Commerce Department official cited shrinking postwar margins of oil companies as an important contributor to the profit decline. He also said that to compile today's report, the department estimated that the June trade deficit, not yet published, widened $1 billion, to $5.7 billion. Imports, meanwhile, rose at a $31.6 billion annual rate in contrast to a $15 billion rate of decline in the second quarter, the report showed.
Business investment in plants fell again but this normally lags behind during upturns as companies delay capital spending until they find capacity pinched. The decline, moreover, was only $2.9 billion at an annual rate, compared with a $22.6 billion rate of decline in the first quarter.
Residential investment posted a small increase during the latest period, the first rise in housing for more than a year.
Many analysts had predicted that inventories would rise in the second quarter, swelling the G.N.P., but the fact that they did not was taken as an encouraging sign.
 
Inventories Are Falling
 After reductions in non-farm inventories at annual rates of $16.3 billion in the spring, $28.1 billion in the winter and $28.5 billion in the fall, stocks are considered so lean that production will need to be increased fast if the recovery is sustained, analysts said.
They also said the rise in consumption showed that the inventory reductions were not the result of corporate pessimism but of strong demand. "Consumers haven't retrenched," asserted Richard D. C. Trainer, chief market economist at the Bank of Tokyo. "We are firmly in recovery."
The four-tenths of 1 percent rate of increase in the nation's second-quarter output of goods and services follows two straight quarterly declines -- at a 2.8 percent pace in the first quarter and at a 1.6 percent pace in the final quarter of last year.
For the third quarter of 1990, during which the recession actually began according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the economy grew at a rate of 1.4 percent. The research bureau designated last July as the peak of a seven-and-a-half-year exansion.
 
Reassuring Numbers
 The price data contained in today's report were mostly reassuring even though much of the improvement reflected additional unwinding of the sharp increase that occurred before the Mideast war. The fixed-weight G.N.P. index, which assumes the components of output do not vary, was 3 percent in the second quarter, down from 5.2 percent in the first three months of the year.
The implicit price deflator, which captures changes in the composition of output but for that reason is not a pure gauge of prices, eased to 3.9 percent from 5.2 percent.
Perhaps most encouraging, suggested J. Antonio Villamil, the chief Commerce Department economist, was the fact that the fixed-weighted index for gross domestic purchases -- what is bought as opposed to what is produced -- rose only 2.4 percent after rising 3.7 percent in the first quarter.
 
Projected Growth
 "Modest inflation is a very positive development for the sustainability of the economic expansion," Mr. Villamil said, repeating an Administration projection that the economy will expand at a 2 to 3 percent pace during the second half of this year.
Reflecting the pickup in spending, however, the personal savings rate slumped during the quarter to 3.7 percent from 4.2 percent in the first three months of the year.
Other figures showe that G.N.P. expressed in current dollars rather than in 1982 dollars rose at a 4.6 percent rate in the second quarter to $5.62 trillion compared with a 2.2 percent rise in the first. The rate of real G.N.P. was $4.13 trillion.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the first quarter of 1991 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

HEADLINE: Reactors to Juice Cartons: Soviet Factory Adjusts

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PODOLSK, U.S.S.R., July 25

 BODY:
Across the Soviet Union, people are starting their days by popping open milk and juice containers that are produced here thanks to machines that used to produce sophisticated military components too secret to be discussed.
The Luch Experimental Works factory in this industrial city about 15 miles south of Moscow was an integral part of the vast and secretive military industrial complex, producing parts for nuclear reactors, lasers and metal optics used in advanced weapons systems. Now, as part of a joint venture with a Swedish company, the factory has been partially turned over to manufacturing machines that make cardboard containers for milk, orange juice, apple juice and guava juice. 
 Tetra Pak-Luch, as the joint venture is called, is a successful and apparently rare example of the Soviet Union's program to bolster its feeble economy and improve its deficit-riddled consumer market by converting military enterprises to civilian use as Soviet-American relations warm and new arms-control agreements are reached.
 
Secrecy and Ineptitude
 Operating in special areas of the plant marked off by cordons, Tetra Pak-Luch is an oasis of capitalism, a self-contained world of shiny tools, men in spiffy, pressed coveralls with the company logo and even imported toilet paper, a scene that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said he hopes to see replicated throughout the military industrial complex.
Defense Industry Minister Boris M. Belousov said last month that his ministry had significantly cut its military-related production -- for example, rocket launchers, tanks, armored personnel carriers -- and increased its production of, among other consumer goods, washing machines, tape recorders and perfumes.
He said that in 1988, civilian goods accounted for 35 percent of his ministry's industrial output, a figure he said would rise to 65 percent this year.
But Soviet and Western experts say the Soviet program to convert industry from military to civilian uses is marked by internal dissent, secrecy, bureaucracy and ineptitude that has vastly hindered this cornerstone of President Gorbachev's economic bailout blueprint, making it far from the economic triumph Mr. Belousov describes.
The vast military industrial complex is said by various informed experts to employ from 5 million to 8 million people in about 5,000 enterprises that occupy two percent of the country's territory and include about a third of all the enterprises in Moscow alone. This year the Supreme Soviet earmarked 96.6 billion rubles for the military industrial complex -- 35 percent of the Government budget.
But of the 400 enterprises scheduled for conversion, only five or six have actually been completely retooled, according to official sources, including Soviet television. It was not clear if that number included Tetra Pak-Luch, which once made not only reactor and laser parts but also things that employees said they could not discuss with a Western visitor.
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported recently that of the 120 products that were supposed to be manufactured by converted military industry enterprises, only 28 were actually being produced.
Successes like the Tetra Pak-Luch joint venture are rare examples, and even there, the Swedish partners say they must continuously break through bureaucratic logjams to push the project along, including getting special permission to come to work on weekends.
 
Some Kind of Military Tie
 One of the Swedish employees here said such weekend restrictions and other observations over several months have led him to conclude that despite protestations to the contrary, the plant continues some kind of military-related production, an idea supported by a couple of Soviet employees here who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"There are many odd things here at Luch that add up to that in my mind," said Bengt O. Hakansson, technical factory manager of Tetra Pak-Luch. "There are all these militia men with guns walking around patrolling the grounds. I can't work on Saturday or Sunday unless I request permission in advance. There are all these workshops I can't go into."
One Soviet employee said that raw materials for the plant were still provided through the Defense Industry Ministry, even though company officials say it has been at least two and a half years since the plant stopped military-related work and lost its defense industry sponsorship. The employee said workers were told to approach their jobs as they did before "conversion," and to regard their jobs as secret.
Whether the parts of the Luch Experimental Works not engaged in the Tetra Pak joint venture continue to serve the military industrial complex secretly is less important as a fact than as an example of the deep secrecy surrounding military enterprises and the conversion process, a secrecy many experts say is one of the chief obstacles to successful conversion.
 
Sharing Military Technologies
 For so long, the military and civilian sectors were kept so separate that despite the sophistication and technological advances of the military industries, that expertise was never brought to the long-suffering civilian economy.
"For too long we have been loading one side of the boat and now it has begun to sink," Vsevolod Avduyevsky, chairman of the National Commission for Assistance in Converting War Industries to Civilian Production, told a Soviet reporter last year.
An article in 1989 in the journal Kommunist caused a big stir in the military industry with a suggestion that for conversion to succeed and for the economy to rebound, the military-related ministries would have to share their technologies with the civilian sector.
The managing director of Tetra Pak-Luch, Aleksandr Panchenko, said his plant was so cut off from other enterprises even within the nation's network of military factories that there was a scramble among top management to find new products and new clients when they were told about two and half years ago that their military orders were being cut.
 
Top Military Opposition
 "We worked in a micro-world," said Mr. Panchenko, who insisted that all Luch's military ties had been severed.
But he said that while people at Luch sought new partners -- eventually hooking up with Tetra Pak through the Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry -- other military factories' directors were sitting back, sure that conversion was a passing phase.
"Everyone thought that they were protected, that the state was a bottomless barrel with inexhaustible resources," he said, sitting in the sleek Tetra Pak-Luch offices, enjoying the product of his enterprise's foresight, drinking imported Brazilian coffee, smoking foreign cigarettes, dressed in British sportswear. "Now these guys come to us to find out what steps they should take. They see that this is all for real and if they don't save their own factories nobody else will."
Yuri A. Ryzhov, a deputy in the Supreme Soviet who headed a legislative commission on national security, said the top military leaders oppose conversion because it erodes their power base and exposes their profligate management methods.
 
Testimony of Generals
 While some of the leaders publicly support the idea of stepping up consumer production at military plants, Mr. Ryzhov said, they continually find ways to undermine the process.
"Real conversion has no friends in the top structures of the Defense Ministry," he said.
Several years ago, when the Soviet leadership first introduced the idea of conversion, generals testified before legislative committees about the program's benefits, holding aloft pictures of baby carriages that were produced at missile factories and boasting that they were satisfied customers of washing machines built at military factories diversifying from their usual orders.
Now, leading generals often shrug off criticism of the conversion program.
 
Inappropriate Conversions
 "Your country has been fumbling with conversion for 40 years and still has no great solutions," a high-ranking general told an American military colleague during a visit to the Soviet Union this week by Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Opposition comes from places other than the top. Labor unions often protest a plant's conversion because on the whole, workers in military enterprises receive significantly higher salaries than their civilian counterparts and they object vehemently to the prospect of lower wages and possible unemployment.
But inefficient planning and a bumbling bureaucracy seem equally responsible for the conversion program's problems. Factories are often saddled with demands for producing things inappropriate to their technical resources. In one of the most outlandish cases, an enterprise that made components important for the Buran space shuttle was revamped to produce pots and pans.
"A factory should produce something that corresponds to its technical and technological potential," said Vyacheslav Malchevsky, production manager at Tetra Pak-Luch. "Pardon me, but if we were producing cosmetics or baby carriages, we would be floundering like all those other military enterprises."
But in the disjointed and crippled Soviet system, the benefits of success at Tetra Pak-Luch are elusive to the average shopper desperate for some evidence of an economic recovery.
"This country produces 24 percent of the all the world's milk and now we produce machines that can package all that milk efficiently and safely," Mr. Panchenko said. "But still, there's no milk in the stores."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Soviet Pact Signings

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
In addition to signing the first treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons, the United States and the Soviet Union plan to conclude at least three new agreements on cooperation in areas like space and aviation during the summit meeting in Moscow next week.
The White House said today that President Bush was also likely to present President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with the favorable tariff treatment that the Soviet Union has long sought, by announcing in Moscow that he is sending the Soviet-American trade treaty to the Senate for its approval. 
 The accord was signed by the two leaders in Washington in June. But Mr. Bush kept it on its desk until the Soviet Union enacted new legislation on emigration and met American concerns about other provisions of the agreement dealing with intellectual property rights.
The strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start, is to be signed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev on Wednesday amid much pomp and ceremony.
At a separate meeting, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is to sign three "memorandums of understanding," that will pledge new levels of cooperation in civil aviation crisis management, disaster relief and space exploration -- most likely in general terms.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev might also issue separate statements on the three economic areas in which the United States is most interested in aiding Soviet industry: oil exploration, the conversion of military plants to civilian use and distribution of food.

HEADLINE: Baker Addresses the Mongolian Parliament

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 26

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today became the first Western statesman to address Mongolia's Parliament, pledging support for its reform efforts and promising millions of dollars worth of United States aid.
"On behalf of President Bush and the American people, I come here today to lend our support and to work with you for the success of political and economic freedom here in Mongolia," Mr. Baker told a meeting of bot houses of Parliament in the capital, Ulan Bator. 
 Mongolia, an enormous land with a tiny population sandwiched between the Soviet Union and China, held its first free elections in 70 years in 1990. The ruling Communists were returned to power. Mr. Baker praised Mongolia as the first Communist state in Asia to initiate democratic reforms.
He pledged $6.4 million in aid to help Mongolia overcome a financial crisis created when its longtime mentor, the Soviet Union, withdrew crucial aid last year. He told the legislators that he would ask Congress to approve $10 million in additional aid to help tide Mongolia over.

HEADLINE: Chevron Profits Fall 40.7%; Shell Has Loss

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 26

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation said today that its profits fell 40.7 percent in the second quarter. The Shell Oil Company posted its first quarterly loss since 1934, amounting to $68 million, after writing off $90 million for costs related to job cutbacks.
Other oil giants that operate mainly in the United States, as Chevron and Shell do, reported steep declines in earnings earlier this week for the quarter ended June 30. They included Amoco, ARCO and Phillips Petroleum. 
 Companies with bigger foreign operations, like Mobil and Texaco, reported comparatively smaller profit declines for the period, and Exxon posted a slight gain. They benefited partly from wider profit margins in refining and chemicals, and from higher natural gas prices in Europe.
Bernard J. Picchi, oil analyst at Salomon Brothers, said most leading oil companies would report lower profits for the rest of the year. Demand for gasoline and chemicals remains weak, and crude oil prices are likely to average far less than during the second half of 1990, he added.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
 Chevron

Net income for the nation's fourth-largest oil company fell to $384 million, or $1.09 a share, from $648 million, or $1.83 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. The spring quarter of 1990 was the third most profitable quarter in Chevron's history. Revenues for the San Francisco-based company rose 9 percent in the 1991 quarter, to $9.7 billion from $8.9 billion.
Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executive, said the company had a $16 million loss in refining and marketing in the United States. Pricing wars and lagging demand from a weak California economy were the biggest factors, Mr. Picchi of Salomon Brothers said. Chevron also said it had paid more to acquire crude oil for its refineries and had lost some refining efficiency because of unscheduled repairs.
Operating profits in domestic production rose to $65 million, from $43 million a year ago. The totals excluded a special gain from asset sales of $5 million in the 1991 quarter and of $48 million in the year-ago quarter. International operations posted earnings of $279 million, aided by $57 million from sales of reserves in Spain and the British North Sea, up from $167 million. Chemical profits fell to $36 million, from $65 million.
Chevron's share price fell $1.125 today, to $70.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 Shell Oil

The nation's sixth-largest oil company said it lost $68 million in the quarter, after a special aftertax charge of $90 million to cover costs of severance programs and other expenses in paring 4,650 employees from its work force in the next 12 to 18 months.
The company earned $161 million in the second quarter last year. Revenues in the spring quarter rose 3.5 percent, to $5.35 billion from $5.17 billion. Shell Oil operates principally in the United States and is owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
Frank H. Richardson said the Houston-based company was searching to pare costs in addition to the employment cutbacks announced July 1, which amounted to 15 percent of the work force.
"We are proceeding with the streamlining of our operations," he said.
The company, which operates the nation's largest gasoline retailing network, will likely post lower earnings in 1991 than at any time during the 1980's.
Refining profits in the second quarter fell to $5 million, from $73 million. Chemical profits declined to $58 million, from $90 million, but income from oil and gas production rose to $10 million, in contrast to a $22 million loss a year earlier. Capital spending rose to $791 million, from $650 million.

HEADLINE: States and Cities Fight Recession With New Taxes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Hard hit by recession, state and local governments are raising taxes and fees more steeply than they have in decades. The total amount to be raised this year may approach the $23 billion in Federal tax increases that Congress enacted last fall.
And despite all the political oratory about avoiding tax increases, public policy specialists say the trend is likely to continue because of the spiraling costs of education and prisons as well as health care and other social services.
 
A Wider Tax Net
 With expenses rising sharply and revenues plummeting, states and cities have cast their tax nets deeper and wider than ever before: 
 California faced a deficit of $14.3 billion, a figure that is almost as large as New Jersey's entire budget, and it increased income and sales taxes to take in a projected $7.3 billion, a state record. In Pennsylvania, the recession has for the first time in 30 years caused tax revenue to fall behind the previous year's. Still it could set a record in state tax revenue, as legislators are considering raising business, income and sales taxes by almost $3 billion to balance a $14 billion budget.
No sooner was the ink dry on New York City's $28.5 billion budget than city officials said that the $735 million increase in property and income taxes was inadequate and that they expected a $4.3 billion shortfall through fiscal 1995. Philadelphia enacted a new sales tax that is expected to bring in an additional $75 million to $90 million to help cover the city's chronic deficits.
Generally, cities and states are trying to tax everything that moves. California extended its sales tax to candy, newspapers, snacks and bottled water, Arkansas to used cars and New York to dating services. Delaware raised income taxes on non-residents, Wisconsin increased fees for hunting licenses and Oregon raised the price on copies of birth certificates to $13 from $10. New York City increased fines for fire code violations, Los Angeles raised taxes on real estate sales, Charlotte, N.C., raised taxes on meals in restaurants and Portland, Ore., increased park fees.
 
Recession the Culprit
 States and localities have acted, in part, because the recession has diminished their tax revenues, even as it has forced them to spend more on unemployment and welfare for those thrown out of work. The combination of declining revenues and increasing expenses this year created budget gaps in almost 40 states that totaled $40 billion to $50 billion; the amount of the combined budget gap, the difference between planned spending and expected revenue, shifted constantly as legislators added programs and reduced others.
States, whose fiscal years generally begin on July 1, appear to be closing half the gap with reductions in spending and the other half with increases in taxes and fees. Moreover, many budgets are precariously balanced on forecasts that a relatively strong economic recovery is under way.
Taxes or fees, or both, in the cities of nearly 40 strapped states also are expected to increase in 1992, although it is too early for estimates because most cities' budgets are on the calendar year. "I would be very surprised if this isn't a record year for city tax increases," said William J. Althaus, a Republican who is Mayor of York, Pa., and vice president of the United States Conference of Mayors.
The substantial tax increases, said Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, come as a result of the recession as well as the long-term shift in responsibility for national programs from Washington to state and local governments. He said that state and local taxes have risen to an estimated 44 percent of all taxes, excluding Social Security, that were paid by Americans in 1990 as against 32 percent paid in 1960.
"The trend for the 1990's in state and local taxes is up," Mr. Gold said.
Some governors say states cannot raise taxes quickly enough to cover the rising costs of programs that are required by Federal law. "It's like a dog chasing its tail," said Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania. "It never catches up."
 
A Call for Help
 Governor Casey, a Democrat, proposed the largest tax increase in this frugal state's history to help cover a 38 percent increase in the state's share of benefits paid under Medicaid, the federally mandated health care program for the poor, among other things. "The Federal Government has to give states more help paying for these costs -- it's as simple as that," he said.
Some public policy analysts disagree, saying that what is needed is further reductions in discretionary social service programs, not more money. "If the Federal Government steps out of the picture, there is no reason for states to step in," said Daniel J. Mitchell, an economist and a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington.
There is a consensus among public policy analysts that the state and Federal governments require far too many costly programs, although thare will never be agreement on just which programs are unworthy.
Still, it is primarily the recession, not increased spending, that has brought so many cities and states to their knees. State tax revenue, for example, grew by an average of only 0.9 percent in the first three months of this year; this was well behind the growth in the inflation rate of 5.2 percent, according to the Rockefeller Institute. New England and California had the deepest declines in revenue, and state revenue increases exceeded the growth in the inflation rate only in the Rocky Mountain region.
Some newly elected governors, including Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, a Republican who took office in January, criticize predecessors for not putting aside enough money in the booming 1980's. "It is disingenuous to say that states have been popped by an economic cycle," he said. "Taxpayers have a legitimate gripe when they ask: 'Why did you spend everything you could take from us in the good times and then raise taxes in the bad times?' "
Vermont is the only state without a law requiring it to balance its budget annually. It plans to take three years to resolve its fiscal problems with $75 million in spending reductions from fiscal 1991 and $85 million in sales and income tax increases. Officials say the tax increases will be rolled back in 1994 when they expect the deficit to have abated.
 
North Dakota Holds Spending
 But officials in some states say it is hard to save much money for future needs when there are always so many immediate problems. "How can you justify not meeting people's needs when there is a fairly decent economy?" asked Richard Rayl, director of the Office of Management and Budget in North Dakota. The state, whose economy has recently revived after an agricultural recession in the mid-1980's, balanced its budget this year by holding down spending on discretionary programs and without raising taxes.
Mr. Gold, at the Rockefeller Institute, estimated that state tax increases enacted for fiscal 1992, which began July 1 for 46 states, would bring in a total of between $17 billion and $19 billion. Such an increase would be the largest since 1971 when measured as a proportion of total revenue.
Pressures that will tend to keep taxes moving higher through the decade include annual cost increases of about 25 percent for health care, about 12 percent for corrections and about 8 percent for primary and secondary education, the National Association of State Budget Officers reports.
It has been a chaotic year, with nine states missing their July 1 deadlines for approving budgets and with state offices shuttered intermittently in Maine and Connecticut. In Pennsylvania, one of several states whose budgets are still incomplete, Republican and Democratic legislators have had shoving matches on the floor of the House of Representatives in Harrisburg, and about 79,000 state employees have been working without pay since July 1. Property tax rebates have been delayed in the state under a program for low-income elderly taxpayers, contractors have stopped work on roads and nursing homes have had to borrow money to stay in business.
Oregon, following the national pattern this year, imposed many new fees and raised scores of existing ones, including a $500 surcharge on state college tuitions; a $3 increase, to $13, for a copy of a birth certificate; and a 50 percent increase, to $3,000, for a license to transport radioactive waste.
 
High-Income Taxpayers Pay
 In addition to the many states that raised sales taxes and greatly expanded the taxes' reach, a handful, including New York, California, North Carolina, Minnesota, Missouri and Vermont, raised income taxes for high-income taxpayers. Connecticut, Tennessee, Texas and Florida are still considering enacting broad-based personal income taxes for the first time.
Relatively few states avoided raising taxes, and those that did were proud of it. "Indiana has weathered the most severe economic storm in a decade with our balances largely intact," said Gov. Evan Bayh, "and without raising taxes or shutting down government."
Massachusetts did not have to raise taxes this year, chiefly because tax escalations for this year were included in last year's $1.2 billion tax increase. And like many other states, Massachusetts may wind up balancing its budget, in part, by reducing aid to local governments.
"We could lose up to $360,000 of our $6 million school budget," said Robert B. Byard, superintendent of schools in Belchertown, a small town 15 miles northeast of Springfield. He said previous reductions in aid have forced the school district to charge high school students for busing, sports and use of the school swimming pool. Parents just finished building a $30,000 school addition with donated materials, and they are now trying to raise $23,000 to hire a sixth-grade teacher to reduce the class size below 33 students.
New Jersey, which stunned taxpayers last year with a $2.8 billion increase, avoided another one this year through several measures, including laying off as many as 3,000 workers and selling assets. In an unusual step, the state sold a four-mile section of Interstate 95 to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority for $400 million. The state repealed a sales tax on paper products that had stirred antitax advocates to rally in Trenton with rolls of unraveled toilet paper.
The National League of Cities reports that every year since 1988 more than two-thirds of the nation's cities have raised fees and charges and that more than 40 percent have raised property taxes in each of those years. Yet more than a quarter of the cities, large and small and scattered across the country, still face significant deficits this year, said Michael A. Pagano, author of the National League of Cities' recent survey of 525 cities.
The recession, which hit the Northeast first and hardest, has now jumped across the country, he said. "A greater proportion of Western cities have severe budget imbalances than do Eastern cities," said Mr. Pagano, who added that Western cities have exhausted their reserves and will likely raise taxes and reduce services by significant amounts next year.
"Cities in the Midwest and South are not missing the recession, but in comparative terms, it is less severe there," he said.

Looking For Giants

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
The Port Washington Public Library out on Long Island knows how to dampen a human's spirits. It has asked 50 people each to choose one or two books of the past 50 years "that have most profoundly affected the thoughts and actions of humankind."
 This is a reprise of an exercise the library conducted in 1942 when it asked 20 reading types to identify those books published between 1892 and 1942 that had "most profoundly affected the thoughts and actions of mankind." 
 One immediately notes that in 1992 "humankind" has replaced 1942's "mankind" in this competition. Is this perhaps the result of a profound impact on human thought created by a book? One immediately recognizes a concession to feminist demands that "sexism" be stripped from the language and wonders if the half-century may have produced a monumental feminist book. Betty Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique," perhaps?
 Yet something may be afoot that is more profound for humanity than feminism. Feminism's gains seem pretty much confined to women in Western, industrial societies. Affecting "humankind" requires touching a bigger percentage of earth's billions.
 If, however, we interpret the change from 1942's "mankind" to 1992's "humankind" as evidence that propaganda is on the march, we get to something more far-reaching. Has there ever been another age when people zealous to manipulate human thought and action have fought so tirelessly to control the language?
 George Orwell's "1984" did the great work of alerting us to modern tyranny's power to control popular thought by controlling the language. This of course is what the feminist language purifiers are also up to, though their political purposes seem somewhat nobler than Big Brother's, or Stalin's, or Hitler's, or even our Presidential campaign technicians who turn language into a weapon.
 Before putting "1984" on this list of important books, however, let's look at the library's 1892-1942 list. A quick glance suggests books had more weight back then. Here, for instance, are Hitler's "Mein Kampf," with its absolutely horrifying weight, and Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams."
 Then: William James ("The Varieties of Religious Experience"), Henry James ("The Golden Bowl"), Lenin ("Imperialism") and John Dewey ("Democracy and Education"), as well as Einstein on relativity, Admiral Mahan on sea power and Thorstein Veblen on economics.
 There were giants in those days. Have we then lived since 1942 in an age of midgets? One problem is that the literature of modern science and technology has been almost impenetrable to people outside the priesthoods that speak the lingo. As a result, any reader less assiduous than John Updike may be unaware of books of profound importance.
 I recall a friend, an engineer, in the late 1940's having his nose buried in a book by Norbert Wiener titled "Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine." It was, said my friend, a work of vital importance because it foreshadowed a new age when computers would change society.
 A glance left no doubt I would find it as baffling as Babylonic cuneiform, but now I wonder: Could this have been the book that has most profoundly affected the thoughts and actions of our entire half-century? Or perhaps there is some absolutely essential and utterly mystifying text on the chemistry of plastics without which today's world would be entirely different.
And where is the great book that caused the collapse of Soviet Communism? In 1942 Oswald Spengler's "The Decline of the West" ranked high on the library's list. We smile now at that title, but where is our own half-century's equivalent: "The Collapse of the East"?
 Of course the 1942 list had its duds. "The Golden Bowl," a favorite of that year's great-book selectors, now feels like paralysis by syntax. By contrast, James Joyce's "Ulysses," which changed our way of seeing the world, got only one vote, while Ernest Hemingway and Marcel Proust got none.
 Have we had a Joyce, a Hemingway, a Proust working out there, changing our vision, profoundly affecting humankind? I am afraid to say no, so sneakily change the subject with an even more vital question. Was there any book these 50 years past that influenced humankind's thoughts and acts half so much as the dimmest television show?

HEADLINE: Our Treadmill Economy

BYLINE: By Alfred E. Kahn; Alfred E. Kahn, professor emeritus of political economy at Cornell, was President Jimmy Carter's adviser on inflation.

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
America's international financial standing seems better than it did six months ago, but we have not made significant progress in solving our fundamental economic problems.
When the sum total of our assets abroad and foreign claims on us were recalculated from their original cost to their present market value, our net international indebtedness at the end of 1990 turned out to be not the more than $600 billion previously reported but $361 billion. We also learned that in the first quarter, our trade balance showed a small surplus, the first surplus since 1982. 
 Considered alone, this is all good news. The foreign trade deficit has been dropping each year since 1987, when it peaked at $162 billion; it was $99 billion in 1990 and is expected to reach $50 billion this year.
The fact remains, however, that every year since 1982 we have bought more goods and services from the the rest the world than we have sold to it. Foreign countries have financed those deficits by acquiring claims on us such as Government securities, bank deposits and ownership of factories in this country.
That's not necessarily unhealthy. We don't assess a corporation's economic health by looking only at the liability side of its balance sheet. The question is whether in incurring liabilities it adds to assets.
Has America used the infusions of foreign capital to increase its national assets? The answer is distressing. Over the last four decades, the percentage of our gross national income devoted to consumption has increased steadily and frighteningly, from 58.5 percent in the 1950's to 64.6 percent in the 1980's.
During those decades, the percentage of the G.N.P. we've used to increase our assets has remained just about constant, and net business investment in plant and equipment dropped about 20 percent.
The increase in consumption has been balanced by a decline in Government purchases of goods and services, from 25.1 percent of the G.N.P. in the 1950's to 19.8 percent in the 1980's. But while these purchases were declining, transfer payments such as interest on the Federal debt and entitlement programs like Social Security have risen dramatically.
The percentage of the G.N.P. accounted for by Government outlays for investment -- on education, the infrastructure, research and development -- has dropped very sharply. It would have made perfectly good sense for all levels of government to have gone into debt to make such investments; it would make sense today. But that is not what we have been doing.
Instead, we have transformed ourselves from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor, not to prepare ourselves better for the future but to live better today.
When we look at the reasons for the sharp drop in our annual balance-of-payments deficits since 1987, again we find little ground for comfort.
The first was the economy's very sluggish growth in 1989 and 1990, followed by the recession -- not a healthy way to cut imports. Second, we received $23 billion from our allies in the first quarter of 1991 toward the cost of the gulf war -- no cause for rejoicing, unless we plan to go into the business of exporting troops as well as munitions to foreign governments.
The third reason for the drop in the balance-of-payments deficit has been the 35 percent decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. This means we have had to price our exports more and more cheaply, compared with what we pay for imports, as the net inflow of foreign capital has diminished.
A society that is unwilling to live within its means and that devotes a steadily decreasing portion of its income to saving and investment in physical plant, technology and people will inevitably be restrained once the flow of credit from the outside begins drying up. The restraint may be supplied by an increase in the prices it has to pay for its imports or by recession or depression or both.
That is exactly what has happened. We are now paying the price, in unemployment and in more and more families needing two wage earners to make ends meet. No wonder The Economist summarized the trends in our real incomes over the last 15 years under the headline "Running to Stand Still."

Magic Circle Opera Repertory Ensemble
Theater of the Open Eye at the West End Synagogue,
270 West 89th Street
Through tonight 
 With the recession nipping at the heels of many of New York's small opera companies, both commitment and a large measure of faith are required to start a new one. The Magic Circle Opera Repertory Ensemble, formed last year, has those qualities, and promising young singers as well. The group's triple bill of short 20th-century works, performed with piano accompaniment, opened on Thursday evening.
 The works, which were directed with a sensible simplicity by Jane Lind, were well suited to an ensemble of modest means: Samuel Barber's 10-minute "Hand of Bridge" requires only a table and a deck of cards. Gustav Holst's "Wandering Scholar" and Kenneth K. Guilmartin's "City of Gypsies" are nearly as spare.
In the Holst, the scholar of the title, trying to scare up some dinner, interrupts a tryst between a lecherous priest and a farmer's wife. He is sent on his way but returns with the farmer and repays his inhospitable hostess by pointing out the priest hiding in the haystack. The vocal quartet -- Mark Singer as the farmer, Michelle Couture as his wife, Glenn Braun as the priest and Ross Solomon as the scholar -- sang Holst's folk-tinged arias appealingly and with clarity of purpose.
The Barber, with a libretto by Gian Carlo Menotti, looks in on the private thoughts of two couples playing bridge: Sally obsesses about a hat; her husband, Bill, thinks about his mistress; Geraldine ruminates about her mother, and her husband, David, fantasizes about getting rich. Barber's music has an urbane, light-spirited jazziness that the singers seemed comfortable with. They were Madeline Tsingopoulos, Peter Castaldi, Mary Cidoni and Mr. Singer. Iris Savernik, a dancer, gave the individual fantasies a sense of dimension.
Mr. Guilmartin's "City of Gypsies," a 50-minute work composed in 1985, is a beguiling fantasy based on poetry by Federico Garcia Lorca, with the poet as its central figure. The music, richly chromatic with traces of flamenco figuration, creates a mysterious atmosphere that suits the Garcia Lorca poetry beautifully. And Mr. Guilmartin has arranged the texts as a coherent dramatic narrative that ends with Garcia Lorca's death.
The most notable singers in the large cast were Mr. Castaldi, whose portrayal of Garcia Lorca gave him greater opportunity than in the Barber to show off his attractive lyric tenor; Miss Cidoni, a powerful soprano, and Miss Couture and Miss Tsingopoulos, whose tandem choruses as the storytellers were especially alluring. Martha Wade's accompaniment was slightly heavy-handed in the Holst, but she caught the spirit of the Barber and the Guilmartin nicely.

HEADLINE: New Influx of Cuban Refugees Is Creating Strains for Florida

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 26

 BODY:
Almost daily, newspapers and television stations here tell of Cuban refugees plucked by planes or cruise ships from the Florida Straits as they bob along in rafts or inner tubes. But deteriorating conditions on the island have also provoked a much larger and virtually invisible emigration -- tourist charter flights from Havana -- that has begun to strain this city's resources.
 Because a growing number of Cubans are arriving here as visitors and overstaying their visas, Florida officials are pressing the Federal Government for access to $35 million placed in an Immigration Emergency Fund that was established after the last big influx of Cubans a decade ago. 
But to their frustration, so far the Bush Administration has refused to authorize release of any of the money, even as American and Cuban policies continue to encourage people to flee one of the last bastions of orthodox Communism.
 "It is unfair in the extreme to ask one community to bear the consequences of a national policy on refugees, just as it would be if there were an emergency brought on by a hurricane or flood," Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat, said recently in an interview. "A natural disaster is an act of God, but this immigration crisis is primarily an event controlled by the Federal Government."
 
Backlog of Visa Requests
 According to the State Department, which processed a total of 38,000 visa requests from Cuba in 1990, American diplomats in Havana have issued 36,000 visas since the 1991 fiscal year began Oct. 1 and still face a backlog of 28,000 applications. The figures include neither Cubans who have obtained visas at other embassies, like Caracas and Mexico City, nor the 1,378 Cuban rafters who have been officially admitted to the United States this year.
 No precise figures exist on how many of the Cuban tourists, whose airfares and processing fees are paid by relatives here, have overstayed their visas to settle in Miami. But Federal and local officials estimate, based on immigration and other statistics, that at least one-third of the visitors do not return to Cuba on their scheduled flights. This creates what Mr. Graham called "a silent, gradual influx" that has gone undetected because the Immigration and Naturalization Service's policy of not completely monitoring departures of foreigners from this country.
 "We're looking at an influx of approximately 40,000 people this calendar year," said Joaquin Avino, who as county manager is the chief government executive of Dade County, which includes Miami. "If we can put people on the moon, why can't we measure people going out?"
In May, the most recent month for which data are available, 7,600 Cubans arrived in Miami on chartered flights, as against 2,500 in May 1990. "The number of flights has increased, as has the size of the aircraft being used and the number of companies involved," said Antolin Carbonell, who tracks the situation for the Dade County Aviation Department.
 
Fears of a New Mariel
 Among local officials, the upsurge has led to fears of what they call "a new Mariel," a reference to the 1980 boatlift that brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States. The cost of assimilating that influx of asylum-seekers was borne largely by city, county and state governments here, and Florida officials say the Federal Government still owes them $50 million or more.
 The Miami area is already seeing "an increased demand for the whole spectrum of medical and social services, from job training to emergency housing" because of the new arrivals, Mr. Avino said. "If you suddenly put an additional 30,000 people in a community, that creates an additional stress on the fire department, the police department, the parks and public works."
 Government officials here said that whatever money they get from the Federal Government will be destined for hospitals, emergency housing programs and schools. Senator Graham, who plans to introduce legislation next week that would make it easier for Florida to obtain money from the fund, and other members of Florida's Congressional delegation are continuing to lobby both the White House and the Department of Justice.
 Leaders of the Cuban-American community and government officials expect the exodus to continue, perhaps at an even faster pace. Deprived of Soviet subsidies, Cuba is facing its worst economic crisis since Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, and his government has responded with increased political repression and a declaration of a "period of special austerity" that includes food and fuel rationing.
 As a safety valve, the Cuban Government has over the last 18 months gradually lowered to 35 from 65 the age at which Cuban men qualify to visit relatives in this country. Lisandro Perez, a professor of sociology at Florida International University who has studied Cuban emigration, said the younger Cuban arrivals who have grown up under Communism are likely to prove more difficult to absorb than previous waves of Cuban refugees because "their readiness for competition in the United States" is limited.
 Under existing legislation, both the President and the Attorney General have the power to declare an "immigration emergency," the latter when the number of requests for political asylum rises by 1,000 in any quarter. But many of the new arrivals apparently prefer to bypass the long and complicated asylum process in favor of a special adjustment program that exists only for Cubans, thereby keeping the number of asylum requests below the legal threshold.
 "We don't solicit political asylum claims," said Duke Austin, a spokesman for the immigration service. "That is not a function of the I.N.S." Mr. Austin also said it would be unfair to entering Cubans to deny them the right to the quicker and easier adjustment procedure "only to force the asylum numbers up just so a community can get the impact funds."
 
Dade County's Problems
 The new influx of Cubans comes as Dade County is still struggling to absorb a previous wave of politically inspired immigration that flooded the Miami area in 1989. County officials estimate that more than 100,000 Nicaraguans, the bulk of them anti-Sandinistas requiring public assistance, have settled in southern Florida in the last decade.
 The rapid increase of the Nicaraguan population in 1989 forced one major hospital here to write off more than $5 million dollars in health care bills and also led to an enrollment surge in the Dade County public school system. Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, has estimated the total long-term costs of settling just the Nicaraguans at more than $100 million.
 "We just can't continue to foot the bill," said Kate Hale, director of the Metro-Dade Office of Emergency Management. "There are Federal Government programs in place for just this type of situation, and we are frustrated by what appears to be the Federal Government's attempt to manipulate loopholes that preclude us from gaining access to funds designated for this purpose."

James Brown Is Up to His Old Tricks

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Here's a concept: write songs and arrangements, convene a band, rehearse it hard, take it into a big room and record it. It's been a long time since that was standard operating procedure for a rock album, now that producers are hooked on the convenience of machines and performers like to tinker with endless overdubs. But James Brown knows he made his best music that way. On "Love Overdue" (Scotti Brothers 79392 75225; all three formats), his first album since he was paroled from imprisonment for aggravated assault and weapons violations, he ignores high-tech pop fashion to make the funk he wants.
It's a wise choice, wiser than the one Aretha Franklin makes on her new "What You See Is What You Sweat" (Arista 8628; all three formats). Any pop performer whose career stretches into the decades, like Mr. Brown or Ms. Franklin, sooner or later has to decide whether to continually update the music -- to try and keep up with the market -- or to follow private instincts and see whether the public pays attention. In trying to stay contemporary, Ms. Franklin, one of America's greatest singers, has landed in a limbo somewhere between Whitney Houston and Patti Labelle. And while "Love Overdue" won't eclipse Mr. Brown's finest music of the 1960's and 1970's, its better songs prove he can still summon his old vitality. 
 In the past, Mr. Brown, who is probably in his early 60's, has tried keeping up. During the 1960's, he was a radical who redefined the rhythm of popular music; his genius for syncopation transformed mechanical, repeating riffs into pure motion, lean and unstoppable. He was reduced to billing himself as "the original disco man" in the late 1970's, although his kind of funk had more sophisticated polyrhythm than most disco. His big 1985 hit, "Living in America," produced by Dan Hartman, sounded like a freeze-dried, reconstituted version of what Mr. Brown had done better more than a decade earlier. Mr. Brown is billed as both producer and executive producer on "Love Overdue," as well as writer and arranger on four songs and arranger on a fifth; he's clearly in charge.
He doesn't care about being contemporary, although his strategy is appropriate; the rhythms of his old hits are now reappearing as the foundations of innumerable rap songs. On "Love Overdue," his own efforts look back to the mid-1960's and before -- not, oddly, his startling modal funk from the late 1960's and early 1970's, which inspired performers from George Clinton to Miles Davis to Prince. "Love Overdue" concentrates on rolling rhythm-and-blues akin to "Please, Please, Please" and chugging gospel-rock that recalls "I Got You (I Feel Good)."
When Mr. Brown returned to public performing with his pay-per-view television special in June, he made a public display of spirituality in a backstage prayer with the Rev. Al Sharpton. "Love Overdue" continues his overt gospel references. In "Move On," over chattering guitars and punching drums, Mr. Brown trades call-and-response vocals with a gospelly choir; the song is about wanting to change a frustrating life -- no job, a recession -- but it's easy to imagine Mr. Brown dancing down the aisle of a church as he announces, "I'm getting happy!"
"It's Time to Love" directs its love to the Christian trinity and holds a surprise; partway through, it breaks into a propulsive rumba, complete with vocals in Spanish. "Standing on Higher Ground," a song by Hollie Farriss and Danny Countess whose title is a gospel staple, seems to refer both to Mr. Brown's recent travails ("Once we were up/ Lately we been down") and to the gulf war ("We'll clean it up/ Trying to get peace to last"), before it invokes "the Good Book."
The easy rhythm-and-blues is reserved for love songs: "Show Me," written by Mr. Brown and his wife, Adrienne; "You Are My Everything," which has one odd jazzy chord at its peaks, and Henry Glover's "Teardrops on Your Letter," a bluesy song originally recorded by Hank Ballard. Mr. Brown sings it in husky, after-hours tones, answered by woozy horn and guitar riffs.
Mr. Brown's gift for drama is intact; "Teardrops" climbs from calm reflection to screams, and he drives the rhythms of "Move On" and "Higher Ground" with lung power, note bending and canny timing. His singing only sounds false in the songs by other writers that try to be more contemporary: "Dance, Dance, Dance to the Funk" and "Later for Dancing." The lyrics seem to embarrass him; he would rather be a pious elder statesman.
"Love Overdue" is a short album, just 36 minutes of music, and except for the salsa of "Standing on Higher Ground," it doesn't offer much that can't be found on the magnificent retrospective album "Star Time" (Polydor). But as a token of Mr. Brown's confidence and cantankerousness, it's heartening.
Ms. Franklin's "What You See Is What You Sweat" is as awkward as its title. Like Ms. Franklin's recent albums, it tacks a 1960's oldie -- this time, a sassy, jazzy version of Sly and the Family Stone's "Everyday People" -- onto a group of new pop songs, with name-brand guests as duet partners (Luther Vandross and Michael McDonald). Ms. Franklin is handed over to a grab bag of producers. There are dance-pop hitmakers like Elliot Wolff and Oliver Lieber (Paula Abdul) and diva-ballad auteurs like Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager, but they seem to have handed Ms. Franklin the rejects from other projects.
The Lieber-Wolff "Mary Goes Round," about a man-stealing woman, comes out of a high-school mentality that the 49-year-old Ms. Franklin has probably outgrown, while the ballad "Someone Else's Eyes" offers banal psychobabble. The overblown "I Dreamed a Dream" shamelessly devalues Martin Luther King's words with its spokenintroduction: "I had a dream."
Ms. Franklin also wrote two songs. She produced her "You Can't Take Me for Granted," which lilts along after its overblown intro, letting her voice soar over a gospelly backup choir; despite the harp glissandos, there's a glimmer of a relaxed, mature Franklin style that the rest of the album disowns. Her "What Did You Give," produced by Michel Legrand, goes awry from its first words -- in French -- to its strings and finger cymbals and synthesizers. Not that synthesizers per se are the problem; Luther Vandross's computer-driven "Doctor's Orders" is negligible, but at least it sounds like fun.
The frustrating thing is that Ms. Franklin can still sing like no one else; her voice swoops, curves, coos, growls, caresses. Amid the trendy and pretentious trappings, it's a beacon of emotion. Trying to keep up with the latest pop only holds her back.

A Shot of Cultural Adrenaline at Lincoln Center

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
Maybe it wasn't all that surprising that the management of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, after watching real-estate developers get rich for two decades by filling its neighborhood with high-rise apartments, would decide to get in on the act itself. After all, why shouldn't the institution whose real estate has made profits for so many others get a little something for its own balance sheet?
 Thus was born 3 Lincoln Center, 60 stories of black glass recently completed at the corner of 65th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, intended as the most upscale of the many upscale condominiums in the Lincoln Center neighborhood -- and the only one with the right to call itself an actual part of the performing arts complex. Three Lincoln Center, which has been marketed as "the first opportunity to live at Lincoln Center," is, like Museum Tower, which rose in 1983 over the Museum of Modern Art, a case of commerce being put to the service of art. 
 Like the museum, the tower was not constructed, nor is it owned, by the cultural institution that gives it its name. It is an entirely private development built on air rights over a portion of the center's land, bought for $48.5 million by a developer, the Stillman Group of Scarsdale. But in exchange for allowing the Stillman Group to sell condominiums with the Lincoln Center address, Lincoln Center got more than this hefty cash payment. The developer also agreed to put up the basic structure for a second new building, a 28-story, stone-clad tower containing dormitory rooms for the Juilliard School of Music, nine dance studios, rehearsal studios, new theaters for the Lincoln Center Film Society and the Lincoln Center Institute, a recital hall, and offices.
 This smaller tower, now being occupied, is a stunning addition to Lincoln Center, which has not expanded in any significant way since the completion of the original performing-arts complex in the late 1960's. Known as the Samuel B. and David Rose Building, this structure contains so much in the way of new facilities that it's not hard to see why the administration of Lincoln Center felt moved to make one of those Faustian pacts with the world of private real-estate development.
 A film theater, an experimental theater, dance studios, first-class dorm rooms to make Juilliard competitive with non-New York institutions -- all urgently needed, and what's the harm of another condominium tower? Small price to pay for a shot of cultural adrenaline .
 There's no real answer to this question of the values of such trade-offs, at Lincoln Center or elsewhere. We like to pretend that our cultural institutions are clean and pure, not sullied by their connections to commerce, and the presence of a tower like 3 Lincoln Center stands, like Museum Tower, as a constant reminder that they are not. Surely that is why buildings like this are troubling -- they force us to confront a reality we might prefer to ignore. When a corporation writes a check to a cultural institution, the process of subsidy is invisible; when support comes in the form of a real-estate deal, its results stare us in the face at every moment.
 And no one could greet with enthusiasm the notion that the Lincoln Center neighborhood needs another high-rise condominium. The presence of the taller of these two new buildings can't really be justified on urban-planning terms ; it's only a question of the trade-off. Is it worth squeezing a 60-story tower into this part of Manhattan to bring Lincoln Center some financial stability, and to give the center and its users a panoply of superb new facilities?
 Well, maybe. For now, let me say only that this trade-off, problematic though it may be, has been accomplished with considerable planning skill. The main credit goes to the architects, the firm of Davis, Brody & Associates, who were responsible for the overall plan and for the design of the Rose Building; Harman Jablin Architects designed the 3 Lincoln Center condominium tower.
 The $150 million Rose Building, which has been named for the founders of Rose Associates, the New York real-estate firm whose chairman, Frederick Rose, made the major gift toward its construction, serves as a base on which rises both its own shorter tower and the tall condominium tower. The two towers are altogether different in design, and therein lies the first of several thorny architectural problems.
 The architects were faced here with contradictory goals. The taller tower, 3 Lincoln Center, is the economic engine driving the whole project, but if the place was to make any sense symbolically it had to appear less conspicuous than the Rose Building, which, though much smaller, was more fully a part of Lincoln Center.
 Thus the Rose Building was sheathed in Minnesota stone, a cream-colored stone similar to the travertine of the original Lincoln Center buildings (which was not duplicated mainly because it has proved to stand up poorly to New York winters). From a short distance the stone seems virtually identical to the rest of Lincoln Center, and it allows the Rose Building to aspire to be campanile to the performing arts complex.
 The condominium tower is set slightly back, a bit farther from Lincoln Center Plaza, and it is sheathed in black glass, with some accents in red and others in stone to tie it subtly to the Rose Building. It doesn't quite disappear, to be sure, but it is about as deferential as a 60-story skyscraper can be. The corner facing Lincoln Center is sliced off at a 45-degree angle, a gesture that reduces the apparent bulk in a further act of deference.
 From a distance it all works, and the two buildings appear to be distinct and only distantly related. The black tower is the classiest condominium tower in the neighborhood, as befits Lincoln Center. The Rose Building tower is a solid-looking box, visually much more a part of Lincoln Center than of the overall West Side skyline.
 And to give it its due from close up, the design of the Rose Building does a lot to ameliorate some significant flaws in the original Lincoln Center design. Lincoln Center has always turned its back toward Amsterdam Avenue; this complex opens at least partially toward it. In the original design the pedestrian bridge over 65th Street was a bleak concrete wasteland; as part of this project Lewis Davis, the architect in charge, has redesigned the bridge, the plazas around it and the entire entrance sequence to Juilliard to make of all of this a viable urban presence.
 Alas, once you get beyond these urbanistic strengths there is not a lot of magic to this structure. On the skyline it is solid and workmanlike, but it is a triumph of architectural logistics much more than a triumph of architecture. In many ways the most interesting thing about this building is not its presence as an esthetic object but the brilliant intricacy with which the dance studios, auditoriums, rehearsal halls, dormitories and offices have been intertwined.
 This is a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle of a building. Every floor in the base is different, which is a tough enough architectural problem in itself. But not only were the spatial needs completely different, so were the clients, since each floor had what was, in effect, a different organization calling the shots -- the New York City Ballet for its segment, the Lincoln Center Film Society for its portion, for example. The architects seem to have pulled off a masterwork of diplomacy in getting it all to fit. And the result of this effort, if not the most striking event on the skyline, can only enrich and strengthen the city's cultural presence at a moment when the need could not be more urgent.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Office Market;
The Gloom Persists On Offices

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
CHEMICAL BANK had ardent suitors. George Klein hoped it would move to the office complex he plans to build at Times Square. Douglas Durst hoped it would move to a site that is mostly under his family's control, cater-corner from Bryant Park. Stanley Stahl hoped it would remain in his skyscraper at 277 Park Avenue.
The courtship ended this month in a striking twist that left the city's commercial landlords with one less headquarters for their rent rolls. Chemical will simply move its main offices across the avenue and into Manufacturers Hanover Plaza, which is owned by its merger partner. 
 It is not known yet whether the bank will vacate any or all of the 800,000 square feet it occupies at No. 277, between 47th and 48th Streets, when the merger takes effect. That space is under lease until July 1994.
But the consolidations within the merged bank, whose workforce is to shrink about 14 percent, will affect its extensive presence around the city. Some 70 branches will probably close and hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space could be thrown into an already glutted market.
Some 56.7 million square feet are now available in Manhattan, the Edward S. Gordon Company has found. That is as much space as in the entire office market of San Francisco. And it represents an increase of 5.5 million square feet -- the equivalent of two Empire State Buildings -- from this time last summer.
When will the market improve? It may take years, the optimists say. From where will the tenants come to support a rebound? No one is quite sure.
What confidence there is seems to based mainly on the certainty that markets are inherently cyclical; that if there are valleys, there will just as surely be peaks.
Today's valley is deep. The overall availability rate in Manhattan is 18 percent, Gordon's figures show. And that figure considerably understates the situation in two of the most troubled sub-markets: west midtown, which continues to sag from the weight of skyscrapers built before the West Side zoning incentives expired (but after the market had peaked), and the financial district, which is still feeling the effects of a devastated securities industry.
In the financial district, the vacancy rate is 24.4 percent, according to Gordon. On the West Side, the figure is 27 percent.
"The extended construction cycle and current contraction in demand could cause the vacancy rate to rise to nearly 19 percent before the market begins to bottom out by the mid-1990's," wrote Therese E. Byrne and David Shulman, in a recent analysis of the market, published by Salomon Brothers.
"IF we use the 1970's decline as a clock, we are only four years into a decline that could last as long as eight years," the Salomon report stated. "In terms of magnitude, as of year end, the contraction in financial-services employment is already equal to that of the 1970's. But we are not so optimistic as to think that the down cycle is over."
"Both Wall Street and banking are in the process of restructuring their activities," wrote Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. He noted that the financial-services sector had about 50,000 fewer jobs than three years ago -- with 60 percent of the decline coming from Wall Street firms and the rest from banking.
"The process continues with no end in sight," he said, "a shrinkage in jobs that reverberates throughout the economy."
"There's going to be no question about an abundance of sublease space available as a result of the mergers and consolidations," said Barry Gosin, president of Newmark Real Estate Services, which reports 56.2 million square feet of available space.
"However," Mr. Gosin said, "in the next six months to a year, there will be a lot of tenants making commitments to the city in significant blocks of space, as did Sony. For the next two to three years, we'll be muddling along probably at the same level."
Mr. Ehrenhalt shied away from predictions. "The forecasting track record," he said, "does not offer much in the way of precision. The economic crisis of the 1970's came unheralded by the forecasters, as did the resurgence that followed."
"The Rudins are betting on cycles," said Lewis Rudin, whose family real-estate concern owns nearly 7 million square feet of office space, about 9 percent of which is currently available. "There was the same mentality in 1974, 1975, 1976 -- that it's not going to happen anymore."
"The European mentality, the Far Eastern mentality, the South American mentality of the rich movers and shakers is that New York is the place to be," Mr. Rudin said, "because it's a cosmopolitan, international city. Why is Galeries Lafayette opening in New York? Why is Takashimaya building on Fifth Avenue? Why is Regent Hotel building on 57th Street? Those are the signs."
Indeed, the market is not entirely becalmed. James S. Vanderslice, of the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage, believes he has discerned the "first sign of revival" in mid-Manhattan. The vacancy rate dropped to 16.2 percent in June, from 17.4 percent in May. That is the first month-to-month drop since last October. "Significantly missing this month," he wrote, "was the addition of any major large blocks of space."
Even 1540 Broadway, whose emptiness is particularly noticeable because of its prominent position on Times Square, may be filling up. Ian Bruce Eichner, the developer of the 44-story skyscraper at 45th Street, said earlier this week that "there are major negotiations going on, as we speak, with two separate tenants that would commit to all or substantially all of the building."
The 860,000-square-foot skyscraper has been vacant more than a year. The lenders, Citicorp and a syndicate of Japanese banks, began a foreclosure proceeding about six months ago that is still pending.
The largest lease signed in June was by Katz Communications for 180,000 square feet at 125 West 55th Street, Harry Macklowe's new tower near the Avenue of the Americas.
The next largest lease was signed by Sun Life Insurance of America for 54,000 square feet in 733 Third Avenue, the Durst family's 31-year-old building at 46th Street. "We see the market becoming more active," Douglas Durst said. "It's not returning to the rents of a few years ago, but it is certainly returning to the activity of a few years ago."
Increased activity does not, however, necessarily mean decreased vacancy. The Park Avenue sub-market, for instance, experienced a slight increase in leasing in the first half of this year, compared to the same period in 1990; to 467,000 square feet, from 441,000 square feet. Nevertheless, so many big blocks became available that the net result was an increase of 885,000 square feet of vacant space, Gordon's figures show.
As Mr. Durst noted: "It's a lot of moving around. I don't see a great deal of additional absorption. I think we'll have to wait for the economy to improve a bit more for that."
"Obviously, the prospects for new office space are not very bright at the moment, so we feel that major moves will constitute a good chunk of work," said Richard M. Kielar, senior vice president of Tishman Realty & Construction Company.
As an example, he cited the recent deal between A.T.&T. and Sony USA, which is to lease the whole 674,000-square-foot tower on Madison Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets. It was built in 1982 as the telephone company's headquarters.
THE lease for the skyscraper, whose broken-pediment roof makes it one of the more distinctive on the skyline, begins Jan. 1, by which time A.T.&T. will have moved 1,100 employees who are now at 550 Madison to other buildings in New York City. The company has said it "will continue to maintain its headquarters" in New York.
At the time of development, A.T.&T. was given a 10-year property-tax abatement, valued at $42 million, by the city's Industrial and Commercial Incentive Board, with the understanding that the tower would be used as the phone company's headquarters and not rented. On July 8, as it confirmed the Sony deal, the company turned over a $14.5 million check to the city, representing the value of taxes forgiven since 1987.
It is too early to tell what Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover will do with their space once they merge under the Chemical name. But it is worth noting that they are spread through midtown and downtown.
Chemical has roughly 1.5 million square feet in 55 Water Street, at Old Slip, owned by the Reichmanns; 500,000 square feet in 95 Wall Street, at Front Street; 325,000 square feet (the entire building) in 52 Broadway, at Exchange Place; 250,000 square feet in 380 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets; 150,000 square feet in 633 Third Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets and 150,000 square feet in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, between 49th and 50th Streets.
Manufacturers Hanover owns its 1.4 million-square-foot tower (the former Union Carbide Building) at 270 Park Avenue, directly across from Chemical's headquarters, and Four New York Plaza, a 900,000-square-foot building at Water and Broad Streets. But it also leases 410,000 square feet in Two Grand Central Tower, 140 East 45th Street; 397,000 square feet in 450 West 33rd Street, at Tenth Avenue; 273,000 square feet in 130 John Street, at Water Street; 262,000 square feet in 40 Wall Street, near William Street and 124,000 square feet in 55 Water Street.
Another question hanging heavily is the fate of Morgan Stanley, which has yet to decide between staying in New York or moving to Stamford, Conn. Its main office is in 1251 Avenue of the Americas, between 49th and 50th Streets, It also has space in 1221 Avenue of the Americas, between 48th and 49th Streets; 1633 Broadway, between 50th and 51st Streets; 55 Water Street and One Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: When New York State Becomes a Stockholder

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
WHEN Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced this month that it was beginning construction of a new plant here, two ranking state officials were on hand for the occasion. The plant will manufacture drugs that Regeneron will be testing for the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's diseases, as well as for other nerve disorders.
Vincent Tese, the State Commissioner of Economic Development, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo came to the company's headquarters here to represent the state's $250,000 support of Regeneron, and to describe government investment techniques that are as up to date as the neuroscientific work being done by Regeneron researchers. 
 The state had not simply made a loan, Mr. Tese said. It had made an equity investment in Regeneron, "and we now own 80,000 shares of your stock."
He got a laugh when he added: "During the recent budget negotiations the asset looked so good, some of the legislators wanted to cash in. But not us. We know when we have a good investment."
 
'Little Piece of the Action'
 Mr. Cuomo said the state had never previously made equity investments. "But recently we took a piece of a baseball stadium in Buffalo," he said. "Our deal is, we'll put up the money but we're going to take a little piece of the action; so if you get a franchise, we want the profit.
"The profit would not be for us: the state can't declare dividends. But we can use the money for people who are disabled. Or have more money to invest in the next Regeneron, and the one after that."
Addressing the scientists who had gathered for the occasion, Governor Cuomo said: "We want you to return the money we lend to you. And we want profits and dividends, too, if they are there to be had."
He twitted Mr. Tese for suggesting a reluctance to sell the state's Regeneron stock. "I ought to explain that we also invested in Clestra," Governor Cuomo said, referring to a high-technology company in Syracuse. "Clestra stock went to the moon, but Tese bailed out early."
In fact, the state made a handsome profit on the Clestra investment, receiving $185,000 for its $90,000 investment. Clestra produces contained environments for sterile assembly procedures and will provide technology for Regeneron's new plant here.
 
State's 'High-Tech Squad'
 Clutching a mock stock certificate representing the state's 80,000-share investment in the pharmaceutical company, Mr. Cuomo said, "We're not going to make that mistake with Regeneron."
The executive director of the New York State Science and Technology Foundation, H. Graham Jones, described Regeneron as typical of the companies the foundation had sought to help through its "hi-tech squad," the Corporation for Innovation Development. "We try to get industry and universities to work closer, help technology-based industry get started and keep the companies in New York State, all of it while maintaining an informal investment limit of $250,000 per company," Mr. Jones said. The corporation has invested more than $10 million in 46 companies since 1983, and has drawn an additional $49 million in matching grants from private investors.
In one sense, Regeneron represented a risk for the state because "in the bio-tech field, they either click or they don't," Mr. Jones said. "This one has clicked; it seems to have a magic touch. The company doesn't even have a product yet and they're attracting investments from all over."
Three years ago Regeneron consisted of Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, now its president and chief executive, and three associates working in a former superintendent's apartment with buckling floors on York Avenue in Manhattan. Today, with 109 researchers among its 122 employees, it occupies space previously filled by the Union Carbide Corporation in a scientific/industrial park on Old Saw Mill River Road.
 
State Support Called Crucial
 Union Carbide, with corporate headquarters in Danbury, started building the Tarrytown site in 1959. Six years ago it sold the complex, leasing back about half the space for three divisions still functioning here. Edward B. Harris, director of administration for Union Carbide's Tarrytown site, said that Regeneron was one of a dozen companies renting space.
The state's support in 1988 was crucial, Dr. Schleifer said, enabling the fledgling company to resist bids from the high-technology centers near Boston and in Silicon Valley near San Francisco.
"We were also being wooed to go to Texas, where we could have had all the land we wanted almost for nothing," he said. "But we thought New York had a great environment, and the fact that there were not a lot of biotechnology companies was a tremendous advantage to us, because those people really interested in doing this sort of thing would not have to relocate great distances. So we sort of captured the local market, which is quite extensive."
Albany's support also generated $5 million in matching funds from private investors and that was followed by links with two major companies. In 1989, the giant Sumitomo Chemical Company of Japan bought $4.4 million of Regeneron stock and paid $5.6 million for product development. Last fall a biotechnology company in California, Amgen, made an investment commitment of up to $53 million in Regeneron over the next five years.
When Regeneron became a publicly traded company in April, it raised $99 million on its first trading day, the second largest amount ever raised by a biotechnology company in its initial public stock offering. (The largest amount, $115 million, was raised by the Cetus Corporation in 1981.) This pleased but did not surprise Dr. Schleifer, who speaks of his company as taking a new approach to developing drugs that could alleviate the symptoms, if not cure the diseases, that affect the nervous systems of 6.5 million Americans.
 
Maintaining Nerve Cells
 "The pharmaceutical industry has tended to focus on small molecules, which work to a limited extent, but which do not act to promote the survival of a nerve cell," he said. "Traditional drugs are designed to replace the natural molecules, called neurotransmitters, which nerve cells use to communicate between themselves. Regeneron's product candidates are nerve growth proteins, which act to maintain the vitality of the nerve cells themselves."
In the case of Parkinson's disease, for example, neurons in the brain carrying a substance called dopamine degenerate and die, resulting in a lack of coordination, trembling and rigidity. Current drugs mimic or enhance dopamine, reducing the symptoms of the disease, but over time the brain responds less and less to the increased dopamine and the patient's condition worsens.
These therapies do not treat the underlying causes of Parkinson's, which are not known. But in animal cells in the test tube, Regeneron has shown that a growth factor for nerve cells -- which they call BDNF, for brain-derived neurotrophic factor -- can promote the survival of the dopamine-carrying neurons that degenerate in Parkinson's.
 Articles in two leading scientific journals recently described discoveries made independently by two groups of researchers, at Regeneron and at the University of Southern California. Both used BDNF, which was first isolated in 1989 by two scientists at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Dr. Hans Thoenen and Dr. Yves Barde.
When the Regeneron researchers added BDNF to brain cells in a test tube, they discovered that it stimulated the cells affected in Parkinson's disease. BDNF was also found to protect those cells from being killed by MPTP, a toxic drug that causes symptoms of Parkinson's disease in laboratory animals.
 
Brain Cells May Be Dormant
 Parkinson's experts are especially interested in the new findings because of evidence that many cells in the brains of Parkinson's patients are dormant or dying, not dead.
Dr. Jesse Cedarbaum, a neurologist who is program director of the clinical affairs group at Regeneron, said the company's advisory team included three Nobel Prize winners: Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein, for their work in cholesterol metabolism, and Arthur Kornberg, for work involving genetic codes.
The discovery stage is followed by "producing for research," which Dr. Cedarbaum said was being done in existing quarters but would be transferred to the new plant. Research-level production is followed by laboratory experiments and then the clinical trial stage.
This last step requires a go-ahead from the Federal Drug Administration and has three phases: administering the drugs to a small number of patients to learn how safe the drug is and how it is tolerated; expanding the patient group to 200 to determine dosages; and, finally, using thousands of patients.
"After that, you can request approval to market the drug," Dr. Cedarbaum said. The first of the test phases can take six months to one year; the other two can last one to two years each.
"In light of AIDS," he said, "the F.D.A. has promulgated fast-track regulations to compress the process from five years to two or three years for diseases where there is no treatment and which are fatal or severely debilitating.
"That's something we're hoping to do for the sake of patients suffering from diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, for which no effective treatment currently exists."

Too Early to Ski But Not to Save

 BODY:
While visitors to the Berkshires of western Massachusetts sweltered in the heat this month, one of the region's ski areas announced a 20 percent discount on season passes for next winter. The offer was from Jiminy Peak in Hancock, which said the discount is available to skiers who purchase their passes by Tuesday. Season passes are available for weekends, midweek and night skiing as well as combinations of these periods. For a ski-anytime season pass, individuals will pay $394; the prices then gradually rise until Nov. 16, when it is $492. Two adults in a family will pay $675 instead of the Nov. 16 price of $844 and a family of five will pay $1,342 instead of $1,677. The area described the discounts as a response to "tough economic times." Passes can be purchased at Jiminy Peak's main ticket office or by telephone, (413) 738-5500, with a credit card. The number of weekend passes is being limited to 900.

Susan Sloan, Antiques Guide Publisher

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO

 BODY:
Susan Sloan is convinced that undiscovered treasures are sitting in antiques shops all over New England. The trick, she says, is to look beyond the quilts and weathervanes.
"There is wonderful potential for discoveries if you look for items outside the scope of Americana, like continental and Asian antiques," said Miss Sloan, author of "Sloan's Green Guide to Antiquing in New England." "A lot of trade was done here in previous centuries." 
 Miss Sloan, who is 46 years and a former administrator at a Chicago options arbitrage firm, began publishing her annual guide in 1989, two years after moving to Boston. An enthusiastic collector of antique silver, she was dismayed that there was no comprehensive guide to antiquing in New England. So she decided to write one.
In 516 pages, her 1991-92 guide describes 2,500 dealers, auction houses, antiquarian booksellers and flea markets. It also has a calendar of antiques shows, itineraries for antiquing tours, maps and profiles of major art and antiques institutions.
Miss Sloan, who is working on the 1992-93 guide, to be published Nov. 15, said three distinct trends are shaping New England's antiques business: the region's sluggish economy has forced a number of dealers to band together in multiple-dealer shops; more and more collectors are bypassing dealers and buying directly at auction; and flea markets are proliferating.
The current guide, priced at $14.95 and distributed by Globe Pequot Press, is sold at bookstores nationwide. It can also be ordered for $17.95, including postage and handling, from the Antique Press, 9 Brimmer Street, Boston, Mass. 02108; telephone (800) 552-5632.

HEADLINE: The Economy Lives, but Will It Ever Dance Again?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
It May Be a Recovery, But It's Less Than Robust
The recession is over and the recovery is here, according to everyone from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to New York real estate agents. But hold the bubbly and break out the beer. Most economists expect the kind of slow, shuffling climb that will cause many to wonder if the recovery will stick around come Labor Day. 
 "The indicators are mixed in any recovery," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic consulting service. "The weaker the recovery, the greater the proportion of negative reports." Indeed, the news last week that the gross national product grew at a trivial 0.4 percent in the spring fanned fears that the recovery was sputtering.
 The economists at DRI/McGraw-Hill are a shade more upbeat than the blue-chip consensus of economic forecasters. Even so, they expect the economy to expand at a 3.5 percent rate over the next year -- a crawl compared with the 6.5 percent average for the first year of any post-war recovery.
Three forces will probably hold down the pace of recovery. One is a hawkish Federal Reserve and an Administration that has not seemed inclined to bolster the economy with tax cuts or job programs. Another is the legacy of shaky debts from the overbuilding in many of the nation's commercial real estate markets. Finally, there is no 1980's-style consumer spending spree on the horizon: Households are forming more slowly and saving is already low.
 
A Battle of Nerves - The Consumers', That Is
 In retrospect, the first stirrings of a recovery began last winter, only a month or two after the Bush Administration, the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund had declared a recession. Though the economy was free-falling, hundreds of thousands of jobs were disappearing each month and the headlines were dire, the forces that first tipped the economy into recession were beginning to recede.
Alan Greenspan drove down short-term interest rates. Long-term rates eased as well. The money supply, which had barely increased during the fall, took off. Oil prices plunged, taking inflation down with them. The consumer price index, which spurted at a 10 percent rate in October, actually fell in March.
Most important, the Persian Gulf war ended in victory for the United States. Foreigners snapped up the dollar and investors celebrated by sending the war-bludgeoned stock market back to old highs.
Because this recession, more than any in memory, was brought on by a case of nerves, a brightening in consumer spirits was critical. Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait caused the biggest one-month plunge in American consumer confidence that had appeared the survey's history. When oil prices surged after the invasion, consumers expected a repeat of the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, a surge in inflation and deep recession.
Their fears were self-fulfilling. Consumers stopped buying big-ticket items that could be postponed, namely houses and cars, and business panicked too, cutting production last fall at an even faster rate than sales were declining. The better economic mood, in essence, set the stage for a reversal of fortunes.
 
And It's All Coming Out of the Saving Rate
 Consumers, who dragged the economy into the recession, appear to be pulling it out again. That's the indication from Friday's G.N.P. report for the second quarter.
After falling for two consecutive quarters -- one of the worst retrenchments in post-World War II history -- consumer spending rose at a robust 3.6 percent. Outlays for big-ticket items jumped even faster, by 5.2 percent. "The mood shift led to strong consumer spending, particularly on cars, furniture and other durables whose purchases were postponed when consumers thought the sky was falling, " Mr. Brinner said.
Spending bottomed out in January, the month the air war against Iraq began and oil prices plunged. Despite the fact that companies were cutting deeply into their payrolls, consumer spending rose in February as employees' worries about layoffs lifted.
First to recover was home buying. As mortgage rates dipped below 10 percent, housing became more affordable than at almost any time in more than a decade. By February, buyers were straggling back to car dealers' lots, and the traffic really picked up when manufacturers started offering better deals in May and June. Consumers began buying a little more of everything else, too, though the pattern has been erratic from month to month.
Initially, consumers were not spending because they were any flusher. One indication: Consumers, whose income was falling or stagnant, managed to do more shopping by saving even less of their take-home pay. The saving rate has slipped to less than 4 percent recently, from around 5 percent last summer.
 
So When Will Mores Hands Be Put to Work?
 Consumers may have the will to keep on spending. All they need is the way -- fatter wallets. That will depend on the prospects for jobs and inflation.
As in past recessions, the labor market has been the last to show signs of improvement. When consumers started spending again, businesses did not immediately rev up production and rehire laid-off workers. Instead, companies filled orders by dipping into stocks on shelves and in storerooms -- to the tune of a $21.2 billion annual rate this spring, not much less than in the fall and winter. Industrial production did not turn up until April. Even then, businesses relied on on overtime, not extra hands, to churn out the goods.
Companies finally started to add to their payrolls, but not until May. Payroll employment swelled by 119,000 that month, the first increase since last summer, before falling by 50,000 in June. If that net expansion is not revised away in next week's employment report, said Mr. Brinner, the recession's final month may well turn out to have been April.
A slow recovery is likely to mean, among other things, that job growth will be less robust than after the 1981-82 recession. DRI/McGraw-Hill expects the number of payroll jobs to grow just 1 percent next year, compared with 2.6 percent in 1989. And the forecasters do not see the unemployment rate, which reached 7 percent in June, dropping below 6 percent until after 1992.
The number of jobs is likely to grow more slowly for another reason. As the continuing stream of layoff announcements shows, companies in the defense, computer and service industries from banking to airlines, are cutting payrolls, consolidating operations and pushing fewer workers to produce more products.
The good news is that income, especially wages, has been edging up since March. And DRI/McGraw-Hill's forecast is for income after inflation to advance at an average 1.5 percent annual rate.

HEADLINE: All About/Baby Formula;
Price-Fixing and Other Charges Roil a Once-Placid Market

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
For decades, infant formula was a placid, magisterially profitable industry with a captive market of newborns. It operated pretty much out of the public eye. But all that has changed dramatically.
Now, formula makers are routinely referred to by critics as an "oligopoly." Two giants, Abbott Laboratories and Bristol-Myers Squibb, share almost 85 percent of the market. They and the handful of companies who divide what's left stand accused of a variety of misdeeds and sharp practices, ranging from undermining infant health to price-fixing and bid-rigging to gouging the Government to unfair marketing tactics. 
 The industry steadfastly denies charges of collusion and is sanguine about its future.
"We look at formula and breast-feeding as complementary," said Robert C. Gelardi, executive director of the Infant Formula Council, an Atlanta-based trade association. "There will be a need for formula."
Analysts say that Government investigations into price-fixing and the introduction of competitive bidding for Government contracts in recent years have cut into the 25 percent profit margins the companies in the $1.7 billion industry were once thought to have made on formula. But infant formula remains a steady source of cash for manufacturers and analysts believe a recent lurch in profits is most likely over.
"The damage is done and it is lasting, but the negative trend is now factored into growth rates and profit margins," Neil Sweig, a formula industry analyst at Brenner Securities in New York, said of the impact of competitive bidding for business with the Agriculture Department's Women, Infant and Children nutrition program. "It is still very profitable," he added.
 
The Basic Game
Getting Parents To Pay $500 a Year
 Baby formula, for the most part, is modified cow's milk with nutrients added, although there are some soy-based products for infants who are allergic to cow's milk.
A tiny part of the market comprises specialty formulas for babies with serious digestion problems. Most formula comes in "ready-to-feed," concentrated and powdered form. A 32-ounce, ready-to-feed typically costs about $3.00 in a supermarket.
For all the emotional attachment parents often have for their baby's formula, nutritionally the major brands are virtually identical; their contents are regulated by the Infant Formula Act of 1980.
The largest formula maker, with 50 percent of the market, is Ross Labs, a unit of Abbott Labs, which makes Similac and Isomil, a soy-based formula. Second, with about 35 percent, is Mead Johnson Nutritionals, a Bristol-Myers unit which makes Enfamil.
Wyeth-Ayerst, a unit of American Home Products that makes Nursoy and SMA, follows with 9 percent. Two companies share most of the remaining market: Carnation, the Nestle unit that sells Good Start, and Gerber, which markets a formula made by Bristol-Myers.
Demographics keeps the industry grounded in reality: the driving force of the business is the birth rate, and since the baby boom ended in 1964, the rate has only spiked up once or twice, creating evanescent boomlets. But the industry also tends to respond heavily to social change. The widespread acceptance of infant formula by women in the United States began with the rise of scientific medicine in the early part of the 20th century. In the belief that feeding babies was too complicated and important to be left to laypeople like mothers, medical practitioners touted scientifically concocted formula, given in sterilized bottles.
Breast-feeding declined for several decades and bottomed out in 1970, when fewer than 20 percent of new mothers were breast-feeding their infants. A surge of research since the late 1960's, however, convinced pediatricians that mother's milk is the "optimum" food for infants.
"There is evidence it protects against infection. It obviously has a psychological value. And it is economical," said Dr. Antoinette Parisi Eaton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. "It costs about $500 a year to feed an infant on formula."
The pediatrics community has managed to reverse the decline in breast-feeding -- in the early 70's, it began to trend back up, and by the early 80's, nearly half of the newborn population was being breast-fed. But the increased entry of women into the work force has slowed the trend, to the benefit of the formula industry.
"More moms are working moms. They may stay home with the baby, but when they go back to work, the majority wean them off breast milk and start them on a formula," said Jeffrey Isaacs, director of research at Robert Everszcq & Associates, a market research firm in Los Angeles. A.A.P. research indicates that breast-feeding has dipped to 45.6 percent.
 
Marketing
Loyal Customers, Two Approaches
 The physicians' preference for breast-feeding creates a marketing problem for the industry: how to position a slightly-less-than-optimal product.
The three leaders -- Abbott, Bristol-Myers and American Home -- market directly to physicians or hospitals, who usually give the formula free to mothers. The strategy works: research shows that 90 percent of women stick with the brand the hospital gives them. "We don't do consumer promotion," said Cathy Babington, a spokeswoman for Abbott Labs, in an oblique reference to the new and controversial practice of marketing directly to nursing women, which the industry giants oppose.
Industry leaders can remain aloof from the vulgar area of consumer marketing, in part, because of their market dominance. Three years ago, Carnation began advertising its weaning-formula entry into the market directly to consumers.
"It was a shock to the physician community," said Mr. Isaacs, the market researcher.
The move helped precipitate soul-searching by such organizations as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which decided not to accept contributions from companies that market directly to consumers. "We oppose direct marketing because of our concern that it will adversely affect the decision to breast-feed," said the A.A.P.'s Dr. Parisi Eaton.
Gerber followed with its own ads in 1989, and the two companies did indeed manage to gain a share of the market, albeit with minimal effect on the shape of the market.
Carnation says it is simply giving women -- the decision-makers on infants feeding -- information and choices: the ads commend breast-feeding as the best form of infant nutrition, but also offer formula as the alternative when breast-feeding is difficult or not the mother's choice.
 
Public Money
Some Competition Is Creeping In
 Part of infant formula's enormous profitability is the result of its involvement in the the special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known for short as WIC, an Agriculture Department nutrition program for low-income women and their children.
Although definitive figures are not available, at least one analyst estimates that the WIC program accounts for 40 percent of the formula market. For many years, in the relaxed regulatory atmosphere of the Reagan Administration, the leading formula makers quietly sold their products through state-administered programs -- at retail prices.
Since 1986, however, several states have instituted competitive bidding for rebates, with varying degrees of resistance from the formula industry. It is the companies' contention that the dependence on a single supplier developed in the competitive bidding process diminishes freedom of choice for poor women.
The bidding controversy focused attention on the industry's pricing strategies. Between 1980 and mid-1991, infant formula producers more than doubled their prices. During the period, formula prices have gone up an average of 11 percent a year, while the price of milk has risen an average of just 2 percent annually, according to a study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, a group that studies poverty-related issues. For its part, the industry contends that milk is only a small part of steeply rising production costs.
An investigation of pricing policies is pending at the Federal Trade Commission. All the companies deny engaging in collusion.
The revenue impact of competitive bidding on formula makers is impossible to determine because the companies don't break down financial data by unit. But after an initial shock, analysts say, the companies adjusted to the new order.
There is no question, as some feared, that WIC will be left without providers or that the giants will drop formula. "The companies are forever tied to this business," said Neil Sweig at Brenner Securities.
 
 
 
NESTLE -- BATTLING THE BOYCOTTS
 The consumer boycott of Nestle S.A. ended in 1984 with the multinational company's compliance with the World Health Organization's guidelines on marketing infant formula. And activists relaxed for the first time since the boycott began in 1977.
But the rest period didn't last long. Almost immediately, according to its critics, Nestle, the world's biggest infant formula maker with 50 percent of the overseas market, began backing off on its promises. In 1988, the boycott was called again.
"It was reinstituted to finish what we started," said Nancy Gaschott, a consultant for Action for Corporate Accountability, a group based in Minneapolis and New Haven that took over from Infact, the Infant Formula Action Coalition, which had gone on to other issues.
Critics argue that Nestle routinely violates several provisions of the World Health Organization's infant feeding codes, which were formulated to promote breast-feeding as the healthiest way of delivering infant nutrition.
The practice of distributing formula to mothers in the hospital, which is widespread in the United States as well as in developing countries, is a particular concern. Critics believe that formula given with the imprimatur of a hospital encourages women to choose bottle-feeding over breast-feeding -- to the detriment of their children.
"Children in developing countries live in very insulting life situations," said Doug Johnson, the consumer activist who founded Infact and is now the board chairman of A.C.A. "Water is often unavailable or contaminated. It is virtually impossible to sterilize bottles. Formula tends to be overdiluted. Children are not getting the nutrition they need." But Nestle regards infant formula as essential. "In developing countries, mothers do have to go out to work. They must supplement breast milk," said Dr. Thad Jackson, director of issues management at Nestle.
The boycott's financial impact on the $36 billion company is virtually impossible to calculate. Nestle says it is nil and that the company is working with the World Health Organization and the United Nation's Children's Fund to support healthy infant feeding practices. "We should be working together to provide the best options for vulnerable mothers instead of fighting," said Dr. Jackson.
But activists have forced Nestle to the table before. And this month, the boycott got a lift from an influential quarter: the Church of England joined in.

A Victory -- Perhaps -- for the Baby Bells 

 The Baby Bells are on the verge of winning the right to lose as much money on information services as they want. On Thursday, a Federal judge lifted a ban that has kept the regional Bell companies from bringing electronic yellow pages, banking, shopping and news into the nation's homes. The judge, Harold H. Greene, acting reluctantly at a higher court's direction, warned that the Baby Bells could turn their dominance of local phone service into information service monopolies. Maybe so, but, if the ruling stands on appeal, the companies will enter a business where Sears, I.B.M. and several media companies have lost millions. The phone companies do have the advantage of a line into every home, said Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber. "But you have to be careful and not get carried away in fantasyland here," he said. "The only thing we know for sure is there are going to be a lot of up-front costs." The most likely winner: A.T. &T., already the Baby Bells' largest supplier and now also the owner of NCR's technology for bank, airline and other computerized transactions.
 
Cyborg Wants Better Billing
 
Wait 'til Arnold Schwarzenegger's agent hears about this: a cyborg paid at a higher rate than the star. At Industrial Light and Magic, 35 computer animators spent 10 months producing images of the T-1000 cyborg for the movie "Terminator 2: Judgment Day." I.L.M., a very special special-effects shop owned by George Lucas, the movie producer, received at least $5 million for the job, while Mr. Schwarzenegger is said to have earned at least $12 million. But the computer-generated cyborg spends only about five minutes on screen -- at $1 million a minute -- and Mr. Schwarzenegger about two hours, leaving him with just $100,000 a minute. The cyborg was evidently programmed with a fine knowledge of Hollywood deal-making. In future films, I.L.M. promises to seek better billing as well as bigger bucks.
 
 The Sidewalk Tunnel Network
 
As most areas of construction are crawling out of the recession, one specialty appears strong. Sidewalk tunnels, to shield pedestrians from construction, renovation and crumbling facades, keep going up and over everywhere, especially in New York. At this rate, it might soon be possible to walk from Wall Street to Washington Heights in a downpour without an umbrella. With other projects scarce, architects and designers are taking the time to giving some canopies a more appealing look; postmodernists like to mimic arches and moldings from the buildings behind. Critical acclaim sometimes follows. The American Institute of Graphic Arts has recognized two sidewalk tunnels, including one, crowned by a colorful jumble of boxes, so fitting in front of a new Crate & Barrel store that the shop owners could do worse than to leave it up.
 
Kuwait: Back in the Oil Business
 
Oil is about to trickle from Kuwait, and possibly Iraq. The Kuwaitis have doused enough flaming wells to resume exports, although slowly at first. And the Bush Administration publicized a plan last week to ease a ban on Iraqi sales of petroleum. Reports of starvation and disease have persuaded some American officials that the restrictions are hurting the Iraqi people more than President Saddam Hussein. With other nations pumping more to compensate for Iraq and Kuwait, many in the oil industry say that renewed exports by these Persian Gulf foes can only push prices down further. Gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, have already fallen to historic lows.
 
The Unimpressive Recovery
 
The road to recovery may be bumpy, but economists generally do not expect another dip. A report last week that the G.N.P. grew four-tenths of 1 percent during the second quarter -- "kind of blah," said Samuel D. Kahan of Fuji Securities -- brought more shrugs than scowls. Industrial production, housing and trade numbers the week before were all more encouraging. Businesses are cautiously selling off their inventories, retarding growth now but reducing the prospect of production cuts later.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Building a Better Soviet Car
 
Millions, perhaps a billion, in Western currency is only part of what the Soviet Union hopes to earn from selling at least 30 percent of its largest auto maker. Under a plan announced last week, Moscow also wants help in building better cars.. The Lada sedans made by the Volga Automotive Plant Association ride as rough as second-class bunks on Soviet trains. "Once you open the country up to all sorts of communications and knowledge, you can't keep producing 1936 Packards," said Herbert S. Levine of the University of Pennsylvania. The auto maker will be the first major Soviet company to sell a large stake to foreigners. Don't look for many other large businesses to follow; few would attract such strong foreign interest.
 
The Soviet Union surprised its Western industrialized friends by applying for full membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank just a week after winning their backing for a more limited association with these agencies. American officials reacted as if guests invited for drinks had suddenly blurted out, "Well, what's for dinner?"
 
China's Trade Status
 
China, the largest importer of United States wheat and a major exporter of textiles, is likely to keep its trade privileges. A bill restricting trade with China failed to gain enough Senate votes to overcome a likely veto.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
NCNB Lures C&S, Finally
 
After his first bid for C&S failed in 1989, Hugh L. McColl Jr., NCNB's chief executive, denied that his hard-charging style had clashed with Bennett A. Brown's more countrified ways. Told that Mr. Brown, the C&S chief, prided himself on his backyard barbecues, Mr. McColl said, "I hope I'm invited." Last week, Mr. Brown and his board finally agreed to serve Mr. McColl. C&S, now called the C&S/Sovran Corporation, will be merged into NCNB in a $4.3 billion stock swap. The resulting institution, dubbed Nationsbank, will be America's third largest, with assets of about $116 billion, dominant by far in Texas and the Southeast. Mr. McColl, trying hard to sound chummy, said that most of the company's cutbacks would come through attrition. But C&S/Sovran employees will find that working for this former marine is no picnic. He plans to immediately fly in his NCNB platoons to attack C&S/ Sovran's troubled loans.
 
Detroit's Losses, as Predicted
 
The Big Three auto makers together lost more than $1.3 billion in the second quarter, but that was no worse than expected. Still too many auto plants, too few buyers. Industry analysts say the companies will continue suffering from the ravages of the recession for many more months to come. Like losing baseball teams, the auto makers are already predicting a stronger season in 1992.
 
Flight of the 'Vulture Fund'
 
 Three partners who had managed a Goldman, Sachs "vulture fund," which bought securities of troubled companies and then pressured the companies to restructure, are flying to other fields. Goldman had decided to wind down their Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund after the firm's predatory behavior made some clients nervous. Alfred C. Eckert 3d and Mikael Salovaara are forming their own vulture fund, while Kenneth D. Brody plans to concentrate on private investments, charities and Democratic politics.
Computer Makers' Lucky Losses
 Computer makers are finding few better ways to support their stock than confessing to all their troubles. Unisys and Digital Equipment shares jumped last week after the companies announced heavy cutbacks and billion-dollar charges. The Unisys Corporation said on Tuesday it was taking a $1.2 billion charge against second-quarter earnings, for a total loss of $1.3 billion, and laying off 10,000 of 70,000 employees. On Thursday, Digital came in with a $1.1 billion charge, resulting in an $871 million loss, and plans for laying off more of its 121,000 employees. Years ago, said George Elling, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, major write-offs caused shares to plummet. Now, he said, "everyone thinks they're wonderful, and the larger the better; it's a strange phenomenon." Analysts are far more optimistic that Digital's pains will prove therapeutic, restoring profitability.
 
Delta Is the Favorite
 
Wall Street is still betting on Delta Air Lines to succeed in buying European routes and the shuttle from Pan Am World Airways. Trans World Airlines bid $310 million last week to Delta's $260 million, but T.W.A. has only narrowly avoided following Pan Am into bankruptcy. The Delta bid is "real money," said Thomas Longman, an analyst at Bear Stearns, "and creditors can see cash in the near future."
 
B.C.C.I's Concealed Losses
 
British regulators said the Bank of Credit and Commerce International resorted to bribery and phony loans -- "probably one of the most complex deceptions in banking history" -- to conceal billions in losses. American and British officials fended off accusations that they had responded too slowly to the scandal.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
How the Dollar Spells Relief

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
This month's break in the dollar's rally could offer some relief to global investors, even if the pause is brief.
For starters, the decline in the dollar will help the German Bundesbank, which is struggling with rising inflation, and could also take some pressure off interest rates throughout the rest of Europe. 
 German consumer prices rose 4.5 percent over the last year, the highest increase since the 12 months ending in December of 1982, according to a preliminary report released by the German Government on Friday. A stronger mark would lower import prices in Germany, easing some of the pressure on the inflationary front. This is not likely to mean a near-term cut in rates there, but it could delay or reduce any increase. And it could prompt action elsewhere in Europe by giving countries like France and Britain more maneuverability than the Germans in reducing interest rates. Since the dollar began to fall, Britain has cut rates once.
For the international investor, a weaker dollar and the potential for lower interest rates abroad could make the United States stock and bond markets a little less attractive while enhancing the appeal of Europe and even Japan. The falling dollar means Europeans' American investment gains are worth less when converted into their home currencies. For Americans, the opposite is true. Investments abroad get a little lift when translated back into dollars.
The decline in the dollar started with an ambush in mid-July of aggressive and orchestrated dollar selling in the foreign exchange market by central banks in Europe and the United States. It weakened further because of disappointing economic data, which has raised concern that the American recovery will be very weak. Indeed, on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation, rose four tenths of one percent in the second quarter, at the low end of expectations. And durable goods orders in June fell an unexpected 1.6 percent.
After rising 27 percent against the German mark since early February to a high of 1.84 marks two weeks ago, the dollar has dropped 5 percent, closing on Friday at 1.7440 marks.
And there's no consensus on its outlook. Guy Rigden, director of strategy at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, thinks the dollar is on a trend down that could bring it below 1.70 marks to the dollar next year. "We don't expect the dollar to collapse but just to drift down some," he said. "It is limiting the impact on inflation and helping the overall interest rate environment. But it takes away the biggest attraction of buying American assets if the dollar is not going to appreciate."
Barton Biggs, global strategist for Morgan Stanley in New York, believes the dollar in the longer run will continue to rally but that the stumble in July will last for some months. In the nearer term, he said, the fall could spark a small summer rally in the stock markets around the world.
And he likes the fact that the falling dollar will, for the first time this year, add a little premium on investing outside the United States. Through the first six months of the year, the rising dollar turned stock market gains in Europe of 14.5 percent to a loss of 4.7 percent in dollar terms.
Still, any prediction on the dollar at this point seems bold. The foreign exchange market has made a regular practice of fooling analysts. But there are some factors that may support a temporary swoon of the dollar.
Intervention, which helped push down the dollar recently, works only temporarily. In the longer run, intervention's impact fades if it is not followed with changes in interest rates to back up the dollar selling. This would mean a lowering of interest rates here and higher rates abroad.
Michael Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch said that with the report of rising inflation in Germany, pressure is building on the German Bundesbank to raise interest rates to try to dampen growth. Such a move is the kind needed to back up intervention.
Mr. Rosenberg also argues that central banks seem to be learning to time their interventions better, which means they can catch thousands of traders when they have large or so-called overbought dollar positions. This increases the sting of the dollar selling and can give it a longer-lasting impact.
That, combined with Mr. Rigden's view that the American economic recovery may be disappointing, is the case for a less spunkier dollar, at least for a while. Beyond that, who knows?
 
Elsewhere
 While many stock markets have been sluggish this summer, Britain and Hong Kong are charting a different course.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index jumped to a record 2,587.9 on Tuesday, slipped a little and then rallied again on Friday, closing at 2,589.3, for a new high.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index reached new record closes on Tuesday, Wednesday and again on Friday, closing at 4.031.29. Its jolt came from the failure of the United State's Senate this week to approve restrictions on China's special trade status with enough votes to override a Presidential veto. Hong Kong's economy thrives on the China trade that moves through the British colony.

HEADLINE: An Auto Glut That Won't Go Away

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Just a stone's throw from the rusting carcass of the Chrysler Corporation's defunct Jefferson Avenue plant on this city's east side, workers are installing machine tools in a gleaming new factory. Elsewhere in town, many who will work on the assembly lines of the new plant on Jefferson Avenue are attending classes in such subjects as statistical process control and just-in-time inventory.
By the time the first Grand Cherokee Jeep, a new luxury model, is produced here in January, Chrysler will have spent about $1 billion. 
 In one sense, Chrysler's huge investment symbolizes Detroit's determination to catch and surpass the Japanese. But it also embodies one of the most serious ailments facing the American auto industry: too much manufacturing capacity chasing too few buyers.
Worldwide capacity now stands at 57 million cars and trucks, which would normally exceed demand by about 8 million but is even more out of line now because of the recession. North American auto makers and auto makers exporting here account for a disproportionate 6 million units of excess capacity.
The Big Three's 56 North American plants have the capacity to turn out an estimated 11.5 million cars and trucks annually. This year, because of the recession, only about 60 to 65 percent of that capacity will be used, compared with 70 percent last year and 85 percent in 1985. Analysts say that the 85 percent rate is generally needed to break even, but they are not sure the Big Three will achieve that, even when the recession is over.
That is because American overcapacity has such deep roots, going back to the sharp growth of the Japanese, who went from a worldwide capacity of 10 million in 1979 to nearly 17 million last year, including 1.7 million in plants operated in the United States. Last year, the Japanese sold 3.3 million cars and trucks in the United States, including imports, taking away even more of Detroit's share of the American market. That share has eroded to about 75 percent.
 
Some Close, Some Open
 Detroit has been dealing with the problem by fits and starts. It has closed some plants and consolidated operations in others, with the Ford Motor Company leading the way. But critics say Chrysler and especially the General Motors Corporation have dragged their feet. And paradoxically, as its market share has dwindled, Detroit has redoubled the pace of new model introductions, like the Grand Cherokee, to win back buyers. Naturally, the new models have meant more rapid retooling of plants and the need for plant space.
The Grand Cherokee may yet turn out to be a big moneymaker, as Chrysler says it will, and the new plant a smart investment. But the arithmetic of overcapacity is simply too nasty to allow every model -- and every plant -- to survive. Overcapacity not only saddles Detroit with unproductive overhead, it also leads to punishing price-cutting ploys -- including rebates, low-interest financing and fleet discounts -- to sell the surplus that is produced.
"The ongoing increase in production capacity, coupled with lower industry sales, has heightened competition for market share and forced virtually every manufacturer here into costly marketing wars," said Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman and chief executive. For the past year, Ford, Chrysler and G.M. have been paying an average of $900 to $1,100 per vehicle in consumer rebates.
The Japanese have also had to discount, but they are better able to do so because of lower costs from higher capacity utilization rates back home and lower labor expenses in this country, where the Japanese spend less than Detroit on health care and pensions because their work force is younger. Some Japanese factories in the United States are nonunion; in others, the Japanese have won more favorable contracts than the Big Three.
Capacity utilization rates at Japanese plants here are roughly comparable these days to rates at American-run plants, excluding G.M. factories, which are far more underused as a group. But Detroit can take little solace in that. While the Japanese have also been hurt by the recession, the bigger reason for their unused capacity is that several assembly lines are in a startup phase with full production a year or so away.
For their part, the American car makers have lost billions of dollars in the past year, including big losses reported late last week for the second quarter. The worst may be over, now that the recession itself seems to be over. But analysts say much more must be done to avoid further damage from overcapacity.
 
The $64 Question
 "We've known this crunch was coming since the early 1980's," said John O'Donnell, an economist who specializes in vehicle research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Sooner or later someone will have to bite the bullet. The question is who?"
In one form or another, all of the Big Three have been taking their bites, though obviously not deeply enough. Inventories are actually quite light these days, in part a reflection of numerous temporary shutdowns of plants.
Over the past few years, Ford has been the most aggressive, and in the late 80's it was the only one of the Big Three to achieve something close to parity between capacity and demand. But demand for Ford products has softened in the last year or two along with everyone else's. For the year ending Sept. 30, the company is expected to have a 76 percent utilization rate, according to Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco.
Just a week ago, General Motors bit the bullet again. It announced that it would close two plants -- in Van Nuys, Calif., and Scarborough, Ontario -- in line with a pledge by Robert C. Stempel, its chairman, to balance capacity with demand by the end of 1992. Analysts said, however, that three or four more plants would have to close to meet that goal. G.M. capacity utilization for the year ending Sept. 30 is expected to be 55 percent, Mr. Glantz said.
And Chrysler, which has taken about 600,000 units of capacity out of its system since 1988, has to shut at least one or two more plants as well, analysts say. Its rate: 66 percent.
In some respects, Detroit says it cannot slim down much faster, given the constraints that it faces under union contracts. G.M. signed a pattern-setting three-year agreement last year guaranteeing workers nearly full salary and benefits whether they work or not. Little wonder then that Detroit has concluded it can sometimes lose more money closing a plant than building cars that are unprofitable.
"The economics of the decision to manufacture or not to manufacture have been completely distorted by the labor issue," said Jerry Paul, automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York.
 
A Last Stand?
 In other respects, Detroit simply does not want to do more about overcapacity -- at least not yet -- viewing factory shutdowns as a final ceding of market share to the Japanese.
Closing a plant increases efficiency and lowers operating costs but temporarily forecloses the opportunity to bring out a model that might become a sudden profitable hit, like Chrysler's 1984 minivan. As the Detroit cliche goes: "You can't sell 'em if you don't build 'em."
"The age-old dilemma, as with housing and banking, is how one adequately forecasts the future," said Mr. O'Donnell, the auto researcher. "There always is the hope the market will recover" and wipe out excess capacity.
Not surprisingly, the United Automobile Workers union is strongly opposed to further plant closings, arguing that the American auto industry is unfairly bearing the brunt of what is really a global problem. Overcapacity is concentrated here, the union says, because Europe and Japan are aggressive exporters and stingy importers. The solution, the U.A.W. says, is legislation to protect American markets.
"Plants have closed; lots of them," said Owen Bieber, U.A.W. president. "But where's the payoff? The domestic industry is in as much trouble as ever. Maybe closing Big Three plants isn't such a magic bullet after all."
Whatever the cure, overcapacity appears to be a fixture of the cyclical car industry. "During the last slump, in 1982, there were about 6.2 million units of unused capacity in the North American auto industry," said Chris Hosford, a Chrysler spokesman. "When sales rebounded by 1985, unused capacity fell to half of that, with a resulting 82 percent utilization rate and good profitability."
The fact that the industry is now back at about 6 million units of unused capacity does not faze Chrysler. "If our forecasts are right," Mr. Hosford said, "when the next sales resurgence comes, unused capacity and utilization rates will be at almost exactly the same level as in 1985." And Chrysler, he added, is "well positioned for a market upswing."
But the Japanese competition is far stronger than it was five years ago. And so far Detroit has not proven that its newest models can halt the Japanese advance, so there is no assurance that will happen when the market rebounds.
Certainly, the Japanese don't think so. By 1995, according to industry forecasts, Japanese capacity will grow by another 2 million vehicles worldwide, to 19 million. Much of that growth will come in the United States, where Japanese-run factories, known as transplants, will add 800,000 units of capacity.
In the early 1980's, the Big Three unwittingly encouraged much of this growth when they criticized Japan for importing to North America without manufacturing here. Wary of trade restrictions on their imports and heartened by a weakening dollar, the Japanese accepted the challenge. Initially, the Americans were eager to see how Japanese manufacturing and management practices worked here. G.M., Ford and Chrysler each opened transplants with Japanese partners.
 
Urge to Build
 That experience further convinced the Americans of the need to operate as efficiently and productively as the Japanese. And that meant Detroit sometimes decided to build new plants, like Jefferson Avenue, and new models, like the Grand Cherokee.
But that is a billion-dollar crapshoot. No matter how estimable the Grand Cherokee turns out to be, it will have to fight for a place in a market already clogged with too many similar products churned out by too many plants. Besides facing a host of similar Japanese models, the Grand Cherokee will be competing against Ford's Explorer, G.M. utility vehicles like the Oldsmobile Bravada and even Chrysler's less expensive Jeep Cherokee, produced in an aging plant in Toledo, Ohio.
Marketing experts think Chrysler will be hard pressed to avoid paying rebates if it wants to keep sales of both Jeep models strong. "In a very crowded segment it's going to be difficult," said Mr. Paul of Bernstein & Company. "When you start slicing market segments, the slices get very small."
Chrysler says the new plant is not adding capacity, since it is taking the place of the old Jefferson Avenue facility. But critics say Chrysler should have phased out the existing Cherokee line or closed the Toledo plant and combined production of the two models here or even dusted off a recently closed St. Louis plant instead of spending so much on a risky new facility.
"Somebody wasn't doing his homework when Jefferson Avenue was planned," said James Harbour, a manufacturing consultant based in Troy, Mich.
Yet others say up-to-date plants like Jefferson Avenue and G.M.'s new Saturn facility in Spring Hill, Tenn., have so many technical advantages over older factories that it makes sense to build them, even though they are adding capacity to the market.
Ford has concentrated more on wringing increased production from existing plants than building new ones. After closing several factories during the recession of the early 80's, Ford executives decided they had been courting financial disaster by operating too much capacity.
So Ford invested heavily to make its assembly lines more efficient. It also persuaded the U.A.W. to accept a great deal of overtime. By not opening more plants, Ford in effect limited its ability to prosper during periods of peak demand. By the same token, however, losses would be lower during recessions.
The cautious strategy allowed Ford to surpass the much-bigger G.M. in profitability for a while in the 80's. But with the industry now swimming in overcapacity, Ford no longer can stay dry. Like the less-cautious G.M. and Chrysler, it too must resort to expensive discounting, a painful reminder of just how insidious the overcapacity problem has become. If things don't improve soon, Ford might also have to shut or consolidate some of its factories, analysts say.
"If one player is sick with too much capacity, it affects everyone," said Mr. Paul.
 
 
 
GETTING MORE FROM A PLANT
 Besides shutting and consolidating some factories with unused capacity, Detroit is also trying to squeeze more output from "fully utilized" plants by expanding to three work shifts or three work crews from the normal two.
Full capacity utilization has traditionally been defined as a plant's output for five working days, Monday through Friday, from two eight-hour shifts, with the line running at full speed.
Near round-the-clock assembly was once an unthinkable notion. Technical experts claimed machinery needed more maintenance than would be possible during the few hours of downtime. Moreover, the United Automobile Workers union, which allows overtime under certain conditions, didn't want to institutionalize round-the-clock production.
But technical puzzles were solved, and executives won the agreement of the union, which understands as well as anyone the mounting pressures from highly efficient Japanese competitors.
In mid-July, workers at G.M.'s huge assembly complex in Lordstown, Ohio, approved a "three-crew, two-shift" production schedule for subcompact cars starting in 1992. Under this system, Lordstown will have two 10-hour production shifts on weekdays and one on Saturday and Sunday, with three crews each working four days a week. Workers will get extra pay for the longer shifts and weekend assignments. G.M. already operates two plants in Europe under a similar system.
Earlier in the year, Chrysler workers in St. Louis approved a pact to build minivans on three seven-hour shifts, including some weekend shifts, starting as early as January. This will mean a 35-hour week, instead of 40. But the workers will continue to be paid at the rate of 40 hours in exchange for agreeing to late-night and weekend duty.
By running plants nearly full-time, companies can increase output by about 20 percent. Chrysler thinks it can add 50,000 minivans to the annual total of 225,000 built in St. Louis, saving the $500 million it might cost to retool another plant for minivan assembly.
 
 
 
THE OUTLOOK FOR EUROPE
 Until last year, Western Europe's 101 car plants were operating at very close to full capacity, helping to generate huge profits for, among others, Ford and G.M.
But the profits have diminished rapidly as the auto makers have added capacity to take advantage of an expected -- but thus far unfulfilled -- buying spree from Eastern bloc countries, according to Autofacts Inc., a West Chester, Pa., consulting firm.
In 1989, European assembly plants, with a potential annual output of 15 million cars and trucks, operated at 96 percent of capacity. During the following year, capacity increased by almost one million units. But sales slowed and utilization for 1990 dropped to 87 percent.
G.M. has been able to maintain brisk production and strong profits in Europe because of the high proportion of business it does in Germany, where the automotive sector has remained robust.
But Ford, whose strength is in Britain and Spain where business has been miserable, has suffered a big drop in utilization and has lost money.
The outlook over the next several years, according to Autofacts, is for even more dramatic growth in European excess capacity as several companies chart big expansions. This time, the auto makers plan to cash in on sales increases expected to result from the 1992 unification of the European market. But several will suffer major losses instead, Autofacts predicted.

HEADLINE: Does Military Adventurism Proclaim Our National Decline?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Don't we have any national leaders who will tell the country that we are falling into the trap that the historian Paul Kennedy described as typical for nations in decline? Mr. Kennedy noted that as a nation senses it is weakening politically and economically, there is an impulse to resort to military adventures to demonstrate power, even though this activity ultimately accelerates decline. 
 As some observers have commented, the remarkable exercise of our sophisticated weaponry in the Persian Gulf created a high level of euphoria among our citizenry because it was a demonstration of power at a time when most people agree that our country is losing ground to foreign industrial and financial competition, and lacks the quality of education essential to halt this loss. This fits the picture painted by Mr. Kennedy.
It is far easier for our political leaders, many of whom rightly predicted that a war in the Persian Gulf would not achieve political stability and progress toward lasting peace and democracy for that region, to go along with the self-deception that the gulf war was a great success and to approve yet another Pentagon budget of close to $300 billion to buy still more advanced weaponry for unspecified needs.
This huge outlay for military purposes seems likely to be approved at a time when, far from subsidizing schools so that they can hire qualified science and mathematics teachers, the Federal Government has shown no sign at all of being interested in preventing the firing of about 40,000 teachers across the country as a result of the budget problems of state and local governments.
As Mr. Kennedy told us, the pursuit of military prestige in a period of decline serves only to speed that decline. With a severely crippled education system our country may never be able to recover its competitiveness.

Mother of Yankee Draft Pick Says Michael Is Disrespectful

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEAUFORT, N.C., July 27

 BODY:
The mother of Brien Taylor, the 19-year-old pitcher and the No. 1 choice in the baseball draft last month, today accused Yankees General Manager Gene Michael of being disrespectful and questioned whether racial and economic considerations had entered into the unsuccessful relationship between the team and the family.
"As things go along, I'm beginning to wonder," Bettie Taylor said in a telephone conference call joined by Scott Boras, an attorney and an adviser to the family. "Is it because we're back here, we're poor and we're black? I'm not saying that is the case, but if it is I can live with that, too." 
 Mrs. Taylor emphasized that she was not making an accusation, but said the thought had occurred to her in the past few weeks. The most recent Yankee offer, reportedly for $650,000, is barely half the $1.2 million agreement made last year between the Oakland Athletics and a Texas high school pitcher, Todd Van Poppel.
Michael, when informed of Mrs. Taylor's remarks through a club spokesman late this afternoon, said he would not respond today. Michael has repeated that the Van Poppel contract should not be held as a precedent because he had informed teams before the 1990 draft of his intention to attend the University of Texas. As a result, Van Poppel was not chosen until Oakland gambled with the 14th pick.
At the time of the 1991 draft, the Yankee organization thought Taylor did not intend to go to college and had indicated that he wanted to play professional baseball. Yankee officials believed at the time that he would be signed relatively quickly and reportedly hoped his career would begin as soon as June 12.
Mrs. Taylor said today that her son had been accepted at Louisburg College, and communication with the Yankees would end if he should begin school on Aug. 25.
"When that No. 14 pick was signed, with the deal that he got, in my opinion the market was established," Mrs. Taylor said of Van Poppel's contract. "My son is as good a pitcher." Nearly eight weeks after the Yankees chose Taylor, an overpowering left-hander from East Carteret High School, Mrs. Taylor said she and Michael have never met. To protect her son's college eligibility, the family has chosen to accept offers from the Yankees by mail. Mrs. Taylor said that face-to-face negotiations would begin in the event of an offer similar to Van Poppel's contract.
But she also said that Michael had failed to introduce himself to her when he came to watch Taylor pitch. "Mr. Michael came down here twice," she said. "He didn't even give me a hello. If you ask me, that was downright disrespect. He could have said hello. I've lived with that sort of thing all my life. I mean, disrespectful people."
Mrs. Taylor added that Boras, who also served the Van Poppel family as an adviser and then as a representative, had informed her that Sandy Alderson, Oakland's vice president for baseball operations, had been present from the start of those negotiations.
If Taylor should enroll at Louisburg, the Yankees would retain negotiating rights during a period following the junior college season and before the 1992 draft. But Mrs. Taylor said: "Once Brien goes to college, the Yankees will have no chance at him. They have the opportunity now. If they want him, now is the time to get him."
She said her son would not speak publicly. Brien Taylor's first summer without competitive baseball since his childhood has been spent working as a brick mason with his father. "That's the way he has been raised," she said. "We've always worked for what we've got."

New York Grand Prix? Decision in 90 Days

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

 BODY:
The decision on whether the Meadowlands Indy-car race will move next year to a site using the streets around the World Trade Center is fewer than 90 days away. And the fate of the proposal rests on the resolution of three issues.
The three key elements are whether the revenue projections are enough for the city of New York to justify the expense in a time of fiscal crisis, how much of a disruption would the race create in lower Manhattan and whether the race's current sponsor, a cigarette company, would prove unpalatable to the city government. 
 Deputy Mayor Barbara J. Fife, who has been part of the discussions with the current promoter of the Meadowlands race, Motormarketing International, said that the first issue is whether "the cost to the city won't overwhelm the benefit to it."
 
Will It Pay?
 That is, when the estimates are done as to how much the race could bring in the form of added sales taxes, business revenue and that ever-nebulous matter of "image enhancement," New York had better be able to justify whatever it spends in police and fire overtime and other such costs.
There is no shortage of rosy predictions on the race's financial success. Matt Scheckner, head of the New York City Sports Commission, a joint public and private agency whose purpose is to bring new events to the city, said the race's projected economic impact is about $56 million, or slightly less than the figure for the Big East basketball tournament.
Bud Stanner, chief executive of MMI, predicted that the Manhattan race would draw 65,000 to 70,000 spectators. The original projection for the Meadowlands race was about the same, and that race never drew much better than half that figure.
In this case, it will probably come down to what the city wants the promoters to pay for, and how much they think they can afford to pay. For example, the streets that would make up the 1.3-mile dipper-shaped track need repaving to accomodate the low-slung Indy cars, and MMI may wind up paying for that.
 
TV Could Pay for Police
 As for police overtime, Fife said, New York may decide that it should get a share of television revenue to help pay for that expense.
"There's about a $1.5 million to $1.6 million difference between a permanent circuit and a temporary one," said Chris Pook, the organizer of the Long Beach, Calif., street race, when asked how much more expensive it is to run a race on a temporary track.
"And you have to re-establish the site as a motor-racing destination every year," Pook added, referring to promotional costs. "You have to re-educate, re-remind the public. And that's very expensive."
For any New York motorist, the second issue is of great urgency. The track as planned would use a section of West Street, the main north-south traffic artery to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, between Chambers and Liberty Streets. The track would also limit access to the PATH station at the World Trade Center as well as a few subway stations.
Besides the race weekend itself, several days would be required to set up and dismantle the concrete barricades, safety fencing and temporary grandstands lining the track. Every manhole cover on the race circuit would have to be welded shut, as well. Although the streets would probaby be kept open while all this was done, there figures to be some disruption.
And the streets must be shut on the race weekend itself. Since it is a business district, traffic tie-ups should be minimal on whatever July Saturday and Sunday the race would be held. But Indy-car race weekends are three days, including a Friday.
MMI, realizing it is probably too much to ask to freeze traffic in the Wall Street area on a Friday, is planning a two-day race weekend. That would allow only enough practice and qualification time for the Indy-car main event and one preliminary race, instead of the usual two.
It would mark the first time that Championship Auto Racing Teams, the Indy-car sanctioning group, tried to compact a race weekend into two days. Could CART do it? "I would say yes," said Mel Poole, a CART spokesman. "But that would have to be cleared top to bottom, because it's so unusual."
The last issue involves Marlboro, the race's sponsor. Fife, who said that Mayor David N. Dinkins wants to limit cigarette advertising on city property, said that in the case of the Indy-car race, "It's a question of looking at the pattern of the advertising." Her comments did not sound like an outright unwillingness to allow Marlboro to sponsor the race. Stanner refused to comment on the sponsorship issue. But if Marlboro is unhappy with whatever demands the city makes, the proposal's future does not look bright.

HEADLINE: Brady Backs Japan Finance Minister

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 27

 BODY:
In a highly unusual move in international relations, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady spoke out about the growing public furor over the Japanese stock market scandal, expressing support for Japan's Finance Minister.
In a telephone interview today from Washington, Mr. Brady said he was alarmed at signs that the political survival of Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Finance Minister, was suddenly being threatened by the Japanese Government's handling of the scandal. 
 American officials rarely comment publicly on another country's domestic political matters, and until now officials in the United States have remained silent about the Japanese stock market scandal to avoid the appearance of interfering in it.
But Mr. Brady indicated he had taken the step because Japan's Government had been so helpful to the United States during the Persian Gulf war and because he hoped that the relationship would not be jeopardized by an upheaval in Japan's leadership. He also indicated that the United States was eager that it not lose such a cooperative ally at a time when the world is faced with a host of tough economic issues, like financial aid to the Soviet Union.
 
 Scandal Is Now a Political Crisis
 The stock-market scandal turned into a political crisis last week when the Japanese Government refused to force disclosure of the names of the big corporations and powerful individuals who were improperly reimbursed for stock-market losses.
Although Mr. Brady is not personally close to Mr. Hashimoto, he said Mr. Hashimoto and the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had been particularly helpful when the United States was seeking huge amounts of financial aid during the Persian Gulf war.
"Mr. Hashimoto has been a pretty good partner of the United States, and we hope he'll be all right," Mr. Brady said.
The stock-market scandal has been particularly sensitive politically because it comes a few months before Prime Minister Kaifu's term as party president ends. Mr. Kaifu is expected to campaign to remain party president, and thus Prime Minster. There are no indications that the scandal could bring down Mr. Kaifu's Government, but it could upstage several important bills he is pushing and thus weaken him.
 
American Economic Implications
 Until now, the complex details of the Japanese scandal have not excited much interest among Washington officials, who see it as a distant storm, Mr. Brady said. But, he said he now believes that the scandal holds economic implications for the United States because it is suddenly emerging as a political issue in Japan.
"To the extent that Americans want to be fairly treated when they go to Japan, that's important to us," Mr. Brady said of Americans wanting to invest in the Japanese stock market. But, he added of the scandal, "To be honest with you, it has seemed too far away to do anything about."
By speaking out now, however, the Treasury Secretary is indicating that because the domestic scandal appears to be weakening Mr. Kaifu's Government, the affair has become a subject of international concern.
Officials at the United States Embassy in Japan would not comment on the matter.
 
'He Deserves a Pat on the Back'

Mr. Brady spoke of his deep gratitude to the Japanese leadership. It was at American urging that Japan pledged a total of $13 billion in aid, loans and direct financing to support the United Nations efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Because of constitutional restraints Japan was unable to send troops to the Persian Gulf.
"He said yes in 15 minutes" to the American requests for billions of dollars in war funding, Mr. Brady said of Mr. Hashimoto. "I was impressed with the way he said yes right away. It was the kind of reaction from a partner that was very helpful. He never came back and said 'less, less.' He deserves a pat on the back."
Whether Mr. Brady's comments can help Mr. Hashimoto and Mr. Kaifu remains to be seen. Many Japanese were reluctant to have any involvement in the Persian Gulf war, and there was some criticism here that Mr. Kaifu practiced checkbook diplomacy in response to American demands, rather than display independence.
In the current scandal, Japan's largest securities houses have admitted to making improper payments of more than $1 billion to about 200 stock-market investors to cover losses in the crash last year. The admissions have reinforced long-standing suspicions that individuals and foreigners in the huge Japanese stock market are discriminated against, while the country's more powerful corporations and individuals enjoy unfair advantages.
There is also growing speculation that some politicians may have benefited from these improper reimbursements of losses, which is why disclosure of the list of the recipients has become such a sensitive issue. But disclosure is regarded as the only way the ruling Liberal Democratic Party can erase the perception that it is protecting itself or powerful interests.
 
Proposals for Reform
The Prime Minister personally stepped into the fray Friday in an effort to halt the flow of damaging publicity. He used the occasion of a speech to newspaper editors to issue a three-part directive to the Finance Ministry and his own party.
He said the securities laws should be toughened to clarify the ban on compensation for market losses. He also suggested that the Government consider scrapping the cozy regulatory system that currently exists and create an independent regulatory body for the financial industry.
He also made clear why this had become such a priority. Mr. Kaifu said he did not want the issue on which he has staked his prime ministership -- reform of the electoral system -- to be pushed aside by the scandal.

HEADLINE: Americans Share Soviet Economic Pessimism

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
Separate polls of the American and Soviet people, released this week, show skepticism about efforts to restructure the Soviet economy and illustrate the differing domestic climates that President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev must contend with as they meet to chart the course of the relations between the two countries.
Soviet citizens, interviewed in the European part of the Russian republic and in the Ukraine, expressed overwhelming concern with economic problems. 
 They also reported a widespread sense of national decline from five years ago, but indicated apprehension about many aspects of the free-market economy that is being urged on them by reformers, according to a poll conducted for the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press.
Americans in the latest Gallup Poll saw Soviet economic problems as being very serious, but had mixed views on the type of foreign aid that the United States might extend.
More than three out of four people in the Soviet poll cited economic concerns as "the most important problem" facing their country. And more than 8 out of 10 rated their country's situation as worse now than five years ago.
The 1,123 respondents in European Russia and the 586 people in the Ukraine were interviewed in person in April and May under the auspices of the Institute of Sociology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points for the Russian poll and six percentage points in the Ukrainian survey. Both polls were sponsored by the Times Mirror Center.
While a bare majority in each Soviet republic approved in general of "efforts to establish a free-market economy," further questioning showed that less than a quarter favored "a free-market form of capitalism such as found in the U.S. or Germany." The greatest number of those questioned favored "a more democratic type of socialism" or "a modified form of capitalism such as found in Sweden."
Farming was the only one of 13 economic activities that most people agreed should be "mainly run privately." Majorities said that heavy industry, the telephone system, electricity, trains and buses, banks, schools, and radio and television should be operated by the state, rather than privately.
In the Gallup Poll, 71 percent of 1,002 Americans interviewed July 18-21 said they thought that the Soviet Union's economic problems were "very serious" and 23 percent more said "somewhat serious." At the same time, Americans' confidence that "President Gorbachev's attempts to restructure the Soviet economy are likely to succeed" fell from 65 percent in mid-1989 to 47 percent in the new poll.
The Gallup telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
When it came to extending various types of economic aid to the Soviet Union, the American public made clear distinctions.
Sixty-nine percent favored "providing technical assistance, advice and expertise," while 58 percent favored "donating American grain and other farm products." At the same time, 48 percent favored "providing financial loans," while another 48 percent were opposed; 6 percent favored "providing cash that would not have to be paid back," while 92 percent were opposed to that form of aid.
In polls over the last 20 years, questions about foreign aid to many countries have elicited negative views from the American people.
In this survey, Americans showed little conviction that their Government needed to increase aid to the Soviet Union. Sixty-four percent of those questioned said the Administration is doing "about the right amount to help the Soviet Union in its current economic crisis." Twenty percent said it is doing "too much," while 9 percent said "not enough."

HEADLINE: U.S. FACES TROUBLE MAINTAINING UNITY OF ALLIES ON IRAQ

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Nearly a year after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Bush Administration is finding it more and more difficult to forge a consensus among its allies over steps to bring down President Saddam Hussein and pave the way for a successor Government in Baghdad.
The growing strains on the military coalition were most evident this week, when a deadline passed for Iraq to make full disclosure on its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. 
 After the Pentagon briefed major allies on plans to bomb what is left of Iraq's secret-weapons sites, senior officials said, a number of the allies voiced reservations or even opposition. The officials, who are involved in day-to-day management of Iraqi policy, said the doubts would have to be overcome should President Bush decide to use force.
 
Egypt Expresses Concern
 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has expressed deep concerns to Washington about any further bombing in Iraq, United States and Egyptian officials said.
Saudi Arabia has told Washington that it wants Patriot missile batteries redeployed to protect its air bases and cities from possible Iraqi retaliation should allied bombers launch any new attack from Saudi soil, United States and Saudi officials said.
Turkey has demanded detailed consultations on any military operations mounted from its bases, and last week it briefly interrupted United States reconnaissance flights over Iraq in a dispute over the allied chain of command, a United States official said.
And Israel has asked for 72 hours' notice of any attack to prepare its defenses and requested that its hotline to the Pentagon, dismantled this spring, be reinstalled, the official said.
 
Hussein Could Be a Target
 As these management problems flared, United States military officials were briefing their British and French counterparts on preliminary American plans to bomb not only Iraqi nuclear sites, but also "leadership targets," including Mr. Hussein if his whereabouts is known at the time of the raids, a Pentagon official said.
France, while agreeing to take part in any military operation to protect Iraqi Kurds from repression, has reserved a decision on whether to join broader punitive raids against Iraqi weapons installations, a United States official said.
British officials were also briefed and are believed to be generally supportive of Washington's plans to use force if diplomatic pressure fails. Mr. Bush reportedly told Prime Minister John Major at the summit meeting in London that he wanted the broadest possible participation in any new military action, and Mr. Major is said to have agreed.
The American plans, however, await the results from a new round of inspections of Iraqi weapons installations by a United Nations team that was due to arrive in Baghdad at the weekend. A satisfactory Iraqi accounting of its weapons of mass destruction would defer any military action for the time being, officials said. Washington and the United Nations have charged that Iraq has failed so far to provide the information called for in the Security Council resolution ending the war last winter.
The continuing tensions between Washington and Baghdad reflect the intensity of the Bush Administration's postwar strategy to topple Mr. Hussein as the anniversary of his seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, approaches. The invasion brought on the Persian Gulf war and the first major crisis of the post-cold-war era.
The centerpiece of this strategy for the long and agonizing end game that may lie ahead in Iraq will be the maintenance of the most severe economic sanctions that Washington's coalition partners and the United Nations Security Council will support, Administration officials said. In addition, Mr. Bush will resort to military force if necessary to prevent violent repression by Mr. Hussein inside the country and to insure that Iraq fulfills its pledge to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, the officials said.
In the aftermath of the war, Shiite groups in southern Iraq and Kurds in the north rebelled against the Government and were defeated in heavy fighting. At that time, the United States did not attack the Iraqis, fearing the dismemberment of the country. But Washington eventually undertook to protect the Kurds and an allied strike force based in Turkey is ready to respond if there are new attacks on the Kurds.
 
'Significantly Diminished'
 Whether the United States will prevail against Mr. Hussein remains very much an open question. Defeated on the battlefield, Mr. Hussein is by no means defeated at home, where he is relentlessly organizing the survival of his increasingly family-based regime and maneuvering for a comeback in regional politics.
Still, White House, State Department and Pentagon officials express confidence that as a result of the coalition war effort mounted against him in January Mr. Hussein has lost his ability to dominate the Middle Eastern political scene, and, they assert, this counts as the overriding factor in the allied success.
"He has been significantly diminished," said a White House official, who has taken part in policy management since the invasion of Kuwait. "One reason he is less dangerous is not just because his power has been reduced in absolute terms, but the world is so much more suspicious and prepared to cooperate against him."
As the postwar campaign against Mr. Hussein gathers momentum, significant gaps exist in the Administration's policy, say critics outside the Administration as well as some Government officials.
Though Mr. Bush has made it plain that he will not tolerate needless suffering among Iraqi women and children, widespread disease and malnutrition have been documented in the country, but have not yet been addressed.
 
Arab Sympathy for Iraqis
 A senior Egyptian official in Washington said that public opinion in the Arab world has turned markedly sympathetic to the plight of the Iraqi people. Some of these demonstrated their disillusionment with Mr. Hussein through widespread rebellion in March, but they continue to suffer the effects of the international sanctions.
Western suspicions that Mr. Hussein is cynically promoting much of the suffering and shortages in Iraq to break support for the embargo has only retarded humanitarian efforts and prompted Washington to demand an accounting of Mr. Hussein's cash assets. At the same time, Administration officials are studying ways to further undermine Mr. Hussein's rule, removing his hand from control over any oil sales to finance emergency food or medicine shipments.
If the Security Council approves Iraq's pending request to sell $2.4 billion in oil to buy food, "to the extent possible we will do it in a way that reduces any discretion on Saddam's part to use the resources to strengthen his political base," the White House official said. "That argues for an extremely intrusive, extremely vigilant, extremely regulatory sort of approach," he added.
Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist at the Brookings Institution, said, "We should make it very clear to the Iraqi people that the regime cannot govern without making the people pay the price."
 
Another Arms Problem
 Other gaps remain in the Administration's goal of stemming the Middle East arms race, even as Washington has become the dominant arms supplier in the region. If war and embargo have stanched Iraq's arms appetite, there still is the problem of stemming the temptation in other Middle East capitals to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons in a region where Iraq no longer serves as the Arab deterrent to a nuclear-armed Israel.
In addition, Iraq's success in hiding its extensive nuclear weapons program has demonstrated a surprising new reality that knowledge and old technology may be more important in producing nuclear weapons than access to the well-guarded high technology of the nuclear supplier nations.
If Washington succeeds in bringing Mr. Hussein down, Administration officials say, there may be a long transition before a stable leadership emerges in Baghdad -- and there is no guarantee what it will look like.
"It is unlikely that any successor to Saddam, even if it is one of the fairly nasty people he keeps close to him, would exercise the same degree of authority that he does," the White House official said. "And once the process of political change is under way it is not likely that there would be one turn of the wheel and then no others."
"But clearly," he continued, "Iraq's ability to establish a normal relationship with the outside world is going to depend on normal behavior and it may be that a post-Saddam Iraq is willing to entertain the possibility of reforming its national behavior."
A leading Iraq specialist in the Administration said this assessment in the White House indicated that Washington might cooperate with a post-Hussein government led by a member of Mr. Hussein's family or clan so long as the new Government made a commitment to reform.
A number of Middle East specialists have criticized the Bush Administration for not tapping into the network of Iraqi opposition figures in exile. They represent a broad range of political orientation, from radical Islamic fundamentalists based in Iran to Kurdish separatists, cashiered army officers and former government ministers who seek parliamentary democracy.
But Administration analysts continue to believe that any successful move to oust Mr. Hussein will come from the Sunni Muslim minority, which has always represented the center in Iraq. this leadership class,
"A lot of political leaders in exile have weak ties to Iraq," the White House official said, "and it's not clear that they could have much, if any, influence there while this remains a totalitarian political entity."
 
Intelligence Called Crucial
 Administration officials said repeatedly that one of the most serious requirements for the future will be monitoring of Iraq's behavior and compliance with United Nations resolutions.
The Bush Administration's frustration in anticipating events and problems in the Persian Gulf has been heightened by the failure of American and other Western intelligence agencies over the last 18 months to foresee Mr. Hussein's military ambitions in the region, detect the full scope of Iraq's nuclear program and predict the effect of the war on Mr. Hussein's power base in Baghdad.
A number of officials and experts said the intelligence agencies would have to recognize that in the post-cold-war era intelligence collection and analysis in critical third world areas must improve.
But the White House official noted: "Whenever you're dealing with a government whose policy is essentially the whim of a single individual, prediction is hard. You've got to be constantly prepared for him to surprise you."

For Castro, the Hemisphere Gets Smaller and Lonelier

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
AT the height of his power, Fidel Castro was hardly a welcome guest at most Latin American political functions. The revolutionary fervor of Cuban society and the fragility of their own regimes caused most regional leaders to view Mr. Castro with mistrust, if not outright fear.
So it was a sign of something other than strength or prestige when Mr. Castro took his place this month at the first summit meeting of 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations in Guadalajara, Mexico. Fortified by a region-wide turn toward democracy and market economics, other participating heads of state felt they could safely regard Mr. Castro at close range. Shorn of his socialist allies and caged by his own failing economy, Cuba's aging revolutionary lion could roar but he could no longer bite. 
 For leaders like the conference host, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Mr. Castro's presence was actually regarded as a stabilizing influence. Far from worrying about the risk of contracting a revolutionary virus, Mr. Salinas and other openly pro-American pragmatists welcomed the chance to demonstrate a commitment to Latin American non-alignment and, in the Mexican leader's carefully coined term, "diplomatic diversity."
Likewise, for Mr. Castro, the incentives for close contact with his regional counterparts had fundamentally changed. To the aging guerrilla leader, the countries of Latin America no longer loomed as potential converts to Cuba's revolutionary gospel, but as sources of economic salvation for the Cuban regime itself.
The process that led to Mr. Castro's changed role is almost invariably ascribed to the collapse of the Communist bloc, and the reduction of enormous Soviet subsidies to the Cuban regime. But it is equally a product of the striking convergence of political and economic thought in Latin America itself.
As recently as 1989, a meeting like the Guadalajara summit would have been all but unthinkable. In addition to Mr. Castro, a region-wide conference in that year would have required the reconciliation of such controversial, mutually antagonistic leaders as Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama and Gen. Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay.
 
A Living Gauge of Change
 Of those, only Mr. Castro still clings to power. Now, 38 years after he led the July 26, 1953, attack on a Cuban Army barracks to begin his overthrow of the Batista Government, Mr. Castro is a beleaguered survivor of a different era -- a living measure of the regional changes that have left his country behind. Once regarded by many as a pathfinder for a possible socialist future for Latin America, his regime has become an exception that proves the increasing region-wide rule of capitalism, pragmatism and democracy.
Looking aged and at times visibly agitated by sharp remarks aimed in his direction, Mr. Castro devoted his formal conference speech to a familiar denunciation of the United States and its policies toward the third world. And he reserved special contempt for regional economic initiatives originating in Washington.
"There is always a new siren's song for the eternal navigators that we have become," Mr. Castro averred, his voice assuming its famous timbre for the first and only time in the two-day conference.
"I am no longer speaking of blockades, dirty wars, mercenary invasions," he said. "I refer to illusions like the Alliance for Progress, the Baker Plan, the Brady Plan and the most recent of the fantasies, the Initiative for the Americas."
But at a table of regional leaders who have increasingly staked their national policy and their political fortunes on just such American-style economic strategies, Mr. Castro's well-worn diatribes fell on deaf ears. Even less well received was the Cuban leader's insistence that the United States, more than Cuba, was marked for imminent economic collapse. And the suggestion that Cuba was being forced to conform to a new regional orthodoxy was dismissed with caustic asides from such leaders as President Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.
"We don't want uniformity -- not the uniformity of uniforms," Mr. Gonzalez observed dryly.
Having lost their fear of Cuba's socialist example, other Latin American leaders made clear that they had lost their interest in it, as well.
Analyzing the summit's importance, the participating heads of state invariably looked straight past Mr. Castro's national predicament, focusing instead on the hardheaded business of building a new global negotiating bloc that could unite the markets and policies of their nations. The question of Mr. Castro's presence -- and indeed his fate -- was treated as a short-term issue.
Railing against his diminishing importance, the Cuban leader pointedly rejected any suggestion that he would voluntarily relax his rule in return for outside aid. He appeared almost to relish the vision of leading his countrymen into a twilight struggle of ideologies, a glorious fight to the finish.
"We are preparing ourselves economically, preparing ourselves politically, preparing ourselves morally, and preparing ourselves militarily," Mr. Castro declared to reporters. "What are we going to do? Anything is possible except that Cuba should raise the white flag."
But in a region preoccupied with its own, far different plans for the future, other heads of state nodded in sleep rather than agreement. In the conflict of Latin American politics that he helped provoke and define, it appeared that Mr. Castro would even be denied the honor of a final, losing battle.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wondering if Interests Lie in a United or Divided U.S.S.R.

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
As President Bush approaches a Moscow summit meeting that has been billed as a turning point in Soviet-American relations, the Administration is grappling with the fundamental question of whether American interests are best served by a united Soviet Union or a group of smaller states built from its 15 republics.
Should Mr. Bush go beyond his overtures to the Soviet republics and encourage the Baltics, the Ukraine, Georgia and other restive areas to withdraw from the union? Or should Washington help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hold his country together -- peacefully -- as it gropes for a new economic and political path? 
 In interviews this week, senior Administration officials said that for the time being at least, Mr. Bush believes that American interests are best served by a largely intact Soviet Union, one in which economic powers are more widely dispersed to the republics but foreign policy and nuclear weapons remain under control of a central authority.
 
Confidence in Treaties
 This would permit the United States to negotiate treaties with confidence that they will be enforced and to maintain the formal state-to-state, president-to-president diplomacy that Mr. Bush favors, the officials said.
From a business viewpoint, according to Government officials, Soviet analysts and business strategists, American corporations could deal with republic leaders who might be more amenable to free-market reforms while keeping the advantage of some predictability and preserving the vast national market that is the primary attraction for American investment in the Soviet Union.
"With the exception of the Baltic states, a united Soviet Union, federated in the sense that it respects the rights of minorities, permits economic reform and free markets and gives the republics some leeway is probably the best model for the republics, for the bilateral relationship and for the region," an Administration official said.
 
Bush Will Visit Kiev
 Mr. Bush's actions in recent months have clearly been designed to encourage this outcome, even though the President has taken great care not to offer more than a general call for political pluralism and free markets. Mr. Bush is likely to be just as circumspect during his visit to the Soviet Union starting Monday, especially when he travels to Kiev, capital of the Ukrainian republic, to address the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, said on Friday that the meeting will be "the first post-cold war summit," in which the old arms control agenda will be closed out by the signing of a treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons. He said Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev would focus on Soviet domestic problems, on trade and economics and on ways for the once-competing military giants to work together on the world's most difficult problems.
Mr. Scowcroft said Mr. Bush would also explore ways to expand American ties with leaders of the emerging Soviet opposition, without taking sides on questions that Mr. Bush and his advisers have not resolved for themselves.
The Kiev speech is especially sensitive. The President's senior advisers said it would be an example of his effort to promote negotiations between Moscow and the republics, without encouraging steps toward independence that Mr. Gorbachev will not tolerate and the United States cannot support.
 
Exception in the Baltics
 The exception to the policy of non-interference between Moscow and the republics, officials said, is in the Baltic republics, since the United States does not recognize Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as part of the Soviet Union. But even there, Mr. Bush has stopped short of endorsing the secessionist movement and chose not to visit the area during his trip to the Soviet Union.
American officials said Mr. Bush was acutely aware that however difficult these questions are for him, they are even more perplexing for Mr. Gorbachev, who is locked in an intense debate over how far to go in dismantling the current Soviet system. The officials said Mr. Bush knew also that his ability to influence events in the Soviet Union was also very limited.
"The Soviet Union can stay together or it can fall apart, but what we want to do is stay clean so we don't get blamed whichever way it goes," another official said. "We're going to sit on that fence until we get splinters."
Officials acknowledged that this policy is based on pragmatic, short-term goals, rather than a sweeping vision of what kind of Soviet Union might emerge from the current turmoil.
 
Discouraging Use of Force
 That vision, they said, is clouded by their inability to predict with any confidence what course Mr. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders will take. The officials said Mr. Bush was also convinced that the most important thing was to discourage the Soviet authorities from using force to stop the country from splintering.
After a few months of doubt, beginning last fall when Mr. Gorbachev seemed to lurch back toward the use of military and political coercion and increasing in January with the violent crackdown in the Baltic republics, Administration officials said they were now confident that the Soviet President was moving steadily toward reform.
As long as that is the case, they said, the United States believes that the precise final result is less important than insuring that the process is carried out democratically and peacefully.
"It's a lot easier, and I think justified, to talk about process as being more important than outcome, given that it's very hard right now to see an outcome that involves a reunited Soviet Union aggressively mobilized against the outside world," said Jeremy R. Azrael, a Soviet analyst with the Rand Corporation.
One case often made for maintaining a strong Moscow Government is concern over who would otherwise control the Soviet nuclear arsenal. But officials said that argument was losing credence in the Bush Administration.
"The Soviet Government has taken steps to centralize deployment and control of nuclear weapons, and none of the republics have said they want to republicanize them," a senior official said. "Russian policy, as opposed to Soviet policy, is that over time, they want influence over doctrine and strategy, but tactical control would be in a central command."
Still, officials said Mr. Bush was convinced that maintaining a central Soviet Government is important to his attempts to capitalize on the new level of superpower cooperation in areas like the Arab-Israeli conflict and the spread of nuclear and high-technology weapons.
"Our job isn't to say, 'Look, for our convenience, could you remain one nation,' " a senior official said. "But for a major military power and a major force in Europe and Asia, you would like to be able to work with someone or some body who speaks with authority on issues affecting actions outside its borders."
 
Worry About Muslims
 In addition, Administration officials said they were concerned that breaking apart the Soviet Union would produce intractable and violent disputes over borders that now cut across ethnic and religious lines.
Arnold Horlick, a Soviet specialist with the Rand Corporation, said the debate reflected the "enormous paradox shift that has taken place in the way we think about the Soviet Union."
"If you asked Western statesmen and analysts 10 years ago whether the break up of the Soviet Union is something to be hoped for or feared, you know what the answer would have been," Mr. Horlick said. "Now we are in a position where the weakness of a disintegrating Soviet Union is feared more than a monolothic one. Yugoslavia with nuclear weapons. That's what we fear."

After 14 Years, Is It Time For Another Look at Love?

 BODY:
Since 1686, this has been the official seal of New York City. Each element recalls a bit of history: the sailor on the left holds a plummet for testing depths when seeking a good harbor like New York's, and he stands beneath a cross-shaft, the early navigating instrument Henry Hudson is supposed to have used to plot the local latitude. On the right is one of the Algonquian Indians who lived in Manhattan. In the center are Dutch windmills and the beaver skins they traded, and the barrels of flour the English later exported. In 1977, the City Council changed the date on the seal. It had been 1664, the year four English warships took New Amsterdam from Peter Stuyvesant in the name of the Duke of York. Now it is 1625, the year New Amsterdam was founded after it was purchased for 60 guilders by Peter Minuit on behalf of his employers, the upstart Dutch West India Company. But over the years, other images -- sometimes even their mere silhouettes -- have come to say "New York City" far more effectively: The lady at right. The Brooklyn Bridge. The Flatiron Building. The Empire State Building, sometimes accessorized with a large ape. Even the Coney Island Parachute Jump. 
 Then, in 1977, another image cropped up, this one on a napkin the graphic artist Milton Glaser was using to sketch out an idea for a friend in the state Commerce Department who was trying to turn around a depressed tourism market. Before the logo became a commonplace, its appeal was that it had to be interpreted. "You feel smart when you figure it out," Mr. Glaser said. The agency that was given the campaign, Wells, Rich, Greene, started with the slogan: "I Live in New Hampshire but I Love New York," but later decided that shorter was sweeter. The logo succeeded so well that it has been imitated nearly to death, turning up even as "I <heart> Soweto" and "J'<heart> Fromage." Nonetheless, says Stephen Morello, deputy commissioner for marketing of the Department of Economic Development, given that the state has spent $150 million over the 14 ensuing years to ingrain it in the popular mind, "we are not scrapping I <heart> New York." But last year, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, New York's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Development, said she might like to find a logo just for New York City, one to be unveiled in time for next year's Democratic National Convention and the 500th anniversary of Columbus's Voyage. The New York Times asked a group of graphic artists and advertising agencies to submit their own ideas for such a logo. At right are some of their responses.

Germany's East Wing of the Common European Home

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
WHENEVER Russia has opened a window to the West, it has looked to Germany. Germany, too, has always been drawn more east than west -- as an agent of trade and enlightenment in past centuries, of destruction and disaster in this.
Now, with the cold war finally dissipating, not only the Soviet Union but all the countries of Eastern Europe are looking again to the Germans for economic help, despite their considerable political misgivings stemming from memories of Hitler and World War II. 
 And Germans, because of a wish to redeem their past and because of their geographical and cultural closeness to the Russians, would like to give even more aid than they already have.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has temporarily run out of money because of the costs of absorbing East Germany, but he will be, in effect, an advocate in absentia for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when President Bush goes to Moscow for the Soviet-American summit this week.
Earlier this month, in London, Mr. Kohl was very much present and on Mr. Gorbachev's side at his historic encounter with the leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies; he unsuccessfully tried to persuade the United States, Japan, and his European colleagues that they should step up and give as much for the cause of change in the Soviet Union as the Germans had done -- $31 billion in pledges, loans or outright payments in the last year.
 
Working Within Europe
 While Germany leads the rest of Europe on building economic relations with the Soviet Union and the emerging democracies of the old Warsaw Pact, it is by no means alone. Italy and France have long been on the side of doing more for the Russians than the Americans wanted.
And while Prime Minister John Major of Britain went into the London summit resisting full Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund, his aides said he came out saying Britain was not against it, but had to go along with the United States, Canada and Japan.
Germany was also the reason for Mr. Major's change. To keep his job, Mr. Major has to win a general election some time within the next 11 months, and he has chosen to do it not as his predecessor Margaret Thatcher did, leading Britannia invicta against all non-English-speaking foreigners, but as a European among Europeans. He is cultivating good relations with Mr. Kohl and his colleagues to increase Britain's influence inside the European Community, which is where he has decided Britain's future lies.
It isn't only geography that explains the Germans' new eastward attraction, the Drang nach Osten of the 1990's. Some of it is guilt and the wish to atone for the sins of the Nazis, by extending a helping hand now. Some of it is relief: They are so grateful for the Soviet Union's agreement last year to let the two parts of their country reunite within the NATO alliance that it sometimes seems there is little they won't do, short of quitting NATO, to try to help Mr. Gorbachev.
Germany didn't protest strongly earlier this year when Soviet soldiers guarding a missile base in eastern Germany shot at German officers trying to get a close look at it, nor when high-ranking Soviet military commanders flew in without permission to inspect some of their 300,000 troops who will not be withdrawn until 1994.
Worrying that the Germans would be too compliant with the Russians was a cold war preoccupation of anti-Soviet hard-liners in Washington. They were bothered as well by what seemed a perhaps overly romantic notion that the Germans had -- that only they really understand the Russians and the people of what they call Mitteleuropa.
This notion persists. What is more, it has an echo on the Soviet side, particularly evident to anyone who observed the personal chemistry between Eduard A. Shevardnadze, when he was the Soviet Foreign Minister, and his German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. To some extent, the Germans got their unity by schmoozing up to the Russians, and they feel that their economic and trade position in the new Europe of the future will depend on preserving good relations with them as well.
Some American diplomats here see a risk that all this bridge-building could end up endangering the strategic economic interests of the United States in Europe in the 21st century.
There are those in Central Europe who worry about being absorbed in some latter-day greater East European co-prosperity sphere dominated by Germany. They need foreign capital, and General Motors and other large American companies have made some big plant investments. But the smaller investments on which continued economic development depends seem likely to come mainly from Germany.
Czechoslovakia, for instance, now has 330 joint business ventures with Germany and 348 with Austria, but only 49 with the United States, according to the German Chamber of Trade and Commerce; Germany is the largest exporter to Czechoslovakia and has become Hungary's biggest trade partner as well.
But because of the history of the first half of this century, the Germans have to be careful. Sensitivities in Yugoslavia are particularly acute, whether the Germans say they favor keeping the country together or favor letting Slovenia and Croatia have their independence if they want it; Yugoslavs, like all other Eastern Europeans, remember too vividly how the Nazis took them apart and wonder, unfairly perhaps, about German designs on them today.
The Soviets, after being fixated on the idea of strategic military parity with the United States, may have decided that America is now far away and too far ahead to catch up with. Germany is right at their doorstep, eager to please, and probably better able to help them rebuild their shattered economy.
Two hundred years ago, Catherine the Great -- a German -- imported tens of thousands of hard-working German farmers to bring Russian agriculture out of the mud. Today their descendants are returning to Germany, at a rate of more than 50,000 a year. But the welcome is wearing thin with the mounting problems of reunification, and nearly a quarter of the labor force in eastern Germany is now out of work.
Bonn turned down almost all of the 57,430 applications for asylum it received from Eastern Europe last year. Now, the fear that millions of Russians will be knocking at their doors if the Soviet Union collapses may well be the biggest reason of all why the Germans want to help Moscow.

HEADLINE: Price Rises Rule Postwar Cairo's Scuttlebutt

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
Across this city as summer builds, the talk has turned from war's high drama to far more humdrum scripts -- the cost of gas and taxicabs and most other things afflicted by a scourge of suddenly rising prices.
During the Persian Gulf war, President Hosni Mubarak staked a claim as leader of the so-called moderate Arabs, America's most resolute Arab ally in turbulence that seemed to offer gains to offset the risks. The economic crisis befalling his land, by contrast, is far less easy to either confront or wish away and has now re-emerged to haunt him. 
 In some ways, the crisis -- so deep rooted and long running that it is part of society's fabric -- reflects a familiar phenomenon in this region.
In Egypt, the discussion turns on a peculiar legacy: For decades -- some would say centuries or even millennia -- this society has endured on a crude but effective social contract that is now threatened by economic reforms instilled at the behest of the International Monetary Fund.
"The pharaoh has always been responsible for supplying the minimum, and the Egyptian expects it," said Galal Amin, an economist at the American University of Cairo. "It is so much part of Egypt, this expectation that the Government is morally obliged to have the children accepted at school, to put bread in the bakery, to provide the basics."
Since the fall of the monarchy in 1952, that relationship has been cemented in place by subsidies that kept prices of staple goods low, by jobs in the bureaucracy for college graduates and by guaranteed free education for the rising population of over 55 million.
But Western economists say those subsidies and bloated Government expenditures have also contributed to a skewed and indebted economy that has lost all claim to self-sufficiency.
That, in turn, has produced its own paradox. Diplomatically, Egypt has by tradition been the centerweight of Arab diplomacy; it is Washington's main regional ally and the most populous nation in the Middle East. But, economically its underpinnings are frail.
The International Monetary Fund, in negotiations with the Government over the last three years, has offered help in debt rescheduling and financial aid in return for changes that strip away subsidies and send prices skyward.
"Over the next year or 18 months, the old social compact here is going to be under a lot of strain," a Western diplomat said. "It's going to be difficult to keep on providing what people expect."
That shows through in many conversations across Egypt's social strata.
"I'm planning to get married," said a 24-year-old middle-class office worker. "But suddenly, I find the fridge I wanted has gone up by one-third because there's a new sales tax. So I can't afford it."
Talk to any cabby and he'll say gas prices went up by a third in May. Kerosene for cooking stoves increased by 50 percent while the cost of utilities -- telephones and electric power -- has increased by 30 to 50 percent. Significantly, though, the price of bread, which was allowed to creep up last year, and sugar, of which Egypt is a major consumer in sweet tea and pastries, have not gone up again this year.
"There has been a considerable period of crunch," said a Western economist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "And there are more price rises to come in only a few months' time."

HEADLINE: Beijing Cracks Down on Mongol Dissidents

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 27

 BODY:
Internal Government documents made available today show that the security forces have suppressed two dissident organizations in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia and detained their leaders.
The documents, obtained and made public by Asia Watch, a New York-based human rights group, report that the two organizations "sowed dissension" and opposed socialism while encouraging a rebirth of Mongol culture. Two leaders were arrested in May, and 26 members of one of the groups were kept under house arrest. Some of those detained were Communist Party members, the documents say. 
 The documents were noteworthy not only for the report of the crackdown, but also because they were the first clear evidence of a pro-independence movement in Inner Mongolia.
The Government always insists that the ethnic Mongols in Inner Mongolia are happy to be under Chinese rule, and in recent years there have been few signs of open discontent.
Unrest in the Soviet Union's minority areas has alarmed Chinese leaders, who want to insure that such problems do not erupt in China. Already there have been serious protests and what appear to be growing pro-independence movements in Tibet and the northwest Xinjiang region, inhabited by people ethnically related to Turks.
Over all, ethnic minorities in China account for less than 8 percent of the total population, so the threat from minority uprisings is not as significant in China as it is in the Soviet Union. Still, Inner Mongolia has considerable potential for ethnic unrest, and the discovery of the two organizations has almost certainly sent alarm bells ringing among the security forces throughout the area.
"The two illegal organizations ostensibly used the discussion of 'national culture' and 'national modernization' in public," says one of the documents, which was stamped top secret. "But in fact their erroneous stand and reactionary views and the many illegal activities they engage in clearly show that their real aim was to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist system, to incite a national split and to undermine the unification of the motherland."
It is not clear whether the two groups, called the Ih Ju League National Culture Society and the National Modernization Society, actually tried to overthrow the Government, as one of the documents says. It acknowledges that the groups tried to register legally, but were refused by the authorities.
It also says that dissidents in Inner Mongolia were trying to reunite with the neighboring country of Mongolia, which declared its independence in 1921. In the last year, Mongolia has essentially abandoned Communism and embarked upon an ambitious economic and political restructuring program.
The United States and international organizations are giving assistance, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived in Mongolia on Thursday for a short visit before he makes his way to Moscow for the summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev next week.
The documents suggest that the changes in Mongolia may have inspired the Inner Mongolia dissidents. The documents contain excerpts from what appear to be the groups' newsletters, including one that says that this is a "very opportune moment" with "favorable conditions for the reunification of the Mongolian nation."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Tying a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Election

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE nation's capital lives from news cycle to news cycle action followed by reaction followed by fallout. For many, the military victory in the Persian Gulf is an old story, quickly superseded by the continued friction with Saddam Hussein, the worries over Iraqi weapons capabilities, all the troublesome aftermath of the war.
But for the public at large, the war remains a powerful memory, and it is likely to have lasting political consequences. One year after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, President Bush strides the scene as a tested Commander in Chief with extraordinary approval ratings. Democrats are only beginning to stir from a crippling, months-long defensive crouch. The Presidential campaign is lurching to one of its latest starts in years. And in towns and cities across America, there are still banners flying that welcome soldiers home, still local celebrations of victory in the gulf, still yellow ribbons and placards declaring, "We support our troops." The monuments to the war are everywhere in American politics. 
 To be sure, the public opinion polls show a few signs of reappraisal. The general euphoria about the direction of the country just after the war has eased, reverting to a more pessimistic, pre-war level. There is concern about the aftermath of the war: A poll released last week showed that the percentage of adults who considered the war a "great victory" had dropped to 62 percent, down from 84 percent in March. Still, 80 percent say they believe America "did the right thing" in the gulf, according to the survey by the Americans Talk Issues Foundation.
 
Worrying About Saddam
 "The war is precious to people and I don't think they're going to give it up," said Stanley B. Greenberg, one of the polltakers. Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who voted against the resolution to use force in the gulf, agreed: "There are a large number of Americans concerned about Saddam still in power, but that doesn't detract from their feeling that the war was a tremendous military success, and they feel good about it."
There are numerous theories about the psychic importance of the war in the gulf, many revolving around a yearning for redemption after Vietnam.
Others, like Harrison Hickman, a Democratic polltaker argue, "The country needed a success, and it wasn't a pivot so much off of Vietnam as off the clear end of the go-go 80's." Whatever the cause, the war has taken its place in popular culture as a transcendent, heroic moment in national life, some analysts say, and Democrats expect endless replays of it in the 1992 campaign.
The war clearly was a transforming experience for Mr. Bush. "I don't think he'll ever hear the word wimp again," said Fred Meyer, the Texas Republican chairman. Somewhat more delicately, Bob Teeter, Mr. Bush's polltaker, said: "The public got to watch him handle the most difficult problem any President can handle, every day, almost on a play by play basis. It sharpened, it hardened, it firmed a definition of him as a leader."
Most important, it cast him as Commander in Chief, rather than as the beleaguered head of a country in recession. Democrats can play many sad variations of "what if" these days, and most begin with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August as the turning point. Remember, they say, that Mr. Bush a year ago had just broken his promise to forswear new taxes, faced outright rebellion on his party's right, seemed bogged down in a morass of domestic and budgetary woes as the nation was heading into a recession.
Even today, as Democrats struggle to turn the debate to domestic issues, Mr. Bush clings to his role as head of state, traveling abroad and focusing on trouble spots from the Middle East to the Soviet Union.
The war transformed the Democrats as well: It froze them for months. With half a million troops arrayed in the gulf against Saddam Hussein, it was not an auspicious moment to mount a partisan challenge to the President. Moreover, most Congressional Democrats opposed the resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf, which put them on the defensive. After the war, many Democrats seemed dispirited, stunned into inaction by the President's popularity. "The war essentially has delayed the active pursuit of the Presidency by Democrats for almost a year," said Thomas Donilon, a veteran Democratic Presidential campaign strategist.
Such a delay can have important consequences, Mr. Donilon said. In the summer of 1983, Ronald Reagan was taking his hits from Walter F. Mondale and a bevy of other Democratic hopefuls. Until only recently, one had to look hard for signs of an imminent Presidential campaign, leaving Mr. Bush above the fray. The late start also means that many of the Democratic hopefuls, who are mostly novices in Presidential politics, will have to find their footing, their finances and their voice very quickly.
 
Case for Change
 "His rationale is, 'I'm Commander in Chief, I've won a war, we're coming out of recession, there's no compelling case for change, and they're risky,' " Mr. Donilon said. "The other side is, there is a compelling case for change."
Many Democrats have pinned their hopes on the domestic concerns of the middle class. "George Bush seems to have an economic recovery program for the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Kuwait, and I think a lot of Americans are saying we need an economic development plan for America," said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman.
Kevin Phillips, the conservative analyst who predicted a tide of economic populism after the 1980's, argues that these trends still exist, but have been suppressed by the war, just as Watergate suppressed the conservative tides in the mid-70's. Mr. Phillips said these issues of economic equity will inevitably rise in the 1990's.
But Republicans seem unlikely to let the debate shift away from foreign policy for very long.
"It's clearly there in the public's mind," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. "Politicians don't create images and issues, they discover them. You ask my mama about George Bush and she's going to bring up the war." Mr. Gramm also argues that a vote against the use of force resolution will be "a silver bullet" in Senate races next year.
Mr. Bush's polltakers speak with simple confidence of the power of the war in the public's consciousness. Regardless of the aftermath, Mr. Teeter said: "There was both a principle and a favorable result. We did what we said we were going to do. It was a principle worth going to war for." For now, the "welcome home" banners still fly. And the Democrats are still struggling to adjust to a politics remade by the Persian Gulf.

New Rows to Hoe in the 'Harvest of Shame'

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
IN his famous 1960 CBS documentary, "Harvest of Shame," Edward R. Murrow pleaded for Federal legislation to protect, house, and educate the "workers in the sweatshops of the soil," migrant farm laborers. In dribs and drabs, the years that followed produced a succession of laws designed to lessen the worst abuses against farm workers caught in a life Mr. Murrow likened to bondage.
But despite decades of intended reforms, Government investigators are finding that farm workers are still denied the basic health, safety, and income protections enjoyed by most other Americans. 
 At a Congressional hearing this month, an official of the General Accounting Office depicted a tattered social safety net. He said that some of the holes were created on purpose, as with safety laws that specifically omit farm workers. In other instances, he said, the problems stemmed from lax enforcement of existing laws.
As a result, many migrant laborers continue to be exposed to dangerous pesticides as they work in the fields and denied access to toilets and drinking water. Because they frequently travel, they have difficulty enrolling in state-run social programs, like Medicaid. At day's end, many still go home to shacks, with minimal enforcement of housing codes.
And a bad situation may be getting worse. Advocates say that many employers are using new accounting practices that deprive farm workers of unemployment benefits and worker's compensation and leave many unable to collect full Social Security benefits.
"The farm workers are a forgotten society, and their rights are completely ignored on a daily basis," said Representative Edward R. Roybal, the California Democrat who heads the House Select Committee on Aging. One Federal estimate put the number of migrant and seasonal farm workers, and their dependents, at 4.2 million.
At a hearing convened last year on the 30th anniversary of Mr. Murrow's broadcast, Mr. Roybal asked the G.A.O. to study the gaps in Federal programs designed to protect the laborers. Joseph F. Delfico of the accounting office returned this month, along with several advocates, and gave Mr. Roybal an earful.
Mr. Delfico said that Federal regulations do not require farmers to tell laborers what pesticides they use, the potential dangers, or the relevant first aid procedures. Employers in other industries are required to disclose such information about dangerous chemicals.
In addition, he said that the Environmental Protection Agency had inadequate regulations for pesticide use and enforced them loosely. The E.P.A. found 663 violations of pesticide laws in 1990, but ordered fines in only 42 cases. Even when fines are assessed, Mr. Delfico said, they are often too low to act as a deterrent.
A similar pattern exists with laws regarding field sanitation, which exempt many small farms from rules requiring toilets and drinking water in the fields.
Mr. Delfico said that on farms where such facilities are required, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found sanitation violations in 69 percent of its inspections last year but rarely fined first offenders.
Labor organizers and farm workers testified that many of the problems stemmed from the growing practice of defining migrant laborers as independent subcontractors, rather than employees.
Reducing their number of formal employees allows many farmers to avoid health and safety laws, which generally exempt farms with fewer than 11 employees. But the practice exacts large costs from the workers.
Farm workers defined as subcontractors must pay 15.3 percent of their income in Social Security taxes, rather than the 7.65 percent that regular employees pay. In addition, they cannot collect unemployment insurance or workers' compensation.
Many farm workers find themselves owing large debts to the Federal Government, including fines and interest, because they failed to pay the proper amount of Social Security taxes. In other instances, contractors for whom the laborers worked failed to make the required contributions, and retired farm workers collect less money as a result.
Mr. Delfico described an array of problems for farm workers seeking income supplements and health benefits. In many states, they earn slightly too much money to qualify for welfare. This, in turn, can keep them from getting Medicaid, since the two are often linked. And those farm workers who do qualify for Medicaid coverage often travel and have trouble finding doctors who will treat them under out-of-state programs.
The Federal Migrant Health Program operates rural clinics set up to address such gaps, but because of budget constraints has only enough clinics to serve about 16 percent of the nation's farm workers, Mr. Delfico said.
One encouraging note in the day's testimony came from a three-way collaboration to improve farm labor conditions in northwest Ohio. There, the H.J. Heinz Company, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee and a group of growers negotiated an agreement that provides for increased spending by the companies on health and housing and pledges from the laborers to boost productivity. The agreement makes all the laborers employees, rather than subcontractors.
Among those appearing before Mr. Roybal was Elizabeth Whitely of the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents growers. She had little to say in direct response to Mr. Delfico's findings, but told Congress that most farmers have "a genuine regard" for their workers.
Mr. Delfico's conclusions, like Mr. Murrow's decades before, were less bright.
In 1960, Mr. Murrow told viewers that, "the people you have seen have the strength to harvest your fruit and vegetables. They do not have the strength to influence legislation. Maybe we do."
This month, Mr. Delfico told Congress that, "if history is any guide," progress in the lives of farm workers "may prove to be difficult and slow."

HEADLINE: Black Journalists Fear Setbacks From Recession

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 27

 BODY:
Members of the National Association of Black Journalists attending its annual convention here say the group made great strides in the last decade in promoting diversity in newsrooms around the country. But at the same time the members are worrying that the recession could impair the future hiring of blacks and undercut past accomplishments.
"One of the things that is discouraging about this year is that we are revisiting, as if it was brand new, the issue of affirmative action," said Reginald Stuart, political editor for The Philadelphia Daily News. "There had been a half-dozen reports presented at this convention on that issue, and they say nothing that we didn't know 20 years ago when the first generation of journalists were entering the newsrooms." 
 The effects of the recession were very much in evidence at this year's conference. The number of registrants, 1,300, while more than association executives had projected, is still far less than the 1,800 people who registered for the 1990 conference, in Los Angeles, and the 1,900 at the New York conference, in 1989. Several of those attending this year, including members of the association's executive board, said they had had to pay their own expenses to attend, unlike in previous years when many of their news organizations picked up the tab.
In addition, many who are looking for work or looking to move into larger job markets found fewer recruiters than in past years, and many of the recruiters did not have jobs to offer.
"It's a horrible time to be out of work," said Kuae Noel Kelch, a 25-year-old television producer who was seeking employment. "Jobs are scarce and are more scarce in broadcast than in print. We're all approaching the job market skeptically."
 Several people recruiting for news organizations acknowledged that fewer jobs were available this year, but they said they did not necessarily see the picture as bleak as it might appear to others.
"We have jobs available for a general assignment reporter, copy editor, feature writer and a position in sports," said Leslie Ansley, who was conducting interviews for jobs at USA Weekend, a Gannett publication. "It's not as many as in the past; but unlike other companies, we are hiring."
Similarly, Drew Berry, news director for WCAU-TV in Philadelphia, a CBS affiliate, said his station was also looking for new employees.
"What people have to understand is that just because Booth A may not have a job if you are a talented applicant, you're going to write that name down and pass it on to other recruiters or to colleagues for future reference," said Mr. Berry, whose station was looking to hire a reporter, a writer and a producer.
 
First Woman as Leader
 Among other activities here was the election of officers; the association chose a woman as president for the first time in its 17-year history.
In a closely contested race in which more than half the 1,300 people attending the conventioncast votes, Sidmel Estes-Sumpter, a television producer, was elected to lead the 2,100-member group, which represents blacks in the broadcast and print media.
In another first, four of the remaining five top executive positions in the association, whose membership is two-thirds female, also went to women.
 "We have shattered a ceiling," said Gayle Pollard Terry, a former member of the board and an editorial writer at The Los Angeles Times. "Women have always been allowed to lead at midlevel in this organization, but to elect a woman as president says that we can lead and manage not just at that level in the N.A.B.J., but also at our various news organizations."
Mrs. Estes-Sumpter, who has served on the association's board for the last year and who produces the evening news program for WAGA-TV in Atlanta, said she planned to appoint men to top-level positions in her administration.
"We will be practicing our own affirmative action within the N.A.B.J.," Mrs. Estes-Sumpter said. "We want the board of the association to be representative of the N.A.B.J.'s population."

HEADLINE: A World Trade Center For Westchester

 BODY:
On June 30, the Westchester Weekly featured an article under the headline "With Soaring Taxes Forecast, Development Can Offer The Answer." Then Business Day printed a seemingly unrelated Careers column [July 2]entitled "Creating Jobs By Building Export Trade." These articles, on closer look, are intimately entwined.
In 1989, the Work In Westchester Task Force sounded a clarion call to cure the deficiencies in the workforce or face the unpleasant fact that "Westchester will become a less attractive place to live and work."
In just two short years, the focus of economic alarm has shifted to the stagnation of new business development in the county. We continue on a very troubled path. 
 The fine BDO Seidman report, Business Development and Economic Vitality, tells it like it is and presents an extremely professional argument for immediate action to stimulate new business development. But as it clearly states up front, it does not pretend to be a "how-to" manual. The "how" is left to the readers' imagination and ingenuity.
Quite coincidentally, after reading the BDO Seidman report, I was participating in a meeting on international trade in the New York World Trade Center when the answer to Westchester's current economic woes suddenly lit up my mind:
"The answer is here, surrounding me in these twin towers," I thought. "A Westchester World Trade Center!"
As founder of a Westchester group of former executives of the International Business Machines Corporations who are developing customized training and computer programs to stimulate trade, I've witnessed first-hand the incredible thirst and demand for United States products and knowledge overseas. Today, 80 percent of our national growth is driven by international trade and this proportion is increasing rapidly.
With the American economy locked to the global economy, the growth of new business activity is inextricably linked to international trade. Wherever a World Trade Center has been built, it has acted as a prime stimulus for a region's international commerce. Such growth means more jobs, greater community stability, greater wealth, lower property taxes, and healthier business, retailing and banking climates -- just what the BDO Seidman report calls for.
One need only look to the twin towers at the tip of Manhattan to find a very successful model. It encompasses a modern hotel, meeting rooms, trade-show facilities, state-of-the-art communications, an international electronic network tying together bids to buy and sell, a World Trade Institute for training and language instruction, XPORT (the Port Authority's Trading Company, which helps businesses establish trading operations) and thousands of offices.
It is time for the barons of Westchester to unite in a common vision and strategy, to realize our potential as a world-class community by making it a center for international commerce.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Reshaping of New York City Hits Black-Hispanic Alliance

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Merely remaking the maps was as simple as playing with blocks. But the process of redistricting New York City's Council opened old wounds between black and Hispanic politicians that may take years to heal.
The purpose behind expanding the City Council was to greatly enhance the representation of minority groups, from nine of the existing 35 members who are black or Hispanic to a larger proportion among the 51 new ones. 
 But after years of waiting for a chance to share political power with whites, the city's minority groups began fighting one another over how to parcel out that power, each pushing for what it saw as its fair share.
 
Convoluted Map Pleased Few
 The map that resulted was a convoluted tangle that pleased few besides incumbents, and pleased Hispanic groups least of all. The United States Justice Department, playing referee, agreed with their contention that the lines favored black candidates.
 On Friday, Federal officials approved a new map that had been revised in small ways to meet their concerns, although legal challenges still thrreaten the elections. But while the plan was accepted, the conflicts that had emerged may prove to be the central challenge for politics in New York for years to come.
Religion and ethnicity have traditionally defined New York City politics; today race does.
Driven by the most visible change in its population in four centuries, the nation is redefining itself in multicultural terms, which, if encapsulated in a book about the emerging identity crisis, might be titled: "Goodbye Columbus."
Typically, New York, like California and Florida, is on the cutting edge of change. For the first time in nearly 400 years, non-Hispanic whites now constitute a minority in the nation's largest city.
"New York has become a polity without a clear-cut ethnic majority," said Louis Winnick, an urban analyst.
For the first time, New York's Mayor is black. Yet while politics remains a vehicle for mobility, social and economic power remains overwhelmingly in the hands of whites, whose dominance may be perpetuated beyond their numbers unless the political newcomers coalesce.
 
Multicultural Appeal for Unity
 Last week, Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn, who is black, and Dennis Rivera, the hospital workers' union leader who is of Hispanic heritage, appealed for unity.
"The city's permanent government -- that group of private interests who continue to receive, with no accountability, the benefits of our society regardless of who holds office -- remains intact," Mr. Owens and Mr. Rivera said in a statement. "And they are the ones who stand to gain from this so-called division."
It is arguable whether the latest rifts signal a new parochialism, but what is certain is that they have been worsened by changes in the way politics works.
"What's different is the role of the Department of Justice and the decline of the party," said Nathan Glazer, the Harvard professor of sociology and education who was the co-author of "Beyond the Melting Pot" with Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
As a result, he said, "instead of hammering these matters out in the smoke-filled clubhouse where it doesn't get onto the front pages and where you're doing basically the same thing -- protecting an incumbent or making it easier for newcomers if you decide their time has come -- you have the searchlight of attention that just exaggerates the conflicts."
Those conflicts were heightened by the Justice Department's objections, which coincided with the Republican Party's national strategy of appealing to Hispanic voters.
The latest political divisions also represent a predictable strain on an alliance based largely on a common economic agenda -- "short people drown first in the floods," was how Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Manhattan Democratic leader, put it.
 
Test of Dinkins's Coalition
 The first test of whether the coalition between black and Hispanic politicians that brought Mayor David N. Dinkins to office can survive redestricting may come in the Council elections themselves. The stakes will be even higher two years from now when not only the full Council will be up for re-election, but Mr. Dinkins will, too.
But the coalition between black and Hispanic New Yorkers was riven from the start by social and cultural distinctions and by the personal political ambitions that had split others before them.
"There's no automatic alliance," said Herman Badillo, a former Congressman and Bronx Borough President, any more than there is one between Jews and Italians, except that whites were quick to lump black and Hispanic New Yorkers together as a group -- just as members of the non-Hispanic white minority are often referred to as a group now, regardless of their ethnic origin or religion.
"The white perspective is that blacks and Hispanics never disagree," said Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Bronx Democrat, "and if we disagree, it's the end of an era."
 
Partners in Poverty
 By the time Puerto Ricans arrived, they and blacks were partners in poverty. They witnessed newer immigrants -- Asians, but also black and Hispanic newcomers from the Caribbean and South America -- beginning to pass them by.
The velocity of change can be measured in one City Council district in western Queens where a divisive race -- between candidates of Chinese and Korean origin -- was only narrowly averted this summer.
The competition that had begun earlier over the division of anti-poverty money flared again in 1977 when neither Mr. Badillo nor Percy E. Sutton, a black man who was Borough President of Manhattan, would defer to the other in the Democratic mayoral primary. Eight years later, the tenuous coalition between black and Hispanic politicians -- united in their opposition to a white Mayor, Edward I. Koch -- collapsed when blacks endorsed Mr. Farrell for Mayor over Mr. Badillo.
But the coalition that helped elect Mario M. Cuomo Governor in 1982, came together again for the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson in the 1984 and 1988 presidential primaries and, most pivotally, for Mr. Dinkins two years ago.
Transforming the ideal of minority representation spelled out in the city's new Charter into a reality was daunting. Members of the Districting Commission itself were supposed to reflect the city's population, but, with the Mayor sharing appointments with the Council Speaker, black political insurgents predominated over the Hispanic appointees. Diversity among blacks themselves was evident in Brooklyn, where black mayoral appointees to the commission tried to unseat a number of black incumbents tied to the Democratic organization.
Political realities distorted the process: a desire by the Council Speaker's appointees to protect incumbents; the dispersion of Hispanics and Asians, which made it more difficult to place them neatly into districts where they constituted a majority; and the fact that even where Hispanic residents made up most of the population, many were ineligible to vote.
In no district did Hispanic politicians find favoritism toward blacks more blatant than in Jackson Heights, Queens. Three days before the final districting plan was approved last month, the Lefrak City housing development, with its large bloc of black voters, was drawn into the district -- still giving it a bare majority Hispanic population but favoring Helen Marshall, a black Assemblywoman who is seeking the Council seat.
 In revising the maps last week to meet the objections of Hispanic voting rights advocates, the Districting Commission shifted Lefrak City to an adjacent district.

HEADLINE: 92d Street Y Seeking Gift of $40 Million

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
The 92d Street Y, whose lecturers and performers have included Albert Einstein, Zero Mostel, T. S. Eliot and Yo-Yo Ma, is celebrating its 117th anniversary this year with a $40 million fund-raising campaign.
"The Y never loses sight of its roots and traditions, even as it changes to meet developing needs of the population it serves," said Daniel R. Kaplan, a New York lawyer and the Y's president. "At a time of fiscal crises and cutbacks in services, we're saying New York City is livable and we are helping to make it more livable." 
 Visits from Einstein, Eliot, Mostel and the cellist Mr. Ma were part of the Y's annual schedule of programs, which now includes more than 1,800 classes and events.
 
Diversity of Activities
 "We lack the elegance of a Lincoln Center or the cachet of Carnegie Hall," said Sol Adler, the Y's executive director, "but we offer an almost dizzying diversity of activities."
Programs at the Y range from infant care to dance and exercise for older adults. And then there are the uncounted, unplanned activities for people like Lillian Goldberg Lieber, who says she is 70-plus and calls the Y "a great place to hang out."
Part of the money from the fund-raising drive will go toward renovations: adding a marquee over the main entrance on Lexington Avenue and another at the concert hall entrance on 92d Street, and installing floodlights to illuminate the building's carved limestone facade. The Y's 62-year-old health and fitness center will be also be renovated, and its residence for 400 young adults, which is operating below capacity, will be modernized.
The Y gets 75 percent of its $20 million annual budget from fees and ticket sales and must raise $4 million to $5 million from contributions and income from its $20 million endowment. Another $594,000 was received last year from Federal, state and city governments for programs in the arts and social services, but such support is certain to be reduced because of budget cuts.
 
Running Against the Tide
 Starting a $40 million fund-raising drive in tight economic times is running against the tide, Mr. Kaplan said. Last spring, Y employees picketed for three weeks before a contract dispute was settled without a strike.
Already, Mr. Kaplan said, $21 million has been pledged by foundations and private contributors. The Tisch family has pledged $5 million toward reorganizing Y programs, like concerts by the New York Chamber Symphony, Jazz in July and Monday night poetry readings. The programs will be grouped under a new Tisch Center for the Arts.
Another $5 million has been pledged by the Samuel C. Bronfman Foundation toward the establishment of the Bronfman Center for Jewish Life. The center's program includes annual services for the High Holidays and seminars by Jewish scholars.
An unofficial roster of artists and writers who are part of the Y's history is kept by Steven Siegel. Zero Mostel taught at the Y in the 30's, he said, and the comedian Sam Levenson came to the Y and remembered, "as a child I scratched a little on the violin."
There are dozens of affectionate comments in the files: T. S. Eliot wrote, "There is no place in America where I more enjoy giving a reading." And Mr. Ma wrote, "I will always be grateful for the encouragemment I received when I needed it most."
Albert Einstein visited during the 30's, Mr. Siegel said. He was the only living person whose name was enshrined on the walls of Kaufmann Concert Hall. "Some of our elderly members tell us he looked at his name, and said, 'You shouldn't have done it,' " Mr. Siegel said. "But he obviously was deeply moved."

HEADLINE: Owner of Happy Land Building Faces Foreclosure on Properties

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Alexander DiLorenzo 3d, the owner of the Bronx building that housed the Happy Land social club and an heir to one of New York's larger real-estate empires, faces foreclosure proceedings on about 100 properties.
Some real-estate professionals say they believe he may have provoked the foreclosures, which affect about 40 percent of his holdings, to force the renegotiation of his debts. 
 The foreclosure proceedings are contained in lawsuits filed in recent months in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. All involve the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created by the Federal Government to bail out bankrupt savings-and-loan associations.
The largest foreclosure involves 72 Manhattan properties controlled by Mr. DiLorenzo. The holders of the $68 million mortgage on the properties are the BRT Realty Trust, a company with headquarters in Great Neck, L.I., and the Resolution Trust Corporation, which took over a failed savings and loan in Southern California. They declared Mr. DiLorenzo in default in May, after he missed three monthly payments.
 
In the Hands of a Receiver
 The company initiated the foreclosure proceedings in June and all 72 properties have been placed in the hands of a receiver, according to legal papers filed in State Supreme Court.
Mr. DiLorenzo did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment. An official of the BRT Realty Trust and lawyers representing the company declined to comment.
The recession and the real-estate slump have caused a financial squeeze for many developers and property owners, and led to a rise in foreclosures. In some cases, developers have deliberately defaulted to force banks, which in most cases would prefer not to become the owners of the properties, to stretch out payments or revise mortgage rates.
Several real-estate professionals speculated that Mr. DiLorenzo may have defaulted to force BRT to renegotiate his mortgage. He was paying an interest rate of 12.37 percent, according to the lawsuit, and may be seeking more favorable terms.
 
'Trying to Work Something Out'
 "I don't think he intends to let the properties slip away," said a real-estate professional familiar with Mr. DiLorenzo's holdings, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that he not be identified. "An effort is being made and will be made to try to work something out."
Sue Brown, a spokeswoman for the Resolution Trust Corporation in Washington, said yesterday that officials were "trying to work something out." She said that, in all, 106 properties controlled by Mr. DiLorenzo were now subject to foreclosure proceedings by the corporation.
Two developers familiar with Mr. DiLorenzo's holdings said, however, that they believed the defaults were not strategic, but instead reflected deep financial distress.
They said many of the properties were small, rundown buildings with little value in the current real-estate market. Many are in midtown Manhattan, and were apparently bought in the hope of assembling large parcels of land that could be redeveloped for office towers. It will be a long time before such assemblages have much market value, given the current oversupply of office space, they said.
 
'Ups and Downs of the Cycle'
 "These long-shot, speculative strategies are always subject to the ups and downs of the cycle," said a developer who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. DiLorenzo, along with his brother and sister, inherited a large real-estate empire from his late father, Alexander DiLorenzo Jr. It includes land under several prominent buildings, including the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South and buildings on Wall Street, Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue. The land is often leased to the building owners.
The defaults and foreclosures are primarily on the less valuable parts of the portfolio, including the rundown midtown sites intended for assemblages and many older apartment or commercial buildings in Harlem, Inwood, and other parts of Manhattan.
The Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, decided last November that Alexander DiLorenzo was not criminally responsible for the arsonist's fire that killed 87 patrons at the Happy Land social club in March 1990. Mr. DiLorenzo leased the building on Southern Boulevard in the Bronx to two real-estate brokers, who in turn sublet the site to Elias Colon, who owned and operated the club, and died in the fire.
Last February, the Dinkins administration filed five misdemeanor charges stemming from building-code violations against Mr. DiLorenzo and one of the real-estate brokers, Jay Weiss. They face as much as six months in jail and maximum fines of $5,000.

HEADLINE: Still Looking: The Changing Job Market/A special report.;
For Forlorn Millions, the Recession Goes On

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BEDFORD, Mass.

 BODY:
The experts say the economy is growing again after a year in a recession, but tell that to Charles Moreira. A despairing 22-year-old waiting for yet another job counseling session in the New Bedford office of the Massachusetts state employment agency, Mr. Moreira is his family's sole wage earner because his wife stays home with their 3-year-old child.
Mr. Moreira, a mechanic, lost a $6.75-an-hour job in an automobile dealership last December and has been looking fruitlessly for work since. His $170 a week in unemployment benefits has run out. He is vying with scores of similarly strapped contenders for a warehouse job that pays $6 an hour. 
 "I'm kind of disgusted," he said. "I'm losing all my ambition. I wanted to be the greatest." What about going to a boom town somewhere? "I don't have the money," he said.
Although the Government announced on Friday that the overall economy gained by four-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June quarter, nearly nine million people are still out of work and looking for jobs. The Government does not count several million more among the unemployed because they have given up looking. For all the unemployed, the recession is still going strong. Worse, more of the jobs that are now being offered are inferior to the old ones.
 
 Fewer Jobs, Worse Jobs
 High-wage jobs with full benefits are losing ground to lower-wage jobs with fewer benefits, many of them part-time or temporary. More than in the past, the unemployed find themselves treated like anonymous commodities, hired and then fired, bought out or laid off, with less of the old premium allowed for loyalty or seniority.
As recessions end, some disappointment is predictable. On getting wind of an improving economy, people who have dropped out of the labor force start looking again. Others look more earnestly with the end of their unemployment benefits, which are often more than $1,000 a month and usually last six months. That makes it harder for all to find jobs.
At the same time, employers put off hiring while they wait to be sure business is truly improving. Instead, they ask the workers whom they have kept on board to work longer and harder.
Mostly for those reasons, economists say, the unemployment rate rose only slightly in June, from 6.9 percent to 7 percent, even as most other gauges of the economy were gaining. In 1983, a whole year after the last, longer and harsher recession ended, the rate was 9.6 percent, hardly different from the high point of 9.7 percent in 1982.
But job seekers in New Bedford, Iowa City and Tyler, Tex., three vastly different cities, are encountering more unsettling trends.
New Bedford (population 99,992) is a sick old mill town, despite the mid-1980's signs of a renaissance there, with one of the nation's highest levels of unemployment. In Iowa City (population 59,738), the unemployment rate is rock bottom. But that's largely because so many workers there have part-time jobs. Tyler (population 75,450), like much of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Colorado, rides the booms and busts of oil. Unemployment there was declining last year when elsewhere it was rising, but now it seems to be worsening again.
These cities are not typical. No city truly is. Yet the three illustrate common themes of the national economy, in particular the new instability of anyone's job. And all three are feeling the heat of the bleak new features of the current job market.
One is hiring freezes and layoffs among government workers, an enormous army that accounts for 15 percent of all workers, following layoffs that major banks, computer companies and oil companies have announced in recent days. Another is the deterioration in the quality of jobs, portending further erosion in the standard of living that began for tens of millions of Americans more than a decade ago.
Government jobs used to be recession-proof. But in the year that ended in June, a Federal work force of 3.3 million has been cut to 2.9 million because spending cuts, so those people have joined the competition for private jobs. This summer, many state and local governments are preparing to dismiss thousands of their 15 million workers.
Unlike Washington, most state capitals are required by law to balance their budgets. With sharp cuts in Federal aid, on top of their declining tax revenues from recession-stalled businesses and consumers, many are plunging into the red.
Because of a 3.25 percent cut in all Iowa state spending, Hunter Rawlings 3d, president of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, said: "We're going to have to lay off some people. How many I can't tell. It won't be insignificant. Maybe 100."
New Bedford's Mayor, John K. Bullard, said his city had eliminated 300 of 2,800 workers, including half its park and cemetery crews.
Meanwhile, job seekers in New Bedford, Iowa City and Tyler find employers more miserly than ever. They are holding down wages and cutting benefits because of the burdens of both the debt that many amassed in the high spending 1980's and the doubling of medical-care costs in the decade.
Employers who provided employee health insurance are now asking employees to foot part of the bill. For the average non-executive American worker, whose wages have fallen 14 percent in real terms since 1977 because of inflation, this simply means another cut in pay.
"A lot of traditional patterns are being broken," said Richard Belous, senior economist at the National Planning Association, a research organization supported financially by both business and labor groups. "Once, you had a husband working and bringing home $12 an hour. Now, you can have a husband and wife working and bringing home $9 an hour together."
 
Tyler
Tough Times Amid the Roses
 Tyler is the hub of Smith County, the wettest dry county in Texas, people there say. The city grew first on peach farm ing, then on cotton, then on rose bushes, of which Tyler pro vides a third of the nation's suppply.
But in the 1930's the discovery of oil in Kilgore, 27 miles east, and the surge in oil prices a decade ago sparked Tyler's big growth, with real estate development and oil drilling, financed by loans from ever-ready banks.
Servicing the oil operators earned $150,000 a year in the early 1980's for Richard Clark, who is 38 years old and the father of four children. He has a business hauling gravel to oil fields. He used to have two trucks, but demand for the service is a quarter of what it once was. "I'm down to one truck," he said, "and it's been sitting in front of the house for the last four months."
Mr. Clark went back to school and became a freelance photographer, taking pictures at weddings and sporting events. His wife Linda, 34, quit her job this month as manager of a bakery. She said her paychecks were bouncing. Until she left, the Clarks were earning $35,000 a year.
For Tyler, as for most of Texas, the bubble burst with the plunge in oil prices in the mid-1980's. Construction stopped dead in Tyler, and banks sank under the debts of bankrupt speculators in oil and real estate.
The city's unemployment rate hovered near 9 percent for two years, while the nation's economy was generally thriving. Tyler suffered less than some other Texas communities, because hospitals, colleges and manufacturing companies lent the economy some diversity. But the recovery of the local economy that started in 1987 appears to have stalled this year: unemployment has been bouncing each month between 6 and over 7 percent after dropping to 5.5 percent in February.
 
 Coming Home to Hardship
 It is the best-paid jobs, in manufacturing, that are slipping away. The area has lost 500 of 12,100 factory jobs, most in the past year. Two leading manufacturers, a boat builder and a television maker, have shut down. Employment counselors tell people who cannot find jobs to go back to school or move.
Roy Cofer, 40, has made two big moves. With opportunities in Tyler scarce 20 years ago, Mr. Cofer went to Detroit. He was a polisher at a steel mill, earning $15 an hour two years ago. He lost the job. Unable to find other work in Detroit, Mr. Cofer, his wife, Colleen, then a cook at a restaurant, and their three children headed back home.
It paid off for about a year. In June last year, Mr. Cofer found work as a mold maker at a manufacturer of pipes for pipelines. He took a big cut in pay, to $6.40 an hour, and Mrs. Cofer was unable to find work. Still, the cost of living was lower, and Mr. Cofer started saving to make a down payment to buy their rented three-bedroom trailer home for $18,300.
Then, in March, Mr. Cofer was laid off with 400 other workers. He could be recalled -- a few have been -- but while waiting, he said he had mailed out 10 applications for other jobs and had not got a single interview.
This month, his unemployment benefits ran out. Now the Cofers are living mostly on $160 a month in food stamps. "It can't get worse," Mr. Cofer said of the Tyler economy. "It's to the bottom."
 
 Taking Another Route

Bill Knight took the other route to a better job -- going back to school. A plumber, he ruptured two disks opening a sewer line, and after three operations his doctors told him to take up another career. With help from the state and workers' compensation, he entered Tyler Junior College four years ago at 34. Then he entered the University of Texas at Tyler and earned a bachelor's degree in May.
Father of two children, 9 and 13, with a wife who works in a stamp-and-coin shop, Mr. Knight is dismayed to find no better opportunities than he says he could without a degree.
"What I would really like to do," he said, "would be child welfare work for the Texas Department of Human Services." But the state, facing a projected $4.6 billion deficit next year, has imposed a hiring freeze and may lay off 1,000 employees rather than raise taxes to keep them on.
Some signs of recovery have emerged in Tyler. After a four-year hiatus, construction and the oil business have revived.
But those industries each employ just under 3 percent of the area's 62,400 workers. Factories, accounting for 17 percent of the work force, are still sliding. Jobs in stores, services and offices acount for just over half, and it is in those jobs primarily that Robert Sullivan, a labor market analyst for the Texas Employment Commission, sees most of the erosion in the quality of work.
"We're definitely seeing a strong trend in using temporaries and part-timers and another thing -- employee leasing," he said. "Companies lay their work force off, put it on the payroll of a leasing company, which leases them back to the companies. The leasing company becomes responsible for their pay and benefits."
It can save the companies some money, he said, but it frays the bonds of loyalty between the companies and workers and makes jobs all the more unstable.
 
Iowa City
Lots of Jobs, Lots of Poverty
 Iowa City is a lively and cosmopolitan university town. With patches of wood and soft hills, a river bisecting it and roads that bend and slope, it is an anomaly in a state of perfect grids. People like that. The population of Iowa City grew by 10,000 in the 1980's, to 60,000, while the state's population was shrinking nearly 5 percent.
Despite all the newcomers, despite the recession's toll on factories there and on state financing for the University of Iowa, Iowa City and the rest of Johnson County have created jobs enough to keep local unemployment about 2 percent throughout the recession. Among 271 urban areas that the Bureau of Labor Statistics monitors, only another university town, Lincoln, Neb., can match the rate as the lowest in the nation.
Still, Iowa City has lower incomes and higher poverty than many communities with higher unemployment. Thomas F. Pogue, an economics professor at the university, said the average Iowa wage earner also lost more ground to inflation in the 1980's than the average American.
The reason is that much of the work people there do is low-wage, low-benefit and part-time. The Iowa Department of Employment Services says 27 percent of the workers in the state work 34 hours or less, compared with 18 percent nationally.
Daryl Anderson is a temporary part-time elections technician paid $6 an hour. "I service, set up and do diagnostic repairs of computerized voting machines," he said. "I'm used as needed. My last job ended in June. I go back at the end of August." His wife works at two part-time secretarial jobs.
Between jobs last year, Mr. Anderson was a census taker. Other times, like the present, he makes himself available for day labor. Kathy Kick, an interviewer at the employment office, lists about 50 day laborers in a spiral notebook. People call in for workers to mow lawns, bale hay, unload trucks, do housework.
 
 Worried About Security

The Andersons do not have children, but at 39, Mr. Anderson has begun to worry about job security, a pension and his health. "I need insurance," he said. "If I have to get sick, I would literally lose everything I have."
The 29,000 students at the university, who on average spend $7,000 a year for tuition, room and board, set the standards for hours and wages. Single and healthy, they demand little more than the minimum wage and have little desire for health insurance. Students hold nearly all the jobs in stores, restaurants and bars.
Older workers who compete with students for jobs cannot demand much more, said Tom M. Bullington, manager of the Iowa City office of the state job-placement service. "If we've got someone with the skills an employer wants and the employer's not willing to increase the wages," he said, "they just take the next-best qualified."
Around here, some people seem not to resent wages that are about $1 an hour less in Iowa than the national average of $10 and still lower in Iowa City. Working harder to keep afloat is just part of the ethic.
Thomas Hardin, 30, is looking for a manufacturing job that would pay $1 or $2 more than the $6 an hour he earns at a full-time job with full benefits in a key-making concession in a store. His wife runs a day-care service at their home, but with three young children, they need more money.
Mr. Hardin said his other option was a second job, part time. He did this a few years ago, and would like to avoid the strain. Another thing he did not like was the Senate's voting its members a $23,200 pay increase, to $125,100, this month. Nor does he like welfare: "I don't think it's right, sitting on their rear end collecting money. I don't think anyone should get money without working."
 
New Bedford
Dead Industry Has Monuments
 Whaling created New Bedford, and even now, with the high price of the scallops it takes from the Atlantic, New Bed ford earns more money from seafood most years than other port cities.
But fishing is a small employer, and most of the textile and apparel companies that drove the city's growth early in the 20th century have perished or fled. They have left behind a graveyard of multistory brick tombstones with painted-over windows.
New Bedford never found much to take the place of the old mills. Among cities, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says only Modesto, Calif., and McAllen, Tex., have higher jobless rates than the 13 percent in New Bedford and the neighboring mill town of Fall River.
"We're ways away from turning things around," said Jessie Ealy, manager of the state employment office. "I'm looking at more like a year for the economy to turn back."
 
 'The Nowhere Jobs'

That is sad news for Alan and Debra Monroe. Mr. Monroe is 29, father of a 5-year-old, and has applied for unemployment benefits, which in his case would be around $100 per week. "I just lost my job," he said. "I was a maintenance worker at Muldoon's Restaurant, cleaning and vacuuming, part time, 20 to 24 hours a week. I got $5.50 an hour. I'm checking all the nowhere jobs."
Mrs. Monroe's own benefits run out in August. She is 34, mother of two other children, 13 and 14, by a previous marriage. She lost a job in January. "I was an office clerk," she said. She has found nothing since: "You can't even find a job in your own country."
Mayor Bullard is cheered by renewed hiring at some apparel companies, by a Polaroid Corporation commitment to build a big plant and by the city's longer-term prospects as a center for sea-related industry.
But he noted, too, that over the last year New Bedford had lost a Goodyear Tire and Rubber plant and a company called Chamberlain Manufacturing that made artillery shells. The adjacent town of Fairhaven has lost a data-storage center of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. All were big employers, providing the area's best wages and benefits -- and once the best job security.
A few of their castoffs may do all right. Alan Machado, 44, was laid off June 28 by A.T.&T., which, he said, has shifted the plant's work to Florida, Georgia and Missouri. He managed systems that stored billing information, earning $560 a week plus overtime. Now he receives $307 in unemployment benefits. He has one child, and A.T.&T. is letting him keep his health insurance for six months. He said his experience in computer technology gave him confidence that he could find another good job.
The company would move him to Georgia or Florida, he said, but his wife, Deborah Robillard, 33, could not be assured of a job. A buyer for a local retail chain, she was laid off in December but will return when the company gears up for the Christmas season.
For families like Wilbur Chase's, however, the closings mark the last gasp of a happier era in New Bedford. "I worked for Goodyear until they stopped production Jan. 11," said Mr. Chase, who is 56. He was paid $14 an hour. "It was a good steady job. I was there 27 years."
His wife has never had to work, he said. Their two sons, 29 and 30, single and still living at home, followed their father's tracks. "One worked at Goodyear," Mr. Chase said. "One worked at Chamberlain." Mr. Chase said he has a pension and some health insurance and believes he can get by if he can find a part-time job. His sons may leave town.
One job hunter, Joseph Fabio, 33, captures the dismay of many others in New Bedford. "Psychologically, the condition of being unemployed and looking for a job, I did not comprehend," he said. "It takes a lot of stamina and bravery to deal with rejection."
Single, Mr. Fabio has junior college degree in electronics technology. He lost a good job working for a professor at Boston University after the professor's government grant ran out. Four months ago he was laid off from a $7-an-hour, full-time sales job.
"In our society, you are what you do," he said. "When you end up not even having a job, it becomes really strange. You're not hooked to anything."

HEADLINE: Last Of the Old-Time Summits

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
President Bush's trip to Moscow this week marks the end of the superpower era, not just for the Soviet Union but for the bilateral Soviet-American focus of world affairs. The end of the cold war did not produce the giant condominium that many feared. But neither is there a renewal of what Henry Luce called "the American century," a lonely U.S. superpower minding and ministering to dependents.
The main event of the Moscow summit meeting will be the signing of the Start treaty, reducing strategic missile arsenals on both sides. The U.S. and Soviet Union will still have enough nuclear power to destroy the world many times over, but the meaning of that power has changed. They won't run the world. 
 Foundations of a new global political directorate were laid at the London summit of the Group of Seven last week. Mikhail Gorbachev called it G-7 plus 1, but G-7 1/2 comes closer to reflecting the partial yet established participation of Moscow, which will continue on several levels.
A European leader present said Mr. Bush obviously preferred dealing one on one to the multilateral setting. But he will have to get used to the club approach and explain to the American public why the U.S. can't direct the way to his "new world order" on its own.
There is an analogy to the emerging management system in the 19th-century Concert of Europe, worked out at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 after the Napoleonic wars. There was no blueprint, no charter for running Europe then, as there won't be now for trying to keep the world on keel. But there were understandings capable of absorbing most frictions for a century.
That world order broke down cataclysmically in 1914, leading to the bloody inhumanities of the 20th century. There must be no temptation to revert to the 19th-century patterns as the new concert of powers evolves, a danger already visible in Balkan rivalries and in nationalisms in Eastern Europe.
The 19th-century concert, a triumph of conservatism over the revolutionary urges unleashed by Napoleon, provides two key warnings of what not to do.
The new concert must not set out to repress change, as the old one did, but to provide openings for peaceful accommodation to inevitable challenges. And it must not rely on a balance of power, which encourages shifting alliances and the unscrupulous search for advantage.
It will have to be clearly aimed at collective security, a Wilsonian ideal discredited between the world wars that is now regaining its hopeful sheen because there is no acceptable alternative.
For Americans, flushed with pride at the demonstration of their indispensable leadership in the gulf war, this may not be obvious. Mr. Bush himself seems halfhearted about partners who don't accept Washington's decisions without cavil. And it is true, as Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the New York Democrat, said recently, that "collective security can only work if American leadership makes it work."
But the Moscow meeting will show that it isn't only Soviet weakness that has made a bipolar world obsolete. It is also the necessity of cooperating with other players whose decisions affect American power to act. Of course, the G-7 1/2 can't keep the helm to itself for a century, as the Vienna powers did. It is a haphazard group formed in response to the 1973 oil crisis and successive economic threats, but gradually accepting political responsibilities.
Others will knock at the door as the transition to global management develops. But the Group of Seven does share basic values, an idea of how the world ought to work and a common interest in keeping peace. Its members have arguments -- over how to bring the Soviets to the stage the modern world considers normality, how to regulate trade and monetary relations -- yet they know they have to agree on big issues.
Soviet-American summit meetings are no longer the critical point of decision. The world has moved on.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Summits Still Matter

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
This week's Bush-Gorbachev meeting has the air of a last superpower summit, the farewell to the dramatic days when Washington and Moscow seemed to hold the worldwide reins of war and peace, the ritual end to a titanic bipolar struggle that sucked up energies and resources and lives, yet effectively maintained a nuclear peace.
Compared to the cold war meetings, this will be a Potemkin summit. The United States and the Soviet Union -- separately and together -- no longer shape global destiny. 
 Which does not mean summits are useless, and which raises two questions:
First, what will replace the superpower forum as the organizing vehicle or principle for international politics? The short answer is no single grouping of states, but ad hoc arrangements. President Bush is already practicing this approach skillfully, though he has botched its articulation. Ad hocism is the most that can be done to bring some semblance of peaceful change to an increasingly messy and fluid world.
Second, what will be the value of this and future Soviet-American summits? The short answer is that they will become one of many needed clearinghouses for dealing with the old issues like arms control, the Middle East and Afghanistan. But such meetings can also become an effective means for Washington and Moscow to confront their most important mutual concern -- the Soviet Union itself.
For all Mr. Bush's talk about a new world order, he frets about Mikhail Gorbachev's political survival and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The American President is simply most comfortable in the orderly old bipolar world. As much as he would like to hang on to it, however, he knows he needs a new security policy.
Mr. Bush has made collective security his rhetorical trademark, yet knows its limitations. It worked well enough in the Persian Gulf war. But the Iraqi threat was egregious and near universal, and thus is unlikely to serve as a model. In any event, the United Nations is constituted to handle only old-model wars -- one nation attacking another. It will always resist intervening in current-style conflicts -- civil wars and wars of national independence. Such intervention is too likely to end up one day in one's own backyard.
Nor are regional security groups eager to police "internal" wars. True, African states did the job recently in Liberia. But the highly touted Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ran away from the imbroglio in Yugoslavia. The European Community, led by Britain, France and Germany, could not get its act together there either. And these European organizations are generally better positioned than their counterparts on other continents to take such action.
It is similarly unrealistic to expect the leading industrialized democracies, known as the G-7, to step into and up to political-military quarrels. Their interests simply are not sufficiently convergent on these matters. That should not be surprising given their paltry performance in coordinating economic policies, their principal reason for being.
All of which points to an even larger role for the U.S. Forget this idea. Though the U.S. is now the lone superpower, it is so by default. It no longer has the economic strength to make the sacrifices required to run the world, and could not do so anyway.
Mr. Bush has taken the far wiser course. He is energizing every available combination of states to confront specific problems on an ad hoc basis, from free trade to missile sales to Cambodia. And where most conflicts will be internal and economic, that is the only sensible approach.
Mr. Bush heads toward the Moscow summit in just this spirit. He is planning to spend most of his time on Soviet internal politics and economics. He will give primary attention and help to Mr. Gorbachev, a proven friend who has bravely overthrown Communist totalitarianism and finally committed himself to a confederal and democratic future for his country. But he will also confer with Boris Yeltsin, Gorby's archrival, just in case. Then he will visit the Ukraine to underline America's support for confederation.
In the bad old days, Soviet leaders would go ballistic at any mention of their internal situation. Now it is the only subject they want to discuss. And it is precisely the right focus for Soviet-American summitry in a new, nonpolar and disorderly world.

HEADLINE: Allies

 BODY:
The possibility has been a long time coming, but it's startling nonetheless. After six years of Mikhail Gorbachev's warming winds, the cold war is over and it is now reasonable, as Presidents Bush and Gorbachev prepare to meet in Moscow Tuesday, for their countries to think of each other, in fundamental ways, as allies.
Not since Yalta has the thought been even thinkable. For half a century the superpowers stood locked in fearsome, fearful hostility. Yet now they share four goals, a fact that makes the idea of alliance more than a semantic flourish. And at this summit meeting, the two leaders can make progress toward all four. 
 The common first purpose can be stated simply: to integrate the Soviet Union economically and politically into the world, and give it a stake in peaceful relations with its neighbors.
Communism's thrust toward worldwide revolution has masked the insularity of the Soviet Union. It was protectionist in profound ways, trying to keep out people, goods and, above all, ideas. Now some Soviet leaders want to integrate the country with the West, open it, transform it.
That has long been America's hope. Yet it's naive to assume that the transformation will necessarily be liberalizing. The shock of a collapsing economy and shattered values are certain to spark reaction, and possibly conflict. That raises the second common goal. The West cannot afford to stand by and watch the struggle of Westernizers in the Soviet Union without trying to help.
The U.S. and the Soviet Union also share a common enemy -- the destabilizing force of weapons proliferation. Both countries need time for cutting arms and making plowshares, and need assurance that competition among nations will not assume a threatening form. That requires collaborative efforts at controlling the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and conventional weapons.
There is no guarantee that even energetic collaboration can succeed; the most obvious recent evidence is named Saddam Hussein. Hence the fourth joint Soviet-American purpose: to promote collective security. Traditional alliances pit some countries against others. Collective security aggregates many against an aggressor. That approach was tested in repelling Iraq.
Mr. Bush can do much to advance these goals in Moscow. He can grant most-favored-nation trade status -- and speed up economic engagement. By meeting with Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of other republics and addressing the Ukraine's Parliament, he can lend moral support to far-flung reformers.
President Bush also can cooperate in converting Soviet military production and curbing arms sales. And he can discuss ways to act collectively for peace in the Middle East and the Balkans.
Much good can come of this summit meeting if, in short, both men act like allies.

HEADLINE: A Fix Too Quick on Unemployment

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats are suddenly seized with the idea that unemployment benefits for the nation's jobless are inadequate, and must be improved by next Friday. The House is developing a more honest fix than the Senate.
Bills to authorize up to 20 additional weeks of benefits are moving quickly in both houses because (1) members want to go on vacation at the end of the week, and (2) the Democratic leadership wants to show concern for victims of the recession, even if they've been slow to do so. 
 The problem is how to pay. Under last year's budget agreement, new spending must be offset by new revenues or by cuts in other programs -- except for emergencies. If there is a genuine emergency, certified by the President, no offset is required. But it's not cricket to use emergency funding as a trick to skirt the pay-as-you-go agreement. The deficit is large enough.
The Senate Finance Committee's bill opts for the emergency route. Arguing that President Bush has declared three foreign emergencies this year -- for Operation Desert Storm, for Kurdish refugees and for flood victims in Bangladesh -- the Democrats say it's time he acknowledged an emergency at home. But the Administration says the recession doesn't qualify, especially since the recovery may have already begun.
A more forthright approach is offered by Representatives Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Thomas Downey of Long Island. Their bill invites Mr. Bush to declare an emergency, but if he won't it lays out a valid alternative: increase the taxes employers pay into the unemployment insurance fund.
The insurance system needs more than either bill proposes. It is a smaller safety net than it used to be for several reasons, including stiffer standards adopted to avoid raising the tax. Also, the 1986 tax reforms made jobless benefits fully taxable as income, but made no provision for higher benefits. Alas, the time for fundamental improvements is when the economy is in good shape -- and Congress isn't interested.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
High Technology on a Large Scale

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
SAY what you will, there is still nothing like a big American sedan, at least for those of us who grew up lusting after Lincolns and Packards and Cadillacs. True, the likes of the new Lexus coupe make the luxury market a delightfully different ball game, but some of the domestic entries must be given their due.
Lincoln's Town Car is an exercise in quiet mobility, for example, and it is a car that I would happily own. Cadillacs, too, have been a longtime love, and I have owned a bunch of them, making me a member of a very large club. The other members have been uncommonly reticent this year, but even with bad days piling up in showroom upon showroom, Cadillac remains the nation's leading luxomobile. 
 And, for '91, the dealers have been given a new lure to mix with the Coupes de Ville, Sevilles, Broughams and the rest. The car is a de Ville Touring Sedan, and it packs luxury, comfort and surprisingly high technology into a hefty 17-foot-long package with front-wheel drive.
Perhaps it is the size itself that creates the surprise; instead of a small gem bristling with goodies at every turn, the new Cadillac has something here, something there -- with a lot of space in the middle.
The technology is not especially innovative, either, particularly in a car costing $36,316. There are the rolling locks pioneered by Lincoln, the antitheft ignition key stolen from Corvette, the central locking system which, among other things, allows all doors to be opened when you open the trunk. No, not sensational, but nice in the way that it comes together.
One thing that is new is the feature that makes this a "touring sedan," which is auto-speak for a stiffly sprung four-door that you can fling into a corner with some hope of eventually getting straight again. Cadillac calls it Computer Command Ride, and the retuned chassis and big aluminum wheels are helped by four electronically controlled struts that adjust the suspension as speed increases.
The struts remain in the "comfort" mode up to 40 m.p.h. From there to 60, they automatically adjust to "normal" mode. At 60, the struts shift into their firm state, allowing better control. The system also reacts to pitch and dive when brakes are applied, and a lateral accelerometer uses the struts to counter body roll at any speed.
The car drips chrome. It has bumper guards and the formal roofline of other Sedan de Villes, but it adds its own bits of trim and exclusive tan leather seats and interior. The trunk is huge by today's standards, and the rear seat matches it for space. One thing that's hard to understand, however, is that with those big back doors and all that length, the rear windows go down only half way. Unforgivable.
Up front, our metallic black sapphire Caddy had American walnut accents on dash and doors and a digital dash that was coy about troubling the driver with mundane information. Unless you go looking, the Touring Sedan is only candid about speed and miles traveled. For more, you need to go to the driver information centers on each side of the steering column, where the push of some buttons will let you know such things as range and fuel remaining.
As it turns out, quite a lot of that premium fuel does stay in the tank, and economy is estimated at 16 miles per gallon, city, and 26, highway. In a week's driving, the actual average was 19.9, more than respectable when you are moving a vehicle that weighs almost two tons with a V8 engine that puts out 200 horsepower.
The 4.9-liter aluminum powerplant will take the sedan from zero to 60 in 8.7 seconds, and it is hooked to an electronically controlled automatic transmission that uses a viscous clutch to improve smoothness in its shifts. Smoothness, of course, is Cadillac's middle name, and the car is quiet and comfortable, despite its sporting nature.
The steering wheel is wrapped in leather and houses an air bag in its center. Antilock brakes are standard as well, and there are the usual Cadillac niceties: an efficiently self-dimming rearview mirror, a 200-watt stereo system that includes a compact-disk player, headlights that come on by themselves when the sun goes down, and power everything.
In fact, when I looked at the window sticker, I thought for a moment that I had seen the ultimate in servo-assists. On the sticker's equipment list were these four lines:
 MIRROR -- AUTOMATIC DAY/NIGHT
 MIRRORS -- ILLUMINATED VANITY
 TRUNK LID PULL DOWN -- POWER
 TRUNK MAT
A power trunk mat, now that would be real technology. It turns out that the car has an electric pulldown for the lid and somebody just forgot the punctuation. Shucks.

HEADLINE: Inflation and Taxes Eat Up Treasury Bills

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Interest Rates, the Real Ones," a July 2 Business Scene column, points out that the 6.3 percent return on one-year Treasury bills is actually a 1.8 percent rate after adjusting for inflation at the current rate of 4.5 percent. From this the article then concludes that these investments of savings are "winners" because they yield a net return after inflation. 
 This calculation, however, does not tell the whole story, for it ignores the effect of income taxes, which are imposed on the entire 6.3 percent, even though most of the income is illusory, in reality representing merely a protection of principal.
Thus, assuming a 28 percent income tax rate, the real rate of return is virtually zero: 1.8 percent after-inflation return and 1.764 percent for income taxes. Few people realize that the effect of taxing the inflationary segment of the nominal return dramatically increases the effective income tax rate. In the above example, income taxes consume almost 100 percent of the after-inflation return.
I might add that there is, of course, a direct connection between this disastrous result for savers and the level of Government spending. Until Congress eliminates the enormous increases of recent years in Federal Government spending, which are widely believed to be the root of our inflation problem, this situation will only continue.
Is it too much to hope Congress will finally put aside its desire to curry favor with the recipients of Government largesse and proceed to reduce spending?

HEADLINE: Soviet Economy Defies Improvement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Several of your July 14 articles taken together expose the predicament of the Soviet economy. Leonard Silk says in The Week in Review, "The economic disaster in the East has exceeded the gloomiest expectations of Western economists." 
 In the Forum (Business section), Marshall I. Goldman reminds us that "Since 1989, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has embraced -- only to discard -- about 10 economic reform plans." You summarize the latest, via Harvard, in the same Forum: it declares that "the basic principle is the creation of a market economy."
But your front-page article from Moscow observes that "in the absence of any experience of free enterprise, all the talk of free markets, ruble convertibility and privatization raises only vague and ominous images for most Soviet citizens." You then detail how the bold new programs "disappear in the tangle of competing jurisdictions or founder in a legal system utterly inadequate for its new tasks."
It seems the only valid advice for Soviet-type economies that are attempting reform is the old Irishism, "If I wanted to get there, I wouldn't start here."

HEADLINE: The Network Takeovers: Why ABC Survived Best

BYLINE: By KEN AULETTA; Ken Auletta is the author of "Three Blind Mice: How the TV Networks Lost Their Way," which will be published in September by Random House. This article is adapted from the book.

 BODY:
DAVID W. BURKE WAS A formal man. A vice president of ABC News, he was renowned for his starched white shirts with gold cuff links, round tortoise-shell glasses and fastidiously trimmed sandy hair. High-minded and exacting, the son of a Brookline, Mass., policeman, he was known around ABC News as "the headmaster." But here he was at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix, on his feet, clapping like an Amway salesman. He looked down at his hands, and willed them to stop. "Christ, what the hell am I doing?" he remembers thinking. He glanced around and saw 160 fellow executives, more than half of them from ABC, hollering like cheerleaders at this, the first management retreat since Capital Cities Communications officially swallowed the network on Jan. 3, 1986. 
 For three and a half days in late January, officials of the two companies met in the Arizona desert. When David Burke looked up at the Biltmore's stage, he saw Thomas S. Murphy, the lanky, avuncular chairman of the merged companies, winking at familiar friends, flashing a perfect row of white teeth. He listened as Murphy singled out the Cap Cities divisions that had had great years. "He was like a politician playing to his old constituency," Burke later remembered.
"Stand up and give them a round of applause," Murphy urged everyone -- especially, Burke felt, the folks from ABC.
So Burke, like everyone else, jumped up and, a moment later, felt miserable.
He was not alone. Employees at all three networks were feeling anxious. Ownership of ABC, CBS and NBC would effectively change hands within nine months. ABC was first, acquired by Capital Cities Communications, a notoriously "lean and mean" company that owned radio stations, TV stations (several of them ABC affiliates), cable systems, newspapers and magazines. In June 1986, NBC's parent company, RCA, would be acquired by General Electric, an industrial giant that had shed 25 percent of its work force in the past five years. And in September, Laurence A. Tisch's Loews Corporation, a holding company known for rigorous cost cutting, would gain control of CBS, William S. Paley's "Tiffany" network.
The adjustment to Cap Cities was difficult for many old ABC hands. Indeed, the month of January had been one prolonged insult. It was unnerving enough to be taken over by an affiliate, but even more so by a company whose local newscasts were among the first to billboard sensationalist crime stories. Employees took a punch in the nose when Frederick S. Pierce, president of ABC, was replaced by a Cap Cities executive, John B. Sias, a ramrod-straight for-mer paratrooper with a fondness for peculiar practical jokes -- he once bounced through ABC's network newsroom on Lincoln's Birthday disguised as the former President.
A second jolt came when Sias informed Roone Arledge that he would no longer be president of ABC Sports, a title he had held for 18 years. Cap Cities said it wanted him to concentrate on managing the network's news division, which he had run since 1977. Arledge wasn't buying it. He knew Cap Cities abhorred his chauffeured Jaguar, thought he was the exemplar of what Sias and Murphy and Daniel B. Burke, the president and chief operating officer of Cap Cities, referred to as ABC's "limousine mentality." The line on Arledge was damning. As Sias put it, "He likes to spend money."
Like much else at ABC, the limousine mentality was a holdover from the flush era when the networks enjoyed a monopoly. Ten years earlier, in 1976, 90 percent of American viewers watched evening shows on ABC, CBS or NBC. On a typical night, the average household received just seven stations, and TV Guide listed only 14 viewing options. Neither Showtime nor ESPN nor CNN nor the Disney Channel nor MTV was included among the 14 -- aside from services like the struggling HBO, cable programming barely existed. Only the Big Three could afford to exhibit recent Hollywood movies. There were few if any syndicated shows, and none bulldozed a time period the way "Wheel of Fortune," "Jeopardy" or "The Oprah Winfrey Show" does today.
There were, in early 1976, few commercially available VCR's or cordless remote controls, no satellite distribution of programs, no backyard dishes, no superstations, no Fox network and just over 100 non-network commercial independent TV stations in the entire United States. Advertisers wishing to reach mass audiences were held hostage by the networks, whose revenues swelled by 324 percent between 1976 and 1984. The network was king.
Ten years later, the networks had reason to feel like trapped mice. Only 75 percent of viewers on a typical evening now watched the three networks. And in the 1990-91 season, when the average home would receive 33 channels, and 7 out of 10 homes would have VCR's, the network share would plunge to 62 percent.
Gripped by a sense of crisis, Cap Cities did what came naturally: it pounded away at costs. Every extravagance -- from ABC's six private dining rooms and six daily mail deliveries to its 17-room duplex penthouse at the Plaza Hotel and the $2,600 that "Good Morning America" spent each week on breakfast snacks for its guests -- would have to go. When the ax began to swing, some ABC employees worried that their new owners would cripple the network's ability to turn out a quality product.
As David Burke looked up at Tom Murphy, his mind raced over the first month of the Cap Cities rule, and as he later remembered thinking: "It will never be the same again. The business is going to evermore be different; be managed, be cost-conscious. Will they listen to a creative idea? Or does it all have to be cost-perfect?' "
 FOR CAP CITIES AND ABC, a more important clash lay ahead. May is the month when each network makes final decisions about the prime-time schedule for the fall season. In Los Angeles, Brandon Stoddard, head of ABC Entertainment, sat with his team and watched the 31 pilots submitted for consideration, compared them with shows currently on ABC and then prepared a draft schedule to present to the Cap Cities/ABC hierarchy in New York on May 15, 1987.
The 40-odd executives who entered the 38th-floor conference room at 1330 Avenue of the Americas had received tapes of the pilots. They knew ABC had lots of holes to plug. Because of ratings duds like "Starman" and "Life With Lucy," ABC would end the 1986-87 season in third place. Few in the room knew what Stoddard would recommend, though John Sias had a clue. Before the meeting Sias had phoned Arledge and told him, "Get your research together." Since Arledge had only two shows in prime time -- "20/20" and "Our World" -- he understood he had to be prepared to defend them against Stoddard.
But Arledge was not prepared for what happened next. Standing beside a magnetized board displaying the seven-night schedule of shows that would probably run on ABC, NBC and CBS, Stoddard, a short, perky, self-confident man, laid out at machine-gun speed the three building blocks that would support his proposed schedule. First, he had a hot new variety hour -- "Dolly," starring Dolly Parton -- that he wanted to broadcast Sunday from 9 P.M. to 10 P.M., the most-watched hour of the entire week. It was an hour dominated by the CBS Sunday night movie, which got a strong lead-in from "60 Minutes" at 7 P.M. and "Murder She Wrote," with Angela Lansbury, at 8.
Dolly could dent CBS's lead, Stoddard insisted. She would appeal to many of the older viewers now tuned to CBS, and she would be up against movies on both CBS and NBC. Dolly was hot, Stoddard assured the executives. Her "Smoky Mountain Christmas" on ABC came in fifth among made-for-TV movies in the 1986-87 season. When she'd teamed with Kenny Rogers for a Christmas special on CBS, the ratings had gone through the roof. Just to be sure, Stoddard proudly announced that ABC had tied her up with a three-year personal and production contract that, it was later revealed, would cost the network $34 million.
BUT THERE WAS A problem. In order to schedule Parton on Sunday, Stoddard said, he would have to find another night for ABC's Sunday movie, his second building block. He couldn't shift the movie to Monday: that belonged to Monday night football. Tuesday was also out of the question. It was already a winner, with comedies like "Who's the Boss?" "Growing Pains" and "Moonlighting." Wednesday, another strong night, was out as well. Neither Friday nor Saturday night would work either: the VCR had deflated these as movie nights. The ABC movie would have to be moved to Thursday.
Stoddard was now ready to unveil his third block. To make room for a two-hour movie at 9 P.M., he would shift the news division's magazine program, "20/20," from Thursday at 10. He would move it "right here," Stoddard said, slapping a magnetized "20/20" plate next to Thursday at 8 P.M. and shoving aside the plate for "Our World," a "you were there" montage of historical news clips.
There was a collective gasp. "20/20" would be up against NBC's blockbuster Thursday schedule, anchored by "The Cosby Show," the top-rated program in television. And not only would Barbara Walters, star of "20/20," and News languish in this forlorn time slot, but "Our World," after being mauled by Cosby for the last year, would disappear entirely. The way intramural score was kept at the networks, Arledge's division was "losing" an hour of programming to Entertainment, and the one prime-time hour it still had was being offered as another sacrifice to the Cosby juggernaut.
All eyes turned to Roone Arledge. An elegantly tailored man, with a carefully maintained coiffure, he sat absolutely silent for what seemed an eternity. Finally, Stoddard's deputy, Ted Harbert, jumped in, telling the assembled executives: "Research reports that the audience at 8 P.M. Thursday is potentially larger. '20/20' could kick off ABC's entire night. And if the movie was terrific, and if it ran more than two hours, it would be possible to shorten '20/20' and start the movie earlier."
Now Arledge reacted. "Stop!" he shouted. "This is out of the question!" The move was outrageous, a deliberate slap in the face of News.
"Why don't you run Dolly Parton at 8 P.M. on Thursday?" David Burke asked.
"What, are you crazy? You tell Dolly!" said Stoddard.
"You tell Barbara!" Burke shot back.
"This is the way it's gonna be," Stoddard announced. He had reason to feel emboldened. So far, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke had backed his every decision. Against their own business instincts, they had approved his requests for expensive mini-series. They had kept John Sias out of his hair. They had treated him as if he were an expert, even a high priest, as if he alone knew the secrets of network programming.
The room again fell silent. Stoddard knew Arledge had allies besides David Burke, the only other executive from News in attendance. The sales division, a bigger player in programming since Cap Cities had taken over, was a fan of the program, which commanded prestige advertising prices. The affiliates liked it because it pulled fairly good ratings, compared with many of ABC's other prime-time programs, and made a natural lead-in to their own late-night newscasts. And management liked it because the $20 million or so in profits that "20/20" generated helped put News in the black.
Stoddard, prepared to compromise, wandered over to the schedule board. He reached up and moved "20/20" from Thursday to Friday at 10 P.M.
"Try Tuesday at 10," countered Arledge, picking ABC's strongest night and a position right after "Moonlighting."
"Impossible," said Stoddard, noting that the slot was reserved for a terrific new series -- "Thirtysome thing." The audience flow from "Moonlighting" to a series about yuppie angst made a perfect fit. To stick "20/20" there would suddenly skew to older viewers.
Arledge lost Tuesday. He didn't much care about the demise of "Our World," a ratings disaster. But he did feel passionate about "20/20" and his good friend Barbara Walters. To move "20/20" from Thursday to Friday at 10 would mean a smaller available audience, he said, since Friday and Saturday were the least-watched nights of the week. That would translate into a revenue loss, since advertisers paid less for smaller audiences. And he knew that if the program no longer produced a profit, News would lose clout.
ARLEDGE WAS GENUINELY irate. "20/20" was a workhorse for the third-rated ABC; in its eight years on the air, it had always earned a bigger audience share than its lead-in show. And there was something else. Roone Arledge, more than anyone else in the room, had put ABC on the map. Using hand-held cameras and shotgun microphones and instant replays, he had pioneered the modern look of TV sports on shows like "Wide World of Sports" and "Monday Night Football." And he had brought showmanship to news, with split-screen interviews and socko graphics.
In pursuit of the right look, Arledge sometimes drove his minions crazy. For years he had badgered the anchor Frank Reynolds to wear dark suits and avoid button-down collars and polka-dot ties -- they did not convey "authority," he announced. When he was dying, Reynolds and his wife, Henrietta, hatched a conspiracy. Although the coffin would be closed, as a final protest he would be dressed in a cream-colored suit, button-down collar and polka-dot tie.
Roone Arledge respected Stoddard, but he didn't understand why he was treated with such reverence. As a scheduler he was surely no genius. Recently he had put "The Betty Ford Story" against the second installment of CBS's smash mini-series "I'll Take Manhattan," which appealed to the same female audience. Lose this fight, and Stoddard would be liberated to move News wherever he pleased. Arledge threw down the gauntlet: "If '20/20' goes to 8:00 Thursday, we won't produce the show."
The stalemate was now complete. And Murphy would have to break it. He would have to decide between News and Entertainment, a forbidding prospect even for an experienced network hand. Rising, Murphy looked squarely at Stoddard and said, "You are one tough son of a bitch." They would sleep on it, announced Murphy, and gather in a smaller group tomorrow.
But the next day's session produced deadlock again. Finally, after yet another day of acrimony, Murphy announced a decision to the entertainment division: "We'll go with Friday at 10 P.M."
Stoddard's staff burst into applause.
"How dare you applaud?" exclaimed Murphy. He was angry, disturbed that Stoddard's people saw the decision as a victory for themselves. That wasn't the way Cap Cities did things. Murphy himself didn't bother to read press clippings about himself, not even when Business Week put him on the cover. He prized teamwork. Murphy adjourned the meeting, saying he would talk to Arledge.
"We've made a decision," Murphy announced as soon as he, Dan Burke and John Sias were seated in Arledge's fourth-floor conference room, where they were joined by David Burke and two other News vice presidents. "We're going to move '20/20' to Friday at 10 P.M."
"We have had eight years of success with '20/20,' " Arledge said. "And we are being badly treated. The decision is wrong. The research department said it is wrong. The affiliates said it was wrong. Sales said it was wrong." The jabs stung, for the Cap Cities people felt uneasy with the decision they had made.
Before they could respond, David Burke squared off against Tom Murphy. "It's been hard on everyone going through the merger, hard on you, Tom, and hard on us," Burke said. "We've tried to anticipate your management style. The people involved on both sides don't share the same jargon or history. And we in News are arrogant, for good reason. We feel the weight of public responsibility." Burke paused, then threw a wild punch: "That little twit on the West Coast has no right to push aside News!"
"He isn't a twit!" shot back Murphy.
"Yes he is!" Burke shouted. "But as time went on, Tom, I got comfortable. News management and I were on the team. And you were my leader. And yet, as my leader, you come in and say Brandon Stoddard, not Tom Murphy, is my leader. Well, I don't want to have Brandon as my leader."
Dan Burke was stunned, but before he could utter a word in his boss's defense, an unruffled Tom Murphy said: "I understand how hurt you are. This is the toughest decision I've ever made."
Tom Murphy was serene. He saw the sometimes bitter negotiations as another step toward encouraging frankness, unbottling feelings. This belief was reaffirmed in the weeks and months afterward; when the papers were filled with stories on the squabbles at CBS and NBC, Cap Cities management never read about the sulfurous things David Burke had said to Tom Murphy.
The May scheduling battle was the first big institutional fight within ABC in the nearly 17 months since the takeover, and the lessons it taught would help change the way Cap Cities managed its network. Murphy and his team came to understand that a network was not like one of the Cap Cities stations or its publishing division. Institutional rivalries and conflicts came with the turf. But the No. 3 network could not afford a fratricidal war. And Dan Burke, a stern, even moralistic taskmaster ("the Cardinal," some called him), wasn't about to allow it. Cap Cities would have to modify its decentralized approach and become more involved in decision-making. And ABC's competing divisions would have to learn the meaning of teamwork.
Entertainment had won the battle, but perhaps it had lost the war. Murphy and company began to see that picking programs and deciding on a prime-time schedule was not the arcane science they had thought. Soon after the meeting, Sias later recalled: "Tom and Dan told me they wanted me to be a little more heavy-handed. Tom was frustrated and concerned that we were not making progress in prime time. By insisting that Dolly be on Sunday at 9 P.M., it caused us to lose the Sunday movie. And we had invested $350 million in movie product. After May, I was a little less reluctant to come in there and have a say."
In the aftermath of the scheduling sessions, Murphy summed up his changed thinking: "The area we're least comfortable with is the most important -- entertainment. But we're no longer virgins."
 "DOLLY" WOULD QUICKLY expire in the next season, confirming to the new owners of ABC that they had made a mistake in deferring to Stoddard's judgment. Variety shows no longer pulled viewers, and Parton turned out not to have universal appeal. Moving "20/20" to Friday did not turn out as badly as Arledge had predicted, but since many fewer viewers watched television on Friday nights, its audience was off.
Still, there were some grounds for optimism. Even Brandon Tartikoff of NBC, television's reigning programming genius, declared in the fall of 1987, "I'd say that ABC has planted a few seeds that could develop into something." Shows like "Thirtysome thing" offered distinctive drama, prompting TV critics to proclaim that ABC, not NBC, was the new champion of "quality" programming.
There were other signs of progress as well. By the end of 1987, nearly two years after it officially took over ABC, Cap Cities was further ahead of its network rivals in creating a more congenial place to work. At NBC, the new president, Robert C. Wright, was cheap with compliments; even more damaging to morale, he kept wondering out loud whether network television might not be doomed to extinction. Laurence Tisch, the president of CBS, also believed that compliments encouraged complacency. Rarely venturing from his corner office to schmooze, he was generally regarded as a Scrooge-like figure, chained to his Quotron machine and calculator. Both NBC and CBS managed by instilling fear, believing that it kept employees on their toes.
The Cap Cities way was different. Dan Burke and Tom Murphy believed that contented, less fearful employees would be unafraid to stick their necks out, to take chances. This was one reason why, after an initial round of job cuts, in which 1,800 people were let go, they planned to avoid layoffs in the future (and did until July of this year). It was the reason why in 1989 they decided to assure Arledge and News that their newest creation, "Prime Time Live," would not be subject to the tyranny of the Nielsen ratings; the program would be given a full two years to succeed or fail. While Tisch and Wright lunched privately in their own suites, Murphy, an easygoing backslapper who called everyone "pal," ate at least three times a week in a communal dining room open to 145 company executives, as did Dan Burke.
The people at ABC came to feel that Murphy and Burke might truly be different from the dreaded new owners at CBS and NBC, that they understood television as an institution. With more fervor than either Wright or Tisch, Murphy and Burke championed "the public trust" (although Cap Cities tolerated a glut of crime stories and "happy talk" on most of its local newscasts). "A network," Murphy said, "touches 100 percent of the people every day. I consider being in broadcasting special, and with it comes a special responsibility."
Slowly, Cap Cities seemed to be getting a grip on the entertainment side of the business as well. Plunging feet first into Hollywood, Murphy was looking more closely at research reports on entertainment shows, attending focus groups designed to spot the strengths or vulnerabilities of series already on the air. His confidence grew. "I have very common taste," Murphy explained that fall. "I have been surprised by the correlation between what I like and what the viewers like. I'm more confident of my own judgment now."
Murphy also came to appreciate that in Hollywood a network had to spend money to make money. A single hit meant millions for ABC. Talent was expensive, but it was even more expensive to watch NBC lock up the best producer-writers. So in the fall of 1987, Murphy signed off on an extraordinary "talent" contract to tie up Steven Bochco, creator of ABC's promising series "Hooperman" and NBC's breakthrough "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law." The package, linked to a syndication deal with 20th Century Fox, was said to be worth up to $50 million. ABC, said Bochco, was sending a signal. "People assume, correctly, that if I'm willing to work at ABC it's because I've got freedom," he said. "That's a wonderful message to send to this community."
Confidence grew throughout ABC. Surely the good feeling would translate into higher ratings, just as it had under the legendary Grant Tinker at NBC in the first half of the 80's. Handicapping the three-network race in late 1987, Peter A. Lund, then an independent TV executive and now executive vice president of the CBS Broadcast Group, echoed a common refrain about Cap Cities: "I keep thinking that ABC will be the winner of this crowd. Why? Because Murphy and Burke are broadcasters, and because I have never heard so many people say so many nice things about their bosses. People at ABC think they're terrific managers. They have created an atmosphere that can lead to success. At a time of insecurity in the business, that's important."
As Murphy and Burke learned that crafting a schedule was not a science, so they learned that producing and orchestrating what gets on the air could be an art. Throughout the organization, a sense spread that Murphy and Burke were coming to think less about costs and more about the magic of television. A turning point came when they took a close look at ABC's masterful coverage of the 1988 Winter Olympics, produced by Roone Arledge. "The Cap Cities people went up to Calgary and saw what a network does," said Michael P. Mallardi, who had been ABC's chief financial officer and who now oversaw their TV stations and radio and video-enterprise divisions. "They came away with a real appreciation." They showed that appreciation to Arledge not long afterward, when they awarded him a new five-year contract, boosting his annual salary from $2 million to nearly $3 million.
More good news arrived in March 1988, when Ted Koppel, who had been working without a contract, agreed to remain at ABC. The decision came just after Peter Jennings had been signed to a new contract and was given a new executive producer. For ABC, the payoff came quickly. After several years of turmoil, the gifted anchor relaxed, and viewers responded. By February 1988, Jennings occasionally edged into first place in the weekly ratings, a pattern that would solidify into a permanent lead beginning in 1989.
 IN THE THREE-NETWORK competition, ABC was gaining. Compared with NBC and CBS, it suffered the smallest audience decline in the 1987-88 season. Its schedule was not dominated by aging shows -- on average, its series were two years old, compared with a little more than six for CBS. And ABC was a strong No. 2 in its demographics, with more youth and urban appeal than CBS. Shows like "China Beach," "The Wonder Years," "Moonlighting" and "Thirtysomething" demonstrated that ABC was doing distinctive television. And with its lineup of comedies on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday at 8:00, it had the table-setters to entice viewers on several nights. ABC already had more shows in the top 30 than CBS, and the following season, "Roseanne" would knock the mighty "Cosby" out of first place. In 1989-90, ABC would be the only network to gain viewers.
In a newly competitive industry, Cap Cities/ABC enjoyed some strategic advantages. It had the most-balanced portfolio of holdings. It owned ESPN, the nation's largest cable programming service, eight TV stations rated No. 1 in their urban markets, as well as AM and FM radio stations, newspapers and magazines. ABC was a major investor in the Broadway theater, owning stakes in such hits as "Cats," "Phantom of the Opera," "Amadeus" and "Dreamgirls" -- theatrical investments made with an eye to the future potential of pay-per-view. And overseas looked promising, with ABC poised to become what Dan Burke described as one of "the six or so integrated companies" that would compete in global communications. Under Bob Wright, NBC would race to catch up and diversify from broadcasting to cable. CBS, meanwhile, had already shed most of its cable-programming investments; under Tisch it would sell its remaining nonbroadcasting holdings, including its magazines and publishing division and CBS Records.
While the ultraconservative Larry Tisch invested most of CBS's cash in Treasury bills, and NBC's managers followed the risk-oriented General Electric philosophy, Cap Cities steered a middle course. It had grown from a single Albany TV station by relying on prudent acquisitions and cost cutting. Success taught Cap Cities that rewards came to the slow and sure.
This impression of "balance" both shaped the new culture at ABC and helped convince broadcasters and industry analysts that ABC was the network to watch. A 1989 Broadcasting magazine poll of securities analysts found Wall Street touting Cap Cities/ABC stock. In 1989 ABC posted profits of more than $165 million, up from a loss of $4 million the year before. In prime time, the youthful reach of ABC's shows would whittle away at NBC's ratings and demographic leads. In the morning, in the wake of the Jane Pauley fiasco, "Good Morning America" shot past "Today." In the evening-newscast race, Peter Jennings and ABC News came to be seen as the best of the three news organizations, as Jennings's and ABC's handling of the gulf war confirmed. In sports, as CBS suffered heavy losses and NBC lost its baseball franchise, ABC turned a modest profit.
But ABC was "winning" a loser's game. By the end of the 1990-91 season, the damage from the earthquake that had struck broadcasting was unmistakable. The three networks lost 5 percent of their prime-time audience this season, as their share fell to 62 percent.
For the second year in a row, no network opened the season with a certifiable hit. And what hits the networks did have -- shows like "Cheers" (NBC), or "Murphy Brown" (CBS), or "Roseanne" (ABC) -- now attracted ratings one-third to one-half smaller than those of network hits of past years. This year, pounded by falling ratings and a recession, the three networks together are likely to lose money.
Yet, even though ABC's prime-time resurgence seems to have stalled, analysts have tended to note Cap Cities/ABC's strengths -- its advertiser-friendly demographics, its news and sports divisions (the most profitable among the three networks), its diversified portfolio of investments. And a management team so strong that when Tom Murphy turned over leadership of the company to Dan Burke in June 1990, it seemed less a break than a graceful transition.
 FOUR YEARS AFTER rallying the troops at the Arizona Biltmore, Tom Murphy delivered an emotional thank-you to industry executives at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. "I always thought it was something special to be a broadcaster," he said. "The part of the network most dear to my heart is the news division. . . . The greatest personal satisfaction I have gotten out of being associated with ABC is when the slide goes up and you see the ABC logo and it says under it, 'More Americans get their news from ABC News.' "
Tom Murphy was saying something special, something that Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather and other journalists who come to work each day at the networks craved to hear.
They wanted to feel appreciated. And they wanted to hear something else, something that Murphy would also say, as if by reflex. Before the applause subsided, Murphy hushed the crowd, and invited one of his executives to stand and bask in the spotlight, alone. When the light reached its destination, Murphy introduced "the genius behind the great ABC News operation -- Roone Arledge!"
Later in the evening, after Peter Jennings paid a brief but poignant tribute -- "Tom, we are proud to work for you" -- the sportscaster Jim McKay rose to lift his glass. "Frankly, when Cap Cities took over some five years ago," he said, looking at Murphy, "all we knew about them was that they were supposed to be 'lean and mean' and run a tight ship. Didn't sound like us, did it, Roone? Well, we found they were lean but really weren't mean at all. . . . We found this was a business organization that used words like 'integrity' and 'honor' and 'responsibility' -- and meant them."
Like their counterparts at the other two networks, Dan Burke and Tom Murphy have at times been quite ruthless in terminating employees. And ABC, like NBC and CBS, has sacrificed quality for ratings, has too often chosen to entertain rather than instruct. But amid the turmoil in television, ABC was simply a better place to work. Not because it had invented some new management technique like General Electric's "workout sessions" or improved its ratings, but because, while keeping an eye on the bottom line, Cap Cities seemed more sensitive to the human factor. "I've never met anyone who tired of compliments," observed Dan Burke.
Unlike the top management at either NBC or CBS, it did not seek to defeat the old culture. It became more involved in Hollywood. Just as important, Cap Cities management took the time to mingle and laugh, to give pats on the back, to share credit. It respected the sometimes passionate reasoning and traditional totems of its workers, knowing that anxiety and ambition, pride and panic can overwhelm dollars-and-cents business logic, can boost or retard profits. In the middle of an earthquake, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke radiated a sense of security.

HEADLINE: Pop Radio Suffers a Midlife Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID BROWNE; David Browne is a senior writer at Entertainment Weekly.

 BODY:
As Wilson Phillips' "You're in Love" booms through the control room of Z100, you would think the New York-area radio station was doing everything right. At its Secaucus, N.J., headquarters, the "morning zoo" disk jockeys Gary Bryan and Ross Brittain are bustling around making prank phone calls to executives and rattling off traffic and news updates. Every so often, Mr. Bryan scans the music log -- a computerized list of songs he must play every hour -- and grabs a pile of tape cartridges, each containing a current hit. Those marked with blue dots indicate songs that, in the words of the show's producer, Mike Opelka, are "really happening." For a Top 40 station, one that plays the pop hits of the moment, life doesn't get any more normal.
But at Z100, officially known as WHTZ-FM, and many other pop radio stations around the country, things are seriously out of tune. Z100 had been No. 1 in its market from 1987 through the summer of 1989, three times earning a competition-squelching 6.2 share (percentage of the listening audience, based on Arbitron data). By the spring, Z100 was lingering at 3.6, lagging behind stations specializing in oldies (WCBS, with a 5.2 share), dance pop (WRKS, with 5.1), soft rock (WLTW, with 4.8) and six others. 
 Z100's sinking ratings are an indication of the dire circumstances of Top 40 radio, which, when it was the only game in town, used to determine what was a hit record. Top 40 has experienced slumps before, but now must compete with formats that specifically appeal to fans of rock oldies or hip-hop or hard rock. This fragmented audience, combined with the increasing role of MTV and the aging of the baby boomers, is taking its toll on old-fashioned Top 40. The national Arbitron/Billboard share for the format went from 14.4 percent in the spring of 1990 to 11.9 percent in the winter of 1991.
And it's not just Top 40. No longer the sole backbone of the music business, pop radio as a whole is having a midlife crisis. Unsure of whether to grab teen-agers or baby boomers, station owners have switched formats faster than listeners can switch stations; last year alone, 1,050 stations -- roughly one-tenth of all commercial stations -- changed formats, lurching from Top 40 (Paula Abdul) to Adult Contemporary (Gloria Estefan), from hard rock (Guns 'n' Roses) to Classic Rock (the Doors). As station playlists focus narrowly on one type of music fan, and as stations become more attuned to advertisers than listeners, the result is a significant change in what we hear and where we hear it.
Granted, Top 40 is still instrumental in making hit singles. "Unless radio brings it home, it won't be a hit," says John Boulos, a vice president of promotion and field operations at Virgin Records. But as Steve Kingston, Z100's vice president of programming, says, "The rules have changed -- it's a whole new ball game."
Much of the conundrum is radio's own fault. In the 60's, it was possible to hear the Rolling Stones, the Supremes, the Monkees and Aretha Franklin on one Top 40 station in an hour. Today, with the expansion of the FM band that began in the early 70's, those acts would probably be found on separate stations. The FM dial is sliced and diced into as many different music formats as there are shredded vegetables at a salad bar.
Top 40 -- or CHR, Contemporary Hit Radio -- blares hits from Billboard's singles chart. For the latest in synthesized dance pop, rap and club beats, there's UC (Urban Contemporary). For primarily white rock-and-roll, there's AOR (Album-Oriented Rock). For mellow soft rock, AC (Adult Contemporary).
If you're not yet confused, each has subdivisions (like Adult Urban Contemporary, which features upscale black performers like Luther Vandross, or Classic Rock, an offshoot of AOR). There are formats so new they have not yet developed acronyms -- alternative-rock stations that dare to play bands (Depeche Mode, the La's) with members under the age of 40.
This fragmentation and segregation has done wonders for advertisers, who love niche marketing. It has also alienated people who would sooner watch MTV than turn the radio dial in search of music they like.
In the record business, radio is both tolerated because it helps sell records and scorned because it is too static and formulaic. Record companies have been stung by the lack of "back announcing" on radio, the practice of telling listeners what songs they just heard. (A sign of discontent: "When You Play It, Say It!" stickers pasted on new albums as forceful reminders to careless disk jockeys.) In fact, it is increasingly common for record companies to forgo radio initially and introduce a song on MTV.
The very idea of a mass-appeal station -- one that would attract a wide class and age range with something for everyone -- has been lost. Given the cultural fragmentation of the country itself, maybe it was inevitable. In the 60's the weekly WABC-AM Top 40 show "Cousin Brucie's Saturday Night Dance Party" had a 25 share in New York and reached an audience between the ages of 10 and 60. These days, a Top 40 station would be lucky to get a 5 share with an audience aged 18 to 24.
Possibly the decline is a backlash against rap or the pulsating dance music of groups like C&C Music Factory and Tara Kemp. "Top 40 has become a real balancing act," says Mr. Brittain of Z100. "In '83, there was Michael Jackson, the songs from 'Flashdance,' Cyndi Lauper -- all these mass-appeal artists who crossed boundaries. Now it's difficult to play rap without the adults saying, 'Goodbye!' And you can't play the softer pop without the kids saying, 'Too wimpy!' It's a problem."
 
Demographics
Wanted: Young Single Female
 Top 40 used to be simple -- the hits just kept on coming. When the baby boomers came of age (and took the lion's share of buying power with them), radio began singing the tune of pinpoint demographics.
The result? Too much dance pop. Not enough dance pop. Too much Led Zeppelin. Not nearly enough Led Zeppelin. Everyone complains about radio except the advertising community. In that demographic-dominated world, keeping listeners apart is precisely the plan. Music is a tool to reach a specific consumer, preferably age 25 to 54 and female, advertisers' ideal consumer.
If you listen to a particular station, the radio world already has you pegged. According to the Radio Advertising Bureau, Top 40 listeners -- those who tune in to KISS-FM in Los Angeles or WBBM in Chicago, for example -- are 18- to-34-year-olds who buy CD players, drink Coors Light beer and drive a Toyota Celica. Album-Oriented Rock and Classic Rock stations (WNEW in New York, WYSP in Philadelphia) are targeted at 25- to-35-year-olds who drink Corona beer, buy audio components and drive a Toyota MR2. Those who listen to soft rock on Adult Contemporary stations (WBZ-FM in Boston, KOST-FM in Los Angeles) are 24 to 44 years old, gulp Miller High Life, buy TV sets and drive a Toyota Corolla.
"You have to sell specifics -- the whole idea of 'wide' is gone," says Warren Potash, the president of the Radio Advertising Bureau. "The only one who wants to reach everybody is the census."
 
 
Pushing Product
All the Hits, All the Time
 To reach these specific demographics, radio stations must make sure they are playing exactly the right songs at exactly the right time, reducing playlists to a science. Program directors gauge phone requests, conduct phone surveys, scan the Billboard charts, study the playlists of competing stations and listen to relentless pitches from radio promotion executives at record companies. Although dozens of singles are released each week, only three or four (at most) are added to the average Top 40 station.
Shady characters have long been a part of the music promotion business, and they still lurk in the shadows. Flogging performers like Vanilla Ice and Wilson Phillips through independent promoters -- hired guns who, in exchange for large salaries, pitch records to stations -- continues unabated despite the Justice Department's most recent payola investigation. (The case ran aground when charges brought in Los Angeles were dismissed last year against the leading promoter, Joseph Isgro, and other industry figures.) Independent promotion is not illegal, but payola is.
One former executive at a major record label (who insists on anonymity) says her company's radio promotion department would routinely entice program directors and other personnel with vacations in the Bahamas and prostitutes. "People in radio promotion have unbelievable expense accounts that they don't have to justify," she says. "There was an attitude of 'Whatever it takes. . . .' "
Labels spend an average of $70,000 on independent promotion for high-priority albums, according to a survey by a Los Angeles accounting firm. The promoters' influence means that banal songs are often added to radio playlists.
Once songs are selected, many stations use a computer to group them into hourly music blocks; the computer insures that the same artist isn't played twice in a row and that certain cuts are played regularly. The big hits, called "powers," are played about every two hours. In a technique called "day parting," hits and easy-on-the-ears pop are played in the morning, ballads in the afternoon and hard rockers later in the day and into the night. Mr. Kingston of Z100 says there is no other way for radio stations to compete for narrow demographics. "The alternative is to put a box of records in the studio with the deejays," he says. "But the business is too sophisticated these days for the primitive ways of the past to work."
Mr. Bryan, the Z100 deejay, agrees, but with reservations. "Programming is too research driven," he says. "There's too much money at stake for people to make decisions based on gut feelings."
 
 
Competition
The Video Takeover
 Research, among other things, dictates that Top 40 stations play catch-up with video. "MTV is the single most important factor on your side," says Mark Di Dia, general manager of the record company Def American. "You still need radio, but if MTV's on your side, it's the equivalent of 100 radio stations playing your song."
The Top 10 success of the Divinyls' "I Touch Myself" provides a textbook example. Until this year, the Australian band had never had a hit and was regarded as a cult rock act -- a hard sell to Urban Contemporary stations. So John Boulos of Virgin Records developed a multitiered approach to convince Top 40 radio to add the song.
In a process that Mr. Boulos calls "a relay race," Virgin first established the song at college and alternative-rock stations and sent its provocative video to MTV. The network immediately took to the clip. It was six weeks before "I Touch Myself" was shipped to pop radio, at which time program directors had no choice but to play the song.
"We set it up so that, when it went to pop radio, everything was ready," says Mr. Boulos. The tab for making "I Touch Myself" a hit, he says: more than $500,000 spent on making a video, independent promotion and air fare for Mr. Boulos and others to visit radio stations around the country, plus the use of most of Virgin's 25-person radio promotion staff. The payoff: 500,000 albums sold.
 
Adults Only
Nothing but Love Songs
 The power of the baby boomers is reflected in the Adult Contemporary formats, which have grabbed the largest slice of the pop radio pie. These playlists -- the perfect way to reach 25- to 50-year-old listeners -- program pleasant, midtempo soft pop, from Chicago to Londonbeat. Unlike Top 40 announcers, Adult Contemporary disk jockeys are calm and mild-mannered, and the general mood is as reassuring as a phone message from a good friend. "We play songs you can sing along to but not get depressed over," says Robert Dunphy, vice president of programming at WNSR-FM, a New York Adult Contemporary station.
But there are many different kinds of adults. Basic easy-listening Adult Contemporary relies on Barry Manilow, Kenny Rogers and other relative old-timers of the genre. For a slightly "hipper" alternative, there is Hot AC (also called Mix), which favors a younger, more rhythmic generation: Phil Collins, Sting, Mariah Carey, even Billy Idol. Other specializations include Lite (heavy on love songs), Beautiful Music (instrumental selections a la Muzak) and light jazz-fusion. Adult Contemporary stations are so numerous, in fact, that the format leads in overall ratings even though any one station may not be No. 1 in its market.
"AC does better when times are economically shaky," says Mr. Dunphy. "People don't know where the country's headed, so they're looking for a safe haven."
WNSR and other Adult Contemporary outlets may be in for some competition over the male component of the demographic. Several stations around the country have switched to the latest variation on the format -- Rock AC, essentially singer-songwriters and country-rockers of the 60's and 70's like Jackson Browne. "Instead of just playing the Eagles' 'Desperado,' " says Mr. Dunphy, "they'll go deeper into the album and play, say, 'Tequila Sunrise.' " He adds, not at all facetiously, "It's a variation with a lot of promise."
 
 
What's Missing?
Between Rock And a Hard Place
 Wonder where brash, new, innovative rock-and-roll fits into this bleak scenario? You're not alone. Since the advertising world's targeted age group is 25 and up, rock stations tend to dwell in the past -- the Rolling Stones, Jethro Tull, Crosby, Stills and Nash and other baby-boomer war horses. According to Broadcasting magazine, the number of Classic Rock outlets went up 160 percent -- to 240 stations -- from 1989 to 1990.
Nor is new rock welcome on Top 40 stations, whose audience favors electronic dance-pop and rap. Stations are therefore often reluctant to add guitar-based rock bands to their playlist. Current albums by Van Halen and Skid Row have both hit No. 1 without the benefit of a Top 40 single. Even an eagerly awaited single like Guns 'n' Roses' "You Could Be Mine," a thundering rocker from the band's long overdue "Use Your Illusion II" album, has not been immediately embraced by Top 40 stations.
If any new rock band could have attained a foothold on either Album-Oriented Rock or Top 40, it should have been the Black Crowes, the Atlanta boogie-rockers who sound like the illegitimate sons of the Rolling Stones and Humble Pie. Nonetheless, pop radio turned a deaf ear to all four singles from their first album, "Shake Your Money Maker." As a result, their label, Def American, opted to promote the band through touring and MTV. It worked: the album sold two million copies with hardly any radio air play. Only now is the band's third single, "Hard to Handle," which was released last fall, receiving consistent air play.
"It's a sad state of affairs," says Mr. Di Dia of Def American. "If people are buying it and radio isn't playing it, something's wrong."
The drought of Top 40 rock could end when Bruce Springsteen, Guns 'n' Roses and U2 unveil new albums this year; pop radio's acceptance of R.E.M.'s brooding folk-rock single, "Losing My Religion," could be a harbinger of things to come. Or, says Ken Barnes, the editor of the trade magazine Radio and Records, "it could also be the last hurrah" for rock on Top 40.
 
 
Forecast:
Increasingly Cloudy
 There is no denying the continued appeal of Top 40 radio, nor the exhilarating feeling of hearing a favorite oldie or a compelling new single boom over the airwaves. "Radio is a comforting and comfortable medium," says Mr. Barnes. "It attempts to communicate one-on-one."
There is no denying that pop radio still has a few tricks up its sleeve. A year ago, it would have been unimaginable that the Top 40 hits would include "Losing My Religion," E.M.F.'s "Unbelievable" or the Extreme's Beatlesque ballad "More Than Words." But that's just what happened. It might be rash to expect a return to Top 40's most recent golden era of 1983 to 1985, but such loosening up does mean that listeners will be able to hear a little variety -- or at least something other than the thump-thump of a drum machine -- on their local stations. In radioland, this is considered progress.
Yet even Mr. Barnes says he believes that, in the 90's, pop radio will continue to fragment, reflecting the aging of the baby boomers, their continued spending power and their outright disdain for beat-heavy pop.
Says Sean Ross, radio editor of Billboard: "The days when 'American Pie' came out on Monday and everyone was talking about it by Friday are gone. But I believe it can happen again."
The Z100 crew hopes so, too, but it's easier said than programmed. Gary Bryan says it has been his dream to invite a bunch of legendary black 50's disk jockeys in and let them play their favorite 45's from that period. "You know, it might be fun to return to that sense of anarchy," he muses, turning to his co-host. "Ross, will anarchy ever happen here?"
"Nope," says Mr. Brittain, chuckling and shaking his head. "Highly doubtful." Case closed.
Outside the confines of the Z100 studios, though, the situation is not such a laughing matter. Lost in a morass of generation gaps and market research, pop radio's power and signal grow a little dimmer every day.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC: 'Cav' and 'Pag' Visit Little Italy;
Sunny Villages In Calabria And Sicily . . .

BYLINE: By KENNETH FURIE; Kenneth Furie is a former music editor of High Fidelity magazine.

 BODY:
As you have undoubtedly heard, "Cavalleria Rustica na" and "I Pagliacci" are moving. By Saturday eve ning, assuming all goes well, the New York City Opera will have completed the relocation of Mascagni's and Leoncavallo's perennial verismo twins -- cartons unpacked, curtains hung, dishes put away, breakage and loss tallied -- from their ancestral homes in, respectively, Sicily and Calabria to New York's Little Italy.
Actually, City Opera is becoming a practiced hand at these long-distance hauls. Only last night, Verdi's "Traviata," formerly resident in stodgy old Paris, was safely ensconced in present-day New York and Paris. 
 And perhaps it will all work out. There's nothing inherently impossible in this business of transposing an opera setting. Still, the business shows signs of getting out of hand, and in the specific case of the verismo twins, the theory -- that transposition can make the subject matter more available to an audience -- seems especially dubious.
These are operas that openly aspire to reality, and Leoncavallo provided a stirring and seemingly misunderstanding-proof manifesto in the Prologue to "Pagliacci." To cite just the famous climax (better still would be to listen to it from the throat of a good baritone): "And you, rather than our poor actors' cloaks, consider our souls, since we are men of flesh and bone, and like you we breathe the air of this orphan world." A worthy goal, one would think, for any kind of opera.
Nevertheless, the popular understanding of "verismo" seems to inspire attention mostly to those actors' cloaks. For example, in a recent published interview, City Opera's general director, Christopher Keene, ventured that verismo opera "should really shove your face in the grit and grime," as if "truth" were equivalent to "grit and grime." "No more happy peasants in pretty costumes," Mr. Keene promised. "These will likely be the most violent productions of the two operas that New York has seen."
And yet, who are those people in the opening scenes of both operas if not "happy peasants" -- and at least in "Cavalleria," on Easter Sunday morning, in their prettiest costumes. For that matter, the merchants and homemakers of "Cavalleria," which takes place in the village square, would probably have something to say about this "grit and grime" stuff -- don't you get the feeling from the score and the setting that this village glistens under the Sicilian sun?
Nor is it apparent what "violent productions" have to contribute to these operas. The world of "Cavalleria" is in fact one of extreme order. It certainly contains violence, but you would hardly know it from most of what happens in the opera, and even the act of violence in which it culminates is specific and contained -- Turiddu knows the inevitable outcome of his involvement with Alfio's wife. The world of "Pagliacci," apart from the demons lurking in Canio's mind, isn't noticeably violent at all.
If you wanted to find the truth of these operas, like any great work of art, you would surely want to start by discovering their worlds. Their concerns are closely linked to time and place: the orthodox social-religious values that permeate the Sicilian village depicted on this hot Easter Sunday in "Cavalleria"; the entertainment-starved Calabrian village that provides a backdrop for the rootlessness of the traveling players depicted in "Pagliacci."
The values represented in these operas, and the conflicts that grow out of them, surely have universal relevance. Isn't that why we have great composers? Transpose the setting, and what are the chances of finding sufficiently close and consistent equivalents? Isn't it likely to be harder rather than easier to to make an audience recognize and identify with those values and conflicts?
"Cav" and "Pag" were meant to be revolutionary operas, and they are. It shouldn't be held against them that the hoped-for revolution never really happened, that it was co-opted by cartoon images of "verismo." It shouldn't be held against the composers that neither came close to matching this relatively youthful achievement. (Mascagni was 26 when "Cavalleria" had its premiere, in 1890; he died in 1945. Leoncavallo was 35 when "Pagliacci" had its premiere, in 1892; he died in 1919.)
So where might one look for the revolutionary truth of the verismo twins? An example from each opera may serve to show how a performer has found real life in the score, guided by the "Pagliacci" Prologue's admonition that its author "was inspired by what is true."
 
Conducting 'Cavalleria'
 In 1940, the 76-year-old Mascagni accepted an invitation to conduct a recording of "Cavalleria," complete with a wonderfully stagy spoken introduction. The recording isn't generally much admired. The performance is slow. There's not much aural evidence of passionate involvement on the part of the orchestra and chorus of La Scala. The general explanation is that the composer was old and tired, not to mention 50 years removed from the act of composition, and there was after all a war going on.
And yet, whether or not Mascagni would have conducted the opera the same way 50 years earlier, he seems to me in close touch with the compositional impulse. He produces a dramatic coherence and power unapproached by anyone else I've heard -- the only conductors who even pursued this direction being Herbert von Karajan in his recording and Leonard Bernstein at the Met.
From the opening theme of the Prelude, sweet and sultry, Mascagni's performance seems generated by the physical life of the village: the heat through which the inhabitants move with stength of purpose but economy of energy, the communal investment in the morning preparations for the Easter service and then the service itself.
The "Regina Coeli" can have such a monumental impact that one almost sympathizes with Francis Ford Coppola's impulse to cheat in "Godfather III," pretending that this great chorus is the climax of the opera rather than a relatively early event.
For the villagers, it may in fact be the climax of the year. For the opera, it is the basic reality that provides context for subsequent events: the ringing affirmation that "the Lord is not dead" answers all the Big Questions for the villagers and binds them in answer, even as it excludes poor excommunicated Santuzza, for all the fervor of her prayer.
Excommunication in fact seems to have given Santuzza a shred of identity, however heartbreaking: "Sono scomunicata!" -- the central fact of her existence, which nobody in the village appears even to remember. (She has to remind both Mamma Lucia and Turiddu.)
Make Santuzza's place in the community real, and she can be among the most heart-rending protagonists in opera. To hear how the opera's gruesome climax emerges from the texture of daily life in the village, listen to the composer shape his own score.
 
Singing Silvio
 "Pagliacci" is a more straightforward piece, and comes with a built-in road map to reality in the form of the Prologue. So a different form of example may be helpful.
A decade or so ago, before the present glut of wonderful baritones made his services unneeded at the Met, the Canadian baritone Allan Monk lent considerable distinction to the second-line principal roles in which he was cast. These came to include Silvio, the second baritone in "Pagliacci," who has the great scene in which he persuades Nedda to "fly with me," and then returns at the end to become Canio's second victim.
Essentially no information is provided about Silvio. There's just what can be gleaned in the passionate utterances of the duet. Since lovers in the throes of infatuation tend to sound similar, it's easy to think of Silvio as a more dashing and gallant alternative to the outwardly charming and inwardly raging Canio.
And then there was Allan Monk: a somewhat dumpy looking fellow with a lovely, cultivated voice and a highly developed sense of truth in his singing -- the instinct and ability to sing as a human being. And for once the scene made real sense. Silvio is offering Nedda peace, relief from the physical and psychological rigors of her itinerant life with Canio, of which the audience has just seen a fairly brutal sampling.
"The author has sought to paint for you a slice of life," the "Pagliacci" Prologue sings. "His only maxim is that the artist is a person, and that he must write for people." The authors of both these operas have done their job too well, in that both operas have a built-in emotional power that's hard to spoil. But if their inspiration were to be found in "what is true," they might then rise to a whole other kind of power.
 
 
 
'CAV/PAGS' ON CD, AND OTHERS MISSED
 As a group, the "Pagliacci" recordings are stronger than those of the trickier "Cavalleria Rusticana." (All available recordings cited are on CD only.)
First, some overall choices. For "Pagliacci," a pair: the low-key but well-sung 1954 New York recording with Jussi Bjoerling, Victoria de los Angeles, Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill (Angel CDC 49503; mono), and the vibrant 1961 Scala recording with Franco Corelli, conducted by Lovro von Matacic (Angel; currently unavailable).
For "Cavalleria": Bjoerling's 1958 Florence stereo remake, with Renata Tebaldi and Ettore Bastianini (RCA, then London; currently unavailable).
Among the available stereo versions, tread carefully. Herbert von Karajan's 1965 Scala coupling (Deutsche Grammophon 419 257-2), while somewhat overrefined, is beautifully played and well enough sung. London's 1960 recordings (421 870-2) offer slightly stodgy but idiomatic performances with forceful singing by Mario del Monaco and Cornell MacNeil, plus capable colleagues. London's presentable 1967 "Pagliacci" (uncut) with James McCracken, Pilar Lorengar, Robert Merrill (now Tonio) and Tom Krause has been reissued by Innovative Music Productions (IMPX 9017).
Finally, some interesting supplements, beginning with the Canio and Turiddu of Beniamino Gigli -- still in ringing form in the 1934 "Pagliacci" (Angel CDH 63309; mono), vocally stressed out in the moving composer-conducted 1940 "Cavalleria," with Gino Bechi (Angel CDHB 69987; mono); Bongiovanni has issued a listenable 1938 composer-conducted "Cavalleria" from The Hague (GB 1050-2) -- also slow but more urgent. There are points of interest in the work of Callas and company in their 1953-54 recordings (Angel CDCC 47981; mono).

HEADLINE: Scientist Champions Cause of Natural Gas as Fuel

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
BACK in 1982, Prof. Enoch Durbin was pondering an offer to study solar energy in the Negev in Israel when one of his engineering students at Princeton University stopped by to ask him to breakfast with his father, a high-ranking government official in British Columbia.
That casual invitation eventually led Professor Durbin to forgo his desert expedition to spend his sabbatical leave instead in the cooler climes of western Canada. There, he took up a challenge issued over coffee that morning in Princeton -- to help wean the province off its dependence on imported oil. 
 To make that happen, Professor Durbin and the British Columbian Minister of Science, Patrick McGeer, set up a system to re-equip vans and cars to run on compressed natural gas. Today, a network of service stations that dispense natural gas to a growing number of retooled vehicles has reduced British Columbia's oil imports.
Professor Durbin returned from Canada convinced that he could transplant his experience to the United States. Ever since, he has been a tireless supporter of natural gas as the alternative fuel of the future. He supports this source of fuel, he says, because it is plentiful, cheap and better for the environment and would make the United States less dependent on the Middle East for energy needs.
To promote his cause, he has been traveling around the country, calling on Washington politicians, Detroit auto makers, state lawmakers or anyone else who can advance the cause.
"He is a very stimulating individual," said Bernard Robertson, general manager of jeep and truck engineering at the Chrysler Corporation. "Yes, I would certainly describe him as a crusader."
 Such efforts are hardly likely to gain Professor Durbin much popularity in a country where any tampering with the automobile is regarded as a sacrilege, Professor Durbin said. Describing himself as a Don Quixote, Professor Durbin said that when he told his family he would take on the quest of "changing the way America fuels its cars," his wife, Marilyn, responded, "You must be out of your mind?"
Professor Durbin says he does not expect everyone to want to drive a car powered by natual gas. But he argues that if just a few big operators of buses and vans were to switch to that type of fuel, the payoff would be enormous. "If we doubled our consumption of natural gas to replace oil, we could just about wipe out our foreign oil imports," he said.
 Even if many people are skeptical about the prospects for radical change in gasoline consumption levels, Professor Durbin said he was encouraged by several recent developments. One is the decision by the United Parcel Service to convert its vans to natural gas. Federal Express and Entenmann's Bakery are expected to follow suit.
A breakthrough on the government side, he said, occurred when Texas voted to give financial incentives to fleet operators to switch to natural gas. Yet another experiment will occur much closer to home: Princeton University is preparing to convert some of its vans to natural gas.
Not everyone involved in the search for petroleum substitutes agrees that natural gas is the answer. Researchers have been exploring other ideas, including hydrogen, ethanol, methanol and battery-powered engines.
Professor Durbin said he believed that these ideas were all grievously flawed and that natural gas was the superior fuel. Hydrogen, for example, is clean but is easily ignited and is therefore too dangerous, he said.
Methanol, now being promoted by some Bush Administration officials, is "highly toxic, and because it is soluble in water it can easily contaminate our water supplies," Professor Durbin said, and ethanol, though a renewable source of energy, "uses up more energy to make than we get back." Electric vehicles will not be feasible until a lighter battery is designed; currently, batteries equivalent to a 12-gallon tank of gasoline weigh 7,000 pounds, he said.
 
Some Drawbacks to Natural Gas
 Not surprisingly, however, each of these options has its supporters, and auto manufacturers are exploring a number of alternatives to the gasoline engine. Even a champion like Professor Durbin concedes that natural gas also has some drawbacks, mainly that natural-gas tanks hold less fuel and would therefore limit the range for most cars to about two-thirds that of a tankful of gasoline.
But Professor Durbin says the advantages of natural gas far outweigh the disadvantages. On the positive side, natural gas costs about 50 to 80 cents a gallon and reduces smog by producing lower levels of pollutants like carbon monoxide. "It's a superb fuel," he said.
A longtime resident of Princeton, Professor Durbin, 63 years old, has three grown children and has served on the Borough Council. Professor Durbin, who has been on the Princeton faculty for more than 30 years, is also director of the university's Instrumentation and Control Laboratory, situated in the Engineering Quadrangle. There he has been working to perfect an auto engine that could burn natural gas as well as oil. But in the last few years he has also been striving to build grass-roots support for natural gas, a more elusive and frustrating task, but one that he seems to enjoy nonetheless.
Just recently, he spoke to groups ranging from the Princeton Club of New York City to the New Jersey Engineers Club in Trenton to the Unitarian Church in Princeton (of which he is a longtime member) to a panel of auto makers at the Automobile Show in New York City. He is now involved in establishing a federally financed center at West Virginia University to study alternative transportation fuels.
To excite the average person about the propsects for natural gas is not a simple matter, but Professor Durbin approaches the subject with a mixture of wit and cynicism.
 
A Typical Rendition
 "There are many concerns that might motivate you -- the environment, the troubled Middle East, the balance of payment deficits, my children's and grandchildren's obligations to pay those bills," he said, in a typical rendition of his pitch. But, he added with a laugh, "nobility is too slow. It's more effective to appeal to only baser motives -- fear and greed."
The fear side, he said, was helped by the Exxon Valdez disaster, which heightened concerns over damage caused by oil to the environment. The instability in the Middle East was more than amply demonstrated by the Persian Gulf war, he said, adding that in the last decade, the United States has drastically increased, rather than reduced, its imports of foreign oil. "Our energy policy is based on Saddam today; tommorrow, some sheik in Saudi Arabia," he said.
"For roughly the cost of our military operations in the Middle East, we could convert about a million vehicles a month" to natural gas, Professor Durbin wrote in a recent article.
That leads, he said, into the greed part of the equation. "Here's a way to put money in your pocket," he said, touting economic advantages to consumers. In Texas, where some stations are equipped to pump natural gas, it is selling for about 69 cents a gallon versus $1.09 for gasoline.
An experiment now under way there capitalizes on this point, he said. A new law requires owners of fleets to operate a certain percentage of their vehicles on natural gas by 1992, unless they could show they would be economically harmed by the switch. In fact, Professor Durbin said, the law will likely benefit some of these operators because they can save money on fuel and apply the savings to their operations. He likes to cite the example of a school superintendent who, he said, could save enough by switching a fleet of school buses to natural gas to hire two new teachers.
 
Engine Life of 500,000 Miles
 Natural gas is also kinder to the pocketbook in other ways, he said. Gaseous fuel prolongs the life of engines: an engine life of 500,000 miles would not be improbable. It is safe, he said, asserting that there has never been a fire in a natural-gas vehicle. And the known reserves of natural gas far exceed those of oil; there is enough natural gas in Canada alone to meet the needs of North America well into the next century. Natural gas has the added advantage of being renewable, he said, because it can even be produced from garbage.
Professor Durbin said he used a similar approach with politicians. He recently told a group of Congressmen that reducing the nation's dependence on oil "is one of those issues that can help you get re-elected -- and do some good at the same time," adding, "it's rare that the two coincide."
Alternatives to the standard automobile have been around for a long time; a fleet of solar- and battery-powered cars rolled into New York City recently as part of an alternative fuels promotion. But only a major push by the automobile makers could lead to a sizable effort concerning alternatives.
Natural gas vehicles are more common in some other parts of the world, Professor Durbin said, noting that Italy has 350,000 cars that run on the fuel. But none of the 750,000 natural gas vehicles now operating in various parts of the world were built in an auto factory, he said. "They were all built in someone's backyard," he said.
There are some signs that auto makers may be taking a step toward production of a natural gas auto. Mr. Robertson, of Chrysler, said the company was "bullish" about the use of natural gas. "We do see a demand for compressed natural gas vehicles," he said, "especially for fleets with a central fueling station."
 
A Higher Price Tag for Cars
 An initial problem will be to overcome consumer resistance to the higher price tag of natural gas vehicles, Mr. Robertson said. "The early vehicles are going to cost $4,000 more than the standard models," he said. "We don't see that many customers standing there with orders, but we do see a potential market for it."
 Dr. Roberta Nichols, a research director at the Ford Motor Company, expressed skepticism about the development of natural gas vehicles on a large scale. "We don't see it for the family sedan," she said. "It's wrong to single out any one fuel as a winner."
Since it does not pay oil companies to explore for natural gas they simply vent the natural gas that is released when oil is produced. The Soviet Union alone flares off gas equivalent to 100 million barrels of oil each year, Professor Durbin said. "If you flew around the earth in a satellite," he said, "the brightest object on earth is the Saudi or Soviet fields flaring -- or venting -- natural gas."
Such imagery may make the case for natural gas a little more tangible to the average driver of a gas-guzzling automobile. But in the near term, any change in the way the United States uses gasoline must be marketable -- by making it financially advantageous, he said.
New Jersey's major urban areas, like Newark and Camden, could benefit from converting public buses and taxis to natural gas, Professor Durbin said. Because these vehicles consume large amounts of fuel and contribute heavily to pollution, he said, the payback would be immediate.
The other day, as he prepared to go to Washington to push natural gas to members of Congress, Professor Durbin reflected on his decadelong crusade. Before his stint in Canada, he said, he had been involved in fusion research. And if it had not been for his meeting with his student's father, he may have gone into another field. Now, however, natural gas as a solution to a major transportation issue is his main focus.
"Call it the lucky accident and the prepared mind," said Professor Durbin, recalling a favorite phrase of a Princeton colleague. He employed the same principle after he developed tennis elbow a while ago. He designed a new racquet that reduced vibration and sold it to a manufacturer; it was rated one of the best racquets by a German sports society.
Natural gas may be more esoteric than tennis but Professor Durbin believes he can convince people of its benefits. "I have been talking about it, writing about it, helping people to understand it," he said. "I think it is irresponsible to simply do the research and then say, 'Here stupid world, this is what you ought to do.' "

HEADLINE: Loans for the Elderly Tap the Untapped

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
AS the owner of a successful beauty shop in Mamaroneck, Josephine Cairo, who now is 71, managed to accumulate enough money to fulfill her fondest wish: owning her own home.
"In 1967 I had a ranch house built in Rye Brook," Miss Cairo said. "It was my dream come true, and I hope to live in it forever." 
 But although Miss Cairo owns her house free and clear -- the mortgage was paid off years ago -- until recently she worried constantly about being able to afford to keep it.
 
'I Couldn't Keep Up'
 "Some years ago, I had a serious heart attack, which required a five-way bypass operation," she said. "I had to retire and sell the shop. I've been in poor health ever since. Doctors' bills and real-estate taxes were becoming too much for me. I couldn't keep up."
In June 1990, Miss Cairo, whose house was appraised at more than $300,000, received a five-year reverse mortgage from the Hudson Valley Bank. It pays her $1,495 a month.
"With that and the $681 I get from Social Security, I am just about managing," she said. As repayment, the bank will receive part of the proceeds from the eventual sale of her house.
 
Untapped Equity
 Miss Cairo is one of millions of Americans living on fixed incomes who have untapped equity in their mortgage-free homes. In 1982, Congress passed legislation enabling financial institutions to make home-equity conversion mortgages, commonly known as reverse mortgages, to people like Miss Cairo. The loans are for homeowners over 60, and allow them to borrow against the appraised values of their homes.
Yet banks were reluctant to issue such mortgages, and it was not until 1989 that reverse mortgages were available in Westchester, under a program sponsored by the Westchester County Office for the Aging and the Hudson Valley National Bank in Yonkers, which was then the only bank that agreed to make such loans.
The limit on the term of home-equity conversion mortgages like the one held by Miss Cairo is 10 years, said Doris Schear, the program director for Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit group that advises the elderly on housing issues.
But reverse mortgages with lifetime terms are insured through a Federal Housing Administration program that began in January. The program covers reverse mortgages of up to $124,875 from financial institutions making F.H.A. loans. Eligible borrowers are people over 62 with paid-up mortgages.
 
'Good News' for the Elderly
 "It started as a demonstration project by the Department of Housing and Urban Development two years ago, and it's now become a permanent program," Ms. Schear said. "No repayment of the loan is required until the house is sold or the owner moves somewhere else for more than 12 months."
The F.H.A.-insured reverse mortgages offer borrowers several options, including receiving monthly payments and getting lines of credit, said Yola Corbett, an assistant vice president of Prudential Mortgage Company in White Plains. Her company is an independent mortgage banker designated by the Federal housing agency to make F.H.A. reverse-mortgage loans in the Westchester area, and has no connection to the similarly named life insurance company.
"The maximum claim amount is determined by an appraisal, which is done by a H.U.D.-approved appraiser," Ms. Corbett said. "The mortgage rate is set with a formula using the U.S. Treasury securities rate. The borrower is also charged for mortgage insurance."
Prudential Mortgage, which has been reviewing and processing loans in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Vermont since January, made its first closing in New Jersey, Ms. Corbett said.
 
Paying Medical Bills
 "My clients were a couple aged 76 and 75," she said. "Their reason for receiving the reverse mortgage was to pay for excessive medical bills and other bills they had incurred within the last year. They chose payment of a lump sum up front and the remaining they took in a line of credit for future use."
Unlike a traditional residential mortgage, which is repaid monthly, a reverse mortgage is repaid once: after the death of the borrower or when the borrower no longer occupies the property as a principal residence, Ms. Corbett said.
"Most often, the reasons given by my clients who want this type of financing is that they need the money to pay off large medical bills or to make repairs to their property," she said. "Other clients want it to pay for private nursing care or for living expenses.
"The older you are, the more you can benefit, as the maximum monthly payments made to someone 85 years old are almost four times as much as the payments made to someone 62 years old. It's the same dollar amount, but it's spread out."
 
Bailed Out in a Recession
 Reverse mortgages with the 10-year limits, like those being issued by Hudson Valley National Bank, have been godsends to people who never thought they would need them, Ms. Schear said. "In this recession, what we're seeing is so many people who can't get a second mortgage because their income has dropped," she said. "They are being bailed out by being able to use the equity in their homes."
A woman in her 60's who lives in Hartsdale recently came in for a loan application, Ms. Schear said. "Her husband, who had a good job as a middle manager, lost his job in a corporate takeover. But the wife is working, and she wanted to keep her job for four more years in order to get her pension."
"The problem, which is a very common one in Westchester where most houses are worth over $250,000, is although their house was valued at over $400,000, without the husband's salary their income dropped so they didn't have the money they needed for taxes and expenses."
Now with monthly payments of $1,500 from their reverse mortgage, Ms. Schear said, "they're able to hang on for four more years, when they plan to sell their house and move to Florida."
 
$8 Million Committed
 Hudson Valley Bank has committed $8 million to reverse mortgages since the bank began the lending program two years ago, said Elizabeth M. Lindberg, a bank vice president.
"When the county asked us to participate in the program, in order to get it off the ground, we felt as good neighbors we should become a lender," said Ms. Lindberg. "To date, we've made 61 reverse-mortgage loans. Most people take an up-front advance. They can borrow up to 75 percent of the appraised value of their home, up to a maximum of $125,000, and the income from a reverse mortgage is not taxable."
Ms. Schear mentioned another client,"a lively woman in her 70's," who owns a house worth over $400,000.
"She plans to sell it in five years and move out of the state. She told us she borrowed the money to take trips, which she feels she's strong enough to do now but she may not be able to manage five years from now, when she sells her house."

HEADLINE: For Los Angeles, an Office District by Consensus

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE plan for Central City West, an ambitious new office district in this city, seems to invite skepticism. Consider these bare facts: A small number of affluent developers buy land in a Hispanic neighborhood and decide to remake the area into a high-rise office center.
The developers hire their own consultants and pay for their own land-use plan, which is readily approved by City Hall. They then pay to transform the streets from cramped byways into gracious boulevards suitable for skyscrapers. 
 With the stage thus set, the developers have the right to build 25 million square feet of office space, almost as much as currently exists in downtown Los Angeles.
Proponents of Central City West say the plan is not an assault on good public policy, as some critics claim. They say the plan for the 325-acre area directly west of the Harbor Freeway may represent a new standard in consensus-building in city planning.
To devise the plan, developers met face-to-face with local residents, politicians and planners. In the end, the developers agreed to pay more than $1 billion for transportation amenities like freeway off ramps as well as social benefits like low-income housing and open space.
The Central City West plan represents "a public-private approach, rather than the city just imposing regulations," said Dan O'Donnell, a planner for the city of Los Angeles who monitored the process for the planning department.
Both land and location are the attractions of the area for Central City West Associates, a group of 26 developers and land owners that spearheaded the planning effort. The group includes, among others, Hillman Properties of Newport Beach, LaSalle Partners Ltd. of Chicago, the Hospital of the Good Samaritan of Los Angeles and United Parcel Services.
With few construction sites remaining in the core of the financial district, developers in general have bought land just west of the Harbor Freeway, even though the 10-lane corridor has traditionally been the Great Wall separating the financial district from the working-class Hispanic neighborhood on the other side of the freeway.
Local conditions, however, appeared to thwart high-rise development. The west side of the freeway is largely lacking in off ramps, while surface streets are narrow and discontinuous. Neighborhood residents who feared displacement objected to new projects.
The process that resulted in the plan for Central City West began three years ago when a group of landowners and developers approached Kenneth Topping, then planning director for the city, with a plan for traffic improvements. Mr. Topping told the developers to go further and create a land-use plan for the area. Shortly after, Gloria Molina, who was then a City Councilwoman and has recently been elected a Los Angeles County Supervisor, demanded a role in shaping the plan. She remained an aggressive advocate of affordable housing and neighborhood preservation.
From the beginning, Ms. Molina made it clear that she would oppose any displacement of working-class residents. The Hispanic community in downtown Los Angeles has experienced such displacements in Bunker Hill, a downtown neighborhood razed in the 1960's to make room for office buildings, and in Chavez Ravine during the 1950's, cleared to make room for Dodger Stadium.
Into the 80's, residents like Mauricia Miranda, a homemaker, continued to face threats of eviction and displacement by commercial developers. In 1986, Mrs. Miranda succesfully fought such an eviction, and later emerged a leader in United Neighbors of Temple-Beaudry, a 300-member group formed by Ms. Molina to represent residents in talks with the developers.
A five-person steering committee, representing council districts, city agencies and the developers, oversaw the often-rancorous planning process for Central City West. The negotiations, which lasted for two years, "had a lot of friction," recalled Clifton Allen, a planning consultant who drafted the plan.
Residents wanted to remain undisturbed, and Ms. Molina wanted to preserve the fast-dwindling stock of local housing. City officials wanted transportation solutions, including rail and van pools, that made sense on a regional level. The developers wanted a policy to guide their projects through an increasingly turbulent and uncertain approval process.
Ultimately, the developers agreed to replace all housing demolished since 1984, and to build another 10,000 units, a 235 percent increase in the area's housing stock, at a cost of $300 million. Child care and other services would cost $100 million more.
Transportation improvements, to cost the developers an additional $650 million, are to include freeway-lane widenings, a second level to the Harbor Freeway for buses and vans and pedestrian bridges over the freeway. A commuter rail station is planned near the office district, where planners expect a daytime population of 79,000 people.
Safeguarding the process is a strategy of phased development. Every five years for the next 20 years, the steering committee is to determine whether the developers are keeping their promises to build housing and traffic improvements before further projects are approved.
With Ms. Molina's support, the Los Angeles City Council approved the plan in February.
The first phase of Central City West, the $300 million, 840,000-square-foot, 41-story Los Angeles Center Phase I office tower, starts construction this winter. The project is a joint venture of Hillman and Smith & Hricik of Glendale, Calif. Another development partnership, made up of Shimizu America, a subsidiary of Shimizu Corporation of Tokyo, and PRP Development of Riverside, Calif., plan 1.1 million square feet of office space, a 640-room hotel and another 100,000 square feet of retail, to start construction in 1993.
The Central City West plan continues to be a source of controversy among city planners and planning consultants. Critics ask whether the plan is a subversion of the public policy process, since development is driven by a small number of developers with major land holdings in a traditionally residential area. Without the push from interested developers, those critics say, the plan would not exist.
But it also has its defenders. Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, praised the plan as a "forerunner of the way land-use decisions are to be made in the future," by planning for transportation along with buildings.
Central City West's large-scale approach resembles "the 'special-purpose' districts in New York we did in the Lindsay administration, such as the Fifth Avenue Special Zoning District," said William Fain, a former New York city planner who is currently a principal of the local architectural firm of Johnson, Fain & Pereira. The firm created the 18-acre site plan for Los Angeles Center and designed the first two buildings.
Mr. O'Donnell of the city's planning department remains positive about developer-sponsored planning, observing that the city lacks the manpower and resources to create comparable urban plans. "If it were not for the development community, the city would not have done anything close to what is in this plan."
The process of getting diverse groups to agree to create Central City West was ultimately "more important than the plan itself," said David Grannis, a planner who represented the developers on the steering committee.
"The development community needed to open itself up a little bit to participating in public policy, and the city needed to open up to the economics of development," he said.
Mr. Allen, a planning consultant, acknowledges possible hazards in a planning process initiated by the private sector. "There is a danger of imbalanced representation," he said, "that one group will dominate the process." He said such public-private negotiations need strong political leadership like Ms. Molina's, and a powerful referee like the plan's steering committee.
Mrs. Miranda is one person who does not question the process. "The plan represents a lot of things to the Hispanic community," she said through an interpreter. "There is no reason to change it."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: WILLIMANTIC;
Paper, Paper Everywhere, but Who Wants It?

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
JAMES DeVIVO watched as newsprint was unloaded from a garbage truck at his Willimantic plant, and he pointed out the egg cartons, plastic-foam plates, cereal boxes, plastic bags and paper towels that were mixed in the shipment.
"One of the problems we're having is the quality of paper from the towns has gone way down, to the point it's almost worthless," said Mr. DeVivo, 55 years old, who has spent 40 years in the recycling business, the last 35 with his own company. 
 When recycling was voluntary, he said, people who were committed to the cause separated their trash. Now everyone is supposed to do it, but many people are less than careful, Mr. DeVivo said.
 
Can't Predict Prices
 "I keep hearing the state talking about education, about how we have to educate the public how to recycle," he said. "But I keep getting trash in these loads. It's going to take two to three generations for people to really be trained."
The quality of paper is not the only problem facing Mr. DeVivo's company, Willimantic Waste Paper. Mandatory recycling has produced such a glut that he cannot predict the price, or even whether he can find a market, for recycled paper, glass, metal or plastic, he said.
"We shipped out 3,000 tons of newsprint in the last two weeks," he said, "but only because I have so many contacts. And even then I had to pay $15 a ton to get rid of it. It's the first time in our history we've had to pay to get rid of it."
Mr. DeVivo now accepts paper and other recyclable goods only from towns that have him under contract, more than a dozen municipalities in all.
"The markets are not great," acknowledged Kim M. Trella, a senior environmental analyst with the State Department of Environmental Protection. "We had done a lot of market studies for the things that were on the mandatory recycling list. But there were a lot of things, including the poor economy, that came together, and we don't have any magic formula to set things right. That will have to get better with time."
Ms. Trella said the problem is worse for paper than it is for glass, tin and aluminum, which all seem to be finding markets, although their prices are down.
"The towns that had set up long-term contracts to get rid of their material are doing fine," she said. "The towns that are on the spot market, that try to sell to the highest bidder, are the ones having trouble. Some of those towns have to pay to have their newspaper hauled away."
 The board chairman of the Connecticut Recyclers Coalition, a trade organization, Frederick P. Goodrich 3d, acknowledged that "government-mandated collection is far outstripping the ability of the markets to absorb the materials being recycled."
 The prices that some recycled materials fetch are stable, "but they're not going up," Mr. Goodrich said. "But our collection and processing costs are going up, so we're still hurting."
Mr. Goodrich said New Jersey has a program to lend or give money to businesses that use the recycled products, and he would like to see Connecticut do the same.
"The small businesses -- the end users, the processors -- have to be stimulated," he said. "And I don't see that happening in Connecticut."
 
'So We Do It'
 Walter Gudzunas, the First Selectman in East Windsor, one of the towns that was turned away by Willimantic Waste Paper last month, said the town is now paying $30 a ton to get rid of its paper.
"But even what we're paying is cheaper than bringing it to the landfill, where it costs us $65 a ton," Mr. Gudzunas said. "I don't think we have a choice. The state statutes say we have to recycle, so we do it."
Noting that East Windsor only started recycling this year, Mr. Gudzunas said towns that are longtime recyclers are probably more frustrated at having to pay to have paper hauled away when they used to get as much as $40 a ton for it.
 Mr. DeVivo's business, started in 1956, is one of the state's older recycling centers (they were called junkyards in the old days, he notes) that are experiencing a glut.
He said the state upset a delicate balance when it established mandatory recycling.
"Years ago the Boy Scouts and volunteer groups picked up paper and brought it to a recycling center as a way to raise money," Mr. DeVivo said. "When the supply got to be too great, the prices would drop, and these groups would no longer collect. Then the mills would work off their backlog, the prices would go back up, and everything stayed in balance.
"With mandatory recycling, the flow never stops, never even slows down."
 
New Rules Cut the Load
 The tide of paper, glass, metal, and plastic onto Mr. DeVivo's 14-acre property threatened to bury him until he began turning it away. Where he was once taking in a few hundred tons a month, he found himself receiving 10,000 tons a month. His paper baler had to be rebuilt after running three shifts a day, six days a week, for months.
By instituting new restrictions, which included no longer accepting paper brought in by the carload, Mr. DeVivo said he managed to cut his workload back to a more manageable 3,000 tons a month.
"The government has done nothing with mandatory recycling except cost the towns more money," he said. Although a heavy international demand still exists for newsprint, Mr. DeVivo said his buyers understand the situation he faces.
"The Koreans and the Japanese know our market better than we do, and they know we're oversupplied," he said. "One of my Korean contacts came out here to see me recently, and the minute he drove in the yard and saw these mountains of paper, he knew he had me."
White office paper, which once brought $200 a ton because of its high quality, is now being accepted by the mills only if the recyclers deliver it, he said.
 
Processing Adds Costs
 "I had mills begging me to get into plastic, milk jugs and soda jugs and that type of stuff," Mr. DeVivo said. "So I got a baler and I went to work. Now those same guys won't take my calls."
Another problem has been the quality of the recyclable materials he has taken in, he said. The loads are so contaminated that he has to have his employees sort them before they can be pushed into the baler for compacting. That adds more expense to processing the paper, Mr. DeVivo said. It now costs him $25 to $30 a ton to process newsprint and $85 a ton to dispose of any trash mixed in with the paper -- expenses he has to pass back to the towns collecting the paper, he said.
"Older people, who were used to landfills, can't be trained to recycle," Mr. DeVivo said. "It's evident here that they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing."
The State Department of Environmental Protection, which has been pushing recycling, has also made it more difficult for him, he contended.
At first the department told him his glass and can recycling business would be "grandfathered," because he has been doing it so long. Then officials decided that his expanded operation required a new permit, meaning he will have to pay $7,500 for the application fee, $1,500 a year for the license, $5,000 for a survey and more money for a consultant to prepare the permit application.
"By the time I get done, you're looking at $50,000 to get this permit," Mr. DeVivo said. "That's what they want me to pay at a time that business is terrible."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Paying For Spending of 80's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 3 news analysis of the Connecticut state budget crisis attributes it to "falling tax revenues due to the recession." Our study on the fiscal condition of the states found that in the 1980's Connecticut tax collections rose 161 percent. Connecticut ranks third of all the states in per capita tax collections. This is hardly a state starved for revenues. 
 The real reason for the fiscal crisis in Connecticut is not even mentioned: runaway spending in the 1980's -- a path toward fiscal ruin that has finally caught up to the state. Connecticut's spending rose by a whopping 173 percent from 1980 to 1989. Only one state, Arizona, had a faster spending splurge. Given this mushrooming of the budget, Connecticut taxpayers are wise and fiscally prudent to resist imposition of an income tax, which would only further encourage wasteful expenditures.

HEADLINE: The American Games;
For Games in Cuba, the Athletes Come to Compete and Politics Come Into Play

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
They will begin to trickle in this evening. By Friday, more than 17,000 athletes, journalists and tourists representing 39 nations will have converged on Cuba for the largest international event ever on the island nation.
The 11th Pan American Games will begin in Havana with opening ceremonies on Friday followed by 16 days of competition among member nations of the Pan American Sports Organization. 
 The United States, which has by far the richest and most sophisticated sports machine in the hemisphere, will send a delegation of 700 athletes to compete in Havana and Santiago.
 
Dominating the Field
 The Americans are expected to dominate most events in track and field, gymnastics, women's softball, swimming, shooting, taekwondo and judo. The women's basketball team, which has built a reputation for invincibility once enjoyed by the men, will attempt to extend a 41-game winning streak in major international competition.
The men's team, embarrassed at home by Brazil at the 1987 Pan Am Games and relegated to a bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, will attempt to rebuild its diminished international stature.
A young but talented United States baseball team will have to finish in the top four to gain a berth in the 1992 Olympics. In a move that still angers amateur baseball officials, the team lost seven key players to the professional baseball draft.
Cuba, the defending Pan American champion, is the baseball favorite while Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are strong contenders for an upset and an Olympic berth at the very least.
"This is a tough road trip, and we feel the pressure," said Ron Polk, the coach of the United States team. "Baseball is our national pastime, but it's theirs, too, and the fans are going to be pumped up. They'll have sirens and bongo drums. It can be intimidating."
There is an electrifying quality over all to this year's competition because it is being held on what, for many Americans, is a forbidden island, a place that has been off limits, with a few execeptions, for more than two decades.
For United States athletes from archers to sailors, the trip to Cuba is almost as important as their respective competition.
"It's going to be exciting; I've heard so many different things that I'm anxious to see for myself," said Naomi Hewitt-Couturier, one of three top rhythmic gymnasts representing the United States in the competition, which lasts from Friday to Aug. 18.
A native of New York, where she attends the United Nations School, Hewitt-Couturier will celebrate her 15th birthday on Thursday.
The year she was born, 1976, marked the last time Cuba and the United States competed in the same Olympic Games. (The United States boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980; the Soviet Union and its allies, including Cuba, boycotted the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and Cuba boycotted the 1988 games in support of North Korea).
 
Curiousity Sets In
 Like many of her fellow athletes, Hewitt-Couturier is too young to remember the events that triggered enduring animosity between the United States and Cuba. But like many athletes, her curiosity has been piqued by exhaustive procedures and precautions surrounding the trip.
"I never had to fill out so many forms before," she said. "When I asked why, they said that it was because of what was going on between them and us. That made me curious. I'm curious to find out what happened between us."
In some respects, the Pan Am Games is one of the most significant public events in what President Fidel Castro has called "A Special Period in a Time of Peace." The slogan refers to an era of austerity forced by Cuba's diminished support from the Soviet Union and changing ties with Eastern European nations.
There is speculation that the games could help Cuba thaw its relationship with the United States at a time when the Government and the Cuban people are coping with economic hardships.
That Cuba is pursuing a multimillion-dollar construction project during a time of economic retrenchment -- there are plans to make bicycles the primary form of transportation and animal power the fundamental technology in agriculture -- may not be as large a contradiction as it first appears.
 
'We Would Postpone It'
 Cuba was awarded the Pan American Games in 1986. During an interview with ABC-TV yesterday, Castro said that if the decision were to be made last year Cuba would have not played host the games. "If at present we had to make that decision, we would postpone it," he said. "We would say, 'No, we can't.' "
But he also said that Cuba would recoup its investment during the next three years because the Olympic Villa and hotel would be devoted to international tourism.
"Besides, it gave us a possibility to have excellent sports facilities that our people have wanted to have," he said. "The cost of these Pan American Games constitutes 1 percent of what the country has invested in sports and sports activities in the last 30 years."
At a more visible level the games, which are being produced at a cost of an estimated $156 million, will allow the sports-minded Cubans to reinforce their reputation as the Caribbean's sports juggernaut. Last week an official of the local Cuban weight-lifting federation told the president of the Pan American weight-lifting federation that the Cubans expected to win more gold medals in weight lifting than in any other sport.
 
Lots of National Spirit
 They are equally confident in men's and women's volleyball and Greco-Roman wrestling. There is also hope that Cuba's fierce rivalry with the United States in water polo and team handball will produce gold medals.
But Cuban officials say that the national spirit runs deeper than medals. Much of the construction for the Games was performed by 300,000 volunteers on weekends as a supplement to professional contractors, they said.
Outside of a synthetic surface for the track that was purchased from Germany and bowling lanes from Japan, Cuban-made materials were used for most of the major venues, they said.
 
Partisan Rooting
 While politics and nationalism provide an undercurrent to the games, the Cubans' appreciation of sports for sports' sake could surprise American participants accustomed to highly partisan rooting.
"Especially in a sport like baseball," Polk said. "The fans cheer good plays by the opponent and won't hesitate to get on their own players for shoddy plays.
"I remember a game we played them earlier this year: one of our guys hit a home run and they gave him a standing ovation. When he came back to the dugout he said it was one of the weirdest feelings he'd ever had."

HEADLINE: Art Museum in Detroit Tries to Cope With Cuts

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 26

 BODY:
At any given time, on the abbreviated days when you can visit the Detroit Institute of Arts, half the galleries are sealed and darkened, their stairways roped off and their medieval sculpture and Chinese hand scrolls guarded by forbidding black signs warning, "Galleries Closed."
For months now, loyal patrons have watched the proud, embattled museum trim pieces of itself in response to deep cuts imposed by a state Government that is also embattled. It is the most desperate example of the hard times facing museums around the country as deficit-ridden states and cities cut their arts budgets to pay for schools and roads, and as philanthropic dollars grow scarce because of the recession. 
 While other beleaguered museums, like those in Brooklyn and Boston, are beginning to reduce costs, the 105-year-old Detroit Institute of Arts has already taken drastic measures. It has cut back the days it is open, from six to five; closed half its galleries in the morning and the other half in the afternoon, and in May it started charging admission for the first time since the Great Depression.
The museum, which previously eliminated 54 positions, sent dismissal notices this week to 32 curatorial, managerial and custodial staff members and canceled a major Picasso exhibition planned for the coming season. "We are no longer cutting into the fat," Samuel Sachs 2d, the museum's director, said. "It is now meat and bone."
 
Painful Questions at Core
 At the core of the crisis are painful questions about the role of government in preserving what many long considered a public trust. Museums around the country are closely watching Detroit with an eye to their own survival as the priorities of besieged governments are reordered.
"Our fear is that what is happening in Detroit is a predictor of the future for all museums," said Edward Able, executive director of the American Association of Museums, which represents the nation's 8,000 institutions. "Because our museums have been functioning and flourishing for so many years, people think it will always be thus. No one listens until the museum closes its doors. We are in great distress at what we see."
The museum and the rest of the art world here have been in turmoil since January when the state, facing a $1 billion deficit, imposed cuts of as much as 38 percent on the arts and froze all state payments to the museum. Gov. John Engler, a Republican, even went so far as to abolish the state agency that makes grants to arts organizations, the Michigan Council for the Arts, saying he wanted to reorganize it.
Acting on a legislative mandate, Mr. Engler imposed across-the-board cuts of up to 17 percent early in the year on every Government service except education. When further cuts were needed, it came down to hospitals and roads or the arts. To him, the choice was clear. "The arts budget was seen as a nonessential service," said John Truscott, the Governor's press secretary. "It didn't address the basic human needs of people."
 
Institutions Left Reeling
 Since then, several theater groups have canceled productions, galleries have laid off entire staffs and the Detroit Institute of Arts has been left scrambling to stay open. The institute, a city-owned museum that gets nearly 60 percent of its $26 million operating budget from the state, has not received a single state payment so far this year. It had been scheduled to receive $11 million by now.
"We've been pedaling backward as fast as we can go," said Mr. Sachs. "It's chaos. There is a sense of abandonment and betrayal. Things are totally unstable. A stable partner has suddenly become evanescent."
For Detroit, a city still trying to catch up from the last recession, it is like watching one of the last of the family jewels being hocked, carat by carat.
"It is one of the things in Detroit that is working," said Maurice Parrish, the museum's deputy director. "When you look at a city with no museum, no symphony, no cultural institutions, you not only can't attract businesses, you will lose them."
 
'Between Today and Forever'
 Indeed, it is the city, conceding the truth in those words, that has been backing the museum, dipping into its own treasury to keep the institute afloat until some state dollars come in. "But it can't support us forever," Mr. Parrish said. "We're somewhere between today and forever. We're forced into taking a very short-term view."
Several arts organizations, most notably some smaller theater groups and a dance unit, have already shut their doors. "It's made life a nightmare," said Marilyn Wheaton, executive director of Michigan Advocates for the Arts. "You went to sleep with your body intact, and you wake up without your arms and legs."
And those that are left are all fighting for private donations in the same dwindling pool. "As all of us keep hitting up the same sources, they are beginning to laugh at us," said Cynthia Clair, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Arts Education, a nonprofit group based in Grand Rapids. "They're saying, 'I'm sorry, I don't know where you think we're getting all these resources.' "
Things are not likely to change any time soon. As the Engler administration sees it, the good old days of the state's playing big daddy and prime patron are over. It argues that government should not be in the art business, and it says it wants a new, as yet undefined relationship with the arts.
 
Too Dependent on State?
 "What we've been doing is subsidizing the museum," Mr. Truscott said. "We've been paying for their water and electricity and security and staff. They have become too dependent on the state, which leaves them subject to the whims of the Legislature."
The Governor and leaders of the Michigan arts community have scheduled a summit for early August to try to reach some kind of agreement.
But how much they will resolve is uncertain. There is no more money now than there was when the crisis began. Indeed, further budget cuts are planned for the state's coming fiscal year, and the administration is going into the summit with one key message. "We want to explain how difficult times are and how little money we have," Mr. Truscott said.
All of this many leaves museum patrons feeling helpless and fearful. They dutifully plunk down the new $4 suggested admission fee or whatever they can afford and plan their visits around the abbreviated hours of cherished galleries. And they stare, as Raymond Sayegh, a Detroit dentist, did the other day beneath his favorite part of the museum, the signature Diego Rivera murals, with a glint of awe and sadness in their eyes.
"You just hate to see what's happening to the institute," Dr. Sayegh said. "The arts should be glorified. All these sections should be open. They belong to the public. It's so painful to watch."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Freshman, No Novice, Does Battle For a Base

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
When Robert E. Andrews walks the streets of this city, he can easily be mistaken for a lanky, clean-shaven Capitol Hill aide. But his anonymity vanishes when he returns to Bellmawr, N.J., each weekend.
At home, he is the local Congressman who cannot even go to the store without being asked how he plans to save the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Naval Station. 
 "When you're in Washington and you're a Congressman -- big deal -- there are 435 of them," he said. "At home, you're a franchise."
Representative Andrews, at 33 years old, is the chamber's youngest Democrat, and he has found himself in the thick of a situation most freshmen only have nightmares about.
Within nine months, he has fought against, and now must prepare to endure, what has become virtually inevitable: the Federal Government's decision to close the shipyard.
He has estimated that the move will cost his district approximately 15,000 jobs that are associated, directly or indirectly, with the base.
The sprawling, gray waterfront base -- the largest of the 25 major installations that are targeted for closing by a Federal commission -- has become Mr. Andrews's chief obsession.
"If I'm in a diner, nobody ever comes up to me and says, 'What do you think about the civil rights bill or the striker replacement bill or the proposal to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?' " he said.
What they do ask him about, over and over, he says, is how they will find work after the closing of the shipyard, just across the Delaware River from Camden, which is economically depressed.
For lawmakers like Mr. Andrews, the problem is a lot more complicated and politically lethal than simply deciding how to cast a vote.
Unlike other bases proposed for closing, the Philadelphia docks will be mothballed. That means that the Navy will be able to lay off workers, but that it will preserve the site for future emergency use. That means Philadelphia will not be able to reap the benefits of turning the yard over for economic redevelopment.
Now that President Bush and Congress have moved to ratify the base closing commission's recommendations, Mr. Andrews has found himself in the exclusive, essentially powerless, club of Washington lawmakers who are trying to cope with the political fallout of base closings.
 Mr. Andrews is the son of a shipyard worker who lost his job in 1968 when the private New Jersey yard he worked for closed down. "For me this is deja vu," he said.
Since taking over the Congressional seat last November that was held by New Jersey Governor Jim Florio, Mr. Andrews has spent nearly half his time attending hearings, holding meetings or sending out missives in defense of the Philadelphia base.
Rumors that the yard would be on the list for closing had begun months before the first recommendations were released on April 12.
The Pennsylvania and New Jersey Congressional delegations have tried to fight the decision on the shipyard on several fronts, including inserting language into an appropriations bill requiring the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Kennedy to be rebuilt at the installation.
But Pentagon officials hinted in a hearing last week that the Kennedy may not be overhauled at all, and the lawmakers' last hope may be a lawsuit aimed at overturning the recommendation.
He insists that losing the battle does not mean that the voters will sink his candidacy in 1992. But just in case, he does not hesitate to deal his most partisan cards when asked about the Philadelphia base's future.
"The reality is, we have a political process driven by Pentagon politics instead of Congressional politics," Mr. Andrews said in an interview.
And in testimony before a House subcommittee last week, Mr. Andrews produced a chart he said proved that 76 percent of the civilian jobs lost as a result of the base closings would occur in Congressional districts represented by Democrats.
He dismissed the defense offered by the base closing commission's chairman, Jim Courter, a former New Jersey Congressman, that the process was insulated from politics.
"It's sort of bitterly amusing that people contend that in this city, in this political structure, that these decisions were made without consideration of politics," he said.
"In this city, decisions about who gets furniture are not made without political consideration."

HEADLINE: Toward the Summit;
Soviet Bid to Join I.M.F. Still a Puzzle

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
The Soviet Union's applications to join the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank last week are something of a financial mystery.
Administration officials and academic experts here are asking why President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union did not warn other leaders two weeks ago at the meeting of seven industrialized nations that his Government had already prepared an application for full membership in the I.M.F. and possibly the World Bank. The seven leaders endorsed only a "special association" for the Soviet Union with both multilateral lending agencies. 
 The experts are also asking how much the Soviet Union would have to pay to join both institutions, how it would raise the money and how long it would have to wait for loans.
President Bush will discuss a possible Soviet role in the I.M.F. and the Worl Bank with Mr. Gorbachev when the two men meet in Moscow, the White House has said.
 
Brady Is Critical
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady criticized the Soviet applications on Wednesday as "counterproductive" and said, "We were completely surprised by their move." Soviet membership in the institutions is "not going to happen," he added.
Mr. Brady suggested, and other Administration officials privately agree, that Mr. Gorbachev may have been responding to political pressures at home in seeking full membership. Associate status has been described as second-class citizenship in the world economic order for a military superpower.
Soviet officials in Moscow and Washington have said that obtaining full membership could take several years and is best started early. Associate status can come first in a two-step application process, they said.
Reuters reported from Moscow last week that a Soviet spokesman said the applications to both institutions were submitted on July 15, the day before Mr. Gorbachev went to London. Both were received July 22.
Congress apparently also regards the Soviet move as premature. On Wednesday, the Senate approved an amendment to this year's foreign aid bill that would force the United States to vote against the Soviet applications.
The amendment, sponsored by Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, would direct the Administration to vote against Soviet membership unless the President first certified to Congress that the Soviet Union was instituting certain free-market economic policies, adopting democratic political structures and shrinking military and other Government spending.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said the increasing assertiveness of the Soviet Union's republics raises questions about the ability of the Soviet Union to comply with I.M.F. rules. "You have to assume that someone is politically and economically in control" before a country is allowed to join, he said in an interview.
The Soviet Union needs the huge loans that the I.M.F. and the World Bank could provide. Its economy shrank by 10 percent in the first quarter, it is having trouble paying the interest on foreign debts already totaling about $70 billion, and international prices are low for oil and gold, two of its biggest exports.
President Bush is widely expected to send a trade treaty to Congress this week that would reduce tariffs on Soviet imports. But United States trade with the Soviet Union is small and opening Western markets to Soviet goods promises little immediate benefit to the Soviet Union because many of its exports are commodities on which tariffs are already low.
 
Technical Difficulties
 Several sticky technical problems lie ahead of the Soviet applications, including the size of Soviet contributions and whether the Soviet Union would have a seat on each institution's 22-member executive board.
Five countries have individual seats on the World Bank's board and six countries have individual seats on the I.M.F. board. Other countries are represented by regional directors.
The amount of a country's contribution, its voting strength and the allocation of seats on the board are all determined by the size of its economy. But the size of the Soviet economy, Mr. Brady said, is "the most vexatious question of all: it ranges all the way from big to not very big."
If the Soviet economy is as small as India's, as some economists now estimate, its one-time contribution to the I.M.F. would be $4.41 billion, assuming all contributions are raised as planned at the end of this year. If its economy is as large as Italy's, the contribution would be $6.1 billion.
Unless an exception were made, a quarter of this amount would have to be paid in convertible currencies such as the United States dollar or the German mark, which are traded on world markets at rates set by supply and demand, while the rest could be paid in rubles, which are nonconvertible.
And while the I.M.F. does not require that members have convertible currencies to join, it does insist that members later try to make them convertible. Some economists fear that in the Soviet case this could mean high inflation.
The World Bank has a different system and would be slightly less expensive to join. The World Bank lends mostly to support specific economic development projects while the I.M.F. lends money to countries facing balance-of-payments difficulties.
Raising this money would not be difficult for the Soviet Union, said Horst Schulmann, the managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based trade group. Although the Soviet Union does not publish figures on its foreign currency and gold reserves, as one of the world's largest gold producers it can sell enough gold to raise the money.
Once the initial contribution is made, a member can quickly borrow large sums of foreign exchange. For example, Czechoslovakia contributed nearly $800 million to join the I.M.F. last September, a quarter of it in internationally traded currencies.
In January, Czechoslovakia got lines of credit from the I.M.F. totaling almost $1.5 billion, all of it in international currencies.

HEADLINE: Toward the Summit;
Soviets to Embrace Bush, But Not All He Stands For

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 28

 BODY:
Gone are the days when Soviet citizens looked on an American President as the lord of a hostile empire or a white knight come to rescue Russia from its misery. But if President Bush arrives in Moscow this week as the representative of a far more familiar land -- less exotic, less threatening, less all-promising -- it is still the one to reckon with.
The propaganda about a land of scheming imperialists, or the whispered legends of a land of untold prosperity, have long given way to "Dallas," CNN, Arnold Schwarzenegger, McDonald's, Estee Lauder and the accounts of thousands of Soviet travelers and emigres in forming images of America. 
 Thirty-one of the 64 movies showing in Moscow today are American, from "Lethal Weapon 2" through "Dead Poets Society," and neither the endless bounty of an American supermarket nor the misery of urban slums are a mystery any more. Old fears have abated. No longer do people anxiously sidle up to Americans in the streets and ask if there will be war, or presume that every American is a spy.
 
'A Fundamental Change'
 "A fundamental change has come to Soviet-American relations," Georgi A. Arbatov, head of the Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada, wrote in Izvestia. "Serious, honest, normal people in America have come to the conclusion that there is no 'Soviet threat' to the United States. And identically serious, honest, normal people in the U.S.S.R. have come to the conclusion that the U.S.A. does not intend to attack them or 'explode' the country from within."
Soviet citizens and emigres now crisscross the Atlantic constantly, and their accounts and impressions have profoundly revised the former attitude of adulation toward American culture.
On the contrary, many intellectuals return dismayed by what they see as a superficial culture and by "political correctness," militant feminism, self-conscious egalitarianism and other manifestations of what they identify with the very intellectual conformity and intolerance that they spent their lives fighting against.
 
U.S. Lacks 'Spirituality'
 Soviet citizens who have been to the United States regularly bemoan the absence of "spirituality" and of the intensity of Soviet intellectual life.
"One Soviet woman went to an American doctor and tried to strike up a conversation about Toulouse-Lautrec," Tatyana Tolstaya, a writer who spends much of her time in the United States. "She was shocked that he had no idea who he was. Our doctor typically would have known all about Toulouse-Lautrec, though he would have only a vague idea where her liver is."
Soviet citizens have also become far more familiar with American attitudes toward them. The current issue of Moscow News, for example, carries a bemused survey of American views under the headline "American Tries to Make Sense of Us."
Konstantin Pleshakov, the author, wrote: "The Soviet Union is in disarray. A country Americans throught they knew well -- the winter of Stalinism, mummified leaders, fighters for human rights -- has all at once turned into a formidable crossword puzzle. Today's Soviet Union does not fit any pattern. America is accustomed to the logic of categories of good and evil, black and white. In the U.S.S.R. it is hard to find logic."
Gone, too, is the early illusion of perestroika, Mr. Gorbachev's program of economic and political restructuring, that the shedding of Stalinism would bring the United States and the West rushing in to bring happiness and running shoes to every Soviet family.
At the summit meeting of seven rich industrialized nations in London earlier this month, the nations' leaders decided to wait on any extensive aid to the Soviet Union. The decision met with considerable understanding among Soviet commentators, who agreed that it was imperative for the Soviet Union first to set its own house in order.
 
Global Foe No Longer
 However great the changes in the Soviet Union and its world view, even if the United States no longer figures as the global foe or the promised land, it still remains for many Soviets "the other one," the nation by which they measure their own destiny.
Whether from tradition or from a perception of the United States as the only other country that can match the Soviet Union in sheer size and ethnic diversity, America still holds a mystique that neither Western Europe nor Japan, for all their wealth, can match.
The departing American Ambassador to Moscow, Jack F. Matlock Jr., gained considerable popularity across the Soviet Union by demonstrating a familiarity with Soviet problems in fluent Russian. Invitations to his residence at Spaso House became something of a badge of merit.
Mr. Bush may not be greeted here as Ronald Reagan or his other predecessors were, by a monolithic system eager to assert its might and legitimacy against the leader of an opposing system. There may not be the fascination and awe that the cold war fostered in an American President.
The President, moreover, will be meeting already for the sixth time with Mr. Gorbachev, and in the absence of military confrontation, the strategic arms reduction treat, which will cut long-range nuclear weapons, does not carry the drama of earlier disarmament agreements.
But Mr. Bush still represents a land that stands for many Soviet citizens as the ultimate yardstick of democracy and market economy, and he comes to Moscow at a time that the political debate between the Kremlin and the republics, between the central Government and the supporters of fundamental change in the system, is approaching a decisive stage.
Stanislav Kondrashov wrote in the Government newspaper Izvestia: "In the time of the czars, the Russian upper class imitated the English or the French. In the time of the commissars, the open or tacit yardstick became America. Nuclear arms and intercontinental missiles confirmed this: it is America we have to match."
The significance of Mr. Bush's visit, he wrote, is that the main issue will not be Soviet-American relations, as it was at past summit meetings, but the question of the Soviet Union's fate. "In the time of Gorbachev, we have begun talking of becoming civilized, and the main criteria for this, once again, we see in the United States, from the two-party system and division of powers to evangelists and hamburgers."
If past U.S.-Soviet summits were contests of opposing systems, Mr. Kondrashov wrote, now the contest has shifted to the domestic political arena, and Mr. Bush comes not as adversary but as arbiter. The opposition will claim him as an ally in the struggle for reform; Mr. Gorbachev will tout him as proof of his own importance as an irreplaceable contact with the West.
"I will not hazard a guess on what conclusions, apart from the well-known ones" that Mr. Bush will draw, Mr. Kondrashov wrote. "I doubt they will be new. But for us also before the face of the trans-oceanic guest, the main conclusion is not new: without self-help, without a proper measure of agreement and responsibility in the construction of our common fate, we cannot count either on a better lot nor on retaining the respect of other people and politicians."

HEADLINE: Peru Takes Bigger Role In Production of Cocaine

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
 For years, Peru seemed to be a secondary front in the South American drug war. Though the country produced 60 percent of the world's coca leaf, the Government lacked the will to risk alienating the peasants who scraped out an existence growing the raw material for cocaine.
There was little violence and no cartels, and the crop was quickly transported north to Colombia, where powerful drug organizations processed pure cocaine for shipment. 
 But Colombia's two-year war on its Medellin cocaine cartel has transformed the drug business in Peru, shifting the emphasis away from simple agriculture.
Government officials and narcotics officers here say they see the first signs that drug cartels are forming. Large amounts of cocaine are being refined in Peru's jungles, they say, and traffickers are organizing direct shipments to the United States and Europe.
 
U.S. Awacs on Patrol
 Cultivation of coca in Peru has been gradually increasing despite American aid spent on eradicating coca plants. The United States has become so concerned about Peru's drug trade that it deployed its highly sophisticated Awacs planes here three months ago to help the Peruvian police. The radar-scanning jets, normally based in the Caribbean, are used to find and force down small planes moving drugs and money between Colombia and Peru.
Drug investigators warn that the Cali drug organization is profiting from the setbacks of the Medellin cartel, including the recent surrender of its leader, Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
"We have very good evidence that for six or seven months, Peruvians have been dealing with Cali as opposed to Medellin," said a Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "And remember how smart the Cali cartel was. While Escobar was killing policemen and politicians, the Cali people were quietly going about their business."
For the Peruvian Government of Alberto Fujimori, the most alarming development was the discovery of a big cocaine laboratory in the eastern jungle province of Ucayali in early June. The laboratory had a weekly production capacity of more than 100 kilograms of pure cocaine, with a street value of $1.5 million in Miami and $5 million in Madrid. Even by Colombian standards, that is a very large cocaine laboratory.
 
Once There Was a Middleman
 Until recently, any pure cocaine produced in Peru was intended primarily for the country's consumption. Peruvian peasants have traditionally sold their coca leaf to a middleman who might carry out the first stage in processing, turning the leaf into coca paste. The paste was then usually shipped to Colombia, where it was turned into a cocaine base and finally into pure cocaine in labs.
The Ucayali laboratory, which experts say had been operating for at least a year, carried out both of the final two processes. In a complex of five buildings disguised to look like a farming operation, at least 20 people worked with tons of kerosene, sulphuric acid, ammonia, ether and acetone to produce cocaine.
The authorities also found modern communications equipment, 16 microwave ovens for drying the cocaine, two generators, and, in a nearby storage shed, 250 kilos of pure cocaine.
"I don't think there is any doubt we are seeing a move toward an integrated drug industry here in Peru," a senior Western diplomat here said.
Also worrying the Government is the discovery of shipments originating in Peru. Drug-related violence, which many people say was almost nonexistent two years ago, is also on the rise, and members of the military are increasingly coming under attack by groups associated with the drug trade.
Police corruption has hindered efforts to crack down on refiners and traffickers. Western officials say it is hard for an officer with a monthly salary of $80 a month to resist bribes that often range as high as $25,000.
The officials described raids in which agents swooped down on laboratories only to discover that operators had been tipped off beforehand. In checking the 250 kilos of cocaine seized in June at the Ucayali plant, the authorities discovered this month that 54 kilos had since been replaced by flour.
Meanwhile, in areas where peasants once barely made a living off coca growing, large amounts of wealth are being accumulated.
"There are these old huge houses in the countryside from the days of the rubber boom here," said a high-ranking Government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The owners tried to sell them for years but you couldn't even get $100,000 for them. Now people are coming in, laying down $300,000 in cash and saying, 'I'm moving in.' That's big-time drug money. That's the beginning of drug organizations."
 
Issue Is Clear for U.S.
 From Washington's perspective, the developments call for a simple response: to fight the drug war on all fronts, eradicating coca seedlings, shutting laboratories, forcing down planes and putting as many people in jail as possible.
At a base at Santa Lucia in the Upper Huallaga Valley, a region in which much of the country's coca is grown, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency has a rotating contingent of 15 agents. Another 15 members of the agency operate out of Lima or other parts of the country.
But for Peruvians, the issue is more complex, and colored by a long distrust of the United States. Peruvians say the nation's peasants have grown coca for hundreds of years, using it as a mild stimulant and a hot beverage, and that it is Western industrialized countries that have turned its chemical base into a powerful drug.
Some Peruvians also argue that proceeds from the sale of coca leaf, estimated at $500 million to $1 billion a year, are desperately needed in a country where more than 80 percent of the population lives in poverty.
"In this country drugs and the sale of coca is not the central issue, so don't expect strong public opinion on the side of Americans," said Roberto Lerner, associate director of the Information and Educational Center for the Prevention of Drug Abuse in Lima. "The central issue is survival."
 
Accord Signed in May
 Nevertheless, Peru signed an important agreement with the United States in May that provides for a joint offensive against the drug trade. It calls for $220 million in economic aid and $57 million in military and police assistance in fiscal 1991, more than twice what Peru received the previous year.
While the Peruvian Government says it plans to take strong action against traffickers, it has tried to signal the 250,000 peasants involved in coca growing that they will not be treated as criminals, and that a plan will be found to wean them from coca and help them start other crops.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Rose by 13% Last Month

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Helped by a surge in foreign demand, orders for American-made machine tools jumped 13 percent in June from May, according to an industry trade group's monthly report, but they still remained far below the levels of June 1990.
Indeed, domestic orders were down sharply from May and from a year earlier. Analysts interpreted this as a sign that manufacturers had not yet seen much recovery from the recession. 
 The overall increase in machine-tool orders came after three straight monthly declines.
 
Foreign Orders Triple
 In its report scheduled for release today, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said machine-tool orders increased to $172.9 million in June, from $153 million in May. Foreign orders, which nearly tripled in June, more than offset the 14.2 percent decline in orders from domestic customers.
Compared with June 1990, machine-tool orders were down 34.8 percent, with domestic orders down 49 percent. But orders from foreign customers were up 36.1 percent.
For the first half of this year, new orders were down 17.8 percent, with domestic orders plunging 24.8 percent. Foreign orders were up 15.3 percent for the first six months of the year.
"We are encouraged by the increase in orders and particularly by the strength of the export market, said Albert W. Moore, president of the association, which is based in McLean, Va.
Despite the decline in domestic orders, Mr. Moore said, "there are signs that the economy is taking a more positive turn."
"Industrial production is up for the fifth straight month," he said. "Capacity utilization rates are rising, car production was up in late June and early July, and real earnings for production workers rose in both May and June."
Machine-tool makers said that despite the decline in domestic orders, they had seen an increase in inquiries about new equipment from manufacturers in a broad range of industries, particularly automobile makers.
Still, analysts said the figures indicated that capital spending by American manufacturers continued to show little sign of rebounding.
Machine tools are used to cut or shape metal parts used in durable products like appliances, automobiles, aircraft and building components. The level of orders and shipments of machine tools is considered an important indicator of the health of American industry.
 
'Little Early to Tell'
 "It's a little early to tell for sure, but activity has not worsened and June was a somewhat better month than May, which was quite soft," said Richard O. Priebe, a spokesman with Cross & Trecker Inc., a large machine-tool maker that last month agreed to be acquired by a competitor, Giddings & Lewis Inc. "It remains to be seen if there will be any continued upward move."
Machine tool orders have been hurt by the economic troubles of car makers, which typically account for more than a third of the industry's new orders. And some analysts suggest that an increase in orders from auto makers, which are expected to retool soon for new models, will help stimulate the machine tool industry.
One large order that affected the orders from foreign customers was a $45 million contract awarded to Litton Industrial Automotion by Volga Auto Works, the largest producer of automobiles in the Soviet Union. Litton will provide two machining systems for the production of engine components.
The backlog of machine tool orders for June was $1.33 billion, down from $1.37 billion in May.

Colombia Emerges as a Large Exporter of Books

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CALI, Colombia

 BODY:
For years, Colombia has been renowned for its coffee. Soon, it may win equal renown for its coffee-table books.
Starting from scratch in 1980, the year that book paper was first manufactured here, Colombia's printing and publishing industry has grown to make this country Latin America's largest exporter of books. 
 With modern presses and wages of $1 an hour, Colombia is rapidly emerging as an offshore printing center for American publishing houses. And with paper mills here doubling their book-paper capacity this year, Colombian publishers predict an aggressive expansion in the 1990's.
 
Looking to the United States
 "Colombia is already among the 15 major exporters of books to the United States," said Jorge Valencia Jaramillo, president of the Camara Colombiana del Libro, which represents about 180 publishers, distributors and bookstores. "By 1995 we will be among the top 10, and by the end of the decade we will be among the top five," he said in May at Fourth International Book Fair in Bogota.
Indeed, Colombia exported $79 million worth of books last year, up from $41 million in 1986, the year that Colombia became a net exporting nation. The number of titles published a year in Colombia increased to 2,757 in 1990, from 587 in 1988.
American publishing giants like McGraw-Hill, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and the United Bible Societies have had books printed here by Imprelibros, a division of Carvajal S.A. Smaller American publishers have found it economical to print limited numbers of books in Colombia.
"Even with the air freight, we can print and deliver to the United States for 50 percent of the cost of printing in the United States," said Luis Fernando Santos, a director of Intermedios, the publishing subsidiary of the Bogata newspaper El Tiempo.
 
Confluence of Factors
 The sudden and, to some, unexpected emergence of Colombia as a leading book-printing center is a result of a confluence of factors.
Despite its well-publicized drug wars and guerrilla violence, Colombia had Latin America's fastest-growing economy during the 1980's. Inflation was low, foreign debt manageable and growth high.
"Mexico and Argentina were in crisis during most of the 1980's, and they let their printing plants deteriorate," said Fernando Gomez, senior general manager of Grupo Editorial Norma, Carvajal's book subsidiary here, referring to Latin America's traditional publishing centers. "Colombia had a stable economy and was able to import modern machinery."
In addition, Spain, the mother nation for Spanish-language publishing, phased out subsidies on its book exports in the mid-1980's. And the Spanish peseta rose sharply against Latin American currencies. Suddenly, Latin Americans could no longer afford books imported from Spain.
"Until 1982, we depended almost exclusively on books imported from Spain," recalled Juan Luis Mejia Arango, distribution manager for Planeta Colombiana Editorial, the Bogota subsidiary of a Barcelona-based publishing house. "Now, eight of the top 10 Spanish publishers print books here. A book printed in Colombia costs 40 percent of the cost of a book imported from Spain."
To illustrate his point, Mr. Mejia ran his finger down the weekly best-seller list compiled by El Tiempo. Of the 10 fiction and 10 nonfiction titles listed, only one book was an import, from Argentina. Of that list, 11 were by Colombian authors.
But Colombia needs a market for its books, since its internal market is limited by a functional illiteracy rate of about 25 percent. So Colombia's publishing industry is oriented to printing books for export.
Publishers in the United States seem pleased with the work they get from Colombia.
"Colombia is now competitive with Hong Kong and Singapore," said Francis J. Crane, editor in chief of the international books division of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, referring to two other leading book-printing centers. "They have state-of-the-art equipment and the end quality is quite good," he said in a telephone interview from Florida.
In 1988, Mr. Crane supervised Carvajal's printing of 90,000 textbooks.
 
Problem of Geography
 One drawback to Colombia's book-printing industry is geography. The nation's two paper makers, Propal and Smurfit Carton de Colombia, are here in western Colombia, while most publishers are 12 hours away in Bogota. In turn, books must travel 25 hours by truck to the Caribbean port of Barranquilla for shipping.
But Colombia's wage scales allow for labor intensive-work at low cost.
For example, a Carvajal factory near here employs 2,000 people cutting, pasting and folding animated "pop up" books, which feature three-dimensional centerfolds. Printing them in 20 different languages, Carvajal now accounts for 60 percent of the world production of these books.

HEADLINE: In Canada, the Tempo Picks Up

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTREAL, July 2

 BODY:
The Canadian economy is stirring again after a recession, far longer and deeper than the one in the United States, cut output by billions of dollars and sent unemployment to the highest levels since the early 1980's.
Like the United States, Canada has benefited from cuts in interest rates, which appear to be helping the housing and auto markets. Canada's economy is only a tenth the size of the United States' and Americans buy three-quarters of everything Canada exports, so it remains highly dependent on what happens south of the border. 
 Government indexes of leading indicators, used on both sides of the border to predict activity, are now pointing up. The Canadian index has just posted its first gain in 14 months, and most forecasting services expect further advances.
 
'At a Turning Pint'
 "I think we're at a turning point, though we may be bouncing along the bottom for the next three or four months," said Warren Jestin, chief economist in Toronto for the Bank of Nova Scotia.
His feelings were echoed by Purdy Crawford, chief executive of Imasco Ltd., a consumer goods and services holding company that owns drug stores, variety stores, tobacco companies and the Canada Trust bank, as well as the Hardee's fast-food chain in the United States.
Mr. Crawford said he had noticed a "quickening of the tempo of business" in the various company operations in Canada, especially in the last few weeks.
But serious problems and questions do remain, including the federal debt, high unemployment, and the direction of long-term interest rates. And while economic concerns have for now brushed aside the burning issues linked to Quebec's drive for greater sovereignty or independence, they are still lurking.
Prominent economists say there are solid signs that the ice may finally be cracking. They point to strength in exports, rising investment in the energy industry and a surge in provincial government spending in Ontario. That province accounts for nearly half of the nation's economic output.
As might be expected, the national government in Ottawa waxes even more enthusiastic. "I'm very encouraged," said Finance Minister Donald Mazankowski, adding that the Canadian recovery "looks pretty solid."
Especially heartening for the Government are the upward revisions in economic growth rates earlier this year, signaling that the economy was not as weak as first indicated.
Yet the severity of the recession has spurred great popular discontent against the Progressive Conservative Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who has led the country for seven years.
Poll results show an overwhelming number of Canadians want Mr. Mulroney to resign, even though his mandate, renewed in 1988 elections, runs until 1993.
Last summer, before interest rates started falling here, the polls showed the Prime Minister's popularity, in terms of his percentage of supporters, had fallen below the prime rate.
The prime was about 15 percent then. It is now around 9.75 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in the United States.
"At least for now there is a fury in the land against the Prime Minister," said Keith Spicer, a former political science professor and broadcaster. Mr. Spicer, the chairman of the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, appointed and financed by the Government, made the statement in his preface to the forum's report, published in late June.
While economic prospects have improved, the recovery here, as in the United States, still seems a bit anemic and fitful. As a result, in neither country does business or consumer confidence yet correspond with the more promising statistics.
"The momentum for new growth is already here in Canada, but it could run out of steam if the U.S. doesn't really move," cautioned Patrick Grady, a partner in Global Economics, an Ottawa consulting firm.
In both the United States and Canada, debt burdens weigh heavily on governments and consumers. The Bank of Montreal could have spoken for both countries when it noted in its recent Business Review that debt "will not only inhibit further expenditures but keep long-term interest rates higher than would otherwise be the case, further slowing activity."
Unemployment is far higher here than in the United States and is a source of deep anxiety. The unemployment rate for June was 10.5 percent, matching a six-year high, and 3.5 percentage points above the American rate.
Taxes are also much higher, causing thousands of Canadian shoppers to bolt across the border for bargains in the northern United States.
 
High Interest Rates
 The cost of money is another preoccupation. Real interest rates after adjustment for inflation are still considered lofty in the United States, even after steep declines in the last 12 months. But they are even higher in Canada, a result of deliberate Government policy.
"The Bank of Canada has been given a free rein to squeeze inflation out of the system here," said Ernie Stokes, director of Canadian services for the WEFA Group, a research and consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "The whole direction of policies here is much tougher against inflation."
Mr. Stokes, whose office is in Toronto, and others note that the health of the banking and credit system has not been a factor in the monetary equation here, as in the United States, allowing the Canadian authorities greater freedom to tighten credit.
To some, the Government's high interest-rate policy is a problem because it has raised the Canadian dollar from 70 American cents in the mid-1980's to about 87 cents now. Many economists and exporters say that appreciation is damaging this country's competitiveness.
 
Currency May Decline
 With growing expectations that Government inflation targets of 5 percent by the end of this year and 3 percent by the end of 1992 will be met, the Canadian dollar could move lower, some economists say.
Then there is the cloud over Quebec's future. If the French-speaking province makes foreign investors nervous. they might pull their money out of Canada. That could endanger the recovery.
The Mulroney Government expects to introduce new constitutional proposals this fall to try to keep Quebec in the federation while meeting the province's demand for recognition as a "distinct society."
All sides agree it will be a delicate balancing act.

TV Networks, in a Crisis, Talk of Sweeping Changes

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 2

 BODY:
Searching for solutions to the worst economic crisis they have ever faced, the three big television networks are sailing in uncharted water --
and often in opposite directions.
The networks would still rather have the business adapt to their changed circumstances than be forced to adapt themselves. But they have mapped out somewhat different strategies, some of which would radically alter the television landscape. 
 Several events that signaled the networks' differing approaches took place last week:
*An ABC executive predicted that all three networks would not survive and that the hours of prime time would soon be scaled back.
*NBC announced a risky experiment that could leave some network programs, especially the evening newscasts, more vulnerable to losing their audiences.
*And a CBS executive decried the mood of "defeatism" and suggested that more aggressive control of costs could bring back prosperity.
Behind these moves and comments is the troubled financial outlook for all of network television, fueled by a depressed advertising market and rising program costs.
But at least some of the initial steps being taken appear to be carefully considered feints.
The financial squeeze is forcing network executives into a schizophrenic dance of mixed messages. To advertisers, from whom they still seek billions of dollars, and to viewers, from whom they still seek affection and loyalty, the networks still want to present themselves as the most powerful and entertaining way to reach mass audiences.
To others -- mainly Washington lawmakers from whom they seek regulatory relief; affiliated station managers, from whom they seek new and less costly relationships, and Hollywood producers, from whom they seek programs at lower costs -- the networks want to portray themselves as gravely wounded, essential all-American institutions.
NBC seems to be taking the lead in the regulatory end of the story. The network's corporate counsel, Richard Cotton, said today that without some fundamental changes, like requiring cable operators to pay a fee to carry the networks, the network economy was about to go into a free fall.
 
Leverage of Vulnerability
 All three networks are now marketing their vulnerability, because that vulnerability is providing some surprising leverage in the move to reduce costs. Two network executives said in separate interviews last week that the threat of diminished networks had made negotiations for fees to carry prime-time series much easier this year, with some producers actually accepting lower fees than they had received for the same programs the year before.
ABC is likely to be the only network to make money this year. Yet Robert A. Iger, the president of ABC Entertainment, offered the most pessimistic assessment at a press conference last week.
"We're just not going to exist in the same fashion in the years ahead," Mr. Iger said. He suggested that one network would probably go out of business and that the survivors would be putting on fewer hours of prime-time programs, dropping, if possible, the lowest-rated hours on the schedule.
Though he did not specify which hours the network would drop, Saturday night has clearly become the most endangered night.
Mr. Iger's comments were followed by NBC's decision to allow KCRA, its affiliated station in Sacramento, Calif., to experiment with moving prime time one hour earlier. The move would force NBC programs like "The Cosby Show" to 7 P.M., and its evening newscast back to 6 P.M. or even 5:30, an hour when it is likely to be seen by many fewer viewers.
Pierson Mapes, president of the NBC television network, said he recognized that if the KCRA experiment was successful, all NBC stations in the West -- and perhaps those in the East -- would press the network to change the prime-time hours.
"We're breaking all-new ground here," Mr. Mapes said.
An earlier prime time could help NBC's late-night lineup by giving it a bigger audience. The "Tonight" show, for example, would be broadcast at 10:35 P.M. But whether that would make up for the loss of viewers in the early evening is a serious question.
If only the station benefits from this experiment, NBC would probably seek to renegotiate its affiliate compensation deal, under which it pays a station to carry its programs.
John Kueneke, the general manager of KCRA, said the experiment at his station was a signal that radical change is inevitable in the network-affiliate relationship. "I think you're going to see the whole television landscape change," he said. "Nobody believes in the old rules anymore."
 
Disagreement by CBS
 But CBS certainly does. "If one of us goes out of business, it's not because there isn't a demand for quality network programming," said Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group. "If a network goes out of business, it's because the network messed it up."
Indeed, CBS painted a blistering portrait of an altered or reduced network in prime time. "Those open hours would be filled with junk," Mr. Stringer said.
The junk in question would consist of the kind of syndicated programs now in wide use at most local stations: usually game shows and tabloid magazine programs.
The networks clearly will score some points by comparing their more vulnerable programs -- like the ones on Saturday nights -- with such new syndicated fare as "Studs," which throws young people together for dates and then quizzes them on what happened in questions laden with sexual innuendo.
 
Disguised Commercials
 The networks can also make a strong case that "info-mercials" -- paid commercials disguised as half-hour programs, now in wide use in later hours at many stations -- would make their way into prime time.
Mr. Stringer said the answer for the networks was to "find ways to get the costs down." One way he cited: getting producers to reduce their fees, which he said CBS did successfully this year.
Though their comments seemed to be at odds, Mr. Iger and Mr. Stringer essentially made the same point that cost-cutting was at the heart of the grim talk.
In an interview after his press conference, Mr. Iger emphasized that he had not intended to drop a bombshell about the networks vanishing so much as he had wanted to send a message.
"I wasn't really espousing a corporate philosophy," he said, "as much as I was sending a signal to the program suppliers that we have to look at new ways of doing business."
ABC has been sending that signal in other ways. For the first time, the network has made deals with cable companies to supply programs, one of which, a comedy called "Hi, Honey, I'm Home," has been running on ABC this summer.
"Nickelodeon is supplying that show to us for less than half the cost of our next-least-expensive comedy," Mr. Iger said. "This is a way to tell the studios we want to be in business with them, but we can do it cheaper elsewhere."
The effort is working already. Mr. Iger said ABC had also been able to bring programs back to its schedule at lower prices next season.
"I didn't mean to say the world was absolutely coming to an end," Mr. Iger said. "I mean to say it will, unless we get a lot of things in line."

Words of Advice From Dinkins To Dinkins

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
By now, David N. Dinkins must believe that being Mayor means always having to say you're sorry. But does he have any words left in his repertory to reassure New Yorkers?
Mr. Dinkins plans to deliver a report tomorrow night on New York City's efforts to shrink the size and cost of government while improving the delivery of vital services. This will be his sixth major address in 19 months as Mayor. 
 At his inaugural, he promised again, unconvincingly, to be the city's toughest Mayor, in part by hiring more police officers. Then, within two days, he switched gears to fiscal prudency and delayed police hiring. Then in his most compelling performance, he preached racial conciliation -- a chief reason why he was elected.
Last fall Mr. Dinkins disclosed his vaunted anti-crime strategy, which was striking in its scope, but was immediately subsumed by his administration's seemingly contradictory actions that week -- like raising teacher salaries and then threatening lay offs.
Reporting on the State of the City last January, he promised a "new beginning," but never amplified what it was the beginning of. In May he warned that "without help, the un thinkable will become the unavoidable," but by concluding that the recession represented "less an opportunity than a calamity," he implied that his definition of the thinkable was relatively narrow. What might Mr. Dinkins say now?
Don't be defensive: "We will achieve nothing by pointing fingers or assigning blame," he might declare. Mr. Dinkins has little to gain by echoing the "get lost" tone of his remarks to the Financial Control Board four weeks ago and of Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel's letter two weeks later to Drew Zambelli, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's secretary, telling the state, in effect, to butt out of city affairs. Nor will he be credible if he divorces himself totally from the problems he inherited before he faces the future.
Seize the initiative: "We have not merely reacted to the crisis -- we are several steps ahea." Mr. Dinkins would benefit from boldly outlining some of those steps -- including those on which he is prepared to risk political capital. Frightened New Yorkers know there are no easy answers, but they want their leaders to lead.
The Mayor might begin by embracing some of the suggestions still being refined by his Management Advisory Task Force, headed by Roger Altman and Donald Kummerfeld, instead of waiting until they are forced on him by default after contending that he had deliberately stalled until a constituency developed. Among those heavy lifts: East River bridge tolls to pay for bridge and road maintenance; phased-in user fees to finance garbage collection, and a shift of some data processing to private contractors.
Make choices: "We are downsizing city government." Mr. Dinkins might define which services his administration can deliver well and which it can no longer provide.
Be daring: "Now is the time to move boldly and responsibly." Mr. Dinkins has been begrudging in embracing some changes, on the grounds that they will alienate affected constituents while few other New Yorkers will care. He might be bold enough to risk enraging small homeowners by suggesting they bear a larger share of property taxes.
Don't go it alone: "I am proud that the Governor is a true ally of this city." O.K., so Mr. Cuomo snookered the Dinkins administration into joining a city-state commission on government efficiency -- only, in effect, to remove the city's top priority, a state takeover of Medicaid costs, from the agenda two weeks later after calculating the potential cost. Mr. Cuomo can be a sore winner, though. Why alienate him more than necessary?
Mr. Dinkins also might mollify Mr. Cuomo by signaling a commitment to contain Medicaid costs.
Enlist other partners: "I am convinced we will act collectively, not selfishly." Mr. Dinkins's goal is to stanch the growing hysteria over government restructuring and to organize a new national urban coalition. But he also needs to persuade other potential partners -- Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, in particular -- that sacrifices are being shared.
If the quotations above sound compelling, Mr. Dinkins cannot speak them in tomorrow's address. He would be accused not of plagiarism, but of repetition: the Mayor recited those very lines before, during his televised address in May. They were not persuasive enough then to rouse his public.
The other day Mr. Dinkins said he would address the city tomorrow because "the people kind of need to know that we are not asleep."
With lots of tossing and turning, his administration has not been fast asleep by any means. But the Governor and other critics believe it has been slow to begin reducing costs systemically without savaging services. A bold and responsible speech might assure New Yorkers that their Mayor has not been talking in his sleep.

HEADLINE: The Budget Follies Have to Stop

BYLINE: By Jim Sasser; Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom holds that the 1990 budget agreement will last until shortly after the 1992 election, when campaign promises can be safely forgotten and we must face deficits that have deepened beyond expectations. Until then, we are supposed to be on automatic pilot.
Yet the Congressional Budget Office confirmed last week that we can't achieve the planned $480 billion deficit reduction over five years without further paring. We must begin that paring far in advance of fiscal 1993. 
 This week, as the Senate debates the Defense Department's fiscal 1992 budget request -- including about 100 major weapons-acquisition programs that could total more than $500 billion -- we can't keep acting as if the tough choices have already been made.
The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 produces much of its savings by imposing caps, through fiscal 1993, on domestic, international and defense spending -- the three component parts of the so-called discretionary budget. Until then, we need only exercise restraint. Afterward, these limits yield to a single cap on discretionary spending as a whole for fiscal 1994 and 1995, and here aggressive austerity must replace passive restraint.
The Budget Office estimates that if the three parts grow with inflation beyond their projected 1993 level, they will, taken together, exceed the overall limits for 1994 and 1995 by substantial amounts. Even taking into account the planned decline in military spending for both years, we must further cut discretionary spending by $14 billion in 1994 and about $22 billion in 1995 -- no easy matter.
The Administration and Congress, which must start building budgetary ships in ever-tinier bottles, are doing just the reverse. The House and Senate have fully financed the space station rather than end that expense, which will be $2 billion in fiscal 1992. If we keep pouring money into the $30 billion station, we'll doom other necessary space-science projects to extinction.
Similarly, the Superconducting Supercollider will grow from $535 million in fiscal 1992 to its overall price tag of about $11 billion. Sustaining this program would relegate smaller-science programs, the heart of America's technological capability, to a budgetary no man's land.
If we can't cut domestic programs, it will be extraordinarily difficult to cut defense, unless we start today. The Budget Office says that if we wait to make decisions until 1994, when the spending caps descend, the Pentagon would face the prospect of cutting 425,000 people in the military beyond the 233,000 who are to go between 1993 and 1995. We would be limited to personnel reductions because cuts in big weapon systems don't have an immediate impact on the budget.
Despite the squeeze on other military spending, we persist with our plan to sink $20 billion into "Star Wars" over the next three years, $16 billion into the B-2, $10 billion into the Aegis class destroyer, $7.1 billion into the F-22 advanced tactical fighter and $12.2 billion into the C-17 transport.
Something's got to give, and these systems are a good place to start. The big-ticket procurement bill for the next three years totals more than $85 billion. We could slide in under the 1994 and 1995 spending limits if we cut that tab by just one-third.
We should seek cuts in domestic programs, too. But the larger point is that we can't have every high-dollar high-tech toy we fancy. We have a timely opportunity to make military and domestic choices that threaten neither national security nor our well-being.
If we wait for a politically convenient post-election moment, we'll limit our opportunities and perhaps destroy our last chance to bring the deficit under control.

HEADLINE: From There to Intolerance

BYLINE: The following is condensed from an editorial in the July 20 issue of The Economist.

 BODY:
America has many contradictions, but none greater than the fact that it was founded by puritans and yet invented tolerance. The tension between the busybodies of 1620 and the free spirits of 1776 has often marked American history: the puritan had the upper hand in Prohibition, the permissive had it in Woodstock.
Like all things American, the contrast knob is turned up highest in California. San Franciscans treat homosexuals almost without prejudice, but 60 percent of Californians tell pollsters they want contraceptives forcibly implanted into drug-taking single mothers (thus simultaneously sanctioning fornication and eugenics). Los Angeles allows people of every color and creed complete freedom to sink or swim, yet employs a police force notorious for its racism and violence. 
 America's great tradition is to be puritanical only about private behavior. And although its public policy has often been strict (color bars, Prohibition, the death penalty), it has been far more permissive than most countries in its respect for civil liberties. Increasingly, though, Americans are being permissive about themselves and puritanical about others. Worse, they are ever more ready to believe that the answer to every problem is to pass a law.
To a lot of Americans, it now seems that prosperity can be bought like insurance. If you lose your job you can sue for the mental distress of being fired. If your bank goes broke, the Government has insured your deposits. If your marriage goes wrong you can divorce -- and then sue for a share of the money your spouse would have earned had he or she not given up a lucrative job. If you drive drunk and crash you can sue somebody for failing to warn you to stop drinking. There is always somebody else to blame.
Contrast this with the puritanism directed at others. Too many Americans expect greater abstinence and sexual restraint of their politicians (Gary Hart, John Tower) than they do of their teen-age children. They reprimand a neighbor for kissing her boyfriend goodnight on the steps of her house and so lowering the tone of the block (as happened in California). They pass laws against the parking of pickups in driveways for the same reason (in Illinois). They insist on conformity. They treat other adults as though they were children.
Much intolerance is inconsistent. America does not punish pot smokers more heavily than murderers. But it does (in some states) mandate prison sentences for someone caught with a few grams of cocaine, yet happily allows him to buy a pistol. A pistol is a lot more anti-social than a joint.
To somebody who believes in tolerance, though, puritan America is not as scary as punitive America.
Crime? The majority's answer is loud: more police, more death sentences, more mandatory long sentences -- yet little community policing, little attention to prevention of any kind. In 10 years, spending on criminal justice has risen twice as fast as spending on health.
The homeless? Unable to afford to build cheap housing, city governments have begun to do the popular thing instead: ban begging. Health? The most popular solution to the problem of uncontrolled, unaccountable medical bills is to force them on to employers or taxpayers, which only makes them more uncontrollable and unaccountable. Race? Pass laws that require positive discrimination and job quotas for minorities, and let merit go hang.
Twenty years ago America thought it could bribe problems away with money; now it seems to think it can banish them with laws. The better answer is to alter incentives so that a problem disappears without the need to create outlaws.
On pollution, for instance, the conventional response has rapidly become a moral reprimand preferably aimed at industry rather than consumers: ban sulphur emissions and disposable nappies [diapers], leave petrol untaxed and road use free. Never mind that sulphur does far less damage to forests than car exhaust, or that cotton nappies cause four times as much water pollution and twice as much air pollution to make and get rid of as disposable ones.
The most pernicious form of intolerance is "political correctness," because it comes disguised as tolerance. Imposing a new orthodoxy is not the way to tackle prejudice. University restrictions are in marked contrast to the freedom and tolerance with which those same students were treated by their parents and schoolteachers just a few years earlier. They were given unimaginable license to drive cars, stay out late, watch violent films, earn a living at supermarket checkouts.
In 1988, 38 percent of 17-year-old American girls had had sex, compared with 23 percent in 1973. As for younger children, parents prefer to nurture their self-esteem than use discipline. Teen-agers are treated as adults. Yet when they get to university they are suddenly plunged back into a world of condescending "because I say so" conformity.
Social engineering is out of fashion in Eastern Europe. In its place there could, with any luck, emerge a culture that recognizes the need to achieve social order by offering incentives, not by handing down instructions. The pioneer of that philosophy was America. If its people go the other way, they won't be the only losers.

Magazines Feel Pinch As Advertising Drops

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
In magazines as in people, looking good is often half the battle.
So when advertising pages plunge as drastically as they have this year, the impact on the size, the look and the feel of a magazine can be almost as devastating as the damage to the bottom line. In other words, looking like a loser is the surest way of becoming one.
This presents a dilemma. Many magazines observe strict ratios between their advertising pages and their editorial pages -- typically, 60 percent advertising, 40 percent editorial. But when advertising pages plummet, should editorial pages be reduced proportionately? 
 "You do that, and it's the end of the world," said Terry McDonell, editor in chief of Esquire, where ad pages fell 34 percent in the first six months of the year. "You have a minimum amount of editorial that you can put out there. And for the last half of the year, I have been supplementing that with additional editorial."
These are the dog days for magazines. The industrywide advertising slump has turned out to be even steeper than analysts predicted. Figures for the first six months of the year show an average decline of 10.8 percent in advertising pages for the 170 magazines tracked by the Publishers Information Bureau.
The decrease in revenues means that virtually everyone is reducing costs. Many magazines are running fewer articles in each issue, trimming the length of articles and assigning fewer articles. Even at Esquire.
"Pithiness is the virtue of the moment; the go-go years of giving a writer 1,000 words to clear his throat are history," said David Hirshey, articles editor at Esquire. "I would say that a piece has a better chance of running here that is well-reported and economical. Puff pastry is out; meat and potatoes is in."
Freelance writers whose bread and butter comes from magazine assignments say that they are being hard hit by these cutbacks.
"Writers I talk to are moaning and groaning," Irvin Muchnick, a freelance writer in California, said. "There is definitely a recession in our business right now."
Some writers said pieces that had already been accepted by magazines were later returned to them to try to sell elsewhere. In many of these cases, the magazine had already paid the writer the full fee, as well as travel and other expenses. This is different from a "kill fee," which magazines usually pay writers when an assigned piece is not accepted. Kill fees are a fraction of the contracted price.
An article about a convention of Christian bikers -- a "kind of quirky, offbeat feature, and a story that we just loved," said Robert B. Wallace, executive editor of Rolling Stone -- was returned to the author recently because Rolling Stone did not have the space to run it.
"The author was paid a kill fee, and he sold it again," Mr. Wallace said. "When you are limited on space you have to make those kinds of decisions."
Magazines that said they were not cutting back on their articles included Vanity Fair, Mirabella, Mademoiselle and GQ.
"We are probably running longer stories than we were before, and we may even be running more pieces," said Arthur Cooper, editor in chief of GQ, which saw a 20 percent decline in advertising pages in the first six months of the year. "More than a year ago, we decided to do tougher and more investigative pieces. Three years ago, the longest pieces we ran were 6,000 words. Recently we have run 9,000- and 10,000-word pieces."
GQ is among those that do not hold fast to a set ratio of advertising to editorial. When there are fewer advertising pages, then it is simply the ratio that changes.
"I would say that for the year it is probably 55 percent to 60 percent advertising and 45 to 40 percent editorial," Mr. Cooper said. "but in smaller issues like July it may be 60 percent editorial and 40 percent ads."
 
Reduced Flexibility
 While The New York Times Magazine, which saw a 26.3 percent decline in advertising pages for the first six months of the year, does not have a fixed ratio of advertising to editorial, the amount of space for articles is nonetheless reduced when advertising pages drop, according to Warren Hoge, the editor of the magazine.
"This means that I cannot run as many stories, and in some cases I don't have the flexibility to display them as dramatically as possible," Mr. Hoge said.
For example, the issue of June 9, 1991, had 88 pages with four feature articles, one of which was a photo-essay. Last year, the issue of June 10 had 104 pages and six feature articles. By contrast, the issue of June 12, 1988, had 136 pages with six feature articles, all of which were longer than the current ones.
"I think that everyone would agree that because of the severe space limitations, stories get cut a little more than we would like," said Bruce Weber, articles editor of The New York Times Magazine.
Many editors said the decline in advertising made it increasingly difficult to put together their magazines.
Gay Bryant, editor in chief of Mirabella, which had a 11.5 percent drop in ad pages for the first six months of 1991, said advertisers were buying more single pages and fewer multipage spreads. This presents some problems, she said, in trying to fit the articles around the advertising.
"There are more challenges in terms of putting the actual book together, largely because there are fewer ad spreads being bought," Ms. Bryant said. "But we haven't shrunk."

Stock Sales by Insiders Raise Doubts on Tiffany

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
It's a rare person these days who is not in love with Tiffany & Company and its high-flying stock, which has soared 47 percent since Jan. 7. Except, of course, the company's management.
Since April 30, when the company finished the second of two down quarters, 15 Tiffany insiders have sold 113,850 shares, or 14 percent of management's stake in the company. And that selloff is raising doubts about the stock's chances of remaining at its luxurious heights. 
 Among the sellers were 13 of the company's top 16 managers, including the chief executive, the design director and the chief financial officer, plus two outside members of the board, according to Invest/Net, a company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that tracks Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
 
80,550 Options Exercised
 Four of the sellers sold all of the shares they owned, although the company said last week that all four still had options to buy additional shares. A total of 80,550 options were exercised and sold in the period, but no one in the group reported buying and keeping any stock.
Tiffany's shares fell 12.5 cents on Friday, to $48, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
To be sure, there are always insiders who sell stock, not because they are pessimists, but because they need cash. Or they consider their stock options just another form of compensation. The S.E.C.'s recent decision to no longer require insiders to wait six months before selling shares they obtain by exercising options may have also magnified the selloff. Executives who wanted to sell earlier may have held off until after the new rule took effect on May 1.
Some of the insiders who sold shares said that they were selling for personal reasons and that their sales should not be read as a sign of any pessimism about the company.
 
'Did Need Some Cash'
 "I have occasionally sold some shares," William R. Chaney, Tiffany's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. A multimillionaire, he said he sold 19,000 of his 200,000 shares because he "did need some cash."
"But 90 percent of my net worth is still in Tiffany's shares and is intended to be there for a long time," he added. "I think it's a great investment."
Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a Harvard Business School professor who sits on Tiffany's board, also warned against reading too much into his sale of 900 shares, worth about $45,000, on behalf of three daughters, all of whom have college tuition bills to pay. "I love the company because I think it can make a lot of money," he said. "It's a long-term money machine."
Still, the one-sided direction of the trades and the proportion of insiders who sold lead some outsiders to wonder, What do Tiffany's insiders know that we don't? Their fear is especially keen in light of the two poor quarters and other evidence that the problems afflicting many retailers have caught up with Tiffany, too.
"The insiders know more about the company than most other people do," said David Coleman, the editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report in Huntington, L.I. "They would not be prone to sell their shares if they believed a higher price was forthcoming in the near term."
 
Facing Several Challenges
 Even the company's many fans acknowledge that Tiffany must overcome several challenges to be able to justify its stock price. No one expects it to sustain the 35 percent compounded growth rate it has enjoyed since going public in 1987. But with the low-yielding stock at 4.5 times book value, and 20 times projected 1991 earnings, some analysts say the company would have to grow at least 20 percent a year before investors would get a fair return on their investment.
That could be dicey in the current retail environment. For starters, 27 percent of Tiffany's sales still come from the company's flagship store on Fifth Avenue at 57th Street in Manhattan, in the middle of the high-rent district of a city whose bankers, brokers and other professionals are either losing their jobs or are fearful of layoffs. The drop in tourism resulting from the Persian Gulf war -- expected to linger as the dollar rises -- is another reason the New York store may have trouble topping the $123 million in revenues it generated last year and the $127 million it produced the year before.
Another 21 percent of the company's sales come from wholesale orders to Mitsukoshi Ltd., a big Japanese department store chain that features Tiffany products in nearly all of its stores and owns 15 percent of Tiffany. Though Mitsukoshi hopes to pump up sales by expanding its Tiffany boutiques and devoting more space to Tiffany's majority-owned Faraone line of jewelry, the days of easy growth may be ebbing with the Japanese economy.
 
Shift on Monthly Indicator
 Of concern to some analysts was the company's recent foot-dragging on the question of May and June retail sales in Japan, and then finally its announcement in early July that it would no longer disclose the monthly indicator until the quarter was over. To Mr. Chaney, the policy change was based on a desire to be "sure we're consistent in how we disseminate information." To Donald I. Trott, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst who was already turning bearish on Tiffany, it was yet another bright red flag.
"For the time being, we'd prefer to be on the sidelines with respect to the stock," Mr. Trott said. "We regard it as a good company, but a questionable stock."
The rest of the company's sales come from catalogue orders, sales of corporate gifts and Tiffany stores sprinkled throughout the United States, Europe and the Far East. Those stores, including several brand new shops in cities including Berlin, represent investments in the company's future. But it will take time before they bring in enough money to make up for the slowdown in the company's traditional markets.

HEADLINE: GROUPS PRESSURE BUSH TO INCREASE MEDICAID ACCESS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has come under growing pressure from its own advisers and from four of the most powerful health-care organizations to propose ambitious, potentially expensive changes in the nation's health-care system to protect uninsured people.
 A report drafted for an advisory panel appointed by the Administration recommends expanding Medicaid to cover doctors' services and hospital care for 10 million people below the poverty level with no health insurance. 
Various health policy experts estimated that the cost to the Federal Government would be at least $4 billion a year.
 Medicaid, a state-Federal program, already finances health care for 27 million poor Americans.
 
'Really Isn't Acceptable'
 The panel has not voted on the report, prepared by its staff to reflect a consensus of its members' views. But the recommendation suggests that the panel is willing to consider new investments in health care that are much more substantial than anything proposed by President Bush. More than 33 million people lack health insurance; about 80 percent are workers or their
 While emphasizing that the panel's work was far from complete, Deborah L. Steelman, the chairwoman of the 13-member group and the director of domestic policy for Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign, said in an interview: "We've got millions of people under the poverty level with no access to health insurance. This really isn't acceptable. It's not socially acceptable, it's not morally acceptable, and it's not economically smart."
 The Administration has said it will be guided by her panel's recommendations in developing its own health policy proposals. The panel was appointed by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and includes a wide variety of business executives, labor leaders and health-care experts.
Another Call for an Overhaul
 The panel does not specify how to pay for its recommendations. But an overriding theme of its report is that the best way to ease the burden of paying for future health and retirement benefits is to "increase the productive capacity of the economy," thereby creating jobs and generating additional tax revenues.
 Even as the panel prepared its report for submission to Dr. Sullivan later this year, chief executives of four powerful organizations -- the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the Blue Cross and BlueShield Association and the Health Insurance Association of America -- adopted a joint statement of principles last month, endorsing "universal access to health care services for all Americans."
 The organizations also call for expansion of Medicaid to cover the 10 million uninsured people below the official poverty level, $13,360 for a family of four, and they say this change should be financed with "broad-based taxes."
 The four trade associations have sent their joint statement, a remarkably broad agenda for national health care reform, to John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and have asked for a meeting.
 Lynn M. Etheredge, a health policy analyst who worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget for 10 years, said the joint statement marked "a fundamental shift."
 "These groups are no longer fighting reform," he said. "They are supporting it. The debate has moved from whether or not there will be major reform to when it will occur and who wins, who loses. I think they want George Bush to get moving."
 The four organizations are strongly committed to protecting the private practice of medicine and preserving a big role for private health insurance. But even they are now prodding the White House to take action on health care, rather than continuing to study the issue until the 1992 election.
 Because of constraints imposed by last year's budget agreement, Congress is unlikely to approve a significant expansion of Medicaid this year. But liberals and conservatives alike say it is virtually certain that in the next few years Congress will pass legislation to help poor people get health insurance coverage through the Government or the private market.
 
One of Many Topics
 In January 1990, Mr. Bush announced that a team of Administration officials led by Dr. Sullivan would study the health-care system and suggest improvements. At a Congressional hearing in April, Mr. Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, testified that the recommendations had been "delayed and delayed," but should be ready within 18 months.
 Ms. Steelman, who served as associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, emphasized that Medicaid was one of many topics being addressed by the panel, the Advisory Council on Social Security.
 One council member, G. Lawrence Atkins, a specialist on employee benefits, said, "I have always felt strongly that government has an obligation to insure that everybody below the poverty level has adequate health insurance coverage." Most panel members have indicated that they agree.
 But they disagree about whether the expansion of Medicaid is enough by itself or whether it should be part of a comprehensive effort to control health costs and to improve insurance coverage for the general population, including people above the poverty line. At least four of the 13 panel members say they favor the comprehensive approach.
 
Role Envisioned for Schools
 The panel also recommends a much larger role for clinics in schools, saying they should offer basic health care, including immunizations and screening to detect vision or hearing problems, to all children from infancy through sixth grade.
 A confidential draft of the panel's report says Medicaid payments to doctors, which now lag far behind the prevailing rates, should be gradually increased so that more doctors would treat low-income patients.
 The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that it would cost the Federal Government $9.2 billion a year to expand Medicaid to cover all uninsured people with incomes below the poverty level. About 45 percent of that amount, or slightly more than $4 billion, would cover doctors' services, hospital care and prescription drugs. Much of the remainder would be for nursing homes, institutions for the mentally retarded and other long-term care. Medicaid cost the Federal Government $41 billion last year.
 Medicaid eligibility has historically been linked to welfare, and in many states the family income limits for both programs are far below the poverty level. In Alabama, for example, state officials said a family of four was ineligible for welfare if it had net income exceeding $155 a month, or $1,860 a year.
 These are the members of the advisory council, besides Ms. Steelman and Mr. Atkins:
 Robert M. Ball, former Commissioner of Social Security.
 Philip Briggs, vice chairman, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
 Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, a trustee of the American Medical Association.
 Dr. Theodore Cooper, chairman of the Upjohn Company.
 Prof. John T. Dunlop of Harvard.
 Karen M. Ignagni, director of employee benefits at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 James R. Jones, chairman of the American Stock Exchange.
 Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminum Company of America.
 A. L. Singleton, a consultant.
 John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union.
 Donald C. Wegmiller, president of the Health One Corporation.

HEADLINE: U.S. RENEGOTIATES SOME S.&L. DEALS TO REDUCE COSTS

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
With an angry Congress complaining, Federal regulators have begun renegotiating some of the biggest sales of failed savings and loans to private investors and have started to withdraw many financial breaks granted to other investors.
 The Government says it is trying to save taxpayers billions of dollars. Exercising some of its options has already produced savings of more than $1 billion, the regulators say, and the renegotiations could produce as much $2 billion more in savings. 
But the investors, who put up millions of dollars to buy moribund savings and loans, say the regulators are violating the spirit of the sale agreements and could push some of them into insolvency.
 Even though the Government is empowered under the contracts to take these actions, many investors say they never figured the regulators would have the will -- or the cash -- to do so.
 
'Always a Business Risk'
 "There was always a business risk that the Government would buy back assets," said Richard K. Kneipper, a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Dallas, whose clients have included investors in some Texas savings and loans. "But no one figured that they would actually do it."
 Some investors question whether regulators are motivated by a desire to silence Congressional critics of the deals, which were completed in 1988. At that time, a special Government insurance fund lacked enough money to close the growing number of failed savings institutions in the Southwest, so regulators offered investors generous monthly subsidies and high-paying Government notes to entice them to buy the institutions and keep them alive. About 200 deals were struck.
 Critics in Congress and elsewhere have labeled these arrangements sweetheart deals that they say enriched the investors at the expense of taxpayers. The regulators at the time said the deals were the best available option, and the investors themselves say they answered the Government's call only to be roundly criticized ever since.
 And now the investors say the Government's actions have had a chilling effect on further investment, making more people reluctant to do business with the Government.
 "It looks to me like they are really trying to destroy this industry," said Joseph Matlock, chief executive of the Franklin Federal Bancorp in Austin, Tex., and chairman of the Texas Savings and Loan League. "They are making sure that no private capital comes into this industry again."
 And Scott Shay, a managing director at Ranieri, Wilson & Company, which invested about $90 million in cash in Houston's insolvent United Savings Association, complained: "It's a modern-day witch hunt. This is going to bankrupt a good number of thrifts, and the costs to the Government are going to be higher."
 Government regulators do not see it that way.
 "This is being done because it saves taxpayer money," said William H. Roelle, director of the resolution and operations division of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency overseeing the savings and loan cleanup. "We are exercising rights we have under these contracts and we want to do it in a way that does not create insolvencies or damage these institutions to the point that their survival is at stake."
 
Cost of the Deals Rises
 Since 1988, the price tag for the roughly 200 deals has grown to $65 billion, as the market value of the real estate in their portfolios continues to fall, which weakens the value of the savings institutions' assets.
 As the cost to the Treasury mounted, so did the criticism in Congress, which saw these deals as an example of Government largess and investor greed.
 Among the deals being renegotiated are those with Ronald O. Perelman, the financier who is chairman of the Revlon Group; the Bass brothers of Texas, one of America's richest families, and Lewis S. Ranieri, the former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers. These discussions have just begun.
 "We're in negotiation with all the big transactions, and as time has gone on the discussions are more intense," Mr. Roelle said. One main area is a plan to exchange warrants that the Government received to buy stock in these savings and loans for a reduction in some benefits -- tax breaks and cash subsidies -- that the Government provided.
 
Effort to Reduce Subsidies
 Aside from trying to renegotiate some deals, the Government is also exercising two cost-saving options it has under most contracts. It is forcing institutions to write down, or reduce the stated value, of their real estate portfolios to current market values. That action, in turn, reduces the amount of Government "yield maintenance" subsidies investors receive. And it is prepaying high-cost Government notes given to investors to help provide capital for these savings and loans.
 So far, the Government claims to have saved taxpayers $1.07 billion through these two options. And the swiftness and decisiveness with which the Government has moved is believed to be bringing the big investors to the negotiating table.
 The largest renegotiation involves the acquisition of First Gibraltar Bank in Dallas, a $13 billion savings and loan bought by Mr. Perelman's group. Gerald J. Ford, chief executive of First Gibraltar, readily acknowledges that his group is satisfied with its existing agreement. It agreed to renegotiate, he said, "because of political sensitivities."
 
'To Get On With Our Lives'
 Mr. Ford said he expected the negotiations to "cost us some money." But he added, "We are prepared to do that to get on with our lives" and to get out from under a cloud of uncertainy that limits First Gibraltar's ability to raise capital.
 "We know that in attempting to minimize the cost to the Government it will cost us money," Mr. Ford said. The Government has already reduced by about $400 million the value of First Gibraltar's assets. This reduces the "yield maintenance" subsidy the Government must pay, which is based on the value of the assets.
 At American Savings Bank, a Bass brothers investment where the Government recently prepaid a $748 million note, negotiations began only two weeks ago. "We're willing to sit down and restructure if it is beneficial to the Government and doesn't basically change the financial arrangement of the deal," said Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for the Basses.
 In Texas, among the hundreds of smaller savings and loans, the Government's insistence on reducing asset values and the note prepayments are being greeted with dismay -- and disbelief.
"If you own a thrift here, you are treated like you've got leprosy," said Mr. Matlock of Franklin Federal.
 So far, the Government has forced institutions to reduce the value of real estate assets by $6.6 billion, which cuts the amount of subsidies received by these savings and loans by $372 million. The Government's actions strikes at the heart of many deals: a promise by the Government to protect the buyer of the institution against losses as he tries to sell troubled real estate assets. But critics of the deals have complained that in the difficult Texas real estate market many savings and loans have failed to market these assets and have instead been content to simply hold onto them and collect a Government check.
 
Return of 9 Percent or More
 The subsidies have generally provided a return of 9 percent or more on the value of the assets left unsold -- a higher return that what Texas savings and loans could earn on most other investments.
 Under the contracts, the Government was empowered to buy many of these assets, or reduce their value, but to do so required cash that the Government did not have. Recently Congress authorized $22 billion to meet Government obligations for these deals, and the Resolution Trust Corporation began to move.
 These write-downs present savings institutions a series of business dilemmas, they say. For one, they reduce their subsidies, but the overhead costs for managing these real estate assets remain the same. And, in a peculiar twist, the Government is obligated to provide the savings and loan with a one-time check equal to the amount of the write-down -- in accounting terms, it means that the loss is recognized today rather than at some point in the future. The institutions say they would rather have the subsidies than the one-time payment, which they say they cannot reinvest at the same high rate.
 "We've still got the same overhead, but we've got less income," said James Jarocki, chief executive of Americity Federal Savings Bank in Dallas, which is facing a $50 million write-down. "They are exercising their rights under the agreement and I cannot fault them for that. They are doing the right thing for the taxpayer.
"But now we are going to reinvest this money in loans, and there's a bit of a scramble going on where people are now tripping over themselves to put out loans."
 Thomas P. Vartanian, a Washington lawyer and former general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said he thought the Government was being motivated by "political as well as economic realities." He said the "jury is still out" on the 1988 deals and the institutions might eventually be revived by a rejuvenated marketplace rather than cash spent by the Government.
 But Mary A. Creedon, an associate director at the Resolution Trust Corporation, disagrees. "To save money, we have to spend up front and for us, there are a limited number of ways to save money," she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Day Higher; Gold Down in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher in slow trading yesterday as dealers awaited further word on the state of the United States economy and the direction of interest rates.
Gold prices fell after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.80 an ounce, to $363.40. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $363.60, off $2.40 from Friday. 
 Dealers said the dollar recovered some ground from Friday's decline, which followed an unexpectedly weak report on second-quarter growth in the economy. The report on the gross national product reinforced concern that the Federal Reserve may feel more pressure to lower interest rates.
 
Little Economic Data
 But traders said the market was quiet in the absence of any significant economic numbers yesterday to shed more light on the chances for an interest rate cut.
"Very little happened," said Jeff Mondschein, managing director of foreign exchange at Continental Bank in Chicago. "We're waltzing into August, toward the end of the summer months." He said he thought the market would await further signs of any new interest rate changes.
He said the market also was sensitive to any possible changes in German interest rate policy, which would influence the dollar's trading against the mark.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.74735 marks, up from 1.7430 marks late Friday. In European dealings, the dollar rose to 1.7530 marks, from 1.7375.
In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 138.10 yen from 138.35 yen Friday's. Later, in London, it rose to 138.15 yen. By the time trading ended in New York. the dollar fetched 137.85 yen, up 0.25 yen from late Friday.
Sterling slid. In New York, the pound fetched $1.6815, less expensive than Friday's $1.6830, and in London, the pound fell to $1.6745 from $1.6885.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.5265 Swiss francs, up from 1.5220; 5.9435 French francs, up from 5.9380; 1,305.50 Italian lire, up from 1,301.00, and 1.14925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14875.

HEADLINE: An Industrial Policy, Piece by Piece

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y.

 BODY:
Despite the Bush Administration's opposition to a large-scale Federal effort, the nation is adopting an industrial policy piece by piece as a result of Congressional and state initiatives. Dozens of Federal and state programs are helping manufacturers improve their efficiency and technology to compete with foreign companies.
Advocates of these programs say they are essential to keeping the nation from losing more jobs and industries, like consumer electronics, to foreign competitors. They note that other nations, particularly Japan, provide extensive support for technological advances. 
 The American programs, although small, are building a framework for broader technical assistance of the sort that farmers have received for more than a century. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides $35 million in grants to develop promising innovations like flat-panel video and computer screens. An additional $11.9 million goes to support five manufacturing technology centers to teach small and medium-sized companies the techniques of computerized production. The National Science Foundation is spending $50 million a year to support joint research by industry and universities into fields like fiber optics.
Dozens of states have developed their own programs. Most emulate the highly successful agricultural extension services by providing technical extension agents who travel their regions of the state to help small factories, usually without charge. New York State has 20 of these agents, most of them manufacturing engineers, who are available as consultants to small companies.
Many in Congress want to expand these Federal and state programs in a big way. Eleven Senators have sponsored bills to provide more than $500 million a year for civilian technology projects and to establish a national manufacturing extension program on the agricultural model.
Other nations have such a broad range of industrial policies that the only common element is the goal of helping companies become more competitive and efficient. Many European and Asian countries pick the most promising technologies and help major companies develop them. Japan's renowned Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, has long coordinated the country's industrial advances.
 
Province of the Pentagon
 In the United States, industrial policy has been largely the province of the Pentagon. Most American companies, fearing the rise of another bureaucracy, have opposed the creation of an agency like MITI to promote civilian technologies.
The Bush and Reagan Administrations have resisted the development of a formal industrial policy as a harmful exercise in central planning. The White House questions whether the Government can choose among competing technologies any better than the free market. The Administration recently tried to drop $5 million appropriated by Congress for the Office of Science and Technology Policy to evaluate emerging technologies.
Many officials and executives who object to a broad industrial policy cheer smaller-bore efforts to spread technological skills. President Ronald Reagan did, in fact, sign the 1988 legislation that introduced the new programs of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, formerly the National Bureau of Standards. Some advocates of an industrial policy have found it prudent to present their goals in more modest, palatable terms -- "technology policy," for example.
In the face of White House opposition to a broad national effort, Congress and the states have been mounting more modest, less centralized ventures, with strong corporate support. Most of the state programs concentrate on manufacturers too small to keep up with the latest computerized methods. Recently, 34 states applied to the National Institute of Standards and Technology for money to promote their technology-assistance programs.
In Japan, such small companies can count on technical help from both government and the larger businesses they serve. Small suppliers and larger manufacturers work like corporate families, often with cross-ownership. In the United States, until recently, major manufacturers stayed aloof from their suppliers, often dropping them on the basis of annual bidding.
"There is a major difference between the United States and Japan," said Gene R. Simons, director of the Northeast Manufacturing Technology Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy. "Large Japanese firms make sure that technology as well as orders are passed on to suppliers. But when large U.S. companies decide to outsource components to suppliers, the technology to design new products is not always there."
Many of these American suppliers have to rely on production methods that larger manufacturers consider outdated. "The estimate is that the methods of production of these foundation firms lag by 30 percent their industrial customers," said Jack Russell, director of the Midwest Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor, Mich.
The approximately 365,000 manufacturing companies with fewer than 500 employees produce about half the value added in manufacturing, state officials have said. Those that do not directly compete with foreign companies often supply components to larger manufacturers who are themselves struggling in world markets.
The health of these small suppliers can be critical to the success of larger businesses. Some executives say that the United States lost most of its consumer electronics industry because manufacturers began buying components overseas, creating competitors who decided to assemble the products themselves.
Here at Rensselaer's manufacturing center, one of the five that Washington sponsors, Mr. Simons uses the state's technical extension agents to choose companies most likely to benefit from the center's emphasis on computerized operations. The center itself has 17 engineers he can send out to help companies.
Wynn Kintz, president of Kintz Plastics, a 100-employee company 30 miles west of Albany, was one who benefited. Mr. Kintz wanted to speed his eight-week process of making the metal molds he uses to form plastic parts, including computer cases and medical instruments.
He thought that computer-aided design could help, but he knew little about the subject. Buying the wrong equipment could financially ruin his company. Hearing of the center through a friend, he visited several times, trying out various computer software packages until he had the confidence to choose. He also arranged training for the technicians who would operate advanced equipment.
Now he designs new metal molds on computer terminals that feed instructions directly into the automated machines that cut the patterns. He can make new molds in just two weeks, allowing him to react faster to customer orders. "They took us from total ignorance to an installed system that is up and running," Mr. Kintz said. "It worked out very well for us."
He said that such rapid turnaround was essential to the Eastman Kodak Company, which recently awarded him a contract to make the outer cover of an instrument the company will introduce in October.
Since, according to Mr. Simons, 90 percent of all technical issues in manufacturing involve decisions on software, the center has established a software demonstration site in a one-story building on the north end of campus. There, Mr. Kintz and others can try software from more than 40 vendors on everything from simple personal computers to powerful work stations, for fees that seldom amount to more than a few hundred dollars.
"Who is a manufacturer going to get advice from?" Mr. Simons asked. "Mostly he will find salesmen who want to sell him something. Now he can come here and find what works best before buying."
In many states, the goal has shifted from innovation to implementation. "The states started in the early 1980's to push the development of high technology," said Mary Ann Clark, an official of the National Governors Association. "But the emphasis now is to work with smaller manufacturers to diffuse existing technology."
The states are supporting about 50 programs to provide technical assistance. "The states are five to seven years ahead of the Federal Government in trying to bolster these foundation firms," said Mark Tebbano, director of industrial innovation programs for New York State. "Without these suppliers, the major manufacturers may move off shore."
 
Congress Begins Programs
 In the last few years, Congress has begun several programs, broadening the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The National Science Foundation has also added to its mission by supporting research projects jointly sponsored by industry and universities. The Center for Telecommunications Research at Columbia University recently received a long-term $14.3 million grant for work on increasing the capacity of fiber optics. Bell Communications Research, the GTE Corporation, Philips N.V. and three other companies are partners in the project.
The Senate bills to expand technology funds have drawn industry support, including the backing of Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, and George M. C. Fisher, chairman of Motorola Inc.
Senator Jeffrey Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat and one of the co-sponsors, said that state and Federal governments spent $1.1 billion a year on agricultural extension services even though farming accounted for only 2 percent of the gross national product. But the nation spends only $70 million on manufacturing extension services, he said, even though manufacturing accounts for 20 percent of G.N.P.

Unocal Net Plunges 97% In Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Unocal Corporation reported yesterday that its second-quarter profit sank 97 percent, compared with results that included a one-time gain a year earlier, while the Pennzoil Company said earnings for the quarter more than doubled. 
 Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Unocal
 The Los Angeles-based energy company earned $5 million, or 2 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $165 million, or 70 cents a share, in the 1990 period.
Sales rose slightly, to $2.73 billion, from $2.72 billion a year earlier.
The latest results reflected declines in natural gas prices and West Coast refining and marketing margins and a rise in exploration costs. The 1990 results were helped by a $132 million gain on the sale of Norwegian properties.
"The second-quarter results were disappointing," Unocal's chief executive, Richard J. Stegemeier, said in a statement. "They reflect the combination of several short-term events, including very low West Coast refining and marketing margins, higher exploration and dry-hole expenses, and lower domestic natural gas prices."
But Mr. Stegemeier said that Unocal's worldwide crude oil and natural gas production had risen, as had earnings from chemical operations. Crude oil prices were higher than they were a year earlier, he noted. Unocal's shares closed at $24.625, unchanged, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Pennzoil
 The Houston-based energy company said it earned $12.9 million, or 32 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $4.7 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier.
Second-quarter revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $598.6 million, from $551.1 million a year earlier.
James L. Pate, president and chief executive, said the company's motor-oil and automotive-products segment had performed well, maintaining higher refinery and product margins despite recession-related declines in motor-oil volume.
Operating income in this segment rose 57.8 percent, to $30.3 million, from $19.2 million.
Higher prices for oil and liquid natural gas more than offset lower natural gas prices, the company said. Earnings from oil and gas operations edged up to $11.6 million from $10.7 million a year ago.
The company also benefited from a increase in dividend income from its investment in the Chevron Corporation, another energy company.
Pennzoil's share price fell 25 cents, to $73.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Xerox's Net Declined 3% In Period

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., July 29

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation reported today that second-quarter earnings fell 3 percent because of slow copier sales.
After-tax profit totaled $126 million, or $1.11 a share, in the quarter, compared with $130 million, or $1.16 a share, in the corresponding period last year. 
 Revenue rose 1 percent, to $4.45 billion, from $4.42 billion in the year-ago period.
Income last year included $8 million from real estate and third-party financing businesses that have since been discontinued. Income from continuing operations rose 4 percent, to $126 million, from $122 million last year.
Paul A. Allaire, Xerox's chairman and chief executive, said the earnings showed the company was in a good position to take advantage of an economic recovery, but he warned that "stronger marketplace demand is required to insure increased earnings in full-year 1991."
Earnings from Xerox's insurance and financial services operations rose 30 percent, to $43 million, in the quarter. After interest and headquarters expense, earnings from continuing operations amounted to $4 million in contrast to a loss of $6 million in 1990. Revenue fell 9 percent, to $1 billion.
The drop in revenue was a result of the company's efforts to withdraw from writing personal lines of property and casualty insurance, said Stuart B. Ross, chairman and chief executive of Xerox Financial Services.
In document processing, second-quarter earnings fell to $122 million, from $128 million, as operating revenue rose 4 percent, to $3.5 billion.
Mr. Allaire said sales of less-expensive copiers and printers were stronger in the second quarter than the first, but sales of higher-end products continued to be hurt by the recession.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN MOSCOW;
Bush in Moscow to Chart a New Course

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 29

 BODY:
President Bush landed in the Soviet Union tonight for a summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that will explore the shape of Moscow's relations with Washington in the post-cold-war era but may also focus on the politics of the Middle East.
Mr. Bush's plane arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport here a few minutes before 10 P.M., local time, after a nine-hour flight form Washington. He received a low-keyed greeting from Vice President Gennadi I. Yanayev, reviewed a small honor guard, including a quartet of drummers with red stars emblazoned on their instruments, and then sped into the capital and retired for the night. 
 After four decades of intermittent summit conferences at which the United States and the Soviet Union were adversaries if not enemies, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev meet this week with both the cold war and the arms race apparently cast upon the scrap heap of history, with a successful military collaboration in the Persian Gulf fresh in their memories and with the Soviet leader having only last week jettisoned much of Communism's sacred dogma.
 
A Need for Western Help
 Feeble economically but still strong militarily, the Soviet Union has ackowledged its need for help from the United States and the West and has made evident its recognition that it lives in a world transformed. But most of the details of how it will govern itself, manage its economy and relate to that world remain to be filled in, and the process may speed up this week.
In the hours preceeding Mr. Bush's arrival, senior Soviet officials pressed the United States to join them in issuing invitations for a Middle East peace conference as a means of stepping up pressure on Israel, which has not yet formally agreed to such a meeting. American officials, led by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, reportedly expressed reluctance about pushing the Israelis quite that hard yet, and the Soviets later conceded that no joint invitation would be issued now.
Mr. Baker met with Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, in a preliminary to the two days of Bush-Gorbachev talks, which begin Tuesday morning. He said afterward that "I for one do not think the window of opportunity has closed" in the Middle East. But he did not commit himself either to a joint trip to the Middle East with Mr. Bessmertnykh, as proposed by the Soviets, or to a starting date for a peace conference before the end of the year, another idea put foward by the Foreign Minister.
Vitaly N. Ignatenko, the Soviet presidential spokesman, said at his first summit briefing this morning that Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush might issue a joint Middle East declaration at the end of this, their sixth meeting and fourth full-fledged summit conference in a little more than 18 months.
 
Arms Treaty to Be Signed
 The ceremonial high point of the meeting will come on Wednesday when the two leaders sign the treaty reducing the size of their strategic arsenals by about a third. For the first time, the superpowers will formally commit themselves to scaling back their enormous fleets of long range-nuclear missiles and bombers in by far the longest and the most complicated arms-control agreement ever negotiated.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will meet at a government country house or dacha 20 miles northwest of Moscow; at Spaso House, the American Ambassador's residence here, and in the Kremlin, whose golden domes glistened brilliantly this weekend in sultry sunshine that seemed more Italianate than Muscovite.
At the top of the agenda for their discussions will be Mr. Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet economy. Ten days ago in London, the leaders of seven major industrial democracies, led by Japan and the United States, balked at giving large-scale financial help to the Soviet Union, although the continental European powers and even Britain had been eager to give Mr. Gorbachev, who met with the seven, a strong signal of Western support.
 
New Trade Status Seen
 Mr. Bush is likely to announce most-favored-nation status for the Soviet Union here this week, a concession long sought by Moscow that would make Soviet exports to the United States eligible for the lowest tariffs.
But there is no sign that he will relax his stand against cash subsidies.
The Western nations agreed to seek limited membership for Moscow in the International Monetary Fund, but Mr. Gorbachev stunned them a few days ago by applying for full membership, against Washington's expressed wishes.
Underlying the generally upbeat mood of this week's meetings are not only that disagreement but also American uncertainties about the completeness of the Soviet leader's commitment to reform, the exact scope and nature of the reform plans and the relationship of the central Government to the republics.
In addition, Mr. Bush is unlikely to find any backing here for his threats to stage air strikes against Iraq for failing to disclose to United Nations inspectors the full dimensions of its nuclear weapons program. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in an interview on Cable News Network on Sunday that any use of military force against Baghdad could have "negative consequences" and would not win unanimous support internationally, as did the January attacks in the Persian Gulf.
Because the lines of power are so tangled in the Soviet Union at the moment, Mr. Bush faces a very delicate task during his time here.
He has agreed to hold a private session with Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian republic, which has most of the Soviet Union's natural resources and more of its people than any other republic. Mr. Yeltsin, a more avid reformer than Mr. Gorbachev, has been his rival or his enemy for much of the recent past, but at the moment they are reconciled.
Mr. Bush is also flying to the Ukraine, another large and restive republic, on his way back to Washington. He will make a speech in Kiev, capital of the Soviet agricultural powerhouse, visit a cathedral and meet with local officials in a gesture of approval of Ukrainians' attempts to find some new means of expressing their rich cultural and historical traditions.
Overall, the President's schedule makes it clearer than ever before that the United States takes the republics and their aspirations seriously and understands that politicians like Mr. Yeltsin and Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian leader, have developed significant independent power bases.
But he took care this weekend in an interview with Soviet journalists to underline his continuing support for Mr. Gorbachev and the national Government.
Asked whether the White House, the Kremlin and the republics now formed a triangle, Mr. Bush replied, according to the official Tass press agency, "The President of the United States primarily deals with the President of the Soviet Union."
In its report of the interview, the Communist Party daily Pravda said Mr. Bush added: "Contacts with the republics are very important, but I don't think I deal with Yeltsin on the same level as I deal with Gorbachev. People in the Soviet Union should know the U.S. president will deal with respect with the President of the Soviet Union. That doesn't exclude good relations with Yeltsin. I just don't want to make them equals."
The continuing struggle for power was as evident as ever right up to the time of Mr. Bush's arrival. Lest the President forget the bid for independence of the three Baltic republics and Mr. Gorbachev's resistance, Mr. Yeltsin and Vytautas Landsbergis, the Lithuanian leader, signed a friendship treaty today. The treaty recognizes Lithuania, which in March 1990 declared its independence as a sovereign state.
For his part, Mr. Gorbachev has invited both Mr. Yeltsin and Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the leader of Kazakhstan, to take part in "expanded talks" with him and Mr. Bush on Tuesday. Kazakhstan has been one of the republics most loyal to Mr. Gorbachev's economic and political policies. Mr. Ignatenko said of the two republic leaders, "They are fully fledged partners in the talks."
 
Several Agreements Ready
 The presidential spokesman said a number of agreements would be signed during Mr. Bush's visit to Moscow, the first by an American President since Ronald Reagan's trip in the spring of 1988. Among them, he said, would be treaties covering security in civil aviation, technological cooperation, medical supplies, cooperation in preventing industrial accidents, natural disasters and elimination of their consequences and housing construction.
But it is the arms treaty, known as Start, that has brought Mr. Bush to the Soviet capital this week.
Linton Brooks, the chief United States negotiator, and Yuri K. Nazarkin, his Soviet counterpart, initialled copies of the treaty at a ceremony in Geneva today before sending them to Moscow. Mr. Brooks described the agreement, which took nine years to reach, as "an immense accomplishment," according to a Reuters dispatch. They put their initials on 300 pages of each of four copies of the 600-page treaty, for a total of 1,200 times.
"It's hard work, isn't it?" Mr. Brooks asked Mr. Nazarkin, who responded, "But it's more fun than negotiating it."

Chronology: "Looking Back: 30 Years of Summitry"
 
Septmeber 1959: Dwight D. Wisenhower and Nikita S. Khrushchev meet at camp David, Md. The talks result in the "spirit of Camp David," an effort to press for scientific and cultural exchanges and disarmament.
 
June 1961: Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy have heated exchanges in Vienna. There are no formal agreements. A year later, the Soviets send nuclear missiles to Cuba; the United States forces their removal.
 
June 1967: Lyndon B. Johnson meets in Glassboro, N.J., with Aleksei N. Kosygin to dicuss the Middle East, the Vietnam War and nuclear arms. They come to no agreement.
 
May 1972: Richard M. Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev, in Moscow, sign the first treaties setting limits on strategic nuclear arms, know as SALT I, and on curbing antiballistic missile systems. They agree to keep negotiating on arms, but region issues divide them.
 
June 1973: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Washington. They agree to try to complete a new arms treaty by 1974.
 
June-July 1974: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Moscow and Yalta. They agree to a treaty banning underground nuclear-arms tests with yields exceeding 150 kilotons, and arrange a 10-year economic accord.
 
November 1974: Gerald R. Ford and Brezhnev, in Vladivostok, reach a tentative deal limiting missile launchers and bombers and lay a base for a second strategic arms treaty. The treaty is not completed before Jimmy Carter takes office.
 
June 1979: Carter and Brezhnev, in Vienna, sign the second treaty limiting strategic arms, or SALT II. Although the Senate never approves the treaty because of the Soviet sweep into Afghanistan in December 1979, both sides agree informally to observe its limits.
 
November 1985: Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Geneva for wide-ranging talks on arms control and other subjects. They agree to revive cultural exchanges and to enhance air safety, but no arms-control agreements are achieved.
 
October 1986: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Reykjavik, Iceland, to provide momentum to arms-control talks. The two sides speak of vast cuts in strategic arms and medium-range missiles, but the accord falls through because of disagreements over the American plan for a space-based missile defense system, or "Star Wars," and over Moscow's insistence on putting all arms issues in one package.
 
December 1987: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Washington. They sign a treaty to destroy intermediate-range nuclear forces, known as I.N.F., and agree to seek a treaty cutting long-range nuclear arsenals. But "Star Wars" remains a sticking point.
 
May-June 1988: Gorbachev and Reagan, in Moscow, exchange formal documents putting the I.N.F. treaty into effect, but make no breakthrough on cutting long-range nuclear forces. Reagan says important work has been done but Gorbachev speaks of "missed opportunities."
 
December 1988: Gorbachev says farewell to Reagan and greets President-elect George Bush at a two-hour luncheon on Governors Island in New York harbor.
 
December 1989: Bush, now President, and Gorbachev meet in Malta. They say they will strive to conclude treaties on long-range nuclear weapons and conventional arms in 1990.
 
May-June 1990: Bush and Gorbachev meet in Washington. They pledge to cut stockpiles of long-range nuclear arms and chemical weapons. They also sign a trade treaty.
