HEADLINE: Queens Businessman Guilty of Defrauding Bank

BYLINE: MOSI SECRET


HIGHLIGHT: A former college basketball player who once held a fund-raiser for President Obama was convicted of using fraudulent accounting practice to obtain a loan. 

 BODY:
Courtney Dupree, a former University of North Carolina basketball player who hosted a 2008 fund-raiser for Barack Obama at his Manhattan apartment, was found guilty on Friday of using accounting tricks to defraud a bank of millions of dollars. 
The verdict, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, marked the fall of a man who by all accounts had lived a charmed life. After playing basketball at one of the nation's top programs, he earned a master's degree in business from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. And after a short career in finance, he founded his own company. 
But it was at that company, GDC Acquisitions, LLC, a holding company in Long Island City, Queens, which owned subsidiaries to maintain and distribute office lighting and furniture, where Mr. Dupree's fortunes turned. He was convicted of inflating the value of the company's assets to obtain a $21 million loan with Amalgamated Bank. 
Prosecutors said that in August 2008, GDC and Amalgamated Bank entered into an agreement under which the subsidiaries could borrow up to $21 million through a revolving credit loan. The company pledged its accounts receivable as security for the loans and was required to submit documents to the bank each month stating the value of its accounts. 
The prosecution said the defendants submitted documents in November 2009 indicating that GDC had $25.2 million in accounts receivable when it actually had only $9 million. The prosecution said the defendants inflated accounts by booking fictitious sales the company was never able to make. 
"GDC told a big lie that it had to catch up to," Michael L Yaeger, a federal prosecutor, told the jury during closing arguments this week. "They never caught up to that lie. But the lie worked." 
The prosecution played audio recordings that were made by a cooperating witness in which GDC employees questioned the company's numbers. The prosecution also presented e-mails in which employees discussed problems with the accounting. 
Much of the three-week trial, presided over by Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto, was spent going over accounting registers and practices that lulled the occasional observer in the courtroom to sleep. 
The defense did not dispute that there was accounting fraud but said that the accounts were corrupted by employees without Mr. Dupree's knowledge. 
"If the government had a tape where Courtney Dupree was talking about fake billing, you would have heard it," Roscoe C. Howard, Mr. Dupree's lawyer, told the jury.
"He was a minority business owner who was providing jobs where they were needed," Mr. Howard said. 
Mr. Dupree, 42, was defiant on the stand, and questioned the prosecutors about their case. 
"On the stand, Courtney Dupree was pretty smooth," David C. Woll, a prosecutor said during his closing arguments. "He joked around with his lawyer and impressed us with all of his big words."
But the jury took less than a day to find him guilty on four counts: conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, and two counts of making false statements. 
Mr. Dupree faces a maximum sentence of 30 years on the most serious charge. 
Thomas Foley, the chief operating officer of GDC, also faced fraud charges but the jury acquitted him on all counts.
"The defendant Courtney Dupree defrauded an F.D.I.C.-insured bank out of millions of dollars by lying about his company's financial condition," Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. "Executives who abuse positions of influence and trust should expect to be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law."

HEADLINE: Senate Republican Conferees Chosen

BYLINE: ROBERT PEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Bipartisan panel of Senate and House members will try to work out an agreement on payroll taxes, unemployment benefits and Medicare. 

 BODY:
The Senate Republican leader announced Friday that he had chosen three of his colleagues to try to thrash out a bipartisan deal on payroll taxes, unemployment benefits and Medicare.
The three Republican senators will join four Democratic senators and 13 House members on a conference committee wrestling with the issues, which tied the Senate in knots for more than two months.
The newly named Republican conferees are Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona, Michael D. Crapo of Idaho and John Barrasso of Wyoming.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said they would "focus on the areas of agreement between the House and Senate approaches."
The House and the Senate could not agree on how to pay for a yearlong extension of the payroll tax holiday that workers enjoyed in 2011. On Dec. 23, the two chambers passed a bill to keep the Social Security payroll tax at its current level for two months, avoiding an increase that would otherwise have occurred on Jan. 1.
Democrats and many Republicans agreed with President Obama that the payroll tax cut should be extended, but could not agree how to offset the additional cost, $100 billion for the last 10 months of 2012. That will be a major question for the conference committee.
If Congress does not act by March 1, workers will see a bigger bite out of their paychecks, the government will reduce payments to doctors treating Medicare patients by 27 percent, and many jobless workers will begin to lose unemployment insurance benefits. House Republicans want to reduce the maximum duration of unemployment benefits as part of an effort to overhaul the program.
The conferees may also discuss proposals to speed construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, to freeze the pay of federal employees and to impose a surtax on individual income exceeding $1 million.
In an election year, when the two parties are sparring over those issues, reaching an agreement will not be easy.
The other negotiators were selected last week.
Speaker John A. Boehner named eight House Republicans to the conference committee: Representatives Dave Camp and Fred Upton of Michigan, Kevin Brady of Texas, Greg Walden of Oregon, Tom Price of Georgia, Tom Reed and Nan Hayworth of New York and Renee Ellmers of North Carolina.
The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, named five House Democrats: Representatives Sander M. Levin of Michigan, Henry A. Waxman and Xavier Becerra of California, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Allyson Y. Schwartz of Pennsylvania.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, chose four Democratic senators: Max Baucus of Montana, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania.
Several members of the conference committee, including Mr. Baucus, Mr. Kyl and Mr. Camp, were also on a joint select committee that was supposed to come up with ways to reduce federal budget deficits by at least $1.2 trillion. That panel disbanded in late November without any agreement.

HEADLINE: Republican Abandons Bid for Re-election

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Steve Austria of Ohio said he would rather step down than move to another district or face a Republican colleague in a primary next year for a new Congressional district. 

 BODY:
The redistricting battles playing out across the country have exacted another casualty.
Representative Steve Austria, a Republican from Ohio, has decided to step down at the end of his term in 2013 rather than seek a third term next year, avoiding a primary matchup with a veteran House colleague brought on by redistricting.
State lawmakers, forced to cut two seats from Ohio's Congressional map this year because of slow population growth, carved a new district from the one held by Mr. Austria and a neighboring district held by Michael Turner, a five-term Republican. Mapmakers eliminated another seat by reshaping the districts held by Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich, both Democrats.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Austria said he felt "anger and frustration" about losing his district. He added: "I have thoroughly enjoyed working on behalf of every one of my communities, both large and small, and regret that I will not be able to continue the work I have been truly committed to, due to the redrawing of the maps."
The decision is a reversal for Mr. Austria, who filed papers this month to run in Ohio's new 10th Congressional District. On Friday, he said that the new district had been changed to include only a small part of his current district, while the rest came from Mr. Turner's territory. Mr. Austria said he would rather step down than run uphill in a potentially nasty primary or uproot his family to move to another district. He did not rule out a future run for public office.
Mr. Austria, a former state legislator and financial planner, was one of about a dozen Republicans elected to the House in 2008 when Democrats increased their majorities in both chambers. He beat three Republicans in the primary and defeated Sharon Neuhardt, his Democratic rival, in the general election to replace David L. Hobson, a Republican who retired.
In Congress, Mr. Austria has been a reliable Republican vote against Democrats' policies, opposing the $787 billion economic stimulus program, cap-and-trade legislation, and the health care overhaul. But he has also crossed party lines to vote for items such as an expansion of the federal health insurance program for children in low-income families.
His decision on Friday puts him in a growing group of House lawmakers displaced by redistricting. Among them are Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Jerry F. Costello, Democrat of Illinois.

HEADLINE: Wyden-Ryan's Unrealistic Assumptions

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The latest proposal to overhaul Medicare, like its predecessors, uses unrealistic assumptions about how increased competition would lower health-care costs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In a surprising year-end act of bipartisanship, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, offered a proposal to reduce the growth of Medicare spending, envisioning a fundamental transformation of Medicare to a "managed competition" or "premium support" system.
In their plan, the government would provide a subsidy to Medicare beneficiaries to choose among competing insurance plans, including the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. 
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Wyden say their system would control the growth of Medicare spending better than the current system by encouraging more efficient cost-sensitive decision-making by both providers and consumers. This incentive argument has considerable analytical appeal, especially among economists - competition usually reduces costs in most markets. 
But the markets for insurance and health services are not like most markets, and there is scant evidence to support the Ryan-Wyden assertion, as Uwe E. Reinhardt noted in Economix last week. The cost savings from managed competition are hypothetical and uncertain - in fact, there are reasons to fear that such a system could actually increase costs. 
Despite competition and choice in the private insurance system, Medicare spending has grown more slowly than private insurance premiums for comparable coverage for more than 30 years.

From 1970 to 2009, Medicare spending per beneficiary grew by an average of 1 percentage point less each year than comparable private insurance premiums. Between 2000 and 2009, Medicare's cost advantage was even larger - its spending per beneficiary grew at an average annual rate of 5.1 percent while per-capita premiums for private health insurance plans grew at 7.2 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
In inflation-adjusted terms, Medicare spending per beneficiary increased more than 400 percent between 1969 and 2009 while private insurance premiums increased by more than 700 percent.
What explains Medicare's sustained cost advantage over private insurance? Medicare has much lower administrative costs than private insurance (administrative costs account for about 14 percent of health care spending, or a whopping $360 billion a year).
And Medicare has considerable negotiating leverage with providers as a result of its huge enrollment. Private insurance plans are unable to negotiate payment rates with providers that are as low as Medicare's rates, even though Medicare's negotiating authority is tightly limited and often undermined by Congress. 
Advocates of premium support point to the Federal Employees Health Insurance plan as an example of how competition would work in Medicare. But this plan has been no more successful than private-employer-provided insurance at controlling the growth of insurance premiums. 
And traditional fee-for-service Medicare outperforms both, even though its elderly beneficiaries include a sizable share of the sickest individuals who are the largest consumers of expensive health-care services. 
In the Ryan-Wyden version of premium support, the fee-for-service Medicare would compete with private insurance plans that offer a standard package of defined Medicare benefits or an actuarially equivalent one. 
All participating plans would take part in an annual competitive bidding process, and the bid by the second-least expensive private plan or by traditional fee-for-service Medicare, whichever is lower, would set the benchmark for the federal subsidy granted to Medicare beneficiaries to purchase the plan of their choice. 
A beneficiary who chooses a more expensive plan than the subsidy for which he or she was eligible would have to pay the difference; a beneficiary who chooses a less expensive plan would receive a rebate. 
The Ryan-Wyden plan links the size of the Medicare subsidy to systemwide health care costs through the competitive bidding process and assumes that competition will slow the future growth of these costs. 
But in an explicit acknowledgment that the resulting cost savings are speculative, the plan also contains a backup cap that would limit the growth of federal spending on Medicare per beneficiary to the rate of growth of nominal gross domestic product plus 1 percentage point. Historically, both private health-care costs and Medicare spending per capita have increased at faster rates.
The Ryan-Wyden proposal is ambiguous about what would happen if the cap became binding. The proposal says Congress "would be required" to intervene and "could" implement policies to change provider payments and premiums for beneficiaries. 
Congressional intervention to control provider payments would shift the burden of higher-than-anticipated costs to providers from the federal government and would effectively signal the end of managed competition as the mechanism to control costs. 
In lieu of such intervention, Mr. Ryan has indicated that the cap would apply to the growth of the subsidy itself, and this would shift the burden of higher-than-anticipated costs to beneficiaries from the federal government. 
That would mean that the Ryan-Wyden system would devolve from a premium-support system in which the growth of the subsidy depended on actual health-care costs to a voucher system in which it was delinked from such costs.
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 sets the same target for the future growth of Medicare spending. But unlike the Ryan-Wyden proposal, the act does not undercut Medicare's ability to control costs by weakening the negotiating influence derived from its national enrollment. 
Instead, the act puts Medicare at the center of reforms to create accountable care organizations, reduce payments to hospitals with high admission rates, bundle payments to providers and carry out comparative effectiveness research. Such reforms are essential to controlling costs and improving care. 
And only Medicare has the clout and responsibility to accomplish them. 
Despite competition, private insurers have been unwilling or unable to spearhead such changes, opting instead to pass rising costs onto consumers through higher premiums and to rely on Medicare to foster efficiency-enhancing systemwide reforms. 
That's why the Congressional Budget Office has consistently refused to recognize large potential savings in health care costs from reforms to increase competition among private insurance plans. Indeed, the C.B.O. has concluded that replacing traditional Medicare with competition among such plans would drive up total health care spending per Medicare beneficiary.
The Affordable Care Act also creates an Independent Payment Advisory Board, composed of nonpartisan health-care experts responsible for producing proposals to keep Medicare spending within the target while beneficiaries; increases in premiums and cost-sharing are precluded. These proposals would take effect automatically unless the president and Congress acted to overturn them.
In 1998, a National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, chaired by Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, and Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of Maryland, developed a premium-support proposal similar to Ryan-Wyden but without an enforceable backup cap on spending. The commission failed to achieve the supermajority required for a formal recommendation to Congress. 
I was a commission member appointed by President Clinton, and at the time I thought premium support was worth trying. Ultimately, however, I could not recommend the commission's proposal because it rested on unrealistic assumptions about the magnitude of the cost savings that would result from competition. I believed competition might ease Medicare's future financing gap but would not eliminate it, and I was concerned that the commission offered no credible cost-containment measures to address this gap. 
I have similar reservations about the Ryan-Wyden plan. No evidence supports the plan's assumption that a premium-support system with competitive bidding would control Medicare spending more effectively than traditional Medicare. 
Nor does the plan contain enforceable cost-containment measures like those in the Affordable Care Act. And the plan's backup cap on the growth of Medicare delinked from the actual growth of health care costs could shift the burden onto Medicare beneficiaries in the form of higher premiums and reduced access and quality of care. 
An earlier version of this post misstated the year in which the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. It was 2010, not 2011.

HEADLINE: The College Sports Cartel

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Twice a year in Vienna, the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gather to decide on the short-term direction of oil prices. Sometimes, O.P.E.C. agrees to cut back on oil production, pushing up the price of oil. Other times, it decides to boost production. Always, the goal is to fix the price of oil, rather than allow it to be set by the competitive marketplace. Indeed, collusion and price-fixing are the main reasons cartels exist -- and why they are illegal in America.
Yet, in Indianapolis a few weeks from now, a home-grown cartel will hold its annual meeting, where it, too, will be working to collude and fix prices. This cartel is the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A. would have you believe that it is the great protector of amateur athletics, preventing college athletes from being tainted by the river of money pouring over college sports. 
In fact, the N.C.A.A.'s real role is to oversee the collusion of university athletic departments, whose goal is to maximize revenue and suppress the wages of its captive labor force, a k a the players. Rarely, however, will the cartel nature of the N.C.A.A. be so nakedly on display as at this year's convention.
In The Times Magazine this weekend, I lay out a proposal to pay the players in the two big revenue sports, college football and men's basketball, something the N.C.A.A. won't countenance. In the course of my reporting, I gained a new appreciation for the cartel characteristics of sports leagues.
Sports leagues can't exist without at least some collusion. As Andy Schwarz, an economist and litigation consultant, puts it, ''If steel companies got together to decide when and where to produce steel, that would violate the antitrust laws. But if sports teams in a league get together to decide when and where to play games, that's generally allowed.'' Major League Baseball has long had an antitrust exemption; other professional leagues have salary caps, which are legal because they have been agreed to by the players.
The N.C.A.A. has neither an antitrust exemption nor a player's union to negotiate with. In other words, it lacks some of the legal protections that shield professional sports from antitrust suits. What it has, instead, is a work force full of young adults dreaming of becoming pros and willing to sign any document, no matter how onerous, if it will help them reach that goal. The document the N.C.A.A. forces them to sign completely stacks the deck against them. To cite just one outrageous example, if a player runs afoul of an N.C.A.A. rule, he isn't allowed legal counsel to defend himself.
Recently, Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., tried to make the rules a tad less onerous. He got the N.C.A.A. board of directors to approve an optional $2,000 stipend as well as a four-year scholarship instead of the current one-year deal for players.
And how did the cartel react to these modest changes? It rose up in revolt. Enough universities signed an override petition to temporarily ice the new stipend. The same thing happened with the four-year scholarship.
A lawyer in Fort Worth, Christian Dennie, who specializes in sports law, got ahold of an internal N.C.A.A. document outlining some of the objections. One is especially worth repeating: ''The new coach may have a completely different style of offense/defense that the student athlete no longer fits into,'' wrote Indiana State. Four-year scholarships might mean that the school would be stuck with ''someone that is of no 'athletic' usefulness to the program.'' Thus does at least one school show how it truly views its ''student athletes.'' (Andy Staples at Sports Illustrated first reported on this document.)
At the N.C.A.A. convention in mid-January, both of these rules will be reviewed. In all likelihood, the N.C.A.A. will roll them back. However benignly it characterizes this action, it will be as clear-cut an example of collusion as anything that goes on at an OPEC meeting.
How can it be that the N.C.A.A. can define amateurism in one moment as allowing a $2,000 stipend and in the next moment as forbidding such a stipend? How can it justify rolling back a change that would truly help student athletes, such as the four-year scholarship, simply because coaches want to continue to have life-or-death power over their charges? How can the labor force that generates so much money for everyone else be kept in shackles by the N.C.A.A.?
The N.C.A.A. claims it has the legal right to do all the above and more. And maybe it does. But it certainly would be worthwhile to see someone challenge its cartel behavior in court. The inevitable rollback of the $2,000 stipend and the four-year scholarship would be an awfully good place to start.

HEADLINE: The Damage of 2011

 BODY:
After they took power in January, the hard-line Republicans who dominate the House reached for a radical overhaul of American government, hoping to unravel the social safety net, cut taxes further for the wealthy and strip away regulation of business. Fortunately, thanks to defensive tactics by Democrats, they failed to achieve most of their agenda.
But they still did significant damage in 2011 to many of the most important functions of government, and particularly to investments in education, training and transportation that the country will need for a sound economic recovery. 
With a threatened government shutdown in April, the Republicans pushed through spending cuts of about $25 billion over a decade. Then, in August, the agreement to raise the debt ceiling -- an unnecessary crisis created by the Republicans -- cut nearly $2 trillion through 2021 with strict spending caps, a move that will hurt hundreds of programs serving millions of Americans for a full decade and longer.
Given the level of extortion they faced, the White House budget office and Congressional Democrats negotiated relatively well. They prevented Republicans from touching Medicare recipients, Medicaid, Social Security and other programs. (President Obama did offer to cut entitlement spending in exchange for higher tax revenues, but Republicans refused that deal.) They arranged for more than $500 billion in cuts to come from defense spending. And they did not agree to extend the Bush tax cuts, now scheduled to expire at the end of 2012.
But that still leaves major reductions in the vital category known as nondefense discretionary spending, which faces cuts of around $800 billion over a decade. That category includes education, housing assistance, transportation, public health, veterans benefits, law enforcement and courts, environmental protection and many other crucial programs.
This spending category has been the main focus of Republican pressure for decades. In the 1970s, nondefense discretionary spending represented about 5 percent of the gross domestic product; that is now down to about 2.5 percent. Over the next decade, once the new cuts go into effect, it will decline to less than 2 percent. This year's spending bill, signed into law a few days ago, is roughly 10 percent lower than last year's, cutting Pell grants, environmental programs and aid to desperate states. Low-income heating assistance was cut by 25 percent.
As the economist Jared Bernstein has noted, this is the category of spending that helps people move up the income ladder, providing nutritious food, improving early education and job training and putting people to work.
The precise cuts on individual programs will be determined each year by appropriators acting under the new caps. Each year's cuts will be more painful than the last because the spending limits fail to keep pace with population growth, inflation and the needs of the economy.
This situation is the result of the Republicans' success at shifting Washington's focus from job creation and revenue increases to deficit reduction, at exactly the wrong time, when the economy was too weak to handle it.
The long-term deficit needs to be reduced once economic growth has returned, but only in the context of higher taxes for the rich and a careful restructuring of Medicare. Even if the Bush tax cuts expire on time, much of the $3.8 trillion that that would bring in over a decade would have to be used for deficit reduction if the caps stay in place.
All of this leaves President Obama and the Democrats with much work to do in 2012. When the 2013 budget process begins in a few weeks, they will need to protect vital investments from further cuts and start building the case for raising the spending caps.

HEADLINE: Organic Agriculture May Be Outgrowing Ideals

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; David Agren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TODOS SANTOS, Mexico -- Clamshell containers on supermarket shelves in the United States may depict verdant fields, tangles of vines and ruby red tomatoes. But at this time of year, the tomatoes, peppers and basil certified as organic by the Agriculture Department often hail from the Mexican desert, and are nurtured with intensive irrigation.
Growers here on the Baja Peninsula, the epicenter of Mexico's thriving new organic export sector, describe their toil amid the cactuses as ''planting the beach.''
Del Cabo Cooperative, a supplier here for Trader Joe's and Fairway, is sending more than seven and a half tons of tomatoes and basil every day to the United States by truck and plane to sate the American demand for organic produce year-round. 
But even as more Americans buy foods with the organic label, the products are increasingly removed from the traditional organic ideal: produce that is not only free of chemicals and pesticides but also grown locally on small farms in a way that protects the environment.
The explosive growth in the commercial cultivation of organic tomatoes here, for example, is putting stress on the water table. In some areas, wells have run dry this year, meaning that small subsistence farmers cannot grow crops. And the organic tomatoes end up in an energy-intensive global distribution chain that takes them as far as New York and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, producing significant emissions that contribute to global warming.
From now until spring, farms from Mexico to Chile to Argentina that grow organic food for the United States market are enjoying their busiest season.
''People are now buying from a global commodity market, and they have to be skeptical even when the label says 'organic' -- that doesn't tell people all they need to know,'' said Frederick L. Kirschenmann, a distinguished fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University. He said some large farms that have qualified as organic employed environmentally damaging practices, like planting only one crop, which is bad for soil health, or overtaxing local freshwater supplies.
Many growers and even environmental groups in Mexico defend the export-driven organic farming, even as they acknowledge that more than a third of the aquifers in southern Baja are categorized as overexploited by the Mexican water authority. With sophisticated irrigation systems and shade houses, they say, farmers are becoming more skilled at conserving water. They are focusing new farms in ''microclimates'' near underexploited aquifers, such as in the shadow of a mountain, said Fernando Frias, a water specialist with the environmental group Pronatura Noroeste.
They also point out that the organic business has transformed what was once a poor area of subsistence farms and where even the low-paying jobs in the tourist hotels and restaurants in nearby Cabo San Lucas have become scarcer during the recession.
To carry the Agriculture Department's organic label on their produce, farms in the United States and abroad must comply with a long list of standards that prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers, hormones and pesticides, for example. But the checklist makes few specific demands for what would broadly be called environmental sustainability, even though the 1990 law that created the standards was intended to promote ecological balance and biodiversity as well as soil and water health.
Experts agree that in general organic farms tend to be less damaging to the environment than conventional farms. In the past, however, ''organic agriculture used to be sustainable agriculture, but now that is not always the case,'' said Michael Bomford, a scientist at Kentucky State University who specializes in sustainable agriculture. He added that intense organic agriculture had also put stress on aquifers in California.
Some organic standard setters are beginning to refine their criteria so that organic products better match their natural ideals. Krav, a major Swedish organic certification program, allows produce grown in greenhouses to carry its ''organic'' label only if the buildings use at least 80 percent renewable fuel, for example. And last year the Agriculture Department's National Organic Standards Board revised its rules to require that for an ''organic milk'' label, cows had to be at least partly fed by grazing in open pastures rather than standing full time in feedlots.
But each decision to narrow the definition of ''organic'' involves an inevitable tug-of-war among farmers, food producers, supermarkets and environmentalists. While the United States' regulations for organic certification require that growers use practices that protect water resources, it is hard to define a specific sustainable level of water use for a single farm ''because aquifer depletion is the result of many farmers' overutilizing the resource,'' said Miles McEvoy, head of the National Organic Program at the Agriculture Department.
While the original organic ideal was to eat only local, seasonal produce, shoppers who buy their organics at supermarkets, from Whole Foods to Walmart, expect to find tomatoes in December and are very sensitive to price. Both factors stoke the demand for imports. Few areas in the United States can farm organic produce in the winter without resorting to energy-guzzling hothouses. In addition, American labor costs are high. Day laborers who come to pick tomatoes in this part of Baja make about $10 a day, nearly twice the local minimum wage. Tomato pickers in Florida may earn $80 a day in high season.
Manuel Verdugo, 42, began organic tomato farming on desert land in San Jose del Cabo five years ago and now owns 30 acres in several locations. Each week he sends two and a half tons of cherry, plum and beefsteak tomatoes to the United States under the brand name Tiky Cabo.
He has invested in irrigation systems that drip water directly onto plants' roots rather than channeling it through open canals. He is building large shade houses that cover his crops to keep out pests and minimize evaporation. Even so, he cannot farm 10 acres in the nearby hamlet of La Cuenca because the wells there are dry.
At another five-year-old organic farm, Rosario Castillo says he can cultivate only 19 acres of the 100 he has earmarked for organic production, although he dug a well seven months ago to gain better access to the aquifer. The authorities ration pumping and have not granted him permission to clear native cactuses. ''We have very little water here, and you have to go through a lot of bureaucracy to get it,'' Mr. Castillo said.
Many growers blame tourist development -- hotels and golf courses -- for the water scarcity, and this has been a major problem in coastal areas. But farming can also be a significant drain. According to one study in an area of northern Baja called Ojos Negros, a boom in the planting of green onions for export a decade ago lowered the water table by about 16 inches a year. ''They were pumping a lot of groundwater, and that was making some people rich on both sides of the border at the expense of the environment,'' said Victor Miguel Ponce, a professor of hydrology at San Diego State University.
The logistics of getting water and transporting large volumes of perishable produce favors bigger producers. Some of the largest are American-owned, like Sueno Tropical, a vast farm with rows of shade houses lined up in the desert that caters exclusively to the American market.
While traditional organic farmers saw a blemish or odd shape simply as nature's variations, workers at Sueno Tropical are instructed to cull tomatoes that do not meet the uniform shape, size and cosmetic requirement of clients like Whole Foods. Those ''seconds'' are sold locally.
Yet the connection to the United States has brought other kinds of benefits. Del Cabo Cooperative, which serves as a broker for hundreds of local farmers, provides seeds for its Mexican growers and hires roving agronomists and entomologists to assist them in tending their crops without chemicals. As the American market expands, said John Graham, a coordinator of operations at Del Cabo, he is always looking to bring new growers into his network -- especially those whose farms draw on distant aquifers where water is still abundant.

HEADLINE: This Revolution Isn't Being Televised

BYLINE: By JON B. ALTERMAN. 
Jon B. Alterman is director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

 BODY:
Washington
THE Egyptian revolution did not happen last winter. It is happening now. And it is not taking place in Tahrir Square, but in towns and villages throughout the country.
Although protests and violent military responses in central Cairo have seized world attention, they involve only a small fraction of Egyptians. Much more important are the millions who voted this month in a rolling election process that will continue into January, setting the stage for a negotiation between newly elected officials and Egypt's military rulers over the country's political future. We must focus our attention on its outcome and, perhaps counterintuitively, try to ensure an ambiguous result so that no side is left empty-handed.
In February, the picture looked very different. The youthful energy of Egypt's revolutionaries captivated audiences and furthered the view that educated and tolerant people across the region were poised to seize power from brutal dictators. As the Arab Spring wore on, it became clear that not as much had changed in Egypt as many had thought. Army officers in suits had ruled Egypt since the 1950s. They were still in command, albeit now in uniform. Many Egyptians bristled, and thousands protested the army's ongoing rule and the slow pace of reform. 
A core of activists still come to Tahrir Square, but the real game is farther afield, where Islamist parties have mobilized tens of thousands to get out the vote and monitor polling stations.
For Americans, it is hard to imagine that religious parties could win almost 70 percent of the Egyptian vote. But I served as an official election observer earlier this month, and it is hard for me to imagine how they could not. Islamists have grasped that the game has moved beyond protests to the mechanics of elections, and their supporters are motivated, organized and energetic. By contrast, the secular liberal parties are virtually absent from the countryside. Judging from posters, billboards, bumper stickers and banners, the two major Islamist parties have the field almost to themselves.
Although Egypt's rising Islamist politicians are seeking to take power from the military, the army has generally supported the political process by guarding polling stations and maintaining order. But the army's legitimacy is now fading due to its brutal treatment of protesters. While it had initially approached the elections with professionalism and fairness, raids on civil society and democracy groups in recent days represent a real departure. As the army's image declines, high voter turnout and strong poll results are enhancing Islamists' legitimacy.
This is but a prelude to the real battle, which will come in the spring as a new Parliament is seated, constitutional revisions begin and a presidential election campaign kicks off. Egypt is also likely to be running low on foreign exchange reserves, tempting the government to devalue the pound and spur inflation.
Elected politicians and the army will both be working to set the rules by which Egypt will be governed. Each side is likely to take things to the brink, reminding the other of its strengths and ensuring that it gets the best deal.
Many in Israel and America, and even some in Egypt, fear that the elections will produce an Islamist-led government that will tear up the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, turn hostile to the United States, openly support Hamas and transform Egypt into a theocracy that oppresses women, Christians and secular Muslims. They see little prospect for more liberal voices to prevail, and view military dictatorship as a preferable outcome.
American interests, however, call for a different outcome, one that finds a balance -- however uneasy -- between the military authorities and Egypt's new politicians. We do not want any one side to vanquish or silence the other. And with lopsided early election results, it is especially important that the outcome not drive away Egypt's educated liberal elite, whose economic connections and know-how will be vital for attracting investment and creating jobs.
Our instinct is to search for the clarity we saw in last winter's televised celebrations. However, what Egyptians, and Americans, need is something murkier -- not a victory, but an accommodation.

HEADLINE: Housing Aids the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''No Relief in Report on Housing'' (Stocks and Bonds column, Dec. 28) hammers home the point that there can be no robust economic recovery until the housing market gets back on its feet. 
A healthy housing industry contributes to job growth and helps communities thrive. We estimate that constructing 100 new homes creates more than 300 jobs and $8.9 million in local, state and federal taxes and other revenue, much of which goes to finance schools, police and firefighters.
In scores of communities where the inventory of new homes has been nearly depleted and employment is gaining, builders should be responding to the new housing demand.
Unfortunately, credit is so tight that many lenders are refusing to make loans to builders for sound projects, and creditworthy borrowers can't get mortgages.
Policy makers must work to resolve this credit crunch. Stabilizing the housing market will greatly help employment, consumer confidence and the economy.

HEADLINE: Analyzing the Analysts' Investment Predictions

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
I'M not the only one who has seen prognosticators through the years make a wrong call -- Dow 36,000! Dow 5,000! But I can't recall any of them being asked to explain months later why they slipped up.
So last January, I thought it worthwhile to find a group of analysts and advisers who would be accountable for their predictions, a group willing not just to make investment recommendations for 2011 but also amenable to my checking in every quarter to assess how they were doing.
Let me pause and thank the group for being good sports. Only one dropped out, when he left the firm, and one other was miffed when I highlighted a call he had changed.
As for the exercise itself, it did not turn out as I had expected. When 2011 began, many indicators in the United States were pointing to the start of an economic recovery, including improved consumer confidence and increased growth projections. What happened was far different and far more complicated. 
Here are just a few of the economic shocks of the year: the earthquake and tsunami in Japan; the revolutions throughout the Arab world; the debt problems in Greece, and now other European countries, that are a drag on the European Union; the spike in stock market volatility from August onward; and the continuing political clashes in the United States over spending and taxes, along with Standard & Poor's downgrade of the country's credit rating in August.
''This is probably the hardest year I can remember in a very long time for managing money,'' said Richard Madigan, chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan's Global Access Portfolios. In 2008, ''you could assess what you thought was happening in the world and dive into the trenches and fight it. This year was tough.''
Still, an analyst's job is to get things right through thick and thin. So in the final column with this group, I asked the participants to identify their best and worst calls, what surprised them and to predict what lies ahead for 2012.
BEST AND WORST CALLS The one call everyone missed was just how much the prices of United States Treasury bonds would rise, even after Washington almost came to a standstill last summer over raising the debt ceiling and the country's credit rating was lowered. Beyond that, the best calls were a mix.
Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, backed dividend-paying stocks at the start of the year and never wavered, though he acknowledged after the third quarter that the reasons this call worked changed as the year went on.
In the beginning, he argued that money was going to move from bonds to stocks, and dividend-paying ones would rally first. Then, he saw a company's ability to pay dividends as a sign that these companies were well run. After the summer, he and many other analysts pointed out that dividend-paying stocks were a good option for income when the yields on 10-year Treasuries fell to around 2 percent.
Now, Mr. Stone said, the country is in a period of what he called financial repression, where interest rates are lower than inflation, and he said dividend-paying stocks were a good option for generating income and preparing investors for an eventual increase in inflation.
''Dividend-paying stocks at least give you a chance to win over some amount of time,'' he said. But the best plan back in January, he said, would have been to have ''ignored all that and run to long-term Treasuries, even though it made no logical sense.''
He was not alone in his enthusiasm for this asset class. Mr. Madigan said he had invested $2 billion in dividend-paying stocks in 2011, to good results. He said it was part of a broader strategy of focusing on less volatile investments.
A different rationale motivated Niall J. Gannon, director of wealth management at the Gannon Group at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, to focus on investing in consumer companies with a global reach, like Procter & Gamble or Gillette. (In many cases, these companies also pay dividends.) He remains convinced that the best strategy over the next 10 years is to focus on the middle class in emerging markets (even though his more profitable short-term call this year was on municipal bonds).
''I still have a positive view of humanity,'' Mr. Gannon said. ''The world welcomed its seven billionth resident. I look at it as the seven billionth consumer. We're moving in the right direction.''
SURPRISES The big surprise for everyone -- after Treasury prices -- was just how intense and frequent this year's crises were. Most members of the group were humbled, if unbowed, by what world events did to their finely wrought analyses.
Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, said he was glad that he did not get caught up in the emotional swings of the year. ''We didn't panic,'' he said. ''We made adjustments during the year, but we never went to a position of maximum defensiveness.''
Yet he came across as the most humbled by the swoons of 2011, even though he made some good calls, like predicting solid corporate earnings growth, being skeptical of the value of the euro and adding money to high-yield bonds.
Richard Cookson, chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank, who was bearish and outspoken about the state of the global economy throughout the year, remained so at the end. ''Nothing surprised me,'' he said. ''We weren't as bearish as we should have been at the beginning of the year, but we were bearish.''
He added, ''We've thumped the table all year: property and credit bubbles never end well.''
While most of the advisers said they would not change the calls they made in January, even knowing what they know now, Mr. Cookson went a step further and put out a list to clients, trumpeting the 13 calls he said he got right over the last two years -- including cutting investments in emerging markets, avoiding financial services stocks and moving heavily into fixed-income investments. He also noted his two bad calls -- he missed the 2010 rally in stocks and bought more Italian equities in February, only to see their value fall months later.
(Readers of the October column in this series may wonder about his pronouncement that ''Greece will default in the next few weeks.'' To that, he said: ''Greece is being kept on life support. It's pretty certain to default. The question is timing.'')
THE NEXT YEAR Perhaps not surprisingly, no one was eager to make bold predictions for next year, at least none who departed from the prevailing, if discomforting, view that 2012 will be a year of more uncertainty.
Like the other analysts, Mr. Stone said that investors were worried that Europe was going to continue to be a cause for concern. He said he thought the economic picture would begin to improve next year, but ''predicting when that will happen is hard to do.''
Still, Mr. Stone said he believed that the United States economy would grow by 2.5 percent next year and that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would have single-digit growth. He predicted that global economic growth would be about 4 percent.
Mr. Madigan predicts that global growth will be about half that because the economies in emerging markets and Europe are going to slow even more and the half dozen national elections around the world are going to keep markets unsettled. ''It's going to be another bouncy, bumpy, Tiggerish year next year,'' he said. ''The question is, do you believe next year is the latter part of the bottoming process. If you do, you should be in the markets.''
Whatever happens, Mr. Gannon said, investors need to tune out the headlines. ''The short-term bumps are hard to take, but when you think there is an antidote to that, investors have been widely disappointed,'' he said. ''The Goldilocks model of putting together a lot of smart guys who can make 8 percent when the market is down 20 percent -- you need to stop looking for that.''

HEADLINE: Egypt's Obstructionist Generals

 BODY:
Egypt's military council continues to demonstrate its utter contempt for the citizens who risked their lives to end President Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian rule. In the latest outrage, security forces on Thursday shut down three American-financed democracy-building groups in Cairo and as many as six other nonprofit organizations. Armed with automatic weapons, troops provided no warrants and, in some cases, detained the groups' employees for hours. They confiscated computers and files and sealed the doors when they left. 
The three American groups are all well known and respected. Two of them, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, have ties to the main American political parties. They were authorized by the Egyptian government to monitor the country's first post-Mubarak parliamentary elections, set to resume next week. The third group, Freedom House, just finished its application for official recognition three days ago.
Egypt's Islamist parties, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, have honed their organizational skills over the years and won a majority in the first rounds of parliamentary voting. But the country's liberal and secular activists, the heart of the revolution, still need a lot of help to learn the skills to develop political parties, train poll workers and get out the vote.
The raids go against the military council's promise to allow free and fair elections. They are part of a desperate attempt to intimidate the opposition and cover up the council's many failures by invoking the canard of ''foreign'' meddling in Egypt's unrest.
Egyptians continue to protest because the army has made clear its determination to cling to political power indefinitely -- and control lucrative chunks of the economy -- no matter how many civilians it has to arrest or kill.
The Obama administration has spoken out firmly against the raids, and, on Friday, it said the Egyptian government had agreed to stop harassing the democracy groups and return their property. The administration needs to keep pressing that message and make clear that if such abuses continue at least some of the $1.3 billion in annual American military aid will be withheld. The European Union should also review its assistance.
Egypt's generals claim that they are protecting their country. The truth is they are only interested in protecting their own power and perks. Their continued repression is the real threat to Egypt's stability and its future.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ends Back Where It Started

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Like a roller coaster returning to the platform, the stock market in the United States ended the last day of trading in 2011 just about where it started the year. But what a wild ride it was in between.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the main gauge of broad market performance, closed on Friday at 1,257.60, finishing the year nearly dead even with its 2010 close of 1,257.64, which is technically down 0.003 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip American stocks fared better, closing the year with a 5.5 percent gain at 12,217.56.
Market strategists predict the S.& P. will stay in a range of 1,100 to 1,500 by the end of 2012, depending on how investors balance economic growth, fiscal policy, corporate earnings and the European debt crisis, as well as the potential for change after the November election.
Yet, looking back at 2011, it was a flat finale that told little of the volatility preceding it, when political turmoil, financial upheaval and even natural disasters left almost no corner of the markets untouched. 
On 35 trading days in the year, the broader market closed with a gain or loss of 2 percent or more -- the most number of days of that magnitude since the financial crisis of 2008-9 and making 2011 among the most volatile on record for stocks.
''It has been such a difficult year,'' said Rick Bensignor, the chief market strategist for Merlin Securities. ''Things changed on a dime.''
Oil prices shot up to $114 a barrel before plunging to $76 and rising again to $100 in reaction to revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa. Investors piled into the perceived haven of United States Treasury bonds even after the nation's credit rating suffered its first-ever downgrade. The earthquake and tsunami in Japan exacted a devastating human and economic toll.
And the debt crisis in Europe upended governments, stirred fears of sovereign defaults and imposed severe financing strains on banks. Possibilities that were once remote became questions for debate in 2011: Will the euro zone break up? Is this a replay of the 2008 financial crisis?
Sentiment was also hobbled by a deadlock in Washington over fiscal policy and by the potential for slowing growth in emerging markets.
''Investors are scared to death,'' said Philip J. Orlando, a chief market strategist for Federated Investors. ''You have a massive flight to safety.''
Despite the bruising it took in 2011, Wall Street managed to score one of the better global performances. Major European and Asian indexes lost anywhere from 6 percent (Britain) to 26 percent (Italy) for 2011.
Looking ahead, some analysts see the United States faring even better in 2012. Binky Chadha, the chief strategist for Deutsche Bank, who forecast that the S.& P. 500 would end closer to 1,500 in 2012, wrote in a market commentary that ''very healthy'' corporate fundamentals and cheap valuations would help equities eventually win out over the euro crisis and American fiscal issues.
Some analysts said investors would most likely be better braced to handle policy changes in the nations that use the euro.
''Investor reaction should continue to get better,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank. ''For as lousy as Europe's news is, it has got to be the slowest moving train wreck in the history of the financial world. It's the stuff that comes over the transom that kills us.''
Among the best 2011 performers in the S.& P. 500 were utilities, up 14.8 percent; health care, up 10.2 percent; and consumer staples, 10.5 percent. The financial sector fared the worst, finishing down 18.4 percent.
Macroeconomics ganged up on market sentiment this year to such an extent that investors backed off stocks even as American companies set records for profits, mostly via cost-cutting.
In the third quarter, for example, earnings per share for companies in the S.& P. 500 were $25.29, their highest ever for a quarter, according to statistics compiled by Standard & Poor's. But in an ''enormous disconnect,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S.& P., the index was still down 14 percent in that period.
''The fundamental underpinnings of investing didn't matter'' in 2011, Mr. Ablin said. ''All it took was one headline and just like a tidal wave, it was lapping across the market.''
In 2011, the S.& P.'s lowest level was 1,099 and its highest was 1,363. But between the first half and the second half of the year, the market's performance diverged significantly.
In the first quarter of 2011, for example, the S.& P. finished about 5 percent higher, and there was even talk of the Dow breaking the 13,000 mark when it hit a high of 12,810 in April.
Then the mood changed. The intensifying crisis in Europe, the debt-ceiling stalemate in Washington and the downgrade of the United States credit rating pummeled markets. In the third quarter, the S.& P. 500 dropped 14.33 percent.
As a loss of faith in politicians deepened and fears rose about nations defaulting, investors flocked to what they saw as safe havens. Gold broke through $1,890 an ounce, and the price of Treasuries soared, with the yields on 10-year notes falling nearly 40 percent in the third quarter, to 1.9 percent from 3.16 percent, despite the downgrade in America's debt. The 10-year yield closed at 1.88 percent, after beginning the year at nearly 3.3 percent.
''That for me was the shocker of the year, just how much people would flock into Treasuries,'' Mr. Bensignor said.
Worries persisted through the fall, as borrowing costs shot up for Spain and Italy, where the 10-year note pushed above 7 percent yield, and the costs of insuring their debt rose. In September, equities even flirted with falling into a bear market, which is considered to be a 20 percent decline from a recent peak. On Oct. 4, in a prime example of the year's volatility, the S.& P. 500 traded in bear territory amid expectations that Greece could soon default on its debt, only to rise by 4 percent in the last hour of trading.
The dollar was also buffeted by the headwinds in Europe. It weakened as optimism grew before euro summit meetings and reversed after the meetings ended. Like stocks, it bounced back, ending the year on Friday at 80 on its index of currencies, compared with a high of 81 in early January.
As recession fears fade and the presidential election portends fiscal changes, analysts are forecasting the 10-year bond yield to rise, with LPL Financial forecasting 3 percent on the higher end of the range in 2012.
''The risk-on, risk-off trading environment that characterized the bond market performance in 2010 and 2011 is likely to persist in 2012,'' said Anthony Valeri, a fixed-income strategist for LPL.
Analysts say they expect either that Europe is already in recession or that some euro zone members, like Italy, Spain and Greece, will be soon. So developments in the euro zone will continue to have a major impact on the sentiment of American investors in 2012, they said.
But the focus in 2012 might swing back to corporate performance as investors try to gauge how successfully the country can ''de-couple'' from Europe.
A Russell Investments survey released this month showed that for the first time in the six years of the survey, money managers were most bullish over big American stocks, while stocks in overseas emerging markets and developed markets dropped in rank.
''What we hear from the managers is that they do expect company fundamentals like earnings will begin to matter'' in the United States again, said Rachel H. Carroll, the consulting client executive for Russell Investments.

While the year had fewer days with big market moves than during the 2008-9 financial crisis, it was still among the more volatile of the last three decades.

HEADLINE: In an Uncertain Market, Investors Rush In, and Out, Together

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
It seems that anxious investors in these troubled economic times are seeking safety in crowds.
The prices of stocks, bonds and a host of other financial assets, which in normal conditions more often than not move in a diversity of unpredictable directions, are increasingly surging up or down in lockstep.
The rise in correlation between individual stocks, but also between completely separate asset classes like stocks and gold or stocks and oil, ''has been one of the big themes of the investment climate this year,'' said Marc Chandler, a market strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
The chief explanation for the correlation is the great uncertainty facing investors -- mainly over the crisis in Europe, which has raised the specter of the potential bankruptcy of governments and a collapse of the banking system. 
With every bit of bad news, nervous investors around the globe have been selling many of their positions across all asset classes, no matter what they are, driving prices down, and rushing into perceived safe havens like cash and United States bonds. But sometimes just a day or so later, with a glimmer of hope that Europe is pulling away from the abyss or that the United States is picking up steam, newly optimistic investors turn around and rush back from cash into harder assets, like stocks, foreign bonds or commodities, pushing prices higher together.
''When things are less stressed, stocks and other investments move according to other more fundamental factors like a company's earnings or its balance sheet,'' said Maneesh Deshpande, managing director for global equity derivatives strategy at Barclays Capital. ''But when macro fears take over, they move in flocks.''
The downside for investors caught in this maelstrom is that their attempts to spread risk by diversifying their portfolios is less effective. Analysts expect that volatility and correlation will continue to afflict markets in the year to come.
In November and December, a common measure of correlation within the Standard & Poor's benchmark 500-stock index reached as high as 90 percent, the highest since 1996, according to Barclays calculations. For much of the decade leading up to the financial crisis in 2008, the measure of correlation between the 50 biggest stocks in the S.& P. 500 generally stayed between 10 percent and 40 percent.
Financial stocks were the most correlated in the third quarter, but even other sectors -- like consumer and health care -- that are usually more differentiated experienced ''remarkable pickups in correlations,'' Candace Browning, head of research at Bank of America, said in a recent presentation.
''A recession in Europe, the instability in the structure of the E.U. and the euro, uncertainty about the strength of a U.S. recovery and an upcoming presidential election, suggest next year could look very much like this year in terms of finding alpha in a correlated world,'' she said.
With so much money sloshing around from one day to the next, the high degree of correlation poses a challenge for active fund managers or other stock pickers who pride themselves on their ability to discriminate between stocks or other assets. It may be one reason that some hedge funds are having a tough time.
It is also a problem for ordinary investors who have traditionally tried to protect their portfolios by spreading risk over a broad basket of assets, so that if some go down in price, others will increase. But how can you protect yourself in a world where investments rise or fall together?
Dean Curnutt, chief executive of Macro Risk Advisors, which advises institutional investors on their risk strategies, said that correlation threatened ''the old adage of don't put all your eggs in one basket.'' According to Mr. Chandler, the heightened correlation means ''there is nowhere to hide'' for investors.
It has happened before. Correlation went up when markets were volatile during the 2008 financial crisis, and again in May 2010 when the European debt crisis erupted as Greece needed its first bailout and the anxious United States stock market suffered a ''flash crash.''
The measures of correlation are closely tied to another closely watched market statistic, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The VIX, as it is known, measures the implied volatility of options on the S.& P. 500. When conditions become volatile, it seems, investors rush in and out of assets together, and that's when correlation rises.
It's no surprise that correlation has increased again this year as Europe's unresolved problems have spread to Italy, sending markets reeling.
The realized correlation within United States equities in the S.& P. 500 is now higher than in 2008, Mr. Curnutt said.
But, he said, it was not just stocks: there has also been an increased correlation between oil and the euro, for example, and other assets like stocks and gold, and between Italian government bonds and Italian bank stocks.
''The commonality they have is they are not cash,'' Mr. Curnutt said. Investors are ''jumping out of cash and into something else.''
Mr. Curnutt measures the average correlation of daily price moves over a rolling three-month period. On this basis, the correlation between United States stocks and gold, for example, is now the highest for any three-month period since January 2009, according to Macro Risk Advisors. The correlation between United States stocks and an index of United States government corporate bonds is the strongest since at least 2000, where the company's data set begins. Mr. Curnutt says the effect can be self-reinforcing. When there is a clear systemic risk, as there is now because of the European debt crisis, investors expect correlation to increase -- and so they invest in products like exchange-traded funds, baskets of assets that are intended to perform well in a highly correlated environment.
But these instruments, which have become popular recently, tend to exacerbate the correlation, he said.
''There is a circularity of effect,'' Mr. Curnutt said.
The official monetary policy in the United States -- keeping interest rates close to zero -- is also exaggerating the phenomenon, Mr. Curnutt said, because savers have little incentive to stay in cash and instead rush en masse into other investments when they see glimmers of stability and higher returns elsewhere.
''During this crisis, there has been one big trade out there. Either risk on or risk off,'' Mr. Chandler said.
But while correlation has been such a strong feature of the past year, Mr. Chandler detects some signs that it may be gradually diminishing as investors expect the United States economic recovery to become more robust in 2012.
Whereas in the past investors were switching their assets readily between United States stocks and, say, emerging market stocks, an improvement in the United States economy could make the nation's stocks more attractive. As a result, investors may now choose to keep more of their money invested in the S.& P. 500. With less money tumbling around the financial markets from one group of financial assets to another, correlation could fall, he said.
But Mr. Deshpande of Barclays Capital said one interesting aspect of the last month or so was that measures of correlation had remained high even as market volatility has fallen back.
One reason, some analysts say, is that while markets may be anticipating Armageddon in Europe, they are more and more bullish about the recovery in the United States. As a result, the VIX measure of anticipated volatility in stocks is diminishing. But the lockstep swings of other financial assets remain as investors continue to fret about Europe.

HEADLINE: For Readers, the Neighbors Touched a Nerve

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
I'M always intrigued, when looking back over the year, to discover which columns seemed to set off the greatest debate and which touched the rawest nerve. Often the two aren't the same.
Here's what I found: Mention noisy neighbors -- particularly barking dogs as I did on Sept. 10 -- and you'll get an earful from around the country.
''Ah! Wars, the deficit, unemployment, hurricanes, and other calamities. Good to leave all these pesky problems to Page 1 of The New York Times,'' wrote Yvonne Rall, a reader from Dayton, Ohio. ''Your article resonates with everyone! I have lived in the same house for almost 50 years, and if I brought up all the ups and downs I have endured from obnoxious neighbors all these years, your article would have been four times longer. 
''I have had to put up with noise such as you describe from dogs, which also did their business on my grass, (which I regularly picked up, without saying one word!), but also neighbors who used my property to park their cars on my lawn, had some loud parties, with guests urinating on the front lawn, neighbors who did not pay their fee, thus their trash was not picked up, would not mow the grass in a timely manner, and did not maintain their property, and some who lived as cavemen. I could go on and on.''
And some did go on and on. Jonathan Fox asked why I did not mention how annoying leaf blowers are. (There was no reason; it just didn't make it into the column. But I completely agree. They turn suburban lawns into airport tarmacs.)
Other neighbor problems that readers sent in? Cellphone talkers who loudly hold forth while standing beside open windows. Cigarette or barbecue smoke from next door. And as Luigi Lucaccini, from Mill Valley, Calif., said, ''You covered it all except for the kid next door with the drum set.''
Speaking of noise, my Oct. 8 column on the pros and cons of working at home included a mention by Cliff Stepp, of Stepp Up Consulting, of having to explain to a client why he had heard a rooster crowing. Mr. Stepp's first home office was in a barn.
Joe W. Milkes, of Plano, Tex., told me he has had to do some quick thinking as well. ''We have two large dogs that occasionally howl when the home phone rings very loudly and continue even after the phone has stopped,'' he wrote. ''On one occasion, I was asked by a prospective client about the background noise and I explained that I was appraising a large dog kennel. Being a commercial appraiser I have some opportunity to create a cover story by claiming to be doing various on-site inspections.''
Another column, on Jan. 29, on how to teach children to help neighbors -- with or without a reward -- brought back some memories for readers.
Francis P. King of Manhattan recalled that ''when I was a teenager in the 1930s in a small Oregon town, the going wage rate for mowing the neighbor's lawn was 25 cents per hour.''
E. Marianne Gabel of Delaware, Ohio, received even less than that. ''When I was in my young teens, the minister of my church asked me if I would baby-sit for the family. I liked them all very much and was thrilled. My father, however, told me sternly that I couldn't take any pay for it. I was very disappointed; I knew they would not invite me to baby-sit again, since they wouldn't want to appear to take advantage of free services of a congregation member. And they didn't.''
There wasn't much debate that irritating noisy neighbors were awful and good neighbors were great, but my July 16 column on the downside of perfectionism received some divided reviews. I wrote that while perfectionism might mean you have high standards, it also can create a fear in some of us of being creative and trying new things. I quoted researchers as saying that too often such people have unrealistically high goals, and therefore always feel as if they are falling short.
Amy Wax, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, thought the article was highly imperfect, to say the least.
''Your column on perfectionism was misguided in so many ways that it's hard to know where to begin. There are people operating at the highest levels in many fields who put a heroic, enormous effort into doing things right -- doing things PERFECTLY -- every time, and routinely achieve that goal.
''The message being sent to our children -- that 'it's O.K. to make mistakes' -- is pernicious and encourages sloppiness, carelessness and laziness.''
Larry DuBois of Salt Lake City had a different take on the concept. Referring to the 12-step principles of Alcoholics Anonymous, he quoted from the group's writings: '' 'No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress, rather than spiritual perfection.'
''Seventy-two years after they published the book, that passage is still read aloud every day at the beginning of almost every A.A. meeting in the world. Progress, not perfection. It's amazing how well that principle works for almost everyone who learns to live by it.''
My July 16 piece on the skills that every teenager who is off to college should know wasn't about perfectionism, but the need for a modicum of basic know-how, like doing laundry or tracking finances.
Readers like Mike Derian added their own ideas. ''Know that your child has some idea how to take care of themselves when suffering with colds, sore throats, etc., and that includes knowing how to talk to the nurses at the college clinic,'' he wrote. ''In my experience, these illnesses always occur during finals week -- you can imagine the panic of a young student who put in great effort all semester only to be at half speed for the most important week of the academic year.''
A college student who asked to remain anonymous (it's clear why after reading her story) wrote that she was glad I had mentioned knowing the proper way to use a microwave as something every college-bound teenager should learn.
''I wish a boy who lived across from me my freshman year knew that he wasn't supposed to microwave a burrito wrapped in tinfoil placed in a Styrofoam cup. It created liquid fire. He panicked, so instead of putting it out, he just started throwing his clothes out of the dorm. I was in my dorm room at the time, and I sadly was no better. I suspected it wouldn't do much because it was small, but just in case, I grabbed a few important things and left (we do get fined if we don't leave the building).
''No one put out the fire, and within half an hour, his dorm room was on fire, the firefighters were throwing his bed out his window, and my dorm room was completely smoke damaged. Everyone in my dorm had to move to a different dorm until they fixed everything, and I never saw the boy again.''
So learning to deal with emergency situations is another important lesson, she said. Her college addressed this particular problem by putting up signs ''with a little happy burrito saying, 'Only you can prevent burrito fires.' ''

HEADLINE: As Crop Prices Soar, Iowa Farms Expand Into Every Spare Inch

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
WHITTEMORE, Iowa -- A splash of green on a solid beige horizon, the golf course at the edge of this tiny town promised residents nine modest holes of refuge from corn country. Decades earlier the spot had been farmed, too, but the rocky soil was so poor, the saying went, that you couldn't raise hell there with a fifth of whiskey.
''The rottenest piece of land there is,'' said Mick Elbert, a local car dealer who served on the golf association board. ''All it is good for is a golf course. That's why we built it there.''
But this year, over a chorus of objections, the greens and fairways were plowed under. The course had been losing money, and crop prices had been breaking records, so the new owner did the type of quick calculation that is quietly reshaping the region and determined that it was more valuable as farmland. The first harvest took place this fall. 
Across much of the Midwest the sharp increase in farm earnings has driven the price of farmland to previously unimaginable -- and, some say, unsustainable -- levels. But in the process, to much less fanfare, the financial rewards have also encouraged farmers to put ever more land into production, including parcels that until recently were too small or too poor in quality to warrant a second glance.
As Iowa marches toward the Republican caucuses, much of the politicking has been set against the timeless backdrop of open farmland. These agricultural vistas are expanding across the Corn Belt, where the fertile and increasingly profitable soil has helped this state weather the nation's economic storms.
Farmers are taking down the old barn or the grove of trees that shaded a corner of the family farm to squeeze in a few more rows of crops. They are plowing up areas previously used for grazing cattle or set aside for conservation because they had been deemed too wet, too sandy or too hilly for farming.
And they are returning crops to places that had been reserved for ostensibly more lucrative purposes like strip malls, housing developments or, in several cases, struggling small-town golf courses.
''One day it's grassland, and the next day it's black dirt,'' said Jim Ringelman, the North Dakota-based director of conservation programs for Ducks Unlimited, a hunting and conservation group worried about the trend. ''It's that quick.''
There are no encompassing statistics about how much land is being cleared, but farmers and environmentalists around the region agree that the available figures and anecdotal evidence suggest a significant increase in the amount of dormant land going back into production. There is debate over whether this should be a source of concern.
Craig Cox, the head of the Midwest office of the Environmental Working Group, which has released a report warning about farmland erosion, stressed that the more aggressive farming tactics, like removing trees that act as windbreaks or buffer areas that surround streams, put both land and water at risk.
''It's really disturbing,'' Mr. Cox said. ''Farmers are pushing as hard as possible to get every last bushel out of every last acre.''
In Iowa, the nation's biggest producer of corn and soybeans, farmers insist that they are simply getting more value from their land. Darrell Coddington, a farmer who runs an excavation business, has spent much of the past year clearing additional land in the hilly and wooded southern part of the state, including places that used to be left alone and derided as a ''cocklebur farm,'' referring to the thorny weed.
While working one overgrown parcel for a neighbor, Mr. Coddington discovered a rusting horse-drawn plow buried beneath a foot of earth, a find that suggested the land had not been farmed in a century. And while expanding his own cropland he decided to tear down the empty family homestead, an action that he described as sad but economically justified.
''Hey,'' he said, ''it was farm ground before they built it.''
The force pushing more land into production is the rise in crop prices: in the past five years corn prices tripled and those for soybeans doubled because of swelling worldwide demand, including demand for ethanol production. At the same time yields have spiked because of genetically engineered crops and improvements in farming technology, which are also allowing farmers to grow in previously inhospitable areas.
In turn farmers, flush from the most profitable years in decades and looking for better places to store money than low-interest savings accounts or a turbulent stock market, are putting their money in land.
In Iowa, the state with the highest gains in the Midwest, the average price of farmland grew a record 32 percent last year to $6,700 an acre, according to a study released last week by Iowa State University. This month a land auction in the northwest corner of the state shattered records when one farm sold for $20,000 an acre, prompting another round of warnings of a real estate bubble.
Many of those not buying new land are instead putting money into their operations by buying new equipment or undertaking long-planned projects for their property like tearing down trees, buildings or fence rows to make more room for crops.
Others are pulling land out of the federal Conservation Reserve Program, which pays a per acre fee to farmers who agree to leave their land idle for a decade or more. Enrollment in the program, praised by environmentalists and hunters for improving water quality and wildlife habitat, peaked at 36.8 million acres in 2007 and dropped to 29.6 million acres last month, in part because farmers believed they could make more by farming than the $53 per acre average paid for conservation.
In Iowa, just 9 percent of farmers with expiring contracts in the program renewed them in 2009. With a spike in expiring contracts next year and Congress considering scaling back the program, which has paid out more than $1.7 billion so far this year, significantly more marginal land could return to production.
It is not just land in the country that is being returned to production. In the Des Moines area, farms that were bought for development -- even parcels that were cleared and graded -- are being tilled and planted again, some rented as a stopgap measure and some permanently sold off. ''It may be worth almost as much now as farm ground as it was for development,'' said Bill Northey, the state agriculture secretary.
Todd Volz, a farmer who pays to grow hay on these vacant properties in urban areas, said more developers are using this income until the housing market recovers. ''I can't handle all the work,'' Mr. Volz said.
Another casualty has been small-town golf courses, many of which were already struggling. In Rockford, about a two-hour drive east of here, Jim Dow, the owner and manager of a 78-acre course, has been turning over the land, removing 750 trees in the process. Though he has never farmed, he believes he could turn a profit with the current prices. Better yet he might be able to sell a property that had been languishing without bidders.
''Maybe once people see it's plowed,'' he said, ''someone will make an offer.''

HEADLINE: Hunt for Gas Hits Fragile Soil, And South Africans Fear Risks

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
KAROO, South Africa -- When a drought dried up their wells last year, hundreds of farmers and their families flocked to local fairgrounds here to pray for rain, and a call went out on the regional radio station imploring South Africans to donate bottled water.
Covering much of the roughly 800 miles between Johannesburg and Cape Town, this arid expanse -- its name means ''thirsty land'' -- sees less rain in some parts than the Mojave Desert.
Even so, Shell and several other large energy companies hope to drill thousands of natural gas wells in the region, using a new drilling technology that can require a million gallons of water or more for each well. Companies will also have to find a way to dispose of all the toxic wastewater or sludge that each well produces, since the closest landfill or industrial-waste facility that can handle the waste is hundreds of miles away.
''Around here, the rain comes on legs,'' said Chris Hayward, 51, a brawny, dust-covered farmer in Beaufort West, quoting a Karoo saying about how rare and fleeting precipitation is in the area. 
With his three skinny border collies crouching dutifully at his side, Mr. Hayward explained that he had to slaughter more than 600 of his 2,000 sheep last year because there was not enough water to go around.
''If our government lets these companies touch even a drop of our water,'' he said, ''we're ruined.''
South Africa is among the growing number of countries that want to unlock previously inaccessible natural gas reserves trapped in shale deep underground. The drilling technology -- hydraulic fracturing, or ''fracking,'' for short -- holds the promise of generating new revenue through taxes on the gas, creating thousands of jobs for one of the country's poorest regions, and fueling power plants to provide electricity to roughly 10 million South Africans who live without it.
But many of the sites here and on other continents that are being considered for drilling by oil and gas companies and by governments short of cash are in fragile areas where local officials have limited resources, political leverage or experience to ensure that the drilling is done safely.
A Surge in Interest
The interest from big energy companies in South Africa and elsewhere means that shale gas may redraw the global energy map, according to many energy experts.
Michael Klare, a professor of world security studies at Hampshire College, said that the new sources of natural gas from shale may lessen the geopolitical importance of countries that historically have been the biggest producers of natural gas, including Iran, Qatar and Russia. The new drilling, which draws strong support from the United States government, represents a boon for American companies like Halliburton, Chesapeake Energy and Exxon Mobil that have greater experience with shale gas, and therefore are likely to win many lucrative contracts abroad.
More than 30 countries, including China, India and Pakistan, are now considering fracking for natural gas or oil, and the surge in gas production has spurred interest in building pipelines and terminals that liquefy the fuel so it can be shipped to far-flung markets. In the United States, shale gas has increased supply, driving prices down and benefiting industrial plants that use the gas for manufacturing and consumers who depend on it for electricity, heating or cooking.
But the enthusiasm abroad, especially in less-developed regions, does carry risks, according to many energy experts.
''The big problem is that all the excitement around shale gas, most of it fostered by the U.S., has also led some countries, especially in the developing world, to take a drill-first, figure-out-regulations-later attitude,'' said Professor Klare, who has written extensively about the way that energy policies affect global security. ''There is simply too much being taken on faith when it comes to company reassurances about the safety and costs of this drilling.''
The Indonesian government, for example, is considering allowing drilling for shale gas in a part of Java where, in 2006, drilling led to the eruption of a mud volcano that killed at least 13 people, and displaced more than 30,000 residents from 12 villages, according to a team of international scientists. Indonesia is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, but it struggles to meet domestic demand, and supporters of the shale drilling project say it will help solve that problem.
Shale gas in Poland may represent more than a third of the natural gas resources in Europe, according to energy experts, and could help the country reduce its dependence on Russia, which now supplies about 60 percent of Poland's gas.
But an April 2010 report by Bernstein Research, a market research group, raised concerns about the costs and risks of shale gas drilling because Poland is so densely populated, dependent on agriculture and farmers will have to compete with drillers for water.
''Europe and some of the countries with shale potential have significantly less renewable water resources than the U.S.,'' the report warned.
A U.S. Initiative
In the United States, where the water-intensive drilling technique of fracking was invented, the government is taking a lead role in supporting the dissemination of the technology abroad, as well as promoting other energy projects, including building infrastructure to extract and transport liquid natural gas.
Over the past three years, President Obama has promoted shale gas during visits to China, India and Poland.
''We believe that there is the capacity technologically to extract that gas in a way that is entirely safe,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech in May in Warsaw, where the American Embassy co-hosted an international shale gas conference.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States has financed some of its biggest gas projects over the last several years, including the largest transaction in the bank's history -- $3 billion approved in 2009 for hundreds of miles of gas pipeline and a liquid natural gas plant and terminal project led by Exxon Mobil in Papua New Guinea.
The United States Geological Survey has offered training and technology to geologists exploring shale gas in Europe.
In 2009, the United States and China signed an agreement to promote accelerated development of shale gas in China, which has major shale gas deposits in Inner Mongolia in the north and in the country's restive western frontier, Xinjiang, which is characterized by severe droughts and a separatist movement.
The State Department's Global Shale Gas Initiative, begun in 2010, has been advising many foreign countries on fracking. It has organized a half-dozen trips this year for foreign officials to meet with American energy experts and to visit drilling sites in the United States.
The Web site for the initiative says that its primary goals are ''to achieve greater energy security, meet environmental objectives and further U.S. economic and commercial interests.''
Concern About Effects
Some economists and environmentalists say that while the governments of poorer countries may benefit from the new tax revenues and jobs, they may not be paying enough attention to the environmental risks of drilling. They also note that local residents -- who bear the brunt of the air pollution, potential water contamination from spills or underground seepage, and truck traffic that come with drilling -- may see few benefits.
''These projects have already started causing steep inflation in costs of local housing and services, and except for the lucky few who get temporary construction jobs, the economic conditions for local communities can actually get worse,'' said Doug Norlen, policy director of Pacific Environment, an advocacy and research organization that tracks federal and corporate financing of energy projects abroad.
The direct benefits of new drilling to American landowners -- they receive bonuses and royalties when they lease their land to drillers -- will generally not be shared by landowners abroad. In South Africa and many other countries looking to embrace the drilling, the minerals under a property are more often owned by governments, not individuals.
Mr. Norlen added that the influx of foreign construction workers in these projects could lead to conflicts with local and tribal communities. In one example, he noted, the United States government-financed project in Papua New Guinea to extract and transport liquid natural gas recently led to violent clashes between residents and foreign contractors.
But Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for Shell in South Africa, said that the Karoo project could eventually produce millions of dollars in direct investment and thousands of jobs for South Africans, which would help lower the nation's unemployment rate of about 25 percent.
''There is a huge energy problem looming for South Africa,'' he added, explaining that energy demand is growing rapidly and that shale gas coupled with renewables could help meet that new demand while also lowering the nation's dependence on Mozambique for gas.
Fracking involves injecting large amounts of water mixed with chemicals and sand at very high pressure deep underground to crack rock and release gas. After fracking, much of the water at each well returns to the surface mixed with toxic chemicals.
Shell's plan is to drill at least six exploratory wells over the next three years, and if the gas reserves appear profitable, it will start production with at least 1,500 wells several years later. Martin Bell, the water manager for Shell's Karoo project, said the company planned to recycle as much wastewater as possible, storing it temporarily in closed containers. Trucks will not be the primary method for moving waste or water, he said. Drilling waste, which could be especially toxic because the area is high in uranium deposits, will be shipped to disposal plants by pipes or by rail, Mr. Bell said.
Water needed for fracking may be brought in by rail from the coast, which is hundreds of miles away in some parts, or drawn from aquifers far below the ones that supply water for farmers. The company will tap into the aquifers that farmers use only if it can prove no adverse impact, Mr. Bell said.
In interviews, South African drilling regulators emphasized that producing and using more natural gas would help the country's air pollution problems and avoid increasing its already heavy dependence on coal for electricity, since coal is dirtier than natural gas when burned.
But in this sun-flooded hinterland, where sheep outnumber humans and rusty windmills pumping water dot the horizon, many residents say they would prefer to see the government bring in wind or solar farms, not new drilling.
''It just takes one big spill, leaky pipe or crack underground that their studies didn't catch, and a farm my family has run for four generations is done,'' said Trenly Spence, 44, as he dug up a clogged irrigation pipe that carries water across his 3,300 acres to where his 3,000 sheep and goats graze.
Mr. Spence added that farmers had been frustrated by the lack of information from Shell officials about the chemicals they would inject into the ground during fracking.
Shell officials said that they would disclose what they could about fracking formulas if they started drilling, but that they might be limited by trade secrets of their subcontractors.
In the United States, some drilling companies have been reluctant to reveal the chemicals they use in fracking, saying the information is proprietary.
Officials from the State Department's shale gas initiative have said that developing countries interested in fracking will need to create stronger protections for intellectual property rights so energy companies will think that they can safely maintain certain patents over their drilling techniques. Some environmentalists say that strengthening these intellectual property protections will only help energy companies argue that they do not have to disclose the chemicals they use in fracking abroad.
A spokesman for the State Department declined to answer questions about fracking and intellectual property rights. But he emphasized that the initiative's goal is to help countries make informed decisions about their resources, rather than promoting shale gas abroad.
''The regulatory and financial climate is obviously important to companies considering an investment in unconventional gas,'' the spokesman said in an e-mail. ''But sound environmental regulations and policies are also critical, as is working with local communities and other stakeholders to understand the impact of shale gas on their lives.''
The Future
Some legal experts say that the United States needs to be more concerned about environmental and other impacts as it promotes energy technology abroad. David Hunter, director of the Program on International and Comparative Environmental Law at American University, said, ''Especially with energy projects, the U.S. and its funding institutions have a habit of promoting policies that foster a stable climate for foreign investors but that are not in the best interests of local populations.''
In Peru, for example, the United States Export-Import bank provided more than $400 million in loan guarantees in 2008 for a liquefied natural gas terminal to export gas from the Camisea gas fields, which are in the Amazon rainforest. The project for drilling and pipelines in the Camisea, which received separate financing from the Inter-American Development Bank, has been dogged by spills, accusations that company officials bribed lawmakers and criticisms about exporting the gas rather than using more of it to lower prices for domestic consumers.
Energy companies are using fracking technology in parts of Canada, bringing jobs and wealth to gas-rich provinces like Alberta and British Columbia. But residents near drilling sites have complained that natural gas has seeped into their water wells making their tap water flammable. Drillers have denied responsibility.
In South Africa, pressure is mounting to proceed cautiously.
After public concerns were raised this year about drilling in the Karoo region, South African drilling officials set a moratorium on new licenses for exploration until February so the government could conduct more research.
In July, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa, an independent agency that sets guidelines for media companies, ruled that several of Shell's advertised claims -- including one that said fracking had never led to groundwater contamination -- were misleading or unsubstantiated and should be withdrawn. Shell said the advertisements were an accurate reflection of its opinion.
''The government is under a great deal of pressure to hurry up,'' said Hein Rust, director of disaster management for the central Karoo region. ''But I don't think these decisions should be made on faith or until all the costs are known.''

HEADLINE: The Year Governments Lost Their Credibility

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
For most of 2011, it appeared that the year would be decent, if not particularly interesting, for investors.
Then Europe announced its second plan to rescue Greece, the first one, reached more than a year earlier, having turned out to be completely inadequate. That's when 2011 became exciting and the losses began to pile up.
The summit meeting of European leaders on July 21 in Brussels called for private investors to take losses of 21 percent on some Greek bonds, but for a rescue package to keep losses from being worse. At first markets reacted with enthusiasm, but that deal did not last long enough to even write out the details. 
The European leaders had drastically underestimated the problem and misunderstood the risk that fears of default would spread to other countries.
Within weeks, it became clear that 2011 would be remembered as the year that governments lost their credibility. Markets, which had always assumed that major Western governments would honor their obligations, struggled to learn to adjust to a new world where that was not so certain.
At the same time Europe was failing to come to grips with its problems, President Obama was in negotiations with Congressional Republicans over a possible deal to raise the debt ceiling and avoid an American default. In the end, there was no default, but the fact that some politicians seemed to think one was a good idea was unsettling to investors. In August, Standard & Poor's cut the country's credit rating from AAA to AA-plus.
Oddly, the downgrade of the United States seemed to help its financial markets. Whatever a rating agency might think, the United States seemed to be a bastion of safety and relative certainty. Treasury bond prices rose and yields fell. And the American stock market, while it became extremely volatile, more than held its own. Depending on what index is used, American stocks rose a little or fell a little during the year, although they ended lower than they had been when the European leaders announced their Brussels agreement. The MSCI index for the United States ended with a 2 percent rise.
Late in the year, Europe tried again to find a way out of its financial morass, and may have done a better job. The European Central Bank offered unlimited three-year loans to European banks, which seemed to be willing to take the money -- at a 1 percent interest rate -- and buy government securities that will mature before the central bank's loan must be repaid. In the final week of the year, Italian debt auctions produced rates of 3.2 percent on six-month bills, but more than double that for 10-year-bonds. European share prices seemed to stabilize.
The accompanying charts document the trend in share prices for the world and for 12 stock markets, using MSCI indexes to assure comparability, and document how the investment world changed as it became clear that the July 21 Brussels accord had accomplished little. The indexes include reinvested dividends, and are all calculated in dollars. The countries shown are six nations in the euro zone, the area most directly affected by the European deliberations, and six other major markets around the world.
On July 22, the day after the Brussels accord, the MSCI world index -- which includes markets in all developed economies but not in emerging markets like China -- was up 7.1 percent since the end of 2010. Even poor Greece had a stock market that was almost even for the year, thanks to a 7.5 percent rise on that day.
As the year neared an end, the Greek market was down more than 60 percent. From its 2007 high, the market has lost 92 percent of its value. From top to bottom during the Great Depression, the Dow Jones industrial average fell just 89 percent.
The pain was also intense in other European countries. In all of the other five euro zone countries shown -- Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal -- prices declined significantly after that July meeting. Germany, the dominant economy in Europe, and the one that did the most to keep the bailout packages from growing too large, suffered the most. Italy, down 19.5 percent after the meeting, did the best.
Outside the euro zone, the loss of confidence also echoed. India's stock market lost nearly a third of its value after the summit meeting, and China's fell by nearly 20 percent. The losses in the United States, Britain and Japan were smaller.
The rise in volatility was even more impressive. The charts show the proportion of trading days in each market in which prices either rose or fell at least 2 percent during the day. For the world as a whole, the proportion went from 1 percent in the months before the summit meeting to more than a quarter of the days after that. In Germany, about one day in two exceeded that threshold after the meeting.
When the euro was created in 1999, Europeans voiced hope that a common currency would help the Continent reassert its economic influence in the world. In 2011 that happened, although not in the way the creators of the euro had envisioned.

HEADLINE: A Queens Woman Begins Her Third Career, as a Designer

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
A dream can be deferred for only so long.
When Bertha Astor, 48, left her native Puerto Rico to move to New York at 27, she had a degree in biology from Pontifical Catholic University, she said. She spent a decade putting that education to good use, working as a laboratory technician at pharmaceuticals companies. Later, she obtained a certificate in office administration and spent a decade in jobs in that field.
But childhood memories of helping her mother -- a clerk who made clothes and sometimes sold them -- sew buttons onto dresses still loomed large. And the body-hugging dresses that her grandmother Consuela, a professional seamstress, made for Ms. Astor's Saturday nights on the town stayed on her mind.
''I always have the dream to come up with fashion,'' Ms. Astor said. But, she said, ''The resources for me to pursue a dream as a fashion designer -- it was nearly impossible in Puerto Rico.'' 
Sober work as a lab assistant and an administrative assistant were the only jobs available to her, she said. With a new life to scrape together when she and her husband, Jose Olivar, now 49, moved to New York as newlyweds, who could afford to dream of runways and ruching?
''I did it for the love of money back then,'' Ms. Astor said of her career path. ''I wasn't passionate about it.'' But she added, ''I have to survive.'' Couture it was not, but at least she had financial security, for a while. She was laid off from her job as an executive assistant at Beth Israel Medical Center in 2008, she said, and has found only temporary or part-time work since.
But Ms. Astor, who seems to grow younger by 30 years when she speaks of the masters of the craft she loves -- like Carolina Herrera, whose elegant aesthetic she adores; or her fashion idol, Ralph Lauren, whom she admires for being a self-made man -- saw a silver brocade lining.
At 47, Ms. Astor at last went to fashion school. ''I said, 'If I don't step forward for what I really want, I'm not going to be able to do it ever,' '' she said. ''I said, 'Well, this is my time; I'm going to do it now, and nobody is going to stop it.' ''
Her husband supported her. ''You have to pursue your passion before life runs out,'' said Mr. Olivar, who was laid off from his job as an electronics technician four years ago and has become a self-employed videographer.
Unemployment payments of $94 a week and income from her husband's event-based video business tided her over during her studies at Wood Tobe-Coburn School in Manhattan. In addition, Ms. Astor took out a loan to pay for school.
While attending classes full time, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., she took on a night job, working after school, sometimes four days a week, but still managed to do her homework.
''I was getting home at midnight and sketching to 3 o'clock in the morning,'' she said. Ms. Astor, the oldest person in her classes by decades (classmates called her ''Mama Bertha,'' she said), flourished, obtaining a 3.87 grade point average and winning design competitions, including one for the perfect little black dress. A draped sleeveless number with Cleopatraesque brocade detailing, it is proudly displayed on a dress form in her basement apartment in Corona, Queens.
Ms. Astor graduated in January. Afterward, it was back to sending out hundreds of resumes for jobs in her old field, coupled with frantic work to create her first collection: 20 fall pieces, like a houndstooth-lined swing coat with a pilgrim collar, an iridescent reversible kimono and a vermillion silk Shantung blazer with matching bloomers -- all sewed herself on her tiny Kenmore machine.
For the first time, however, the jobs did not immediately come. In late summer, her unemployment benefits ran out. By September, she was in arrears in rent on the $1,000-a-month apartment that she and her husband shared with Mya, their miniature Doberman pinscher, and Cholita, a Boston terrier they rescued last year.
A social worker at a hospital where she once worked told her of Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The agency gave Ms. Astor $400 from the fund to help with her back rent. It was enough to stabilize her life.
In October, Ms. Astor started a job as a practice secretarial associate at a hospital in Queens. But each night in her basement apartment-cum-design studio, she sews and dreams of her ultimate fantasy, a runway show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, and of her next step, a brick-and-mortar shop.
And one day, perhaps, sartorial success on par with her hero, Mr. Lauren? ''He started from nothing,'' she said. ''If he started from nothing, why wouldn't I?''

HEADLINE: Where the Republican Candidates Stand on Key Issues

 BODY:
Abortion
The candidates all profess opposition to abortion rights, but there are distinctions. Several have signed a pledge that requires appointment only of those with anti-abortion views to key government posts. Others have declined. Some favor allowing abortion in cases of rape and incest.
''The Republican Party cannot get the issue of life wrong. It's a seminal issue.'' Mrs. Bachmann Dec. 15, 2011
To put rape or incest victims ''through another trauma of an abortion, I think is too much to ask.'' Mr. Santorum Aug. 11, 2011
Taxes and Spending 
All but Mr. Huntsman have signed the pledge not to raise taxes. Most want to make the income tax flatter, and reduce corporate taxes. Several have expressed approval for a consumption or value-added tax. All want deep spending cuts and rapid progress toward a balanced budget.
''For middle-income Americans, no tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. Let people save their money the way they think is best.'' Mr. Romney Sept. 12, 2011
''I wouldn't hesitate to call on a sacrifice from all of our people, even those at the very highest end of the income spectrum.'' Mr. Huntsman Aug. 25, 2011
Regulation
Republicans have sought to portray regulations created or supported by the Obama administration as choking off growth, suggesting that the president is hostile to the private sector. They have taken aim in particular at the Environmental Protection Agency and at banking regulations.
''If they want to really change things, the first person to fire is Bernanke, who is a disastrous chairman of the Federal Reserve.'' Mr. Gingrich Oct. 11, 2011
''And that's what we need to be focusing on in this country, freeing up the small-businessmen and women to do what they know how to do.'' Mr. Perry Sept. 12, 2011
Entitlements
With fiscal pressures intensifying, most candidates call for Medicaid block grants to states, and for Social Security personal accounts for younger workers.On Medicare, several have endorsed Representative Paul D. Ryan's plan to encourage retirees to buy private insurance.
''Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids, and it's not right.'' Mr. Perry Sept. 7, 2011
''If you're younger and you would like a personal account, you would control it instead of the politicians. And you know you'll have more money at the end of your lifetime.'' Mr. Gingrich Sept. 7, 2010
Afghanistan
President George W. Bush adhered to an aggressive foreign policy of confronting enemies overseas. That kind of thinking remains the default party platform, but with increasing public restiveness and the rise of the Tea Party, a strain of conservative isolationism is gaining greater voice.
''I stand up and say that when we engage in Iraq and Afghanistan,we engage because we want to be successful.We want victory.'' Mr. Santorum Aug. 28, 2011
''Our nation has done its duty. After 6,000 lives lost and more than $1 trillion spent, it is time to bring our brave troops home.'' Mr. Huntsman Oct. 11, 2011
Torture
There is a divide on water boarding: A few say it is torture and illegal, some say the United States should not do it but it may not be torture, and others say it is legal and should be used.
''This is war.... I am for using the techniques, not torture, but using those techniques that we know will extract the information to save young American lives.'' Mr. Perry Nov. 13, 2011
''It's illegal under international law and under our law. It's also immoral, and it's also very impractical.'' Mr. Paul Nov. 20, 2011
Iran
When it comes to Iran and Israel, most of the candidates are stridently interventionist against Iran, and unequivocally protective of Israel. But Mr. Paul's status among the front-runners in Iowa has set off a debate that has stirred historic isolationist strains in the party.
''We should be planning a strike against their facilities and say, 'If you do not ... close them down, we will close them down for you.'''Mr. Santorum Dec. 15, 2011
''The greatest danger is overreacting. That's how we got into that useless war in Iraq.'' Mr. Paul Dec. 15, 2011
Energy and the Environment
Remove impediments to energy development, open more domestic areas to drilling, let markets decide the fate of alternative energy sources.
Global warming science is ''one contrived phony mess that is falling apart under its own weight.'' Mr. Perry ''Fed Up: Our Fight to Save America from Washington''
''Cap and trade was an effort by the left to use the environment as an excuse to get total control over the American economy, centralizing a Washington bureaucracy. Mr. Gingrich Dec. 6, 2011
Immigration
There is a near consensus among Republicans on the need for more border security, but disagreement on the specifics. All say they are against amnesty, but there is a range of positions on whether to deport illegal immigrants already here and on what benefits should be granted to children.
''What do you do with the human beings who are engaged, some of whom are married, have children? It's a very complicated situation.'' Mr. Gingrich March 1, 2011
''As president of the United States, every mile, every yard, every foot, every inch will be covered on that southern border.'' Mrs. Bachmann Aug. 16, 2011
MICHELE Bachmann
Mrs. Bachmann opposes abortion in all cases as well as embryonic stem cell research. She supports ''personhood''f or embryos, which might outlaw some birth control methods. She signed a pledge to appoint only anti-abortion officials to key health and justice agencies
Mrs. Bachmann wants a minimum income tax, noting that half of the American people pay none. She has pledged to reject new taxes, opposes inheritance taxes and wants corporate tax rates reduced to 20 percent. She opposes a value added tax, and has said she wants to flatten income tax rates.
Mrs. Bachmann believes regulations are a major impediment to job creation, and has called for sweeping rollbacks,including closing the Environmental Protection Agency. She voted against minimum-wage increases and unemployment-benefit extensions.
Mrs. Bachmann has continued to favor the Ryan plan. She argues for an ''ownership society,'' criticizing those who promise to take ''care of people's prescription drugs, their retirement, their health care, their housing, their food.'' She says Social Security must be changed, but not for those over 55.
Mrs. Bachmann, in spite of her Tea Party credentials, remains mainly an advocate of the interventionist doctrine advocated by Mr. Bush. ''If we pull out now, we could cause all of the advances we've made to collapse,'' she said in June.
Mrs. Bachmann criticized Mr. Obama for closing ''black site'' C.I.A. detention facilities abroad and accuses the administration of turning interrogation of suspected terrorists ''over to the A.C.L.U.'' She said waterboarding is not torture and had resulted in useful information.
Mrs. Bachmann said Iran would ''without a shadow of a doubt'' attack Israel if it got a nuclear weapon and she has criticized Mr. Obama as not being a strong enough supporter of Israel.
Mrs. Bachmann opposes cap-and-trade legislation, and has been a vocal advocate of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. She voted to open the outer continental shelf to offshore oil drilling and voted against a 2007 bill to create incentives for alternative energy.
Mrs. Bachmann advocates a double fence on ''every inch'' of the Mexican border and calls extension of benefits like college tuition to illegal immigrants madness. She has suggested that anything less than deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants would be ''amnesty.''
NEWT Gingrich
Mr. Gingrich favors ending financing for Planned Parenthood, and he has signed the pledge to appoint only anti-abortion officials. But Mrs. Bachmann criticized him for saying years ago that he would support colleagues who voted against banning late-pregnancy abortions.
The Bush tax cuts should be made permanent instead of expiring in 2013, Mr. Gingrich says. Corporate taxes should go down to 12.5 percent, and capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes should be eliminated. Mr. Gingrich has also said the country should ''move toward an optional flat tax of 15 percent.''
Mr. Gingrich has always been highly rated by business groups, with a perfect rating from the Chamber of Commerce in 1997. Like his Republican opponents, he favors repeal of Dodd-Frank banking reform, and has said Ben S. Bernanke should be fired.
Mr. Gingrich's 1994 ''Contract With America'' proposed deep entitlement cuts. A labor-backed advocacy group for retirees gave him a zero rating in 1997, while the conservative 60-Plus Association gave him 100. He would allow people to choose a personal account and sees ''no need'' to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Gingrich criticized Mr. Obama's troop drawdown because it was not supported by military leaders, and not considered in the context of the larger, long-term war on Islamic extremism that Mr. Gingrich foresees.
Mr. Gingrich said in 2009 that he was not sure whether waterboarding was torture, but it was ''something we shouldn't do.'' More recently, he seemed to change his mind, saying it was not technically torture and could be used if the president specifically authorized it.
Mr. Gingrich has called for a covert war on Iran's nuclear capability, including assassination of scientists, saying ''we will not tolerate an Iranian nuclear weapon.''
Mr. Gingrich once argued for a cap-and-trade system to limit carbon, and made a promotional advertisement in 2008 with Representative Nancy Pelosi to urge solutions to global warming. He now calls that ad a mistake and opposed the 2009 cap-and-trade bill. He has called for replacing the E.P.A.
Mr. Gingrich has called for ''100 percent control'' of the Mexican border, using the National Guard. But he has also said: ''We are not going to deport 11 million people. There has to be some zone between deportation and amnesty.''
JON M. Huntsman Jr.
Mr. Huntsman has maintained a consistent record opposing abortion, and favors a constitutional amendment to ban it. He does not favor, as some do, outlawing abortion even for cases of rape or incest, and has declined to sign the pledge
Mr. Huntsman has said high earners should make sacrifices, and suggested Medicare and Social Security be reduced for those making more. Income should be taxed in three brackets, and loopholes and subsidies eliminated. He has declined to sign tax and balanced-budget pledges.
Mr. Huntsman has said the big banks should be broken up. Six banks in the country are so big ''they have an implied bailout by the taxpayers in this country, and that means that we are setting ourselves up for disaster again.''
In the Nov. 13 debate, Mr. Huntsman explicitly expressed approval for the Ryan plan to curb the growth of Medicare.
Mr. Huntsman has said flatly that ''it is time to bring our troops home'' from Afghanistan.
Mr. Huntsman said waterboarding is torture, and when we do it, ''we lose that ability to project values that a lot of people are still relying on the United States to stand up for.''
Mr. Huntsman has said that preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons is ''an example of when I would use American force.''
Mr. Huntsman makes the case that the real cost of foreign oil should take in the amount spent on the military to get the oil here: ''When you factor in deployments to the Middle East, when you factor in keeping the sea lanes open it is $13 a gallon,'' he said.
Mr. Huntsman has said the idea of a fence ''repulses'' him, but it is probably necessary. He has also said he favors a path to citizenship for those already here. ''There's got to be an alternative rather than sending people back. That's unrealistic,'' he told a town meeting in New Hampshire in May.
RON Paul
Mr. Paul opposes abortion, and in fact sponsored federal ''personhood'' legislation, but he has taken fire from some anti-abortion activists for saying that only the states should enforce laws against abortion. He has signed the pledge to appoint only those with anti-abortion views to key positions.
Mr. Paul wants to abolish the income tax and the Internal Revenue Service and make deep cuts in federal spending, including military spending. He said he would vote for the FairTax.
Mr. Paul has solid pro-business credentials, with a lifetime rating of 87 percent from the Club for Growth, and as a libertarian consistently argues for private job creation and against government involvement in business.
Mr. Paul has argued that young people should be allowed to withdraw from Social Security and make their own investments.
Mr. Paul is deeply critical of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has advocated vastly reducing American military spending overseas. He has also criticized the war on terror, and the killing of American citizens like Anwar al-Awlaki, which puts him at odds with his colleagues.
Mr. Paul said flatly that waterboarding is torture, and illegal.
Mr. Paul's isolationism contrasts him with his opponents no more starkly than on the issue of Iran. Alone among the major candidates, he has explicitly opposed attacking Iran in the name of nuclear antiproliferation or Israeli security.
Mr. Paul generally opposes federal regulation, although he has backed some tax incentives for clean energy. He supports Arctic drilling, but not tax breaks for oil and gas companies. He is skeptical about climate change.
Mr. Paul has called for recalling the military from overseas and employing troops to patrol the border with Mexico. He has said he opposes a border fence.
RICK Perry
Mr. Perry has said abortion should be illegal except in cases of rape, incest or the health of the woman, but recently announced that it should be outlawed even in rape and incest cases, a position similar to Mr. Santorum's.
Mr. Perry's plan calls for a flat income tax rate of 20 percent that preserves popular deductions for mortgage interest, taxes and contributions for those making less than $500,000. Corporate tax rates would drop to 20 percent. Taxes on Social Security benefits and long-term capital gains would be eliminated.
Mr. Perry favors fostering small business with tax and regulatory policy; he has suggested the Federal Reserve has been acting for partisan ends, an action he termed ''almost treasonous.'' He has said he favors a balanced-budget amendment.
Mr. Perry has famously described Social Security as a Ponzi scheme, saying ''it's a monstrous lie to our kids.'' But, he said, people ''moving toward'' Social Security age should get their benefits. He backs Medicaid block grants and has suggested raising the eligibility age for both Social Security and Medicare.
Mr. Perry said troops should be brought home ''as soon and as safely as we can,'' distinguishing himself from Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Paul. But, sounding more like Mr. Bush, he also said, ''Most Americans realize the need to combat terror on their turf, not ours.''
Mr. Perry said in the foreign policy debate on Nov. 13 that he was not against using ''those techniques that we know will extract information.'' He did not say if waterboarding was one of those techniques.
Mr. Perry has expressed deep skepticism of global warming science. He made a plan to invigorate energy exploration in this country a centerpiece of his jobs plan, saying there are proven but untapped resources to make the country independent.
Mr. Perry has alienated his Tea Party base with this issue. He is against a 2,000-mile fence: Building a 30-foot-high wall, he said, improves the ''35-foot ladder business.'' More critically, Mr. Perry has defended a Texas law that lets some children of illegal immigrants qualify for in-state tuition to state colleges.
MITT Romney
Mr. Romney supported abortion rights before becoming the governor of Massachusetts, but changed his position after a debate in the legislature on embryonic stem cells. He would not sign the pledge to make anti-abortion views a litmus test for presidential appointees in key agencies.
Mr. Romney has praised consumption taxation, but opposes the Fair Tax because it reduces taxes on the highest and lowest income, but increases taxes on the middle. He has proposed eliminating all taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest. He has also signed the cut, cap and balance pledge.
Mr. Romney has said regulations impose a huge hidden tax on business, and that President Obama has allowed many new ones to be enacted. Those would be rolled back, he said, if he was elected.
Mr. Romney has said that ''current seniors'' and those near retirement should not have their benefits reduced. He would like to return Medicaid to the states, and the Medicare plan he unveiled this spring was similar to the Ryan plan, including a voucher-like system.
Mr. Romney has not taken a strong position, saying ''it's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can,'' but quickly adding, ''as soon as our generals think it's O.K.'' He did not criticize the president's decision to remove some troops last summer, as some did.
In 2007, Mr. Romney declined to say whether he would allow use of waterboarding. But after a debate in November, his spokeswoman said that he did not believe waterboarding is torture, and Mr. Romney said the same thing when asked about it by reporters.
The United States should use sanctions and support of insurgents to halt Iran's quest for a nuclear bomb, but if those do not work, ''of course you take military action,'' Mr. Romney said.
In Massachusetts, Mr. Romney proposed plans for reducing carbon emissions, and explored creation of a regional cap-and-trade program, an idea he now opposes. He said he supports the E.P.A. ''in much of its mission.'' He has said he believes the world is getting warmer, but he is not sure it is man-made.
Mr. Romney is pro-fence, and critical of the Perry-approved tuition breaks for illegal immigrants in Texas. He has also said, ''we cannot give amnesty to those who have come here illegally.'' In previous years, however, he has said he favored a path to citizenship for illegal residents.
RICK Santorum
Mr. Romney supported abortion rights before becoming the governor of Massachusetts, but changed his position after a debate in the legislature on embryonic stem cells. He would not sign the pledge to make anti-abortion views a litmus test for presidential appointees in key agencies.
Mr. Santorum would lock in place the current, low capital gains and dividend rates, while cutting corporate income tax rates immediately in half, and for manufacturers, he would completely eliminate corporate income taxes.
Mr. Santorum has said that he would repeal all regulations imposed under Mr. Obama that cost businesses more than $100 million, ''so business can get going in this country.''
Mr. Santorum supports giving younger workers a choice to put payroll taxes into private accounts, while safeguarding the benefits of those who are now retirement age. He praised the Ryan Medicare plan.
Mr. Santorum has said the United States should not leave Afghanistan until the Taliban has been ''neutered.'' He opposes a timetable for withdrawal.
Mr. Santorum said that Guantanamo must remain open, and enhanced interrogation techniques must continue to be employed because they have ''been proven to be successful in gathering information.''
Mr. Santorum has noted that Iran has ''been at war with us since 1979.'' He said the Iranians had manufactured devices that had killed hundreds in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they planned an attack on the Saudi ambassador here. He said military action against Iran could not be taken ''off the table.''
Mr. Santorum voted against the ban on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He has said he differs from opponents because he wants all energy subsidies eliminated. ''Let the market work, as opposed to creating incentives for different forms of energy that the government supports,'' he said.
Mr. Santorum has said the fence should be finished, but also that mass deportations are not the answer. ''Until we build that border, we should neither have storm troopers come in and throw people out of the country nor should we provide amnesty,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New Hampshire Focus for Huntsman

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSCAWEN, N.H. -- Jon M. Huntsman Jr. glanced around at New Hampshire's barren political landscape. ''It's wonderfully empty,'' he said with a grin.
That was certainly true in this tiny town, where Mr. Huntsman had just emerged from a leisurely tour of a belt factory. He, his wife and a daughter had time to learn perhaps more than they ever wanted to know about belt making.
Mr. Huntsman, 51, a former governor of Utah and former ambassador to China, is the only Republican presidential candidate campaigning in New Hampshire right now. While the rest of the pack feeds on itself in Iowa, which votes Tuesday, Mr. Huntsman has spurned that state. ''They pick corn in Iowa,'' he says, ''but they actually pick presidents here in New Hampshire.'' 
He ignored Iowa not so much by choice but imperative. His strategy is based on the theory that the independents who can vote in New Hampshire's Republican primary will be more hospitable to him than the conservatives and evangelicals who dominate the Iowa caucuses. Independents make up 40 percent of registered voters here.
New Hampshire voters, he said in an interview, ''speak to a broad-based electability.''
The conundrum for the low-key Mr. Huntsman is that he is perceived as a moderate, and while he is banking on that perception to some extent, he also rejects it. And so the picture is a bit scrambled.
His television ads call him a ''consistent conservative.'' He does oppose abortion rights and support gun rights, but he does not mention those things. Nor does he mention that he was appointed ambassador by President Obama.
His wife, Mary Kaye, told workers on the factory floor here that he was perceived as a moderate because of his temperament, not his voting record.
Instead of focusing on ideology, Mr. Huntsman has warmed to his identity as the Man Who Would Dare Skip Iowa. How that state votes, he said, ''doesn't really matter.''
Actually, both Iowa and New Hampshire have spotty records in picking the party's eventual nominee. But Mr. Huntsman is enjoying a moment in the sun, such as it is, soaking up some of the bandwidth that will no doubt be diverted once the hordes arrive on Wednesday.
He drew more than 200 people Thursday night to a rally in Wolfeboro, where Mitt Romney, the front-runner in New Hampshire, owns a vacation home.
But Mr. Romney showed just how temporary Mr. Huntsman's moment may be, when he flew back from Iowa on Friday for a quick toe touch. At a spaghetti dinner in Merrimack, Mr. Romney, who is courting the same independent voters here as Mr. Huntsman, drew a few hundred people, both inside and out, and a swarm of news media.
Still, Mr. Huntsman can cite some recent progress in the polls. He inched up to 12 percent in Thursday's Public Policy Polling. That survey put him roughly even with Newt Gingrich, whose fortunes have been sinking while Ron Paul's have been rising. Mr. Romney maintains the lead, according to the survey, with 36 percent.
Mr. Huntsman's supporters have made a relatively substantial purchase of television ad time. Our Destiny, a political action committee working on his behalf, bought more than $70,000 of time in the last week, according to Kantar Media. (In that same period, Mr. Paul spent about $47,000, while Mr. Romney spent $41,000.) The PAC increased its buy significantly this week to $300,000 for a new ad that says Mr. Romney will say anything and urges voters to ''stop the chameleon.''
Mr. Huntsman's main message is that the United States is not living up to its potential.
''We're in a funk, we're dispirited and this isn't who we are as Americans,'' he told workers here.
But he offered few details on how to ''break out of the box,'' as he put it.
''I'm not going to bluster you with 100 things I think we can get done,'' he said, saying he would restore the economy and trust in the nation's institutions.
He concluded with a reminder that he was here when others were not.
''You've got to meet folks, they have to feel who you are inside or they can't make a proper or a fair judgment,'' he said. ''So when you see us running around, all I want you to do is remember that he's that guy who came in and asked for my vote.''

HEADLINE: A Thought on Debt History

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Is this era different. 

 BODY:
One thing that apparently comes as a surprise to many people who love to intone about what history tells us about the dangers of debt is the fact that Britain has had remarkably high public debt relative to GDP for most of its modern history. But here's a question: how relevant are these historical debt levels to current concerns?
Leave on one side the notion that the discipline of capital markets is somehow a new thing. The point that occurred to me is that since the real burden of debt is the possible distortionary effect of the taxes that must be levied to service that debt, it probably matters that both taxation and spending were very different in the 19th century, or even in the interwar period, than they are now.
These differences cut both ways.
On one side, government was much smaller in bygone days, and the level of taxation required to pay for things other than debt service was correspondingly low. Now, the distortionary effects of taxation, at least according to standard Econ 101, are nonlinear in the tax rate: going from 40 to 45 creates a much bigger deadweight loss than going from 10 to 15. So this would seem to suggest that other things equal, the small governments of the 19th century should have been more able than the big governments of today to handle high levels of debt.
But other things aren't equal. Modern governments have a much broader tax base than governments of yore; instead of relying on tariffs and maybe land taxes, they have income taxes, payroll taxes, and VATs. This allows the Nordic countries, for example, to finance very generous welfare states with remarkable ease. So the improved "technology" of tax collection arguably offsets the fact that we start from higher levels of taxes, and may well make it possible for us to handle higher levels of debt than our great-great grandfathers.
In the specific case of the United States, the obvious point is that we start from much lower taxation than many other advanced countries; so we really shouldn't be worried about the slightly higher share of GDP that we will have to collect to service the debt run up during the crisis.
But the general point is that one needs to be careful in using historical debt levels; they remain highly suggestive, and I for one won't stop citing them, but this era is different, in at least two ways.

HEADLINE: Office Owners and Cleaners Reach a Deal, Averting a Strike

BYLINE: SARAH MASLIN NIR


HIGHLIGHT: The office cleaners' union had threatened to strike at midnight but was able to agree on a tentative four-year contract. 

 BODY:
The union representing some 22,000 cleaners and other workers at 1,500 New York City office buildings has reached a tentative deal with the building owners, averting a possible strike.
With the owners pressing for a permanent two-tiered wage system and demanding that workers contribute toward their health benefits, the union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, had threatened to strike when the old contract expired, at midnight on New Year's Eve.
But in negotiations that concluded late Friday night, the building owners and operators, represented by the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, agreed to retain employer-paid health care coverage and to increase the workers' wages by 5.6 percent over the four years of the new contract.
"We're very happy with this agreement," said Matt Nerzig, a spokesman for the union, which represents workers at buildings in all five boroughs. "It protects the lower-middle-class jobs, and that's what we set out to do. It gets workers money over each of the four years; it helps them to keep pace with the cost of living in New York."
The union did make a concession on the wage issue, however. The owners, claiming a high vacancy rate of office space and significantly lower rents since 2007, had fought for a two-tier wage system, under which new employees would be paid less than existing employees. Under Friday's agreement, new workers would be paid 25 percent less than the standard salary for 21 months; their salaries would rise to full pay after 42 months, which was in line with agreements from past years, according to Mr. Nerzig.
Under the old contract, new workers were paid 20 percent less than the full salary for 30 months.
The agreement, which must still be ratified by the union members, would raise the average wage from about $47,000, increasing it incrementally over the last three of the contract's four years. There would be no wage increase in 2012, though workers would receive a $600 bonus that year and a second one, of $500, in 2013.
Among other demands by the owners was the elimination of automatic contributions, in each paycheck, to the union's political action fund. That demand was dropped.
The previous contract was signed in 2007, when the city's real estate market was at its height, and in negotiations the owners cited the severe recession that followed in making their case for concessions. The market, however, has recovered substantially.
In a statement, Howard Rothschild, president of the Realty Advisory Board, praised the deal. "The agreement protects workers' wages and benefits," he said, "and provides crucial cost savings to building owners, who have been battered in this deep recession."

HEADLINE: Man Accused of Driving Drunk With Son in Back Seat

BYLINE: AL BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: A New Jersey man, who told the police he was a whistle-blower in a lawsuit against a utility company, was arrested on Staten Island on Friday. 

 BODY:
A New Jersey man who was pulled over and arrested on Staten Island on Friday night was accused of driving drunk across the Outerbridge Crossing from New Jersey with his 4-year-old son in the back seat of his vehicle, the police said.
The man, Stuart Stott, 42, of Atlantic Highlands, N.J., was charged under a New York State law making it a felony for anyone to drive drunk with a child in their car, said Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the police of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Mr. Stott's blood-alcohol level was "in excess of twice the legal limit" of 0.08, Mr. Della Fave said, adding that Mr. Stott was given a breath analysis test. Among the charges lodged against him were aggravated driving while intoxicated and endangering the welfare of a child, Mr. Della Fave said. On Saturday, he was being held awaiting arraignment.
According to Mr. Della Fave, Mr. Stott told the police that he was a "whistle-blower" in a lawsuit against P.S.E.&G., the New Jersey power company.
On Dec. 20, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark, a Stuart Stott and two other former employees of P.S.E.&G. filed a suit in Essex County Superior Court claiming that they had been wrongfully dismissed after complaining that the company had misused money, an accusation the company strongly denied.
When asked about Mr. Stott's involvement in the lawsuit, his wife, Maggie McGuire, said she was "not at liberty to say" and referred questions to his lawyer, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Stott, who said he had been at Yankee Stadium on Friday for the Pinstripe Bowl between Rutgers and Iowa State, told the police that he had consumed five or six beers at the game, Mr. Della Fave said. He said he had programmed his home address into his vehicle's navigation system, Mr. Della Fave said, and then followed its directions even after he realized that it had taken him off course.
About 9 p.m. on Friday, several 911 calls were made about a "guy driving erratically" on Route 440 in New Jersey, Mr. Della Fave said. Because those notifications are routed to all surrounding police agencies, Officer Jerome Crimi of the Port Authority police heard them and began to calculate where the driver might be.
Officer Crimi headed from Staten Island toward the Outerbridge Crossing "to be in the best place to intercept" the driver, Mr. Della Fave said, adding, "Sure enough, here comes the 2004 four-door gray Volvo that everyone is calling about." The officer tried to pull the driver over, but the vehicle stopped in the roadway. The officer, on his public address system, then directed the driver to keep going to a safety zone just beyond the toll plaza on the Staten Island side of the bridge.
Mr. Stott's son was in a booster seat in the back seat and asleep, Mr. Della Fave said.
Officers contacted Mr. Stott's wife, who picked up the boy. Reached by telephone on Saturday, Ms. McGuire declined to comment about the arrest. She said her husband was unemployed and looking for a job.
The law that created stiffer penalties for drunken driving with young passengers, which went into effect in December 2009, is known as Leandra's Law. It is named for Leandra Rosado, an 11-year-old girl from Manhattan who was killed in a crash on the West Side Highway in October 2009.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Gone Negative

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: In Iowa, Newt Gingrich faces a barrage of attack ads from a "super PAC" and watches his numbers slip as aides urge him to fight back. 

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
For three weeks, Newt Gingrich has faced a barrage of negative ads in Iowa, attacking him for being fined for ethics violations in Congress, for his position on illegal immigration and more. It's not Mitt Romney's campaign behind the onslaught, though, but a "super PAC,"Nicholas Confessore and Jim Rutenberg report.

        
Bombarded with attack ads, Mr. Gingrich is slipping in the polls just days before the Iowa caucuses, prompting some of his advisers to urge him to retract his vow to stay positive and fight back, Trip Gabriel reports.

        
While support for gay rights is growing, President Obama has been hesitant to engage in a debate that helps Republicans bring religious voters to the polls during an election year. Instead, he has let surrogates like Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton speak out for gay rights on behalf of his administration, Mark Landler reports.

        
Usually exuding a nothing-bothers-me attitude, Mr. Gingrich broke character on Friday when he broke down in Iowa while recalling his mother's illness, Michael D. Shear reports. Whether the emotional moment helps Mr. Gingrich reconnect with voters as he slides in the polls remains to be seen.

        
Mr. Obama agreed on Friday to wait a few days to ask Congress to increase the debt limit, giving lawmakers time to return from recess and express their opinions on the request - even if it will be difficult to block it, Mark Landler reports.
Weekly Address:

        
Mr. Obama called 2011 "a time of great challenge and great progress" in his weekly address, citing an eventful year for foreign policy, national security and the economy. But though he said there will be more challenges in 2012, Mr. Obama said he has hope because Americans made their voices heard during the recent debate over extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. "More than anything else, you are the ones who make me hopeful about 2012," he said. "Because we've got some difficult debates and some tough fights to come."

HEADLINE: Romney Focuses on Obama Before Leaving New Hampshire

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney heads back to Iowa for a final pre-caucuses swing after a quick jaunt to New Hampshire. 

 BODY:
 HAMPTON, N.H. - Holding one last event in New Hampshire before bolting back to Iowa, Mitt Romney drew a few hundred people to the Old Salt restaurant here on the seacoast. 
 He gave a quick version of his stump speech, answered a few questions and spent lots of time glad-handing old friends in the restaurant, cozy on a rainy night. Two pillars of the state's Republican establishment, former Gov. John Sununu and former Senator Judd Gregg, introduced him.
 In his speech, Mr. Romney looked past the primary and toward the November election against President Obama. He said he had been asked recently how Mr. Obama will be remembered in history.
 "As a footnote," Mr. Romney said.
 He said the president did not understand America and had made the mistake of looking to Europe for guidance. He took him to task for his health care program and for "stacking" the National Labor Relations Board "with labor stooges that say to Boeing you can't build a factory in South Carolina because it's not a union state."
 The audience applauded heartily.
 "I don't blame him for the recession," Mr. Romney added, "but I blame him for keeping it going for so long." He said the nation's median income had dropped 10 percent in the last four years.
 Calling Mr. Obama a failure, he added: "I don't think he's a bad guy; I just think he's overwhelmed and is in over his head."
 Mr. Romney was pressed in a crush of people seeking his autograph and photographs with him.
 "What you have just seen is a phenomenon," said George Denoncourt, president of a North Hampton research institute, who attended the event.
 "Everyone senses the victory," he said. "This didn't happen with George Bush or John McCain. Everybody now wants to be seen with Romney."
 Joe Higgins, one of the owners of the restaurant, estimated that more than 400 people had packed inside to see Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: In Des Moines, Seeking the Pulse of the People and Finding a Hall of Mirrors

BYLINE: MARK LEIBOVICH


HIGHLIGHT: Iowa's crazy season, which comes every four years, culminates on Tuesday with the caucuses. But before that, a drink. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES - "The only people the pundits listen to is each other," Rick Santorum, a Republican presidential candidate, said on Friday at Legends American Grill in Marshalltown, Iowa.
Fifty miles from where Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, was declaring this, the City Center Lounge at the Marriott in downtown Des Moines was opening for its second night of brisk business. By 11:30 p.m., the lobby bar was hopping with about 100 people, nearly all of them journalists, consultants, political tourists or various hangers-on, according to an imprecise census taken by a reporter.
"Is the comparison to the 'Star Wars' bar scene a cliche?" Doug Heye, a Republican consultant, asked as he surveyed the room from a far corner.
Yes, but whatever. It has been a long day; we'll take the cliche. The scene in the bar, which opened on Thursday to accommodate the swarms in town for Tuesday's caucuses, became a prime data point for Mr. Santorum's broader conceit: that the usual suspects of American politics operate in a well-worn feedback loop, trade in the same green room stories, follow the same Twitter feeds and traffic in the same parochial concerns and conventional wisdom that they in turn inflict on the masses.
Topics at the bar have included the apparent Iowa surge of Mr. Santorum's campaign, the presumed troubles of Representative Michele Bachmann's candidacy, the notion that former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts could easily win on Tuesday and an issue of great national urgency: the lack of in-room minibars at the Marriott.
As a corollary to the last, another abiding belief among the usual suspects is that Des Moines was in desperate need of a convenient caucus watering hole (#it'sallaboutus). Previous gathering spots like the Savery Hotel bar and the lounge at Hotel Fort Des Moines have lost their luster or closed altogether.
Construction crews worked in recent weeks to have the Marriott lobby bar ready in time. Reviews of the space, a large horseshoe-shaped bar stuck in the middle of the lobby, have been mixed ("blah," "unimaginative," "serviceable"), except that standards are modest. It exists, and that's a good thing.
"Every industry has the same type deal during big events like this," said Ray Sullivan, a top aide to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Mr. Sullivan, standing under a TV playing the end of the Insight Bowl between Iowa and Oklahoma, said a bar like this could just as easily be a social epicenter for politicos or for "a group of people who were in town for a toilet paper convention or something."
True enough, but at a toilet paper convention, it would be far less likely to see Newt Gingrich holding court, as he did on Thursday night in a far corner of the bar. His audience included the reporters Dan Balz and Karen Tumulty of The Washington Post and the columnist David Brooks of The New York Times.
Relaxed and philosophical, Mr. Gingrich launched into a lengthy treatise on the state of things interspersed with a periodic reminder - "we're off the record" - before wishing everyone well and heading up to bed.
Behind Mr. Gingrich, his wife, Callista, mingled with various clumps of consultants, campaign officials and media types seated around black marble tables and on cream-colored vinyl couches, while aides for the campaigns of Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich filled in the tables around her.
Earlier, Mitt and Ann Romney, who do not drink alcohol, darted past the scene and headed up to their room on the 30th floor.
As midnight approached, Mrs. Bachmann's spokeswoman, Alice Stewart, wondered, "Why didn't the Marriott build this a long time ago?" Ronald Brownstein of The National Journal stood a few feet away near the reception desk and recalled the glory days of the campaign watering hole.
These included spots like the old Savery down the street and the Wayfarer in Manchester, N.H., where less health- and sleep-conscious legends like R. W. Apple Jr. of The Times, Jack Germond of The Baltimore Sun and Robert Novak of The Chicago Sun-Times unwound after a long day on the trail.
"This is a metaphor for how the profession has changed," Mr. Brownstein said, describing a bygone set of political journalists who "prided themselves on their ability to outdrink a cop after a shift."
By comparison, a vast majority of bar patrons here were under 40, most imbibing delicate beverages like microbrew beers and pinot noir between BlackBerry checks. At 1 a.m., the place was emptying fast, reporters heading to bed with hopes of a morning workout before hitting the trail.

HEADLINE: The Backstory of my Column on Celebrities ... and Politicians

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: Readers comment on my column about leadership from students and Hollywood celebrities. 

 BODY:
Okay, okay, celebrities are not my thing. I have never in my life read People Magazine, and when I'm in the grocery store passing the scandal tabloids, I have to get page one nicknames translated by my kids to know who's supposedly having an affair with whom. But my Sunday column dips its toe into celebrity waters anyway.
Here's why. I've been increasingly annoyed with Congress, which seems to be more a part of America's problem than the solution. The July battle over the debt limit contributed to the crisis of confidence and undoubtedly cost us jobs. And the December ruckus over extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits was similarly absurd. Just as I was gnashing my teeth over our "leaders," I came across Angelina Jolie's new movie, which manifestly demonstrated real leadership and made no attempt to pander to lowest common denominators. And the more I thought of it, the more it seemed that there was something larger going on -- real leadership in our society is often found not among our political leaders but among university and high school students, among social entrepreneurs, or even among celebrities. Obviously that's not true of all students or all celebrities, but it's true of plenty of them. So that's the background of the column, and I'd welcome your thoughts on it.

HEADLINE: Romney Says He Would Veto the Dream Act

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney, for the first time, said that he would veto legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were brought into the country at a young age and then went on to attend college. 

 BODY:
LE MARS, Iowa - In Le Mars, Iowa, the self-proclaimed ice cream capital of the world, Mitt Romney ordered a scoop of rocky road before heading to his first campaign stop of the day, a crowded restaurant filled with more than 200 voters.
But the metaphor enthusiasts - see: rocky road - may be disappointed, because Mr. Romney did not sound like a candidate bracing for a long, hard slog. Instead, the former governor of Massachusetts sounded an enthusiastic, upbeat note, telling the crowd that, "If I'm the Republican nominee, I'll be back in Iowa to win the general election, and we will win Iowa."
"We'll go to Washington with a mandate to make sure we get this country back on the right track," he said. "I'm going to be back in Iowa."
Mr. Romney offered his usual stump speech - a focus on President Obama, with no mention of his Republican rivals - but when a voter asked him if he'd veto the Dream Act as president, Mr. Romney said, "The answer is yes."
Though Mr. Romney has previously been critical of the legislation, which would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who were brought into the country at a young age and then went on to attend college, Saturday marked the first time that he has outright declared that he would veto the legislation should it cross his desk as president.

"I'm delighted with the idea that people who come to this country and wish to serve in the military can be given a path to become permanent residents of this country," he said. "Those who serve in our military and fulfill those requirements, I respect and acknowledge that path. For those who come here illegally, the idea of giving them in-state tuition credits or other special benefits I find to be contrary to the idea of a nation of law."
He added: "If I'm the president of the United States, I want to end illegal immigration so that we can protect legal immigration. I like legal immigration."
The Democrats and Mr. Obama's re-election team pounced on the remark. David Axelrod, a former senior advisor to the president, took to Twitter to call the comments, "Wrong on principle & politics."

Mr. Romney, meanwhile, was busy criticizing Mr. Obama, describing the current state of the economy and the country as "a detour, however, not a destiny."
"We know this is a great land," he said. "That's why when the president went around at the beginning of his term and apologized for America around the world, it made us just heartsick. I will never apologize for the greatness of the United States of America."
He appeared with his youngest son, Craig, who took the microphone to recount a Romney family tradition - an annual, mini-triathlon with "a short little swim and a bike race and then a run at the end." Craig's wife had just had her second child, but decided to compete anyways.
"All the boys had finished at that point and it was down to my wife and my dad over here," the younger Mr. Romney said.
"I tripped her, I tripped her!" Mr. Romney cut in, to laughter.
In the end, the son explained, Mr. Romney came from behind to eek out his daughter-in-law - "He did almost die trying, by the way, he passed out in the lawn chair and we didn't see him the rest of the day," he quipped.
"And you see this fight to the finish, he went for this, he gave it everything he had, he gave it a good kick and he beat her in the end," he continued. "It's that type of hard work, it's that type of determination I think we need in the White House. We need someone who can go in there and solve the challenges we're facing in the country and my dad's the guy to do it."
After the Le Mars event, Mr. Romney headed to Sioux City, Iowa, to offer some New Year's Eve remarks.
"I hope I'm not the highlight of the evening," Mr. Romney joked. "That would be a pretty sad evening."
Mr. Romney's traveling press corps - for whom New Year's Eve is shaping up to be a fairly sad evening - trailed behind him in a press bus, but not before stopping at Blue Bunny to sample some of the ice cream that Mr. Romney and his son had been touting. Inside the ice cream shop, the young woman behind the counter confirmed that Mr. Romney had, in fact, ordered the rocky road.
So, pressed one reporter, had Mr. Romney sampled several flavors? Had he flipped-flopped, or was he decisive? The verdict: He knew exactly what he wanted, and went straight for the rocky road.

HEADLINE: For Romney on New Year's Eve, Quirky Questions in Sioux City

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: If a confident Mitt Romney was on display at an earlier event in Le Mars, Iowa, the voters in Sioux City got a punchy Mr. Romney. 

 BODY:
SIOUX CITY, Iowa - Mitt Romney has attacked President Obama over the economy, the military, and their differing visions for the future of the country. But there are some areas where Mr. Romney just won't go.
"You know, there are a lot of things I could blame on the president, but I'm not going to blame him for getting rid of Pop Rocks," Mr. Romney said, when a young woman at an evening event asked him if, as president, he would bring back Pop Rocks. ("If you become president, I want you to bring those back, those were good," said the woman, referring to the candy that fizzles and cracks in your mouth, and is incorrectly rumored to make your stomach explode if combined with carbonated soda).
"It's been a long time since I've had Pop Rocks," Mr. Romney said. "But I'll tell you - I'll see if we can find some more of those."

Showing a flash of his business background, Mr. Romney concluded: "I'm afraid the market just wasn't there."
The Pop Rocks question was one of several quirky queries that Mr. Romney fielded from the Sioux City crowd, just hours before the clock was set to strike midnight on New Year's Eve. The first question came from a man - later escorted from the event by police - who tried to tweak Mr. Romney about the $10,000 wager he tried to make with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas at a recent Iowa debate. The man said that gambling over $5,000 is a Class C Felony in the state, and tried to suggest that Mr. Romney might be in violation of a racketeering law.
"OK, let's find another question that's a serious question," Mr. Romney said.
If a confident Mr. Romney was on display at his earlier event in Le Mars, Iowa, the Sioux City voters got a punchy Mr. Romney.
"We should have rented a bigger room, my goodness," Mr. Romney said, upon seeing an overflow crowd."We have more people in the lobby and the buffalo room or the tree room, whatever it's called."
Eying the roomful of potential caucus-goers, Mr. Romney said, "You're kind to be here tonight on New Year's Eve," before joking: " I hope I'm not the highlight of the evening. That'd be a pretty sad evening."
Later, as he wrapped up, Mr. Romney urged: " Dance until midnight, you guys!"
