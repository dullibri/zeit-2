HEADLINE: Seeking Familiar Faces to Draw Out Those Who Have Not Sent in Census Forms

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
She would be, in the ideal view of the Census Bureau, the proverbial elegant, engaging Manhattan matron who can effortlessly cajole her way past the most imperious doorman, personally confront apartment dwellers on their threshold and persuade them to complete the 2010 census form.
 ''We do not require you to wear pearls, but if you live locally, you will have access and be accepted,'' said Marilia A. Matos, the associate director for field operations for the Census Bureau. 
 For all the contrasts among them, Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and the Upper East Side, immigrant enclaves in Brooklyn and Queens, dusty border counties of South Texas, isolated resort areas in Minnesota and Indian reservations are among the toughest places in the country both to find residents who have not returned their questionnaires and to recruit census takers charged with pursing them.
 As of Thursday, the New York City census tract with the lowest mail response rate -- 17 percent, compared with the citywide rate of 50 percent -- was 14 square blocks bounded by Fifth and Park Avenues and East 49th and East 56th Streets. The tract was home in the 2000 count to 279 people. It includes several buildings with large numbers of foreign and other part-time residents, including Olympic Tower, Park Avenue Place and Trump Tower. (For the record, Donald Trump said he had not received a questionnaire; if the bureau or the postal service missed you or your building, you can get a form by visiting 2010.census.gov or by calling (866) 872-6868. And, beginning Monday, you can complete the questionnaire by telephone.)
 In 2000, the mail return rate in that tract was 26 percent, less than half the citywide average. 
 On Wednesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Stacey Cumberbatch, the city's census coordinator, again appealed to New Yorkers to mail in their questionnaires before the April 15 deadline. 
 By neighborhood, the participation rate ranged on Wednesday from 31 percent in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to more than 62 percent in Inwood, Stuyvesant Town and northern Washington Heights in Manhattan and in Clearview and Oakland Gardens in Queens. The highest rate of any smaller tract was 80 percent in Todt Hill on Staten Island.
 While Manhattan below 96th Street usually has a better-than-average response rate, it is among the more challenging places to recruit census takers, or enumerators, as the Census Bureau refers to them. Another hard place to recruit enumerators is northwest Brooklyn, with its mix of public housing projects, gentrified brownstones and apartment buildings. 
 More than a million tested, trained, fingerprinted and paid enumerators will fan out across the country in a few weeks to find millions of residents who were mailed census forms last month but did not respond. 
 The bureau's strategy is to hire their neighbors. ''It's crystal clear that if you hire locally, you save money and get better data,'' said Robert Groves, the director of the Census Bureau. 
 ''We have areas around the country,'' Mr. Groves added, with ''populations that disproportionately have criminal histories.''
 In New York City, the bureau expects to hire as many as 1,000 enumerators for each of the city's 18 census offices; they will be paid $18.75 an hour or more. In some Manhattan neighborhoods, the hourly rate might not be enough to lure unemployed lawyers, much less society matrons, so the bureau combs community boards and civic groups. 
 ''In rich areas, believe it or not, what happens is the traditional civic participation and engagement ethic kicks in, where people view this as an opportunity to give back,'' Mr. Groves said. ''They're not volunteering. They're getting paid, but they're not doing it for the money.''
 Enumerators are told to visit each residence six times before giving up.
 ''This is not a 9-to-5 job,'' said Lester A. Farthing, the New York regional census director. ''New York has the longest commuting times in the country. People get home 8 or 9 o'clock in Elmhurst, Corona, Flushing, where people are working two or three jobs. We tell people to try until 8 or 9 p.m. if they can reasonably knock on a door without disrupting a family.''
 There are tips for finding people at home. ''One of the tricks we teach is look for window guards for children,'' Mr. Farthing said. ''You hang out between 2 and 3 p.m. and see if any kids come home.''
 And persuading New Yorkers to let a stranger in is not easy. 
 ''On Park Avenue, sometimes you get a retiree or that person who has the pearls who can talk their way past a doorman,'' Mr. Farthing said. ''Sometimes,'' he continued, ''you need a man to enumerate a man or a woman to enumerate a woman. Sometimes an African-American might not talk to a Caucasian who comes to their door in Fort Greene.'' 
 ''A face that looks like the face behind the door,'' Mr. Farthing added, ''works like a charm.''

HEADLINE: Reinvigorating An Artist's Fantasy

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
A Victorian minaret with a white crescent finial looms over flat-topped brick town houses on a sleepy side street in the Kensington district of London. The domed building is one of the world's gaudiest one-bedroom homes. 
 The English painter Frederic Leighton lived there alone for three decades, lining the walls with 16th-century Damascus tiles, olive-green silk, red flocked wallpaper, ebony cabinetry and paintings and prints by the likes of Raphael, Rembrandt, Tintoretto and Corot.
 In 1898, two years after his death, Leighton's fans turned the elaborate refuge into Leighton House Museum, but his family had already auctioned off his possessions. The museum's staff has been struggling ever since to maintain the odd-shaped building and reacquire original pieces. Last Saturday, after a two-year, $2.4 million, government-financed restoration, the museum reopened, restocked with copies and long- and short-term loans of Leighton's paintings and furnishings. 
 He was clearly obsessed with the Middle East and the Mediterranean, where he traveled, painted and collected. A bronze Icarus fills a doorway in his library, and Turkish platters glazed with teal flowers hang in niches around his crimson dining room. The museum has also upgraded the building's infrastructure, tearing out snarls of 1920s radiator pipes and repairing and regilding the dome's painted ceiling, which had been whitewashed in the 1970s.
 A back stair, long blocked by wiring, has been opened, and docents there discuss Leighton's carefully concealed personal life. He left no records indicating whether he ever had a lover of either sex. The women who posed nude for him would furtively take the side entrance to the back staircase and wait for him beside a black stone fireplace embedded with Chinese porcelain scenes of courtesans. Only the butler knew of the comings and goings; his office window overlooking the stairs has been restored, near a desk full of household bills that show how much mundane behind-the-scenes effort went into maintaining Leighton's architectural spectacle. 
 In the Driver's Seat
 California museums have been going through rough times. Since December art and science museums in Fresno and Claremont, which had been founded or newly renovated in the last three years, closed, and their contents are in limbo.
 There is one fail-safe way to found a new museum in this inauspicious climate: finance it mostly yourself, and fill it with your own collections.
 Peter W. Mullin, an insurance executive in Southern California, has taken that approach in setting up the Mullin Automotive Museum in Oxnard, Calif., which opens on Thursday. The economic crisis and museum shutdowns in California have, in a sense, encouraged him. ''The greatest time of opportunity is the time of difficulty,'' he said.
 The museum's low-slung tan building until 2006 contained another man's collection: the Chandler Vintage Museum of Transportation and Wildlife, where Otis Chandler, the former publisher of The Los Angeles Times, occasionally allowed tours of his motorcycles, muscle cars and taxidermied animals. So the floors are strong enough to support Mr. Mullin's displays of about 100 cars: roadsters, coupes and racers, mostly made before World War II by French companies like Bugatti, Peugeot and Delahaye.
 He has been buying, restoring and racing them since the 1980s. ''These are the apex of rolling art, with graceful, swoopy, curvaceous lines,'' he said.
 Vintage gasoline ads hang on the gallery walls, and display cases contain Art Deco furnishings like glass vases by Lalique and Galle. The cars are posted on or near turntables, as if in showrooms, and around a simulation of a 1932 Le Mans track with antique tools and tires in the repair pits.
 Although many of the cars will be rolled outdoors from time to time for Mr. Mullin to drive, a large contingent will probably never hit the road again. Two years ago he bought a few dozen cars that were filthy and rusting in a French warehouse, and in January, at a Bonhams auction in Paris, he paid about $370,000 for a wrecked 1925 Bugatti that had been fished out of a Swiss lake. (It was apparently dumped in the 1930s, after its owner refused to pay import duties for his French car.)
 Mr. Mullin likes thick corrosion on his ruined cars, treating it more as patina than imperfection. ''I'm going to keep them in their original state,'' he said of the corroded vehicles. ''It would be criminal to do anything but celebrate it.''
 The museum will be open on Saturdays, with an $8 admission. 
 Ancien Regime Silver
 The Austrian archduchess Marie Christine, a sister of Marie Antoinette, hardly had time to enjoy her finest silver. She and her husband, Duke Albert Casimir of Sachsen-Teschen, ordered a service around 1779 from a Viennese imperial metalsmith and used its 1,500 pounds of plates and vessels only for state dinners while ruling the Netherlands. By 1792 Napoleon had dethroned the Habsburg couple, and they packed a few shiploads of possessions and returned to Vienna, where the archduchess died of typhus.
 Her husband became a recluse, puttering around his palace and cataloging his prints and etchings. (The collection became the basis of the Albertina museum in Vienna.) His descendants sold the remaining silver in 1947, while they were impoverished in exile. Until a few years ago the set was thought irretrievably scattered or melted down.
 In 2002, however, the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired two of the Habsburgs' wine coolers, in the form of draped lion skins. (The pair cost $504,500 at Sotheby's.) The curators started hearing rumors that a family in Paris had spent decades tracking down and reuniting other fragments of the set. That family, requesting anonymity partly for security reasons, has lent more than a hundred pieces to an exhibition, ''Vienna Circa 1780: An Imperial Silver Service Rediscovered,'' which opens at the Met on Tuesday and runs through Nov. 7. 
 The Habsburgs, who controlled Italy, clearly had sophisticated tastes for Italian-inspired design. On their candelabra and tureens, neo-Classical fluting mingles with dolphins, snakes, tambourines and botanical motifs that the exhibition catalog, by the curator Wolfram Koeppe, calls ''turbulent acanthus-spray scrolls and seeds.'' The silver also conveyed awesome wealth. If a single hefty tureen had been melted down into coinage, Mr. Koeppe said, ''it would have more than paid for two years of Mozart's salary.''
 The museum is arranging much of the loaned tableware in historically accurate place settings. Napkins are folded like origami into the appetizing shapes of game birds and artichokes. Also on view are leather storage cases; the silver was locked up between meals to prevent theft and poisoning.
 There was always a risk that someone could sneak something fatal into the imperial saltcellars. At a state dinner, Mr. Koeppe said, ''a little arsenic would go a long way.''

HEADLINE: Retail Shares Distract Wall St. From Europe's Woes

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; David Jolly contributed reporting.. 
David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Signs of strength from American retailers helped send Wall Street indexes higher on Thursday, offsetting worries about Greek debt and the jobs market.
 Stocks rose after major retailers, including Target, Macy's and the Gap, reported sales increases of more than 10 percent in March. 
 The results exceeded forecasts, and retail stocks rose, with Target up 3 percent to $55.64 a share and the Gap climbing 3.1 percent to $24.59 a share. 
 The data helped reinforce a sense that consumers were spending again and that corporate profit would strengthen, despite a frail labor market and high levels of household debt. 
 ''When the recovery starts looking good, it's tough to stay on the sidelines,'' said Andrew Schiff, a consultant with Euro Pacific Capital, a brokerage firm. ''But people are being blissfully optimistic if they think we've seen the last of this crisis.''
 Earlier, investors were cautious as the yield on Greek debt spiked to a record high, reflecting worries that a rescue package for the country would be elusive. But a pledge from the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, that Greece would not be allowed to default helped calm the markets.
 ''A default is not an issue for Greece,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 Yields on Greece's 10-year government bonds hit 7.5 percent before dropping back. The spread over comparable German debt, the European benchmark, rose to 4.41 percentage points from 4.05 points on Wednesday. That gap, which has been growing along with concerns about Greece's ability to refinance its debt, shows the premium that investors demand to hold the bonds.
 Uri D. Landesman, head of global growth at ING, said he thought the concerns about a rescue package were exaggerated. But he said the stakes were high because investors saw Greece as a test case for other countries with huge deficits.
 ''These things take time, but the more important question is whether there is a bigger shoe to fall,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''Italy and Spain interest me a lot more than Greece does.''
 A relatively strong auction in the United States for 30-year Treasury bonds also lifted investor spirits, allaying fears of higher borrowing costs. The $13 billion auction attracted a yield of 4.77 percent, slightly higher than the yield on older bonds.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 97 27/32. The yield rose to 3.89 percent, from 3.86 percent late Wednesday.
 Wall Street initially struggled after the Labor Department reported that the latest filings for jobless benefits were higher than had been expected. The department said that first-time claims for unemployment rose by 18,000 last week; analysts had expected a modest decline.
 The unexpectedly high number disappointed those on Wall Street who believed the labor market had reached a turning point. 
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.55 points, or 0.27 percent, to 10,927.07. The Dow was helped by a 3.1 increase in American Express to $43.69 a share.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.99 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,186.44, led higher by shares of consumer-oriented companies as well as banks. The Nasdaq climbed 5.65 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,436.81.
 Shares of US Airways surged nearly 11 percent, to $7.55 a share, after reports that it was in talks with United Airlines about a possible merger.
 In Europe and Asia, fears over Greece ruled. The FTSE 100 index in London dropped 0.9 percent, the DAX in Frankfurt was down 0.8 percent, and the CAC-40 in Paris fell 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Identity Thieves Infiltrated Tax Office in Bronx, a Suit Says

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN; C. J. Hughes and Mirela Iverac contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Last year, Kevin Johns, a construction worker in the Bronx, did his taxes at the H&R Block store on Riverdale Avenue that he had used for the past 20 years or so. The next day, though, he got a call from the tax preparer: his return was rejected because he had already filed. Or at least, someone had filed in his name. That someone helped himself or herself to a $8,499 refund.
 Sharon Hawa, a disaster-relief coordinator with the Red Cross and another longtime customer at the same office, had a similar experience. Ms. Hawa said she went to have her taxes done, only to be told that someone had already e-filed her taxes and collected $6,145. 
 Both Ms. Hawa and Mr. Johns said they were told by police detectives investigating their cases that at least 20 customers of the branch and possibly many more had been robbed by identity thieves who were very likely H&R Block employees. Both said the fraudulent filers used their previous year's adjusted gross incomes as proof of identity.
 ''There's only place that could have come from: H&R Block,'' Mr. Johns said. 
 On Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Johns and Ms. Hawa filed a class-action suit in the Bronx, accusing the company of failing to take steps to protect its customers' security despite previous allegations (and lawsuits filed in Arizona, Illinois and Michigan) against other H&R Block outlets.
 The suit came on the same day, coincidentally, that federal prosecutors announced fraud charges against 26 tax preparers from the Bronx, Manhattan and New Jersey -- none from H&R Block -- accused of collecting tens of millions of dollars in refunds through identity theft over a nine-year period.
 At the H&R Block storefront at 3736 Riverdale Avenue in Kingsbridge, employees said they could not talk to a reporter. 
 H&R Block, the nation's biggest tax-preparation company, with more than 12,000 offices, said in a statement: ''H&R Block is working directly with the I.R.S. and other authorities to resolve this situation for clients. We are standing by our clients and will do everything we can to assist them. So that we don't compromise the efforts of the I.R.S., we aren't able to share additional details at this time.''
 The police said the cases of Ms. Hawa and Mr. Johns had been referred to the Internal Revenue Service, which declined to comment, citing taxpayer confidentiality rules.
 James B. Fishman, one of the lawyers filing the class-action suit, said tax preparation companies were particularly susceptible to infiltration by identity thieves. ''Because this is a seasonal business,'' said Mr. Fishman, of the firm of Fishman & Mallon, ''for the most part, these are temporary employees who do their thing and leave and are never heard from again. But we know that it's continuing at this office. Someone at H&R Block who is friendly with our clients said the same thing has happened this year.''
 In Indiana, two former H&R Block employees were charged last month with stealing the identities of more than 60 customers and pocketing at least $290,000.
 In the separate federal case announced on Thursday in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the 26 tax preparers who were charged had filed thousands of fraudulent returns using the stolen identities of dead people and residents of Puerto Rico, who do not pay federal income tax. Most of the 35,000 returns prepared by the defendants since 2001, yielding more than $95 million in refunds, were fraudulent, Mr. Bharara said.
 One of the preparers arrested was Kelvin Crucey, a senior vice president with the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a prominent economic-development nonprofit in Harlem. Mr. Crucey claimed $250,000 in fraudulent refunds, prosecutors said.
 The customers of the H&R Block branch, Ms. Hawa and Mr. Johns, finally received their allotted refunds recently after considerable headache and red tape.
 But Ms. Hawa, 36, said she had to take a second job to make up for the $6,000 or so she had been counting on last year (whoever filed her return faked the numbers to get a bigger refund). ''I purchased furniture with the idea that I was going to get a tax refund to pay off the credit card bill,'' she said.
 And Mr. Johns, 52, said the state came after him for $1,100 because of discrepancies between the income his identity thief claimed and his actual income. Meanwhile, he said, the $600 he paid H&R Block last year to do his taxes has not been refunded, despite assurances from the company's regional office nearly a year ago that it would be.
 Mr. Johns has, however, recently heard from the company. ''I started getting calls from H&R Block asking, 'When will you be coming in to do your taxes this year?' '' he recalled. ''I said: 'I never want to do my taxes with H&R Block again. I want to be purged from the system.' ''

HEADLINE: Claims Rose From Jobless Last Week

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of newly laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits rose last week, a sign that jobs remain scarce even as the economy recovers. 
 The Labor Department said that first-time claims increased by 18,000, to a seasonally adjusted 460,000. That was worse than economists' estimates of a drop to 435,000, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
 The report covers the week that includes the Easter holiday, and a Labor Department analyst said seasonal adjustment for that week could be difficult since the Easter holiday occurred in different weeks each year.
 The four-week average, which smoothes volatility, rose to 450,250. Two weeks ago, the average fell to its lowest level since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the financial crisis intensified.
 But initial claims have dropped four out of the last six weeks, and many economists say they are likely to resume their decline.
 ''Not everything goes in a straight line,'' Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a research note. ''Definitely not the claims data.''
 California also closed its state offices for a holiday on March 31 honoring Cesar Chavez, the analyst said, which probably held down the claims figures. On an unadjusted basis, claims rose by 6,500, to nearly 415,000.
 Jobless claims peaked during the recession at 651,000 in late March 2009.
 On a more positive note in the Labor Department's report, the tally of people continuing to claim benefits for more than a week fell by 131,000 to 4.55 million, the lowest level since December 2008.
 That figure lags initial claims by a week. But it does not include millions of people who have used up the regular 26 weeks of benefits typically provided by states, and are receiving extended benefits for up to 73 additional weeks, paid by the federal government.
 Slightly more than 5.8 million people were receiving extended benefits in the week ending March 20.

HEADLINE: Japanese Newspaper, in a Twist, Discourages Linking to Its Web Site

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's largest business newspaper, the Nikkei, joined the trend of other news sites last week by requiring readers to pay to view its Web site. But, in a twist, it also imposed a policy severely restricting links to its articles -- or even its home page. 
 Links to Nikkei's home page require a detailed written application. Among other things, applicants must spell out their reasons for linking to the site. 
 In addition, regular readers of the site will also notice that the paper has disabled the ability to right-click -- which usually brings up a menu including ''copy link address.'' The paper's ''link policy'' ends on an ominous note: ''We may seek damages for any violations of these rules.''
 The Nikkei says the rules are intended to make sure its pay wall is not breached and to prevent the linking of its content from ''inappropriate'' sites.
 ''In some cases, links to individual stories could lead to stories being manipulated for a purpose other than journalism, for example to promote a certain stock,'' the Nikkei said. ''There is a danger this could inaccurately affect financial markets.''
 But the policy has brought a storm of fury and derision in the blogosphere in Japan.
 '' ''Nikkei thinks it can go online, but cut themselves off from the wider Internet. ''They just don't get it,'' said Toshinao Sasaki, a technology writer and author. ''The way forward is to link free content with paid content, and links play a big role there.'' Critics say Nikkei's rules show that despite Japan's reputation for being at the forefront of technology, traditional media still lag behind in online strategy.
 Instead of going all out on the Web like many American papers, Japan's top papers have limited online fare, so that readers must buy print editions for full articles. On Daily Yomiuri Online, the Web site of another Japanese daily, many articles are short versions, or ''stubs,'' with no photographs. The same is true for Asahi.com, run by the Asahi Shimbun. 
 The Yomiuri and Asahi are the world's two largest newspapers -- the Yomiuri has a circulation of slightly more than 10 million, while the Asahi has slightly more than 8 million readers. The New York Times, by comparison, has average daily sales of 928,000 papers. The Times recently announced that it was planning to adopt a payment system for some access to its Web site. 
 The Nikkei's daily subscription base is just above three million, 50 percent more than the biggest American business daily, The Wall Street Journal. The Journal also charges for full access to its Web site, but it does not ban linking.
 ''Japan's papers have seen their American counterparts suffer by offering everything for free,'' said Yoshihiro Oto, a journalism professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. ''They're convinced openness doesn't work.''
 For now, the print-focused strategy seems to have helped the industry. Newspapers here have lost relatively few of their print subscribers in the last decade, despite a surge in Japanese Internet users. Statistics show that at least one daily newspaper is still delivered for every household in Japan.
 Still, papers like the Nikkei are speeding up efforts to increase their online offerings to attract younger readers -- and to find a way to profit from the Internet. 
 Younger Japanese have turned from physical papers toward the Web. A 2009 survey by the Shimbun Tsushin Chosakai, a newspaper research institution, found that 59 percent of Japanese in their 20s and 47 percent in their 30s say they get news online.
 Japanese papers rely much more on home subscriptions than ads for revenue. But ad revenue has plunged in the wake of the global economic crisis.
 According to the advertising giant Dentsu, ad revenue at the nation's newspapers fell 18 percent in 2009 from a year earlier, to 673.9 billion yen ($7.24 billion), and was eclipsed for the first time that year by online advertising, which edged up 1.2 percent, to 706.9 billion yen.
 That has prompted some papers to start charging for online content. A month's subscription to Nikkei's online version costs 4,000 yen, compared with 4,383 yen for a one-month print subscription.
 But much of the paper's thinking about the Web is outdated, media specialists say, pointing especially to Nikkei's restrictions on linking to specific articles. 
 Japan's smaller papers, though, are taking a different tack online. The Sankei Shimbun, the smallest of Japan's national dailies with a circulation of 1.7 million, raised eyebrows last year when it introduced an iPhone application that offered free access to its articles. That app remains one of Japan's most popular.
 ''There's just no way we'd limit something like that,'' said Ryuichi Sekiguchi, a spokesman for Sankei. ''Linking should be free.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Church's Judas Moment,'' Maureen Dowd's April 7 column, which was written largely by her brother Kevin: 
 Kevin Dowd writes, ''Georgetown University agreeing to cover religious symbols on stage to get President Obama to speak was not exactly fierce.''
 While preparing for an address on the economy last year, the university's event staff honored the White House advance staff's request to cover some Georgetown University signage and symbols to provide a standard backdrop of American flags, consistent with other policy speeches.
 Numerous religious symbols remained visible throughout the hall during the president's remarks, including the letters ''I.H.S.'' on the shields of 25 Jesuit institutions; crosses on the Georgetown crest displayed on 20 stained glass windows in the hall; and the phrase ''Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam inque Hominum Salutem,'' or ''For the Greater Glory of God and the Salvation of Humanity.''

HEADLINE: South Africa: World Bank To Finance Coal-Fired Plant

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Eskom, the government-controlled utility, got its $3.75 billion loan on Thursday from the World Bank, mostly to finance a giant coal-fired power plant. The Obama administration, despite its unhappiness with the plant's significant carbon emissions that will contribute to global warming, abstained rather than voting no and profoundly upsetting a regional powerhouse. The United States explicitly warned the bank in a statement that it would not actively oppose the loan because of South Africa's acute energy needs, but that the bank should not bring forward similar coal projects in the future ''without a plan to ensure there is no net increase in carbon emissions.''

HEADLINE: South Korean Sailors Say Blast That Sank Their Ship Came From Outside the Vessel

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- It could take weeks for engineers to salvage the South Korean warship that sank in waters disputed by North Korea after a mysterious explosion and provide a definitive explanation of what caused the disaster. But some signs are pointing to North Korea, raising uncomfortable questions for the South's government. 
 On Thursday, surviving crew members went public with their account, saying they were convinced that the explosion came from outside the ship. That follows remarks last week by Defense Minister Kim Tae-young before the National Assembly that the military had not ruled out the possibility that the ship was hit by a mine or torpedo. Mr. Kim added, ''A more likely possibility is a torpedo attack.'' 
 If North Korea is ultimately found culpable, it will amount to one of the most serious military provocations since the Korean War ended in a truce, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war. But what options South Korea may have to retaliate is a difficult issue for the South. 
 The delicacy of the matter was on full display during Mr. Kim's testimony. No sooner had he raised the possibility of a torpedo attack than he was handed a hurriedly dictated note from the office of President Lee Myung-bak. It warned him not to ''lean too much toward the torpedo attack'' and to stick to the official stance: keeping all possibilities open until the ship was salvaged and examined for the cause of its sinking.
 The stakes are obviously enormous, both for Mr. Lee and for the future of six-nation talks the United States hopes to reconvene to discuss eliminating the North's nuclear weapons program. 
 If the ship, the Cheonan, was sunk by a North Korean attack, then the action almost certainly was approved in advance by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, said Won Se-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's top spy agency, in a conversation with lawmakers on Tuesday. 
 But if that was the case, what was the motivation for the attack? Some experts have speculated that it was a desperate attempt at score-settling by the North Korean military, which was overpowered by its South Korean counterpart during three recent naval skirmishes.
 Others have tied it to the fallout from a succession struggle thought to be under way in North Korea, with the military trying to demonstrate its mettle to Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il's youngest son, who is being prepared to take over from his ailing father.
 Then again, North Korea has a long history of provoking trouble when the South is preparing for major international events. In 1987, North Korean agents blew up a Korean passenger jet over the sea near Myanmar, killing all 115 on board and shaking South Korea only months before the 1988 Olympic Games. In 2002, North Korea set off a naval clash while South Korea was a co-host of World Cup soccer matches.
 In November, South Korea is set to host the Group of 20 summit meeting.
 Experts also note the North's traditional tactic of lashing out with unexpected provocations -- like missile and nuclear tests -- when it most needs outside attention and aid. This might be one of those times, analysts say.
 Kim Jong-il is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. He has vowed to build a ''strong and prosperous nation'' by 2012, when his son is widely expected to be announced as his political heir. But the country's economic woes and food shortages worsened sharply after its botched attempt to arrest inflation with a disastrous currency revaluation late last year. 
 Ha Tae-keung, who runs Open Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from informants inside North Korea, said that many North Korean elites believed that their military sank the ship, although they have not produced any proof.
 The North Korean military has been increasing its submarine capabilities to compensate for its decrepit naval fleet, especially after its defeat in a brief naval clash last November, Mr. Ha said.
 ''It must demonstrate that it remains a threat to the South,'' he said. ''It gets aid not by openness but by blackmailing.''
 Mr. Lee won the presidency in 2008 primarily on a promise to stop coddling the North, reversing the ''sunshine policy'' of his more liberal predecessors. 
 He has vowed to make the inquiry as international as possible, inviting American and United Nations investigators. 
 ''We need a thorough and scientific investigation whose outcome the rest of the world can accept,'' President Lee told his cabinet on Tuesday. ''Based on such a conclusion, the government can take a stern position.''
 Despite all that, there are strong reasons to doubt he will come down hard on the North. South Korea's reactions to past provocations have hardly been ferocious, ranging from plotting revenge attacks (but never carrying them out) to coaxing the North back to the negotiating table with more aid.
 Beyond that, experts say, anything it does may only make things worse. 
 ''In the current situation, Seoul has no way to retaliate,'' said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. ''So, it is better to wait until things calm down, so the government will not be under pressure 'to do something' in a situation when all possible actions are counterproductive or dangerous.''
 Mr. Lee's political opponents are already claiming that he is exaggerating the possibility of North Korean involvement to rally conservative votes ahead of crucial mayoral and gubernatorial elections in June. 
 It is possible that the mystery of what caused the explosion will remain unsolved, some experts on Korean affairs said. ''An underlying problem here is whether clear knowledge of the causes of the Cheonan sinking will be attainable, even after salvaging the ship,'' said John Delury, a North Korea expert and the associate director of the Asia Society's Center on U.S.-China Relations, in New York.

HEADLINE: Bernanke, Pointing to 1930s, Credits Fed's Actions for Avoiding a Worse Downturn

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve artfully avoided a second Depression by being open to generating and testing new ideas, the central bank's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Thursday evening.
 In an address here at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, Mr. Bernanke drew comparisons between the financial crisis of 2008 and the financial collapse of the 1930s with greater precision than he had in the past. 
 Mr. Bernanke, who made his name as an academic economist by studying the Depression, has been cautious about being seen as claiming credit for saving the economy from total collapse when the credit markets froze a year and a half ago. In the critical period before he won Senate confirmation in January for a second four-year term, he left it to the Obama administration and others to defend his record. 
 But on Thursday, Mr. Bernanke expressed confidence that the Fed's measures -- a series of emergency lending programs, as well as huge purchases of mortgage-backed securities and government debt -- helped to avoid a panic, stabilize the economy and restore the flow of credit.
 He compared the 2009 ''stress tests'' that the Fed oversaw to assess the financial health of the nation's largest banks with the national bank holiday that President Roosevelt declared in 1933 to evaluate banks' soundness and restore customer confidence.
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had learned several lessons from the Great Depression.
 First, he said that economic prosperity depended on financial stability. That was a connection misunderstood during the Depression, when the central bank stood by as banks failed. In addition, the Treasury secretary at the time, Andrew W. Mellon, urged President Hoover to ''liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate'' as a means to ''purge the rottenness out of the system.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke said that his own scholarship had demonstrated that countries with severe banking problems, like the United States, did worse than those with more stable systems, like Britain.
 Second, Mr. Bernanke said the Depression showed that ''policy makers must respond forcefully, creatively and decisively'' to financial crises. It was not until the 1933 bank holiday, he said, that officials began to ''challenge the orthodoxies of their day,'' like the post-World War I gold standard. 
 Mr. Bernanke said the Troubled Asset Relief Program to bail out financial institutions ''was far from perfect,'' but ''essential for preventing an imminent financial collapse.'' He said the Fed had acted ''sharply and proactively'' by slashing interest rates to near-zero between the fall of 2007 and the end of 2008.
 Mr. Bernanke said the Depression also taught the importance of international cooperation. He called the joint decision of six central banks -- the Fed, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, Canada and Sweden -- to cut short-term interest rates in October 2008 ''an unprecedented display of coordination.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke did not argue that the Fed's response was ideal. He said that ''history is never a perfect guide,'' and cited a quotation from Mark Twain, ''History does not repeat itself, but it can rhyme.'' 
 The complex securitization of investment banks and other parts of the ''shadow banking system'' during the recent crisis could have led to a panic like that of the 1930s, he said. 
 ''When the housing slump shook investors' faith in the values of the loans underlying the securities, short-term funding dried up quickly, threatening the banks and other financial institutions that explicitly or implicitly stood behind the off-balance-sheet vehicles,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''This was a new type of run, analogous in many ways to the bank runs of the 1930s, but in a form which was not well anticipated by financial institutions or regulators.'' 
 The huge outflow from money market funds in September 2008 after the Reserve Primary Fund suffered losses related to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy was ''an additional variation on the theme of the bank run,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 Mr. Bernanke was introduced by Paul A. Volcker, who led the Fed from 1979 to 1987 and is now an influential outside adviser to the Obama administration.
 Earlier on Thursday, in a speech in San Francisco, the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said that he expected unemployment ''to come down only slowly from its currently elevated level'' and warned that ''part of the increase in unemployment over the past two years may be structural, and this part would tend to reverse only slowly.''
 Mr. Kohn, who has announced that he would retire in June, said the Fed would eventually have to start raising interest rates to stave off inflation.

HEADLINE: Learning From Greece

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The debt crisis in Greece is approaching the point of no return. As prospects for a rescue plan seem to be fading, largely thanks to German obduracy, nervous investors have driven interest rates on Greek government bonds sky-high, sharply raising the country's borrowing costs. This will push Greece even deeper into debt, further undermining confidence. At this point it's hard to see how the nation can escape from this death spiral into default.
 It's a terrible story, and clearly an object lesson for the rest of us. But an object lesson in what, exactly? 
 Yes, Greece is paying the price for past fiscal irresponsibility. Yet that's by no means the whole story. The Greek tragedy also illustrates the extreme danger posed by a deflationary monetary policy. And that's a lesson one hopes American policy makers will take to heart.
 The key thing to understand about Greece's predicament is that it's not just a matter of excessive debt. Greece's public debt, at 113 percent of G.D.P., is indeed high, but other countries have dealt with similar levels of debt without crisis. For example, in 1946, the United States, having just emerged from World War II, had federal debt equal to 122 percent of G.D.P. Yet investors were relaxed, and rightly so: Over the next decade the ratio of U.S. debt to G.D.P. was cut nearly in half, easing any concerns people might have had about our ability to pay what we owed. And debt as a percentage of G.D.P. continued to fall in the decades that followed, hitting a low of 33 percent in 1981. 
 So how did the U.S. government manage to pay off its wartime debt? Actually, it didn't. At the end of 1946, the federal government owed $271 billion; by the end of 1956 that figure had risen slightly, to $274 billion. The ratio of debt to G.D.P. fell not because debt went down, but because G.D.P. went up, roughly doubling in dollar terms over the course of a decade. The rise in G.D.P. in dollar terms was almost equally the result of economic growth and inflation, with both real G.D.P. and the overall level of prices rising about 40 percent from 1946 to 1956.
 Unfortunately, Greece can't expect a similar performance. Why? Because of the euro.
 Until recently, being a member of the euro zone seemed like a good thing for Greece, bringing with it cheap loans and large inflows of capital. But those capital inflows also led to inflation -- and when the music stopped, Greece found itself with costs and prices way out of line with Europe's big economies. Over time, Greek prices will have to come back down. And that means that unlike postwar America, which inflated away part of its debt, Greece will see its debt burden worsened by deflation.
 That's not all. Deflation is a painful process, which invariably takes a toll on growth and employment. So Greece won't grow its way out of debt. On the contrary, it will have to deal with its debt in the face of an economy that's stagnant at best.
 So the only way Greece could tame its debt problem would be with savage spending cuts and tax increases, measures that would themselves worsen the unemployment rate. No wonder, then, that bond markets are losing confidence, and pushing the situation to the brink.
 What can be done? The hope was that other European countries would strike a deal, guaranteeing Greek debt in return for a commitment to harsh fiscal austerity. That might have worked. But without German support, such a deal won't happen.
 Greece could alleviate some of its problems by leaving the euro, and devaluing. But it's hard to see how Greece could do that without triggering a catastrophic run on its banking system. Indeed, worried depositors have already begun pulling cash out of Greek banks. There are no good answers here -- actually, no nonterrible answers.
 But what are the lessons for America? Of course, we should be fiscally responsible. What that means, however, is taking on the big long-term issues, above all health costs -- not grandstanding and penny-pinching over short-term spending to help a distressed economy.
 Equally important, however, we need to steer clear of deflation, or even excessively low inflation. Unlike Greece, we're not stuck with someone else's currency. But as Japan has demonstrated, even countries with their own currencies can get stuck in a deflationary trap.
 What worries me most about the U.S. situation right now is the rising clamor from inflation hawks, who want the Fed to raise rates (and the federal government to pull back from stimulus) even though employment has barely started to recover. If they get their way, they'll perpetuate mass unemployment. But that's not all. America's public debt will be manageable if we eventually return to vigorous growth and moderate inflation. But if the tight-money people prevail, that won't happen -- and all bets will be off.

HEADLINE: Miners' Lives: Security, but Never Peace of Mind

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
HORSE CREEK, W.Va. -- As Janice Quarles waited for the phone to ring with news that her husband's body had been pulled from the Upper Big Branch mine, she vowed -- much as so many West Virginia mothers have before her -- that her son, Trevor, 11, would never follow his father into the mines.
 ''There just ain't no way,'' she said.
 But minutes later, concern for his safety was overwhelmed by another worry. 
 ''If that's the only kind of work there is around here, what choice does he have?'' said Ms. Quarles, three days after losing her husband, Gary Wayne Quarles, in the worst American mining disaster in 25 years. ''He's got to make a living just like everybody else.''
 Before stubbornly high levels of methane gas drove them back Thursday, rescuers had come within 500 feet of where the bodies of one group of miners may lie, with the authorities hoping that they would be able to restart the search Thursday night. 
 As devastating as it has been to this mountain community, the explosion that killed at least 25 miners on Monday has done little to alter the steel-toed blend of pride, resignation and economics that defines a coal miner's life. Even as the rescue and recovery effort continued, workers at nearby mines day and night boarded the elevators that carry them miles into the earth. 
 Mining, unlike the low-wage jobs that predominate here, can provide a worker who is barely 20 years old with a home, a nice truck and a savings account.
 ''That's the way it is around here,'' Ms. Quarles said. ''How many people can graduate high school today and tomorrow make $70,000 a year?''
 Unlike in many households, where financial security brings peace of mind, in mining families the two are permanently at odds. Stephanie Pennington, for instance, is quick to acknowledge that her family lives well, with a three-bedroom home and a 2007 Dodge Durango, its rear window studded with decals of a pick and shovel, a crawling man with a headlamp, and the legend ''WV Coal Miner's Wife.''
 But each night when her husband, Robert Shawn Pennington, leaves for the hoot-owl shift at the ICG Beckley coal mine here, she gathers her three children to pray. ''I don't sleep until I hear that key in the door every morning,'' Ms. Pennington, 29, said. For her family, the anxiety spans the generations. Mr. Pennington's father was crushed to death in the old Beckley mine while his mother was six weeks pregnant with him.
 Here along the mountain roads, punctuated by hand-lettered signs advertising tiny churches or live lizards for sale, mining has enabled Thomas Dulin, 22, and his wife, Amanda, to buy an eight-acre farm and two donkeys, Chocolate and Chip.
 Mr. Dulin, whose father is a federal mine inspector, was in college studying to be a teacher when he realized that he could make three times as much working as a miner. 
 In Raleigh County, where the Upper Big Branch mine is located, underground miners make an average of $1,476 a week, or more than twice the average income in the county.
 Though Mr. Dulin came from a mining family, he had never been in a mine shaft before he decided to leave college. Now that he has spent time underground, he said, he realizes that money is not everything. 
 ''I understand now why my parents didn't want me to go in the mines,'' he said. ''Truly your health is very important, and I can see that now, and a lot of the older people in my family who spent 30, 40 years in the mine, I can see the toll it's taken on them.''
 Injuries are not the only danger; many develop respiratory ailments like asthma, silicosis and black lung. 
 Mr. Dulin said he would probably go back to college eventually, but to study in a coal-related field. In the meantime, he said, mining is an adventure-filled job, different on every shift. The crews are fraternities whose members watch out for one another even as they tease and play pranks, like greasing the controls of a piece of machinery when the operator is not looking.
 Joking aside, a certain amount of rationalization is required before one can spend each day embedded in a mountain of rock, chipping away at it from the inside. Accidents can happen on any job, some miners say. Others say their lives are in God's hands. Still others simply push thoughts of danger to the back of their mind. 
 ''I try not to let it get to me in any way,'' said James Songer, 21, whose face on Wednesday morning was still blackened with coal dust from the night shift. ''Try not to think about it. Say a prayer before I go in.''
 James Griffith, 57, whose brother, Bob, died in the explosion this week, said he had left mining for 18 years but returned when his wife needed health insurance. He said he would continue mining until he could no longer work. 
 ''It's kind of like if your dad was a butcher and he cuts his hand off,'' he said. ''Your mother's not going to say, 'I wish you'd stop being a butcher.' It's your family business. Unless you want to work at McDonald's or somewhere.''
 Stephen Franck, a miner for ICG, has other career options: he is a master plumber with a college degree. But he chooses to mine out of love for the job, he said. Mr. Franck, 30, said he felt for the men who died in the Upper Branch mine, but added: ''I'm a coal miner. This is what happens.''
 His mother, Edna Asbury, said she would give anything to see him change jobs. 
 ''I wake up in the middle of the night and my mind automatically goes into a prayer for God to be with him,'' Ms. Asbury said. ''I told him this morning, 'You're going to have to start letting me hear from you every morning to know that you're safe.' He said: 'Mom, you know this was bound to happen. It was their time to go, and they just all happened to be in a mining accident together.' ''
 The Upper Big Branch explosion has revived these types of arguments, but it has not altered the stalemate in which they usually end: if a miner quits, where will he find a comparable salary?
 Such friction can begin even before a worker chooses to go underground. Evan Hash, 22, makes about $50,000 a year as a surface miner, a less risky and lower-paying job than deep mining. But with the birth of his first child last month, Mr. Hash is eager to take the classes required to go ''down under.'' He would make, he said, $1,200 more each month. 
 ''My wife didn't want me to,'' he said as he contemplated second-hand mining uniforms for sale at an intersection outside of Eccles, W.Va. ''I just got her talked into it.''
 But his wife, Leona, 22, did not consider herself convinced. ''He's not going to go underground,'' she said firmly, rocking the baby at a brisk tempo. ''By the time he gets ready to go to school, he'll be talked out of it.''

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- If the trend in baseball stadiums is intimacy, in football, it is grandeur. And the New Meadowlands Stadium, the home of the Jets and the Giants, is certainly imposing. 
 With 2.2 million square feet, it is twice the size of Giants Stadium, which is being demolished next door. It is 30 feet higher and has about 6,000 more seats. The suites are more opulent, the 118-foot-long scoreboards are larger and the construction cost is lavish, at $1.6 billion, equal to the gross domestic product of Lesotho.
 The first football game is not until August, but the stadium will open on Saturday for the Big City Classic collegiate lacrosse tournament.
 Most days, the stadium will look vast, gray and generic. But when the main tenants are at home, lights and video screens will change colors, concessions will sell Jets or Giants gear and decorations will be added to ''blue it up for Giants games and green it up for Jets games,'' said Mark Lamping, the president of New Meadowlands Stadium Company, which was formed by the teams to build the stadium. Fans will add to the palette with their team jerseys.
 The stadium has sumptuous quarters for the well-heeled, including suites that cost $1 million a season, and clubs with leather seats and marble counter tops. Views from the Coach's Club and other premium spots are intimate.
 Fans in the nonpremium seats will have a more spartan experience. The seats are less than two feet wide, space that will be easily filled with fans in their winter coats. The pitch of the top deck is such that fans should have little trouble seeing over others in front of them. And once your eyes adjust to the height, the game below should be, appropriately, fully visible.

HEADLINE: Why So Glum? Numbers Point To a Recovery

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The American economy appears to be in a cyclical recovery that is gaining strength. Firms have begun to hire and consumer spending seems to be accelerating. 
 That is what usually happens after particularly sharp recessions, so it is surprising that many commentators, whether economists or politicians, seem to doubt that such a thing could possibly be happening. 
 Usually you can depend on the White House to view the economy with the most rose-tinted glasses available. But it was not until last week, after a strong employment report, that President Obama started to sound a little optimistic.
 ''The tough measures that we took -- measures that were necessary even though sometimes they were unpopular -- have broken this slide and are helping us to climb out of this recession,'' he said in a speech at a factory making battery components in North Carolina. 
 Note, however, that he seemed to believe the country remained in recession. It is virtually certain that is not accurate, as least as will be determined by the arbiters of recession at the National Bureau of Economic Research. ''The recession is over,'' one of those arbiters, Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard, wrote this week.
 But the White House is unwilling to make that claim.
 Why is good news being received with such doubt? Why is ''new normal'' the currently popular economic phrase, signifying that growth will be subpar for an extended period, and that the old normal is no longer something to be expected?
 It is possible, of course, that I am wrong and the prevalent pessimism is correct. Many economic indicators, including Thursday's retail sales report, are looking up, but that does not prove the recovery will be self-sustaining. There are issues relating to over-indebted consumers and local governments. The housing collapse will have an impact for some time.
 But there are, I think, a number of reasons for the glum outlook that are unrelated to the actual economic data.
 First, the last two recoveries, after the downturns of 1990-91 and 2001, were in fact very slow to pick up any momentum. It is easy to forget that those recessions were also remarkably shallow. If you are under 45, you probably don't have much recollection of the last strong recovery, after the recession that ended in late 1982.
 Add to that the fact that the vast majority of the seers did not see this recession coming. Remember Ben Bernanke assuring us the subprime problem was ''contained''? In mid-2008, after the recession had been under way for six months, the Fed thought there would be no recession, and the most pessimistic member of its Open Market Committee thought the unemployment rate could climb to 6.1 percent by late 2009. It actually went over 10 percent.
 In January of this year -- after the recession had probably been over for at least a few months -- the most optimistic member of the committee expected the unemployment rate to fall to 8.6 percent by late this year. The consensus was for a rate no lower than 9.5 percent. 
 Having been embarrassed by missing impending disaster, there is an understandable hesitation to appear foolishly optimistic again.
 But even without that factor, it is normal for recessions to make people pessimistic. ''Go back and read what people were saying in 1982 or 1975,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''Nobody was saying, 'Deep recession, big recovery.' It is quite normal to expect an abnormally weak recovery. It is also normal for that expectation to be wrong.''
 But if that is normal, one factor that brings optimism to some forecasts is absent this time. Both Republicans and Democrats have good reasons to be negative. Republicans are loath to give President Obama credit for anything, and no doubt grate when he points to his administration's stimulus program as a cause of the good economic news, as he did in North Carolina.
 Democrats would love to give the president credit. But much of the Democratic Party wants another stimulus bill to be passed, notwithstanding worries about budget deficits. Chances for that are not enhanced by the perception the economy is getting better.
 The employment report for March, released a week ago, was a milestone that has been little noted. The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is calculated, showed a gain during the first quarter of this year of 1.1 million jobs, the best performance since the spring of 2005.
 True, the more widely reported numbers from the survey of employers are not as good. But those numbers are subject to heavy revision as better data becomes available. At the turning points for employment after the last two downturns, those numbers turned out to be far better than was reported at the time.
 Employment is a lagging indicator. Employers can be slow to cut back when business turns down, and slow to rehire when it picks up. It stands to reason that when employers cut back sharply -- as happened in this cycle -- they will have to rehire faster than if they had been slow to fire, as was true in the two previous downturns.
 I looked back at the recoveries after seven recessions from 1950 through 1982 and found that, on average, such a strong three-month performance of the household survey, defined as a gain of at least 0.8 percent in the total number of existing jobs, came seven months after the recession had ended, with a range of two to 13 months.
 If the 2007-9 recession ended in August, as the index of coincident indicators would seem to indicate, the lag this time will have been seven months.
 The lag was 28 months after the 1990-91 recession ended, and an amazing 42 months after the 2001 downturn concluded. Those really did deserve the title of ''jobless recovery.'' But they were very different from what appears to be unfolding now.
 The stock market's recent performance may be sending a similar message. Prices have been rising, but there is not much volume. Why? A lot of money managers are fully invested, but many investors remain fearful and are not putting cash into mutual funds. To judge from anecdotal evidence, some of the buying now is short-covering by hedge funds that expected the economy to be much weaker than it is, and thought corporate earnings reports would devastate investors. Instead, they are hearing from companies that business is stronger than expected.
 Some Americans are in deep trouble, to be sure, and the days of paying for second homes by refinancing the mortgage on the first will not return soon. But many Americans -- both individuals and businesses -- who cut back sharply when fear was at a peak a year ago are now finding that they overreacted. The businesses need to hire to meet demand, some of it coming from individuals who are less fearful now of losing their own jobs.
 In 1982, Democrats scoffed at a surging stock market and thought a severe recession would last for a very long time. They were confident that the economy would doom Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984. All they had to do was make clear they offered a stark alternative to the failing policies of the incumbent
 Change a few words (Reagan to Obama, Democrats to Republicans, 1984 to 2012) and you have an accurate description of the current political climate. Could the Republicans be as wrong now as the Democrats were then?

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 Museums
AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 ASIA SOCIETY MUSEUM: 'PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART,' through June 20. This deftly shaped show, not especially large, spans vast swaths of land and time, from India to Japan, and from the first century A.D. almost to the present. Materially, it's cornucopian, with all manner of painting and sculpture and a camping store's worth of pilgrim travel gear: rucksacks for sutra scrolls, monastic hiking staffs and fanny-pack shrines, not to mention charts and maps, some cosmic, some not. The show traces the life of the Buddha and the circular path his wandering took between his birth and death in northern India. It also looks at the paths of those who followed him through the centuries and to this day. Some have traveled alone and quietly, other in lively packs. The action in a mural-size pilgrimage painting from 18th-century Nepal looks like a raucous scene from ''Canterbury Tales'' set in the Kathmandu Valley. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'TO LIVE FOREVER: ART AND THE AFTERLIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,' through May 2. Drawing from its own world-class collection of Egyptian art and artifacts, the Brooklyn Museum has assembled an exhibition exploring all facets of the Egyptian funerary industry. It's not a blockbuster, but it is fascinating. It presents more than 100 objects, from massive stone sarcophagus covers and elaborately decorated wooden coffins to little statuettes and elegant ink drawings on sheets of papyrus. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM DULWICH PICTURE GALLERY,' through May 30. That any of the nine works in this sweet dream of an exhibition sent over from London could easily be mistaken for paintings from the Frick's own incomparable collection tells you all you need to know about the quality on display. Rembrandt's ''Girl at a Window'' (1645) is the star of the show. Jean-Antoine Watteau's ''Plaisirs du Bal'' (about 1717) is a poetic, happy-sad vision of privileged indolence. Gerrit Dou's Vermeerish ''Woman Playing a Clavichord'' (1665) is preternaturally lucid. Nicolas Poussin's ''Nurture of Jupiter'' (1636-7), in which the toddler-age future king of the gods suckles a goat while a nymph holds him in her lap in a rocky landscape, is otherworldly. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CONTEMPLATING THE VOID: INTERVENTIONS IN THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM,' through April 28. In what it calls ''a self-reflexive folly,'' the museum completes the 50th-birthday festivities for Frank Lloyd Wright's building by inviting more than 200 artists, architects and designers to have their way with the landmark rotunda -- imaginatively speaking, of course. Some 193 responded, usually in digital photographs, depicting it as everything from a place to exhibit their work; to a site for trampolines, forests and aquariums; to a jumping-off point for a redesign. The architects tend to be more Oedipal, but not one really improves upon the space. The list of invitees, while global, is a trifle predictable, overloaded with sculptors and installation artists and noticeably short on painters and photographers, who also have imaginations. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'TWILIGHT VISIONS: SURREALISM, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PARIS,' through May 9. Considering how revolutionary Surrealist photography was back in the day, it may seem paradoxical that nostalgia would be the mood suffusing this resonant exhibition. But it makes sense. Caught in the throes of sweeping change in the cultural capital of the Western world, photographers like Andre Kerte, Ilse Bing, Man Ray and others were as preoccupied with what was being lost as with what might be gained by modernization, and the images they made are darkly meditative. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through August 1. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' continuing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation of one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE,' through May 9. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kinds of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. ( Cotter)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Annibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'BIGGER, BETTER, MORE: THE ART OF VIOLA FREY,' through May 2. Viola Frey's giant ceramic sculptures of men and women are among the underappreciated wonders of late-20th-century art. Rising 11 feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness. With their blank or seemingly angry expressions, they may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARINA ABRAMOVIC: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT,' through May 31. The long-building energy wave of performance art hits the Museum of Modern Art with this four-decade survey of work by one of the form's more visible and magnetic figures. And the show's combination of stressed-out bare flesh on film and live bodies, some nude, in the galleries, makes pretty radical fare for the museum. The exhibition is part true endurance-test grit, part pure diva hokum. And it comes with a mission: to demonstrate that it is possible to preserve an ephemeral medium through live re-creations of past work in a museum setting. The demonstration falls flat, but Ms. Abramovic herself is performing a new piece. It consists of her sitting absolutely still and staring straight ahead in MoMA's atrium for almost the entire time the museum is open during the show's run, an estimated 716 hours and 30 minutes, all told. Visitors are invited to participate by taking a seat across from her and meeting her gaze. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: FIVE THEMES,' through May 17. This well-designed exhibition of prints, drawings, films and film installations from the last 30 years showcases the artist's dazzling fusion of charcoal drawing and stop-action animation to excellent effect. The 1990 animations that meditate on the ravages of apartheid remain especially powerful. As the show traces a kind of progression away from, and back to, political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio, it also traces his growing role in his own work, first as image, then as actor. And with a forthrightness that is almost touching, the exhibition also confirms that in the contest between still and moving images, moving almost always wins. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)
 NEW MUSEUM: 'SKIN FRUIT: SELECTIONS FROM THE DAKIS JOANNOU COLLECTION,' through June 6. This exhibition of works from the collection of a New Museum trustee selected and installed by the art star Jeff Koons might conceivably have pulled a rabbit out of its ethically sticky headgear. Instead it teems with usual suspects, and its overcrowding benefits no one, especially the several larger, more admittedly festivalist works that form its high points. This museum has some rethinking to do, and high on the list should be coming to grips with the size and limitations of its often poorly proportioned galleries. Ultimately the air of complicity is less disturbing than the look of complacency. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through April 25. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,' through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of brand-new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the fact that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: '2010 WHITNEY BIENNIAL,' through May 30. In the spirit of the economically bleak two years it represents, the Whitney has made efforts to under-pitch its 2010 Biennial, and the show lives up -- and down -- to its billing. There are fewer artists than in the past. Its installation is spartan. Spectacle is out. Much of what's in is quiet and hermetic to the point of looking blank. The prevailing aesthetic is the art of the tweak, minute variations on conventional forms and historical styles: abstract paintings stitched like quilts, performance pieces channeling the 1960s, and so. The show feels empty where it reflects the retrenched, art-about-art spirit of the moment. But it also has strong work, particularly in video and photography, that speaks of life beyond the art factory. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 MILTON AVERY: 'INDUSTRIAL REVELATIONS,' through May 1. This knockout exhibition is the first exhaustive look at the artist's depictions of New York City's waterways, bridges and railroad yards from the late 1920s and early '30s, a period most associated with his portraits. But here he is out in the open, already summoning the deft abbreviations of form, space and light that would dominate his mature, far more pastoral landscapes. With more than three dozen works -- one-third of them oils -- this show provides an exciting new view of Avery's development and reminds us that his many-splendored achievement is still not fully visible. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street , (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com. (Smith)
 OTTO DIX, through Aug. 30. The first Dix retrospective in this country provides heady glimpses of the achievement of this ''wild man'' of German art. Few things escaped his remorseless eye -- from the horrors of World War I to the hypocrisies of the Weimar Republic. He made every stop on the itinerary of German modernism (including Realism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, folk, visionary), had a few Cubist moments and, of course, qualified as ''degenerate'' under the Nazis. This exhibition of more than 100 paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings (organized with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) doesn't have the scope -- or the space -- to do Dix justice, but it begins to make up for lost time. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
 ED PASCHKE, through April 24. In his toxically glowing paintings of circus freaks, extreme dandies, tattooed ladies and hairy, wingtip shoes from the 1970s and '80s, this Chicago Imagist who died in 2004 explored the dark side of Pop Art. Later paintings look as if broadcast by a television on acid. Jeff Koons, Mr. Paschke's student, assistant and friend, selected the works in this terrific show.

 'JANET CARDIFF & GEORGE BURES MILLER,' through May 1. Few artists work with sound more inventively and with a cannier sense of theater than the Canadians Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller. The main attraction here is ''The Carnie,'' an antique children's carousel in a dark room that looks like something you'd encounter in a ''Twilight Zone'' episode. As it revolves, speakers broadcast ominous, cacophonous modern music by the electronic composer Freida Abtan. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street , (212) 206-9100, luhringaugustine.com. (Johnson)
 R. CRUMB: 'THE BIBLE ILLUMINATED: R. CRUMB'S BOOK OF GENESIS,' through April 17. Loaded with sex, violence, visions and miracles, the stories in the Book of Genesis of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Lot and his daughters, David and Goliath and many others seem custom-made for Mr. Crumb's bawdy sensibility and earthy draftsmanship. His 207 richly hatched, firmly delineated drawings bring to unruly, comical life people and events that often seem puzzlingly abstract in the Bible, from the seven days of creation to the happy death of Joseph at 110 in Egypt. David Zwirner Gallery, 519 West 19th Street , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)
 BANKS VIOLETTE, through April 17. This show has something of a comeback feeling. Its centerpiece is one of the artist's best efforts so far: a big, morose chandelier, made of white fluorescent lights hung low, that resembles a skeletal cabana or giant wind chime, despite the arctic light. Its black wiring spreads like tendrils across the floor to a bank of outlets in a big road case that a rock band might use. Opposite, enormous, rumpled planes of Mr. Violette's signature black fiberglass refract the light of the chandelier. They suggest abstract outcroppings, collapsing billboards and rock arena sets. They're a bit vacuous, but have never been better used. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street , (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)
 Galleries: SoHo
 JOSEF ALBERS/KEN PRICE, through June 5. Pairing a German abstract painter and color theorist, Josef Albers (1888-1976), and a ceramic sculptor, Ken Price (born 1935), is a bit of curatorial genius that can make your eyes feel attached to a bigger, better brain. An intricate dovetailing of works spanning several mediums and decades clarifies their individual greatness. The shared passion for strong color juxtapositions is to be expected. Less so are passions for Modern architecture, pre-Columbian pyramids, stones, interior spaces (variously erotic, domestic or symbolic) and an oscillation between biomorphic and straight-edged form. Anyone interested in the curatorial arts should see this thrilling show, among the best and most timely to grace a New York commercial gallery. Brooke Alexander Gallery, 59 Wooster Street , (212) 925-4338, baeditions.com. (Smith)
 JOSEF ALBERS: 'FORMULATION: ARTICULATION, 1972,' through May 8. This headlong plunge into all things Josef Albers (1888-1976) presents a portfolio of 127 silk-screens that sum up his art and thought to a remarkable degree -- especially if you read the ''Statements of Content'' explaining each motif. A horizontal installation aids absorption, which can transform your understanding of both Albers in particular and abstraction in general, revealing it to be, unexpectedly, an art of everyday life. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street , (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES'; closes on Monday. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
 'PAINTINGS OF FELIX VALLOTTON'; closes on Saturday. The Swiss artist Felix Vallotton (1865-1925) was and still is much admired for his elegantly simplified, erotic woodcut prints. This show of paintings from 1905 to 1912, all depicting attractive young women in different states of dress and dishabille, is a revelation. Inspired by Ingres, these works offer a weird, frankly lubricious classicism. It would be great to see more. Michael Werner, 4 East 77 Street , (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Johnson)
 KEN PRICE: 'NEW SCULPTURE'; closes on Saturday. A dozen impressive new ceramic sculptures reflect the continued cultivation of Mr. Price's rich, ever evolving vocabulary of suggestive forms and his radiant palette of layered, exquisitely revealed colors. His biomorphic idiom has encompassed single shapes stretched to extremes and multiple forms fused to bumpy excess. Now combined shapes suggestive of sausage or Mallomars retain their integrity, while broadcasting intimations of the human form: entwined lovers, reclining odalisques and a seated, Matissean blue nude. But, as usual, that is only half the story. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)
 'THE BRUCENNIAL 2010: MISEDUCATION'; closes on Monday. This alternative to the Whitney Biennial is the brainchild of the Bruce High Quality Foundation, a five-artist collective that is also in the Whitney show and that is intent on placing some of the art world's more conspicuous functions, like education and the organizing of exhibitions, into artists' hands. The show's fun, but how alternative is it? With its floor-to-ceiling roster of young artists and veteran guest celebrities, it feels like the average Bring-Your-Art festival crossed with a Whitney Biennial of maybe 25 years ago. 350 West Broadway, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo , brucennial.com.

HEADLINE: Tax Files Show Harlem Art School's Path to Ruin

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE and RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
The Harlem School of the Arts, celebrated for equipping local children with skills in everything from dance to classical music, had for decades been a favorite of the city's most charitable donors.
 But in recent years, the nonprofit school sank into financial ruin: a $2 million surplus melted into a deficit of more than $1 million. A $1.5 million grant and the proceeds from a $1 million loan evaporated. Nearly half a million dollars in payroll taxes went unpaid.
 The consequences now seem clear: The school has closed its doors, perhaps forever, locking out neighborhood children who dreamed of competing with their moneyed counterparts around the city for coveted arts slots at high schools and colleges.
 ''It's devastating,'' said Linda Hall, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jalin, has taken classes there after school or on weekends for the past 10 years. ''It's like losing your best friend and knowing they can never come back to you.'' 
 School leaders, who are seeking what they describe as ''angels'' to provide a last-minute rescue, have recently blamed the national recession, which hurt many charitable organizations, for the difficulties. But in response to questions, the chairman of the school's board said the school's president was fired last year in part due to the financial problems, and the fact that she and others had failed to give the board a true picture of the payroll tax liability. 
 The New York Times pieced together the events that led to the collapse from interviews with current and former officials and an examination of the school's tax records. While there are conflicting accounts of who is to blame, the paperwork is breathtakingly straightforward.
 The school was in serious trouble well before the national downturn. Expenses soared and a hiring spree took place even as fund-raising plunged; independent audits ceased; the salary for the president and chief executive rose by nearly 50 percent even as some of the school's officials warned that the institution might not survive and advocated closing it temporarily to restore financial order.
 The Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a nonprofit entity that operates with public money, awarded the Harlem School of the Arts a $1.5 million grant in 2005 to hire a chief financial officer and a marketing director to strengthen its fund-raising efforts. But the school failed to meet benchmarks required by the grant, including keeping a marketing director, said Kenneth J. Knuckles, president of the empowerment zone.
 ''The fund-raising wasn't there, but their expenses continued to be the same while there were revenue shortfalls,'' Mr. Knuckles said. ''All of these things devastated the organization.'' He added, ''Certainly the management was not competent, based on everything we saw and everything we have learned in the last few months.''
 The school, which offers classes in music, theater, dance and visual arts, had typically served 3,000 students a year, with some receiving scholarships and others allowed to attend free. Its alumni have gone on to professional, even nationally renowned careers.
 State Senator Bill Perkins, whose district includes Harlem, said the school invigorated not only Harlem's struggling families, but also any parents who wanted their children's hopes to be realized in the arts.
 ''It's really one of the forerunners of many of the cultural enrichment programs that have sprung up through the years,'' Mr. Perkins said. ''It has been a cultural center that was iconic in how it enriched the lives of our children and really partnered in the parenting experience. 
 ''For those of us who are parents, it is very important to find a place, a haven, not just a safe haven but a haven that is culturally enriching.''
 Some of those who have been involved with the school over the decades said it had in some ways struggled since its dynamic leader of nearly two decades, Betty Allen, began edging toward retirement in the mid-1990s. Ms. Allen, a former mezzo-soprano for New York City Opera who died last year, sat on the board at Carnegie Hall and enlisted the support of the opera's benefactors for the school. 
 But even with the loss of its longtime leader, the school held its own for a time. As recently as 2003, its surplus remained at more than $2 million.
 The next year, however, contributions plummeted, falling to $1 million from $1.7 million, the start of a long slide. Yet the school's annual expenditures remained about $3 million. City contracts paying the Harlem School of the Arts to run arts programs in 13 public schools brought in some more money, including for additional staff members, said Camille Akeju, president of the school from 1999 to 2005. 
 Ms. Akeju, who is now director of the Smithsonian's Anacostia Community Museum in Washington, said she left the school believing that a listing ship had been righted.
 Yet William Terry, who succeeded Ms. Akeju, concluded otherwise within a year. He became convinced that the finances were so dire, the school needed to shut down for a year, said Rosa DeSoto, who was the school's controller then.
 Mr. Terry could not be reached for comment. Ms. DeSoto said the board did not seriously entertain the suggestion to close temporarily and hired a new president and chief executive, Kakuna Kerina, in October 2006.
 By then, the situation on paper was grim. It is unclear whether a sense of trouble, or other reasons, led some longtime donors to stop giving or limit their largess; the school's tax documents do not list individual donors.
 But three lines of credit totaling $250,000 were mostly exhausted. The school took on another loan, of $100,000, in September 2006. Fund-raising fell further, and the school's net assets were down to $1 million.
 Under Ms. Kerina, who had worked for nonprofit groups focused on international human rights issues and initiatives in Africa, the gap between spending and revenue rapidly expanded. 
 By June 2007, personnel costs had risen $500,000 from the prior year, to $2.8 million, even as revenue rose only slightly, thanks largely to fees collected for its programs. Fund-raising continued its decline, falling to half of what it had been in 2003. 
 To stay afloat, the school borrowed $1 million in April 2007 against the value of its building, on St. Nicholas Avenue near 134th Street. Thomas J. Bartunek, the board chairman from 2003 to 2008, said the maneuver was initiated by the board as a ''cash-flow bridge'' until measures to cut costs and increase revenue kicked in.
 But Mr. Bartunek said that having enough money to support the school's mission was always a challenge. 
 ''There was never a time during my experience on the board that we said, 'Ah, good, we're O.K.,' '' he said.
 Mr. Bartunek was at the time an employee of The New York Times Company, serving as president of WQXR-FM, the classical radio station. Last year, the Times Company sold the radio station, where Mr. Bartunek still works as a consultant.
 Ms. DeSoto said the numbers were in the annual tax filings for all to see. She said her warnings were ignored by the board and Ms. Kerina, whom she blamed for misusing the empowerment zone grant money on an unsupportable hiring binge. 
 ''She was just spending the money, but no money was coming in,'' Ms. DeSoto said. ''The money was going toward payroll and unnecessary expenditures, doing various events, dinners and stuff like that.''
 But even as the school's chances for survival dimmed, the board paid Ms. Kerina $161,539, nearly 50 percent more than Ms. Akeju had been paid, according to tax records. 
 By June 2008, the last period for which the school has filed a tax return, expenses had climbed to $4.6 million, a jump of more than $1 million in two years. With revenues down, the school recorded a deficit of $1.8 million. 
 Ms. Kerina left last year. 
 Reached by telephone on Thursday night, Ms. Kerina said she had briefed the board every month about the school's dire financial condition. She said she had inherited an organization that was already overspending. 
 ''Going into a situation like that is going to be hard,'' she said. ''You're going to have to pay for the sins of those who came before you, because you're the one who is there. I think part of the problem, to a certain extent, is that there was never urgency to address the situation.''
 The situation appears to have worsened since the last tax filing. In November, the Internal Revenue Service placed a lien on the school for failing to pay $433,953 in payroll taxes. 
 One executive at an agency that had provided a life-saving grant for the school withdrew half of it because of the liens and because the school's books had not been subjected to an independent audit since 2007.
 Christopher Paci, who has been a member of the school's board for four years and its chairman since 2008, said the board last summer fired Ms. Kerina and the controller who succeeded Ms. DeSoto when it learned the depth of the problems. 
 He said the two had misrepresented the reason for the tax arrears and falsely asserted they had made arrangements to catch up with installment payments. He added that Ms. Kerina had failed to develop a long-term strategy and maintain strong financial controls.
 ''Put yourself in the board's shoes, and finding out, it all adds up to what led the board to lose confidence,'' Mr. Paci said.
 John W. Corwin, the interim president and chief executive, said in a memorandum to parents that the school had also recently secured a $500,000 grant and reduced staffing and other expenses. 
 The board had expected to announce a decision on the school's ultimate fate on Thursday, but has postponed that reckoning for another two weeks. 
 Ms. Akeju, the former president, said the school's closing was personal for her. As a 13-year-old girl in 1964, she was a member of its first classes for visual arts. 
 ''It was the first time I saw people that looked just like me doing the things that I loved to do,'' she said. ''You could make it as an artist. You could be an opera singer. Before that it was just a fantasy. It really changed my life.''

HEADLINE: Stellar Gains At Retailers In March

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
The nation's retailers reported their strongest monthly sales growth in a decade on Thursday, with robust gains in virtually every category of merchandise and every type of store.
 The industry collectively posted a 9.1 percent sales increase at stores open at least a year, according to Thomson Reuters. That was the strongest result since the group began tracking the figures in 2000. 
 Analysts polled ahead of time by Thomson Reuters had lofty expectations for March, but the results released Thursday handily beat the 6.3 percent increase they had predicted. 
 ''This really seems to herald the end of the consumer spending slowdown,'' said Bill Dreher, senior research analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. ''Consumers across the entire spectrum are spending. It's department stores, it's discount stores, warehouse clubs -- it's in all subcategories in retailing, which is new.'' 
 For many months, in the depths of the recession, discount chains were the sole type of retailers showing gains as consumers pinched pennies. A recovery in retailing has been gathering strength for months, showing up first at the high end; now stores catering to every class of shopper are benefiting. 
 Thursday's results were the seventh consecutive month of gains in sales at stores open for more than 12 months.
 Retailers urged a measure of caution in interpreting the results, however. While they are all relieved to be growing again, the recession was such a brutal experience that they are not quite ready to celebrate.
 A major caveat was that Easter fell a week earlier this year, which retailers said helped drive March sales, most likely at the expense of their April results. A clearer picture of the industry's health will emerge next month, when analysts are able to look at the combined results for March and April.
 Sherif Mityas, a partner in the retail practice of A. T. Kearney, a management consulting company, described the industry mood as ''muted exuberance.''
 After all, retailers are comparing their results with those of March 2009, the bottom of the recession. At that time, the industry posted a 5 percent sales decline at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 Discount chains like Costco and BJ's Wholesale Club grew during the recession as consumers traded down, but most retailers' sales fell sharply. Even with the recent gains, their dollar volume is still down from the height of the boom in 2006 and 2007. 
 For instance, in March 2007, Macy's reported total sales of $2.288 billion. Its total sales in March were $2.143 billion. Saks had March 2007 sales of $284.3 million. Its sales last month were $238.2 million. 
 Still, many retailing analysts said last month's results were too strong and too broad to be dismissed as merely the result of Easter shopping or easy year-over-year comparisons. They do not expect the April numbers to be as good as those in March, but they think consumer psychology has turned a corner.
 ''This is no flash in the pan,'' Mr. Dreher said. ''This is the beginning of a new trend.'' 
 There have been other broad signs of economic recovery too, like improving sales of automobiles and a better job market. Retailing analysts pointed out that major chains were now selling more merchandise at full price, which bodes well for their next reporting periods. 
 Target said in a news release that it was on track to exceed profit plans for the quarter, by 10 cents or more. Other chains, like Macy's, Bon-Ton and Ross Stores, also said their results exceeded expectations. Some raised their predictions about future earnings, including J. C. Penney and Aeropostale. 
 ''Consumers are generally feeling better about their plight and are finally making discretionary purchases,'' Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm, said Thursday in a report.
 That was reflected in sales of clothing. Even department stores, a sector that had been struggling for years, are showing gains.
 ''Those are some stellar results for chains that were a bit beaten up even before the recession,'' Mr. Mityas said. ''They're hitting the ground running almost better than the specialty apparel retailers and the discounters.'' 
 Sales climbed year-over-year at Nordstrom (up 16.8 percent), Saks (up 12.7 percent), and Neiman Marcus (up 9.2 percent).
 Midrange chains were also strong. Same-store sales increased at Bon-Ton (up 11.4 percent), Macy's (up 10.8 percent), Dillard's (up 9 percent), and J. C. Penney (up 5.4 percent). Kohl's was a standout, with same-store sales up 22.5 percent compared with a year ago. In a news release, the chain said higher customer traffic drove the double-digit increase. 
 In fact, same-store sales at all sorts of clothing chains, be they in a mall or a big box, were healthy: up 19 percent at Aeropostale, up 15 percent at American Eagle and Limited Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works), up 14 percent at the discount chain Ross Stores, up 12 percent at TJX (which owns chains including TJ Maxx and Marshalls), up 11 percent at Gap and up 5 percent at Abercrombie & Fitch. 
 The exception was Hot Topic, which posted a 7.5 percent same-store sales decline. Last year the chain's March sales had increased 7.1 percent, a result that was outside the industry norm and driven in part by movie-related vampire merchandise. 
 Discount chains continued to do well, as they did throughout the recession, though they were outperformed last month by clothing stores. Same-store sales increased 10.6 percent at BJ's Wholesale Club, 10.3 percent at Target and 10 percent at Costco. 
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, does not report monthly sales. The International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry group, expects April same-store sales for the retailing industry to be flat to down about 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Contrition, and Lack of It, at Citigroup Hearing

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The two men who steered Citigroup into the eye of the financial storm offered a striking contrast on Thursday.
 Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup's former chairman and chief executive, abased himself before the federal panel investigating the causes of the crisis, apologizing repeatedly for the billions of dollars in losses at an institution that ended up the recipient of $45 billion of taxpayer aid. 
 But Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, faced withering questions from the panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, for his spare expressions of remorse. Repeatedly playing down his role as chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup's board, he was met with anger and disbelief. 
 ''You were either pulling the levers or asleep at the switch,'' Philip N. Angelides, the committee's chairman, told him. 
 After three hours of testimony, Mr. Prince emerged as dignified though blameworthy. Mr. Rubin, the consummate wise man of Washington and Wall Street, looked demoralized.
 In the second of three days of hearings this week, commission members dug into myriad reasons behind Citigroup's collapse. They depicted a company so troubled that its crisis meetings were called ''Def-Con calls'' and so callous to risks that its regulators were confounded.
 But the bulk of the hearing was spent assessing the men's responsibility for a company that has come to represent the concept of ''too big to fail.''
 Mr. Prince tried to get ahead of the criticism by departing from his prepared statement to offer an abject apology. 
 ''I'm sorry the financial crisis has had such a devastating impact for our country,'' Mr. Prince said. ''I'm sorry about the millions of people, average Americans, who lost their homes. And I'm sorry that our management teams, starting with me, like so many others could not see the unprecedented market collapse that lay before us.''
 His unusually blunt statement of remorse seemed to take some of the oxygen out of a series of hearings more accustomed to corporate legalese. 
 Mr. Rubin stopped short of accepting personal responsibility. He grudgingly conceded that a few savvy investors saw the crisis coming, asserting that nearly everyone in the financial services industry had failed to see a dozen powerful forces -- from excessive debt levels to trade imbalance -- come together in a perfect storm. 
 ''We all bear responsibility for not recognizing this, and I deeply regret that,'' Mr. Rubin said. 
 Mr. Rubin's stance left several members of the panel angry. Mr. Rubin earned more than $100 million during a decade at Citigroup. But he emphasized that period less than he did his tenure as a co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs, where he worked before joining the Clinton administration. 
 Mr. Angelides, a former California state treasurer and a fellow Democrat, did not buy it. ''You were not a garden-variety board member,'' he said. ''I think to most people chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors implies leadership. Certainly $15 million a year guaranteed implies leadership and responsibility.''
 Mr. Rubin maintained that his role had been misconstrued, saying that Citigoup's executive committee met infrequently and ''wasn't a substantive part of the decision-making process.'' He reiterated that his employment contract explicitly exempted him from operational duties.
 Mr. Angelides was so critical of that explanation that Mr. Prince spoke up for Mr. Rubin. 
 ''It is absolutely incorrect to suggest that Mr. Rubin had central responsibility, or any central responsibility for what happened to Citigroup,'' Mr. Prince said.
 Bill Thomas, a former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, assailed both executives for accepting millions of dollars in pay. He also leveled criticism at four Citigroup executives who oversaw the mortgage desk at the heart of the bank's troubles and who testified on Wednesday. Together, they earned $150 million as business boomed. 
 ''That same team, on the way down, didn't have a nickel clawed back,'' Mr. Thomas said angrily. 
 Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Prince spoke in personal terms about the impact of Citi's troubles on his own net worth.
 ''As I sit here today, I own nearly every share of stock that I acquired in a nearly 30-year career,'' he said. ''I have watched it go from $50 to nearly $30 to less than $1 a share.''
 Mr. Prince has kept a relatively low profile since resigning under pressure in November 2007. Now a corporate adviser, he is an avid golfer and spends much of his time in Palm Beach, Fla. 
 After the hearing, Mr. Prince stuck around to shake hands with commission members. ''I'm a private citizen. I feel great,'' he said. In contrast, Mr. Rubin raced out of the hearing room. 
 Though Mr. Rubin has many friends within the Obama administration and on Wall Street, he has kept a low profile since leaving Citigroup in January 2009. He keeps a Park Avenue office at the Council on Foreign Relations. He was a mentor to Timothy F. Geithner, now Treasury secretary. Mr. Rubin also is trying to revitalize the Hamilton Project, an economic policy group.
 But it was Mr. Prince who was more expansive on Thursday. He weighed in with policy prescriptions, arguing that consolidating banking regulation would ''lend itself to greater probity for the industry.'' Mr. Rubin said he supported individualized financial advice for ''the most vulnerable consumers,'' though he added that it would be expensive.
 When questioned about derivatives regulation by Brooksley E. Born, Mr. Rubin said his past reservations were grounded in legal concerns. Ms. Born, a former regulator who had clashed with him over derivatives during the Clinton administration, quoted from Mr. Rubin's best-selling 2003 memoir to draw out his position on regulation. 
 Mr. Rubin got somewhat testy when he was asked about a risk assessment conducted by federal supervisors in November 2007, soon after the bank reported gigantic losses related to subprime mortgages. The report noted poor communication between business units and lax controls. 
 ''I think you should read the reports before the crisis developed,'' not just the autopsy, he responded. 
 Mr. Thomas told both men that contrition was not enough. ''To make the argument that somehow a simple apology still allows you to maintain a profile of income based upon what devastated everybody else doesn't fit the scale test,'' he said, ''no matter how often you feel really, really sad about what happened.''

HEADLINE: From Mortal to Messiah to a Screen Near You?

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
A San Francisco economist who was declared the messiah by followers of a U.F.O.-centric New Age group could soon enter a new realm of idolatry: Hollywood.
 A film producer has approached Raj Patel, the Potrero Hill author of the best-selling economics book ''The Value of Nothing,'' about making a movie. It would not be about his writings, but about the way his life was hijacked earlier this year by members of the group that Mr. Patel describes as ''a cut-rate Scientology.'' At the same time, a leader of the sect, Share International, appeared in San Francisco this week to publicly condemn both the frenzy surrounding Mr. Patel and the newspaper columnist who first reported the story -- me.
These are the latest plot twists in a tale that has led to global news media coverage and thrust Mr. Patel into a situation he does not want, one that seems to get increasingly like a Coen brothers movie in which small misdeeds and mishaps are magnified to freakish proportions by the foibles of everyone involved. 
 Mr. Patel's e-mail in box was flooded with messages of devotion after followers of Share International decided he was the Messiah for All Faiths, or Maitreya, whose arrival had just been heralded by their leader, Benjamin Creme. Web sites and documentaries proclaiming his holiness went up online, and followers flew in from across the country to be in Mr. Patel's presence. 
 Because the prophecy said that Maitreya would refuse to confirm his identity, the more Mr. Patel denied it was he, the more the furor increased. 
 After the original column was published, Mr. Creme angrily responded from London that his beliefs had been misrepresented.
 But while he said it was not possible for Mr. Patel to be the messiah, he did so somewhat elliptically, saying his followers were free to believe what they wished. This ambiguity allowed the story to flourish, which made Mr. Creme and Share International the focus of ridicule on four continents. 
 The Colbert Report broadcast a hilarious send-up, and Britain's tabloids turned Mr. Patel, a native of London, into the celebrity du jour. In the process, they hounded him more aggressively than the believers.
 ''It confirmed my worst impressions of the British press,'' Mr. Patel said.
 With each retelling, facts devolved to become more sensational. Newspapers reported that Mr. Creme and Share International had chosen Mr. Patel their messiah (not true -- it was the followers of the group, not the group itself) and referred to the group as a ''cult.''
 It was against this backdrop that Michiko Ishikawa of Share International spoke to a standing-room-only crowd on Easter in the Koret Auditorium at the San Francisco Main Library. She blamed me and my column for the disdain the group had received, and erroneously said I had labeled the sect a cult.
 She also explained some of her group's beliefs. 
 She said that Mr. Creme had been aboard a spaceship, and that ''space brothers'' had regularly intervened on earth to prevent catastrophes, most notably quelling the Cuban missile crisis and limiting destruction from the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
 Ms. Ishikawa also spoke of cancer cures during her 90-minute power-point presentation, and showed a card with a photo of Maitreya's handprint available for purchase for $1. (She is scheduled to speak at the Bernal Heights library on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. Mr. Creme plans to visit San Francisco in August.)
 While this roadshow proceeds, Mr. Patel said his agent, ICM, had been approached by a Hollywood film producer who wanted to buy the rights to his life. He would not release details, but said the producer was associated with mainstream theatrical releases of dark comedies.
 Mr. Patel finds his predicament farcical. ''It's just absurd in many, many ways,'' he said, noting that his work in economics asks ordinary people to come up with their own solutions to intractable problems and not rely on leaders.
 ''It is a very Hollywood premise,'' he said of his situation. ''The guy who says, 'Don't wait for The One' is declared The One.''
 Mr. Patel dismissed the idea of a movie, though he allowed himself a few moments to daydream about which actors would be cast in a film adaptation.
 He thought he might be portrayed by Sendhil Ramamurthy, an actor from the television show ''Heroes'' who looks enough like Mr. Patel to cause some confusion. ''Either him or a Baldwin,'' Mr. Patel said, or perhaps Sacha Baron Cohen, the star of ''Borat'' and a classmate of Mr. Patel from Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School outside London.
 Daydreams aside, there has been one upside to this buzz: sales of ''The Value of Nothing'' are up in England. For a treatise on economics, one might consider that a miracle.

HEADLINE: United Chief On 3rd Verse Of Old Tune

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
When Glenn F. Tilton took the helm at United Airlines eight years ago, he inherited an airline that was fighting for its life. 
 It hasn't gotten easier since. 
 His tenure has since mirrored the roller-coaster ride of the entire industry, as United has gone in and out of bankruptcy, had contentious relations with its unions and suffered steep losses. Even as the airline has sought to cut capacity and reduce costs, it has had only one profitable year since Mr. Tilton took over in 2002.
 Now, Mr. Tilton is seeking once more to find salvation in a tie-up with a competing airline. But as United and US Airways resume their merger talks -- the third go-round since 2000 -- one question remains: Is Mr. Tilton simply trying to make the best of a weak hand?
 He has long been a champion of merging airlines to restore consistent profits in the bruising world of airline competition. Along the way, he has held talks with most of the major carriers, courted Continental Airlines and even Delta Air Lines, and rhapsodized at length about the benefits of consolidation. 
 ''If you've attended a lunch where Glenn Tilton has spoken in the past eight years, he would dust off the same index card about the need for consolidation,'' said Robert W. Mann, an airline analyst based in Port Washington, N.Y. ''He has been very consistent, very determined and will not be deterred.''
 Mr. Tilton was not available for comment on Thursday.
 A combination of United and US Airways would create the second-largest United States carrier by traffic. The merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, completed at the beginning of this year, created the current industry leader. 
 United and US Airways have not commented, but people who had been briefed on the discussions said on Wednesday that the airlines were discussing a merger. Wall Street investors and analysts welcomed the news. Shares of all airlines rose sharply on Thursday, as investors speculated on other possible mergers. 
 US Airways shares rose 10.7 percent, to close at $7.55. Shares of UAL Corporation, the parent company of United, rose by 6.75 percent, to $20.23. 
 ''The potential for additional industry consolidation is an unambiguous positive,'' wrote Gary Chase, an airline analyst at Barclays Capital. He estimated that a combination of United and US Airways would result in cost savings of $250 million to $400 million a year. 
 A long-time energy executive, Mr. Tilton joined United in 2002 after serving as chairman of Texaco until it was bought by Chevron. Once at the airline, he brought in a new management team but could not avoid bankruptcy after his application for government loan guarantees after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was turned down. 
 What followed was the industry's longest bankruptcy proceedings, dragging on for more than three years. While many airlines have sought Chapter 11 protection to restructure their operations, Mr. Tilton used the lengthy proceedings to force pay and benefit cuts on flight attendants, pilots and mechanics, and slashed employee pensions. 
 Along the way, Mr. Tilton alienated both United pilots and flight attendants, who have called for his resignation.
 Capt. Wendy Morse, who represents United pilots, said the merger talks had caused a ''great deal of consternation among the pilots.'' 
 Mo Garfinkle, a veteran airline consultant who is close to Mr. Tilton and United, said Mr. Tilton was often not given enough credit. ''Glenn was laughed at by people in the industry when he joined, but he is probably the most underestimated and undervalued chief executive in the business,'' Mr. Garfinkle said. 
 The airline industry has been losing money for much of the last decade. It has been pounded by a succession of troubles, starting with the Sept. 11 attacks, followed by the outbreak of the respiratory disease SARS in late 2002, then high fuel costs and finally, a major recession that cut deeply into travel. 
 Last year, United lost $651 million, a relative improvement from its staggering loss of $5.4 billion in 2008, at a time when oil prices surged. The company says it has been actively working to reduce its capacity, grounding 100 planes and raising new revenue through fees. 
 On Wednesday, United said that its average revenue per passenger per available seat mile, an industry metric representing how much money it earned from carrying one passenger for one mile, had increased 21.5 to 23.5 percent last month over March 2009. Compared with March 2008, last month's revenue was 3.2 to 5.2 percent higher.
 ''A big part of the story here is how we've gone from being worst to first in a number of categories,'' said Jean Medina, a company spokeswoman. 
 Perhaps more puzzling about the talks is why United, and Mr. Tilton, are still pursing a merger with US Airways. After all, that airline is not the preferred candidate for United. Continental Airlines would seem a more likely partner since its routes and international network are a far better match. United actively courted Continental in 2008, but Continental eventually walked away from a deal because of United's poor financial health. 
 In the end, though, the issue in the airline business may not be who is the better match. 
 ''Airlines are an ego-driven business,'' Mr. Mann said. ''I joke, but only partly, that the three biggest issues in airline consolidation are: What are we going to call it? Where is it going to be based? And who is going to run it?'' 
 As it turns out, W. Douglas Parker, the chief executive of US Airways, has also been a strong proponent of mergers in the industry. In 2006, he made an unsuccessful bid for Delta, but was rebuffed. Before that, Mr. Parker led America West before it merged with US Airways in 2005.
 Since deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s, overcapacity has been an issue, and explains why many airlines fail to earn adequate returns.
 ''We believe the industry needs to evolve into a more rational structure, and that consolidation may be part of that outcome, as it has in telecommunication industry,'' said Thomas W. Horton, chief financial officer of AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines. ''We have an industry that is too fragmented, with too many competitors, and with different ideas of capacity, pricing and strategic activity.''
 Mr. Tilton still has many obstacles to overcome to complete a deal. Mergers in the industry are tough to put into practice, and many of the expected savings fail to materialize as they are gobbled up by new contracts and pay raises for employees. 
 Antitrust issues might also be a challenge, said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who served as an adviser to the Justice Department in 2000, when a previous merger attempt between US Airways and United failed.
 ''Tell me exactly, why you need to be big to compete?'' Mr. Borenstein asked. ''You also hear at the same time that you need to be small to compete, and that Southwest is eating your lunch. So it's inconsistent.''

HEADLINE: China Seems Set To Loosen Hold On Its Currency

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Michael Wines contributed reporting from Beijing and Li Bibo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese government is preparing to announce in the coming days that it will allow its currency to strengthen slightly and vary more from day to day, people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday. The move would help ease tension with the Obama administration about the United States' huge trade deficit with China. 
 China's exports have been bolstered by its policy of keeping its currency, known as the renminbi or yuan, pegged at a nearly fixed rate to the dollar. Many members of Congress and economists say that by spending several hundred billion dollars each year to hold down the value of the renminbi, China has made its exports extremely competitive in foreign markets and taken away sales from manufacturers in the United States and other countries. 
 But if China allows only a small move in the renminbi, the effects on the American trade deficit may also be small. Chinese companies are formidably competitive and, while labor costs are rising in China, transportation and communication costs are plunging because of heavy investment in new expressways and rail lines.
 A marginally stronger renminbi would make Chinese goods only marginally more expensive in the United States and make American goods slightly cheaper in China, which is now exporting more than four times as much to the United States as it imports.
 The move is being made for domestic policy reasons in China, primarily as an inflation-fighting tool, people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday. While any announcement could still be delayed, China's central bank appears to have prevailed with its arguments within the Chinese leadership for a stronger but more flexible currency, these people said.
 Insisting on anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue in Beijing, they predicted that China's policy shift could easily occur before President Hu Jintao arrives in Washington next week for discussions with President Obama and other world leaders on improving nuclear security.
 Administration officials, especially Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, have publicly kept quiet to avoid giving the impression that a currency policy shift by China was a result of American pressure, instead of a decision based on what was best for the Chinese economy. Mr. Geithner maintained that silence on Thursday, holding meetings with senior officials in Hong Kong before flying in midafternoon to Beijing for a brief stopover and a meeting with Vice Premier Wang Qishan.
 A terse Treasury statement after the meeting with Mr. Wang noted only that the two men ''exchanged views on U.S.-China economic relations, the global economic situation and issues relating to the upcoming economic track dialogue of the second U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, to be held in Beijing in late May.''
 Chinese officials have been publicly wrangling over what to do about the currency for a month. The central bank favors a prompt move, while the Commerce Ministry, aligned with exporters, has opposed currency appreciation. The Obama administration has stayed scrupulously silent, fearing that public comments could backfire by stirring a nationalist reaction in Beijing against international pressure. 
 Holding down the value of the renminbi through huge currency market intervention has become an enormous expense for China. The central bank spent 9.2 percent of the country's economic output last year on the purchase of foreign reserves, mainly Treasuries that are now paying low interest.
 A stronger renminbi could prove to be a mixed blessing for the United States. If China cuts back sharply on purchases of Treasuries, then the Obama administration could find it harder to finance American budget deficits. 
 But with the Chinese economy booming, a small move in the renminbi may still leave the central bank struggling with trade surpluses and a tide of speculative investment into China. That could force it to continue buying Treasuries with the extra dollars.
 Allowing wider variation in the currency would also make it easier for China's central bank to fight inflation, which Wen Jiabao, the premier, identified last month as a top concern for the leadership. Consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher in February than a year earlier, after prices were falling as recently as last October. Inflation is accelerating in China faster than most Western economists expected.
 A stronger currency helps hold down prices by making imports cheaper. It also gives China's central bank more room to raise interest rates and brake economic growth while lessening the risk of drawing more speculative investments into the country. 
 A slightly stronger renminbi that fluctuates each day against the dollar would mainly hurt low-margin, labor-intensive industries in China like shoes and textiles. Many Beijing officials have been worried about job losses in these industries if the currency appreciates. 
 Much of this production is already starting to move out of China, notably to Vietnam and Bangladesh, where labor costs have stayed low. And Chinese factories producing these goods have been struggling to find enough workers over the last two months as the economy grew powerfully this winter, stimulated by heavy bank lending, strong demand for workers in the retail sector and rising government spending on high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure investments. 
 In 2005, China allowed the renminbi to jump 2 percent overnight against the dollar and then trade in a wider daily range, with a trend toward further strengthening against the dollar. For its coming policy shift, China may follow a similar pattern, but officials may emphasize much more in public remarks that the value of the renminbi can fall as well as rise on any given day. That would help discourage a flood of speculative money into China from investors betting on rapid further appreciation in the currency, said people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing.
 Xia Bin, a member of the monetary policy committee of the Chinese central bank, hinted at the new policy for the currency while attending a forum in Shanghai on Thursday. 
 ''Whether to let the yuan slowly appreciate or let it rise to a tolerable range after careful calculation, I think it is better to have that quick, prompt appreciation,'' he said, according to news service reports. 
 Mr. Xia later added that, ''At a certain point, when necessary, it is better to have a quick, prompt appreciation in a bid to fend off speculative capital.'' 
 But Mr. Xia, who spoke after others had already described an emerging consensus in Beijing in favor of a small move in the currency, cautioned that no one should expect a ''large, one-time'' appreciation of the renminbi of the sort that many members of Congress have sought.
 The central bank declined to comment on its currency plans.

HEADLINE: Here's Why I'm So Glum

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Why So Glum? Numbers Point to a Recovery'' (High & Low Finance column, front page, April 9): 
 Floyd Norris urges Americans to be more optimistic about the hopes for economic recovery, yet I am loath to follow his advice until I start to see a recovery around me.
 An unemployment rate of 9.7 percent means that most of us know at least half a dozen people who have been devastated by the recession. 
 The figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the ensuing debate come every month, but every day I hear stories about friends and family members who realize that they have no choice but to go on Medicaid or move back with parents. They watch as their chances of getting a good job fade into the distance as the gap on their resume grows.
 For the sake of all of these people, we cannot look at these numbers, wipe our hands and proclaim the job done.
 I will be optimistic when my loved ones start seeing tangible changes.

HEADLINE: Return of Vazquez Leads To Humbling of Yankees

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Joe Girardi's strides were long and purposeful as he approached the mound in the sixth inning Friday night, as if he were late for an appointment. Javier Vazquez placed the ball in Girardi's hand and walked toward the dugout, his pace slow and deliberate, as if he had bad news to deliver.
 It came in the form of the Yankees' 9-3 loss to the Rays that, six years later, seemed like a continuation of Vazquez's last time in pinstripes. 
 His second tour with the Yankees began like his first one ended, with a dreadful outing that generated flashbacks to that forgettable 2004 conclusion. The carnage Friday included eight hits -- a pair of two-run homers -- three walks and one very frustrated starting pitcher.
 ''The first three innings, I was making good pitches and being aggressive,'' Vazquez said. ''And then, I didn't make good pitches after that.''
 And so for a night, Vazquez, acquired from Atlanta in December, looked miscast in the Yankees' projected role for him: a No. 4 starter disguised as someone better. That description belonged to David Price, the Rays' electrifying 24-year-old left-hander, who overpowered the Yankees through seven and two-thirds innings. His fastball reached the upper 90s, his changeup was sharp and his curveball was better. 
 In ascending to the ranks of the American League elite, the Rays have collected a stable of outstanding young pitching -- James Shields, at 28, is their oldest starter -- with Price, the No. 1 overall pick in 2007, leading the way. His first three strikeouts came on 97-mile-per-hour fastballs to Nick Johnson, Alex Rodriguez and Robinson Cano, the second and third looking. 
 ''I mean, I was hoping he would make a mistake, and he never really made any mistakes today,'' said Mark Teixeira, who went 0 for 4 and is now hitless in his first 16 at-bats, tying his season-opening stretch from 2003, when he was a rookie with Texas. ''We hit a couple of balls hard off him, but he pitched pretty darn well.''
 The same cannot be said for Vazquez, who struggled whenever he pitched from the stretch. He said he concentrated on the Rays' base runners, intent on not letting them steal, but he instead started to rush and was unable to regain his rhythm. 
 ''You know you're doing it, but you still can't correct it,'' catcher Jorge Posada said. 
 Vazquez joined the Yankees before the 2004 season and was labeled an ace in waiting. He left a year later viewed as a disappointment, remembered more for the grand slam he allowed to Johnny Damon in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series than for making the All-Star team. As the Yankees plotted how to improve their rotation this past off-season, they kept coming back to Vazquez, who by following C. C. Sabathia, A. J. Burnett and Andy Pettitte in the rotation would be under less pressure to star.
 The Yankees' use of a three-man rotation during the postseason only highlighted a need for a reliable starter, and Vazquez's durability -- only once since 2000 has he thrown fewer than 200 innings in a season -- signified to them much more than just good health.
 ''You look at his numbers over just the last 10 years,'' Girardi said before the game. ''He's averaged 216 innings a year, and when you do that, you don't last long in games if you don't learn how to pitch and how to be economical with your pitches and use all your pitches and be able to use them at any time.''
 Vazquez has evolved, throwing a curveball more often and a slider he did not have six years ago. Undermining him Friday was a lack of control of his fastball. After the Yankees went ahead, 2-0, in the fourth when Rodriguez tripled and scored on a throwing error. The Rays evened the score on a two-run homer by Carlos Pena. After B. J. Upton singled, Vazquez got Willy Aybar to fly out and was one strike away from preventing further damage.
 But Vazquez misfired badly on a fastball to Dioner Navarro, who singled home Upton. Two more two-out hits stung, none more so than the double down the left-field line by Jason Bartlett. A play seemed out of his reach, but Marcus Thames dived anyway, and the ball bounced beyond his outstretched glove and rolled to the fence, scoring two more runs. When Vazquez gave up his second homer, to Aybar in the sixth, his head dropped as he watched the ball plop into the right-field stands. 
 ''You worry about a guy that's younger more than you do a guy who's experienced,'' Girardi said. ''Javy's been through this where he's had a tough start and he's had to bounce back. It's no fun, though, when it's your first start of the year.'' 
 INSIDE PITCH
 In his own measured way, Derek Jeter said he did not understand why the veteran crew chief Joe West criticized the pacing of the Yankees' recent series in Boston. West, who worked that series, told The Record of Hackensack, N.J., that the pace was ''pathetic and embarrassing.'' The games averaged 3 hours 38 minutes. ''I don't see what's pathetic or embarrassing about it,'' Jeter said. ''As opposed to what? Going 20 minutes shorter, it's not pathetic or embarrassing? At what point is it not embarrassing? If you go over, what, 3:12, it's embarrassing, you know what I mean? I don't know.''... Joe Girardi said Francisco Cervelli would catch C. C. Sabathia on Saturday.

HEADLINE: The Kilts Are the Same, but the Parade Is a Little Bit Shorter

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The recession has forced some deeply painful cutbacks for the people of New York. Raises for some government workers have been suspended. State parks might close. The city could shed 19,000 teachers and other employees.
 And now this: Saturday's Tartan Day Parade -- ''New York's biggest celebration for pipers, drummers, Scottish music and single malt whisky'' -- is being cut.
 Instead of stretching its traditional 13 blocks in Manhattan, the annual festival of bellowing bagpipes, kilted manly men and skittering fleets of Scottie and Westie dogs will be dispersing after a mere 10. 
 The parade, arguably obscure yet nonetheless cherished by Scots, has the distinction of being the first to be subject to new Police Department rules. Because of the city's budget deficit, the department has ordered parade routes cut by 25 percent. Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said reducing marches by a quarter would reduce police overtime costs, saving $3.1 million and 80 civilian jobs. 
 ''We're the first?'' asked Margaret Kennedy, the parade committee's president, in a brisk Scottish burr. ''Lucky us.''
 But while the Scots might have fought over much in their history -- their inclusion in the United Kingdom, for one -- news of the curtailed parade elicited little resistance or angst among the Tartan Day clan. Just as many participants, pipers and dogs are expected this year as last: 2,000, 700, and 70, respectively.
 ''Everyone pretty much understood,'' said Dennis T. Hagerty, Tartan Day's parade marshal. ''These are very unusual times.''
 Even Magnus Orr, a world-class bagpiper from Scotland, was more or less sanguine about the snipped route. Mr. Orr, most at home in knee-skimming kilt (which will remain the same length), traveled some 3,000 miles to New York from the wilds of Scotland to pipe for Tartan Day. 
 ''If all the Scots that are taking part in the parade can help the city save a few bob, then that's a good thing,'' he said. 
 Mr. Orr added that the shorter route might please his fellow pipers, because marching while piping was ''quite hard work.'' 
 ''It's definitely more than just walking,'' he said. ''You're blowing into the bag. Using a lot of energy. The parade is 10 blocks. I think that suits more people.'' 
 The 12th annual Tartan Day Parade commemorates Scotland's proclamation of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, signed nearly 700 years ago. It also celebrates Senate Resolution 155, which officially made April 6 National Tartan Day, to the great joy of the nation's Scots. 
 The parade will begin at 2 p.m. at 45th Street and Avenue of the Americas and head north. Instead of ending at 58th Street, it will end at 55th. 
 Under the new rules, parades cannot last longer than five hours. That is not an issue for the Scots, who will be done in an hour and a half. 
 But organizers of bigger parades are still resisting the changes. 
 Representatives of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade and the Heritage of Pride, which produces the annual gay pride parade, said they still hope to persuade the police to allow them to keep their longer routes. 
 Arthur Finn, co-chairman of Heritage of Pride, said the police could instead trim costs by allowing the parade to stop less often for crosstown traffic, in turn speeding things up. A shortened route, he added, would cut out symbolic landmarks, like passing the New York Public Library, where a huge ''We Remember'' banner is usually unfurled. 
 The Heritage of Pride ''march,'' as the group calls it, scheduled for June 27, will still end in Greenwich Village. But this year, the police want it to start around 38th Street. Mr. Finn's organization was weighing how to respond, though the parade's Web site still lists the step off point as 52nd Street. 
 Javier A. Solano, a lawyer for the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, said the city would benefit more economically by keeping the traditional route, along Fifth Avenue from 44th Street to 86th Street. A shorter parade would mean fewer participants, he said, meaning less of an influx from out of town. 
 The Puerto Rican Day parade, to take place June 13, draws more than two million spectators, he added. Condensing them into less space would make conditions along sidewalks even more crowded. 
 It appeared unlikely, though, that the Police Department would yield much, although Mr. Browne suggested that there was some flexibility within the 25 percent crunch ''to assure the start or end points make sense.''
 The new rules went into effect April 1. That meant that this year's St. Patrick's Day Parade on March 17, for which Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly served as grand marshal, was unaffected, an exemption that caused much grumbling in parade circles.
 And not every Tartan Day participant has made peace with the newly shortened route. 
 Andrew McDicken, pipe major for the Clan Gordon Highlanders Pipe Band, based in Locust Valley, N.Y., was disappointed by the news. On Long Island, he said, parades could stretch over two miles. With 10 blocks, he said, things would be over almost as soon as they began, leaving barely enough time to pipe all the staple songs, among them ''Scotland the Brave,'' ''Green Hills of Tyrol'' and ''When the Battle's O'er.'' 
 ''Once you start marching with the bagpipes you can almost march forever,'' Mr. McDicken said. ''With the drums and the pipes and the tunes, you don't feel the distance. You start up, and basically you're lost in the music.''
 Could his pipers and drummers march a little more slowly, to stretch things out? 
 ''Playing the bagpipes is a very easy marching cadence,'' he said. ''If we walk any slower, we'll be sleeping.''

HEADLINE: Not-as-Big Spenders

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The wealthy are cautiously opening their wallets again.
 ''People are fed up, and they want to have a good time,'' said Rina Anoussi, a Manhattan travel agent who handles high-end clients. They don't want Italy 101. They want more exotic destinations like Kenya and Tanzania.'' 
 But Ms. Anoussi, who operates her own company under the Tzell Travel Group, said her customers were still wary about overspending. They ''argue like carpet dealers in Istanbul looking for the best deals,'' she said. ''They want to know, 'What can I get if I book through you.''' 
 Business is also creeping back for hotels, yacht rental companies, jet brokers and jewelry stores -- purveyors of the luxury goods that once seemed immune to a downturn but then took a megahit with the economy. 
 Some experts contend that much of the high-end spending before the recession was fueled by money borrowed by people who were trying to live beyond their means. Today there is a trend to reducing risk by cutting debt. But even people who came out of the financial crisis relatively unscathed are pulling back. The possibility of losing their wealth has become more real. 
 ''Today if they buy, they are not willing to be embarrassed by overpaying,'' said Jane Bayard, executive vice president at Warburg Realty Partnership of Manhattan. Though the Manhattan residential market has held up reasonably well, ''there were times in 2007, for example, when there were multiple offers and people paid millions over the asking price,'' Ms. Bayard said. ''Today, nobody wants to be the last monkey in the tree.''
 In an economy that remains weak, no one expects a rapid recovery. ''Let's be honest,'' said Stephen Hahn, area vice president for sales and marketing of Ritz-Carlton Hotels, Caribbean and Mexico. ''We are thrilled to see the numbers coming back, but are they springing back to the level they were? No they are not.'' 
 At Sabre Yachts in South Casco, Me., a good year once meant building and selling about 180 luxury sailboats and powerboats priced from $400,000 to $1.5 million. Last year, sales sank to well below 100, said Daniel Zilkha, who has owned the company for 15 years. 
 ''This was by far the worst downturn since the luxury tax nearly wiped out the boat builders in the very early 1990s,'' Mr. Zilkha said. ''Business is picking up relatively slowly, but it feels as if the recovery has substance.'' This year, the company expects to build as many as 120 boats. The yacht charter business was similarly hard hit last year and is also starting to show signs of life for the coming summer, when wealthy customers want boats to cruise in the Mediterranean. Still, Shannon Webster, who runs a charter business in Flagler Beach, Fla., described the current climate as a ''Mexican standoff because smart buyers know they can wait a bit and boat owners are evaluating what they may have to give up to get customers.'' 
 ''Everybody has cut back somewhat,'' Ms. Webster said. ''Even people who rented a 225-foot boat are saying, 'Can I get something that is 50 feet shorter?' ''
 The more conservative sailboat charter business is showing signs of a rebound, too. Tina Hinckley, whose family sold its sailboat manufacturing business to a private equity firm in 1997, now arranges charters for high-end clients through her Hinckley Crewed Charters in Southwest Harbor, Me. She has already booked 20 trips, twice as many as she had on her schedule at this time last year. ''Last year, I sent out quite a few contracts that never came back,'' she said. ''This year, they are actually coming back and signing up.'' 
 If boats are getting smaller, jewelry is getting bigger. A spokesman for Tiffany, Mark Aaron, said the jeweler's sales of pieces that cost more than $50,000 rebounded for the 12 months that ended Jan. 31. The comeback was ''meaningful,'' he said, although he would not quantify it. 
 But it is easier to muster $50,000 than $20 million. 
 The jet business may well have been the hardest hit by the economic collapse. In normal times, 12 percent of the worldwide private jet fleet is for sale. In July 2009, that figure soared to 18 percent. But sales have risen every month for the last seven months, said Brian Foley, a private aviation consultant. ''The recovery has stalled a bit,'' Mr. Foley said. ''Still, there is more business and people are willing to spend more, so they are loosening up.'' 
 To Richard Aboulafia, a consultant at Teal Group, which provides aerospace and defense industry market analysis, there is still cause for concern about the private jet market. ''The good news is that people have stopped dumping jets,'' he said. ''The bad news is that there is still a lot of inventory and prices are flat.'' 
 Blair LaCorte, chief executive at XOJet, which owns 23 jets and leases them for charter, said that his business was picking up. But he concurred that prices remained flat. 
 ''The problem is that it is often hard to distinguish whether companies or individuals are opening their wallets,'' Mr. LaCorte said. ''Some small-company owners buy planes in the corporate name for personal use, and corporate jets are often used for personal agendas, including golf trips and vacations. We tend to use a criterion of whether there are children or pets on board, or how much wine was drunk,'' he said. ''I believe that business is growing faster than personal use, but personal use went down less in the downturn.'' 
 The luxury hotel business is posting a slow recovery. The drop-off in business was far more devastating than the decline when the Internet bubble burst, which ''was a blip compared to the meltdown,'' said Mr. Hahn of Ritz-Carlton Hotels. He said that more recently ''things have stabilized.'' Like Ms. Anoussi, Mr. Hahn said that people were far more cautious about where they would spend their money and were looking for the best deals. ''They are not taking suites as much,'' he said. ''They are opting for club lounges where they pay a premium to use a club where they can eat drink and be merry.'' 
 At The Breakers, the grande dame of Palm Beach hotels, revenue fell 20 percent in the year that ended in August 2009. It is up 5 percent this year, and ''we are estimating a 10 percent increase by year end, '' said Paul N. Leone, president of The Breakers Palm Beach. 
 But even there, guests remain cautious. ''Often we see an individual traveler will go into the Burberry shop at the hotel,'' he said. ''They may spend the same amount as they once did. But if they do, they will get several items, rather than one thing.''

HEADLINE: In Order Books, Signs of Broad Growth

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT much of the world, businesses are reporting a continuing surge in new orders, providing an indication that economies are growing.
 In most countries, orders received by manufacturing businesses turned up sooner than orders to service businesses. But even service providers are now reporting increases in new business. 
 In the United States, most manufacturing companies reported declining orders for 14 consecutive months, ending last May. That was the longest stretch since the early 1980s, and came amid talk of a new Great Depression.
 But since then, the companies have reported rising orders in all but one month, according to surveys by the Institute for Supply Management.
 Service companies did not begin to report rising levels of new business until September. But by March, a higher proportion of companies were reporting gains than at any time since 2005.
 The accompanying charts are based on the surveys, which are conducted in many countries and consolidated by Markit. They are normally shown on a scale of one to 100, with a reading of 50 indicating as many companies are reporting increased orders as are reporting decreased business. But in the charts, they are shown by the amount the figure is over or under 50. A higher level shows more companies are reporting gains.
 Manufacturing was hurt more by the credit crisis than services businesses were, as many companies slashed orders and inventories in an effort to conserve capital. When the recovery started, it appeared that many of the gains reflected buyers beginning to rebuild low inventories. But as it has continued, it looks more and more as if demand is also rising.
 The most notable exception to the pattern is in Greece, which is deeply in debt and trying to cut huge budget deficits. There, manufacturing companies have reported declining orders in 17 of the last 18 months. Economic austerity is damaging local demand but cannot quickly help Greek manufacturers regain international competitiveness. 
 Orders have also been slower to recover in Japan, which faces increased competition from other Asian exporters. Japanese service companies continue to report declining orders, albeit by a narrow margin in the latest survey.
 In China, on the other hand, new business for service companies remained strong throughout the global downturn, although it did slip just below the break-even level in October 2008. That was the month after the Lehman Brothers collapse, when Chinese exporters were seeing the beginning of a plunge in orders -- a fall that no doubt made some of them hesitant to spend money themselves. But service businesses resumed their growth the next month, even as manufacturers reported declines in new orders.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Accelerating Orders: Throughout much of the world, companies are reporting rising levels of new orders for their products and services. The figures are indexed, so a level of zero indicates that as many companies in a given country are reporting increases in orders as are reporting decreases. The higher the figure, the larger the proportion of companies reporting rising orders. (Source: Markit)

HEADLINE: A Place to Live

 BODY:
The spring weeds are up again behind the fences in the empty field at Larkfield and Pulaski Roads in East Northport, N.Y. In the world of not-in-my-backyard suburbia, this is ground zero. 
 Since the 1970s, affordable-housing advocates have been trying to get a project called Matinecock Court, a 155-unit condominium complex, approved and built on that lot. In that time, entire strip malls, shopping centers and developments have been planned, built, abandoned, rebuilt and abandoned again. Children have grown, married and moved away -- to places with cheaper housing.
 And all the while, the residents and elected representatives of East Northport and Huntington Town kept the condos at bay. The stated reasons are congestion, crime and quality of life, which are code words for poor, black and we don't want you. 
 There have been few large-scale efforts by any Long Island county, town or village to build or revitalize affordable multifamily housing. Nonprofit groups and municipalities have had to settle for building a few dozen or hundred units at a time, mostly in depressed village downtowns where resistance is less intense. 
 When groups like the Long Island Housing Partnership have managed to build affordable developments, their tidy townhouses have far more curb appeal than the shabby illegal sublets, neglected rentals and foreclosures that flourish in a dysfunctional housing market.
 But Nimby doesn't do logic. A group called Housing Help, current owner of the East Northport lot, is still waiting for permission to build. The Town of Huntington once blocked the project because it allowed rental housing only in a heavily minority area near the train station. The United States Supreme Court said that was unconstitutional. The town finally approved a site plan in January. Now the group awaits approval of its sewage plant. 
 Opponents are dwindling, but they aren't giving up. A Facebook group called Stop the Matinecock Court Housing Development Project in East Northport has more than 1,000 fans. They protested in the rain last month, yelling as the words ''crime'' and ''high taxes'' bled down their signs. They have called another protest for Sunday. Fortunately, Housing Help is holding on.

HEADLINE: China Announces a Trade Deficit in March, Its First Since 2004

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China announced on Saturday that it had a trade deficit of $7.24 billion last month, its first monthly trade deficit in nearly six years, as imports jumped along with a surging domestic economy while exports grew more modestly. 
 Chinese New Year came late this year, falling on Feb. 14, which hurt factory production on the coast in early March. Many migrant workers travel home for two weeks for the celebration, and they were slow to return to their coastal plants in large numbers because there are now many jobs available in construction, retailing and other industries in the country's interior.
 According to the official Xinhua news agency, China's General Administration of Customs said the March reading was the first trade deficit since April 2004. China had a trade surplus of $7.6 billion in February and $14.2 billion in January.
 Top commerce ministry officials in Beijing had warned repeatedly over the last three weeks that China would run a trade deficit in March. They cited the risk of a monthly deficit as part of their broader campaign to prevent the government from letting the country's currency, known as the renminbi or yuan, rise against the dollar and other foreign currencies.
 After letting the renminbi appreciate gradually against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, the government has kept the renminbi at about 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on currency market intervention to prevent it from appreciating. The weakness of the renminbi has helped China capture a rising share of export markets in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere during the global downturn.
 But the commerce ministry has lost its battle to preserve the renminbi's informal peg to the dollar and the Chinese government will soon adopt a new currency policy, including a small rise in the renminbi against the dollar and wider day-to-day variation in the currency's value, people familiar with the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday and Friday.
 These people, who insisted on anonymity because of the diplomatic and financial sensitivity of the issue, said that China would shift its currency policy in the coming days. But investment bank economists were generally skeptical on Friday, saying that any change would take weeks, not days.
 The March deficit was much larger than the consensus estimate of Western economists, who had been anticipating a deficit of less than $1 billion. Chinese officials have long been wary of trade deficits, after monthly deficits in 1993 and early 1994 depleted the country's foreign exchange reserves.
 But after accumulating $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, trade deficits have become less of a monetary policy issue. Commerce ministry officials have warned, however, that if trade deficits reflect weak overseas demand and exports stumble, then layoffs at export factories could eventually increase unemployment and hurt social stability.

HEADLINE: Math, Civics And How To Budget

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Most Americans aren't fluent in the language of money. Yet we're expected to make big financial decisions as early as our teens -- Should I take on thousands of dollars of student debt? Should I buy a car? -- even though most of us received no formal instruction on financial matters until it was too late.
 While no course in personal finance could have prevented many Americans from getting caught up in the housing bubble, it's clear that most of us need some help, preferably starting when we're still in school. And I'm not just talking about learning to balance your checkbook. It's understanding concepts like the time value of money, risk and reward, and, yes, the importance of savings.
 All of this raises the question: What's happening inside our classrooms? And how many schools even broach the topic? As it turns out, for a country that prizes personal responsibility, we're doing very little. 
 ''We need to teach the basics of economics and finances so people can make financial decisions in a changing world,'' said Annamaria Lusardi, economics professor at Dartmouth College and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. ''It's the compounding of interest, the problem of inflation. These are the principles. And these are really scientific topics.''
 While more states are beginning to require some sort of personal finance instruction, there aren't enough that do, financial literacy experts say, and there is little consistency in the quality of the education. Just 13 states require students to take a personal finance course or include the subject in an economics course before they graduate from high school, up from seven states in 2007, according to the Council for Economic Education. Meanwhile, 34 states (including those 13) have personal finance within their curriculum guidelines, up from 28 states in 2007. 
 But that doesn't guarantee that the subject will be taught. It's no secret that state budgets are tight, and courses not seen as core are more likely to be cut than added. 
 ''The adage 'if it isn't tested, it isn't taught' is unfortunately true in this case,'' said Gary Stern, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and acting president of the Council for Economic Education, which provides economics and personal finance educational programs.
 But that hasn't stopped enterprising teachers like Mathew Frost, who teaches 11th and 12th graders American history and economics at Sunset High School in Dallas, from working the topic into his student's school day. The Texas economics curriculum carves out time for personal finance, but it doesn't test students on the material.
 Mr. Frost says it's just too important to ignore. So he tries to bring the lesson to life for his students by pairing them up as married couples and giving them a couple of children. The students must then create a budget based on the average income range for their neighborhood, or about $21,000 to $40,000 a year. As in the board game ''Life,'' the students are dealt real-world circumstances. Mr. Frost has them randomly pick ''chance cards'' from a bag, which might tell them they need new brakes for their car, broke an arm, suffered a death in the family, or found $20.
 ''I try to make it a realistic as possible,'' he said. ''We talk about building budgets, expenses, investing money,'' he added, as well as ''how to use credit wisely, insurance and careers.'' 
 One of his students later wrote about the experience. The 11th grader, who simulated life with a wife and two children on $21,000 a year, told of balancing needs versus wants, trying to find an apartment in a safe neighborhood that fit the family budget and the effect of an unexpected rent increase on their savings.
 ''I first learned that real life isn't going to be as nice as this game,'' he said. ''I also learned that good budgeting has to be maintained throughout a person's life no matter the income, no matter the living conditions.''
 Research shows that this type of financial education tends to resonate with the students later.
 Michael S. Gutter, an assistant professor of family financial management at the University of Florida, studied the issue in 2009, after he surveyed 15,700 students at 15 universities who came from states with different (or nonexistent) personal finance schooling requirements. The study was financed by the National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit organization in Denver that provides financial education curriculums.
 ''College students who came from states where there was a course required were more likely to budget, were more likely to be saving, and were less likely to have maxed out their credit cards in the last year and were more likely to be paying off their credit cards fully,'' Professor Gutter said. But his research also suggested that ''social learning is also very powerful as well,'' he said. ''What your parents tell you matters.''
 Parents can help, but many don't know the answers. In fact, part of the challenge is that many teachers don't either. ''We should develop a national standard for teacher training,'' said Ted Beck, chief executive of the endowment, which recently conducted a study that found that 64 percent of kindergarten through 12th-grade teachers (in states with financial education guidelines) reported feeling ''not well qualified'' to teach those standards.
 The standards most commonly referred to were developed by the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, which provides the outlines of a recommended personal finance curriculum. The topics cover everything from income and careers to credit and debt, savings and investing to risk management and insurance. Many educators and financial literacy experts agree that smart, comprehensive course materials already exist (You can find a sample in the online version of this story). The challenge is delivering them to classrooms, and then encouraging states to mandate that it's taught. And ideally, it would start much earlier than high school.
 ''It's hard because there is no silver bullet to get this into every school,'' said Matthew Yale, deputy chief of staff to Education Secretary Arne Duncan. ''It's not as simple as saying, 'We're going to institute this in the 100,000 public schools in America.' But our plan for reauthorization does make room for financial literacy in schools, which is a really big, big deal.'' Mr. Yale was referring to the Obama administration's plan to revise the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, commonly known as No Child Left Behind.
 He said the Department of Education's next step is to work with districts and teachers and help them find the money they need, whether it's through the many literacy-minded nonprofits or the private sector. Mr. Yale also said that department officials were working on competitive grant programs, which would allow schools to compete for money to pay for the financial literacy programs. As a joint effort with the Treasury Department, the Education Department is currently running the National Financial Capability Challenge, an online exam for high school students that measures financial know-how and recognizes outstanding performers, to help raise awareness. 
 President Bush created the first Advisory Council on Financial Literacy in 2008, and President Obama plans to assemble his own team. In its annual report, the first council recommended that Congress or state legislatures mandate financial education in all schools for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. But will the new administration follow through with that recommendation? Mr. Yale said education officials were ''not interested in introducing unfunded mandates.''
 So what can we do? According to Scott Truelove, who teaches personal finance as part of a work-study program for seniors at Chesterton High School in Indiana, ''It will take a parent movement.'' 
 Mr. Truelove has already seen the power of financial education in his schools' hallways, where a student told him and another personal finance teacher that she set up a Roth I.R.A. given what she learned in class.
 ''That, to me, is huge,'' Mr. Truelove said.

HEADLINE: J. Bruce Llewellyn, Who Forged a Path For Blacks in Business, Is Dead at 82

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
J. Bruce Llewellyn, whose success in fields as varied as banking, broadcasting, Coca-Cola bottling and groceries made him one of the most prominent black businessmen in America, died Wednesday night at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
 The cause was renal failure, said Edward Lewis, a friend and legal guardian for Mr. Llewellyn. Mr. Llewellyn had been on dialysis for years, Mr. Lewis said. 
 Throughout his life, Mr. Llewellyn repeated his father's dictum that blacks must work twice as hard as whites to achieve half as much. In an interview with The Black Collegian in 1997, he asserted that success had not come easily, calling it ''nerve wracking, gut-wrenching and pain inducing.''
 ''You must act to acquire it with a vengeance and to pursue it with a passion,'' he said. 
 Mr. Llewellyn was one of the nation's richest African-Americans, with a personal wealth estimated at times to exceed $160 million. He was appointed to government posts and advised presidents. 
 In 1963 he joined with others, including David N. Dinkins, later to become mayor of New York City, in founding 100 Black Men, a social and philanthropic organization that began in New York and expanded throughout the United States.
 ''We pushed our guys onto bank boards, into government jobs,'' Mr. Llewellyn told The New York Times in 1976. ''We're the most dynamic group of black men in the country.''
 Perhaps his greatest triumph came in 1985 when he put together a group of black partners to buy a majority share of the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company. It was the first of the company's bottling plants to be acquired by a black person. Four years earlier, Jesse Jackson and his advocacy group Operation PUSH had demanded that Coke open its bottling ranks to black ownership, pointing out that blacks were a major consumer of Coca-Cola soft drinks. 
 Mr. Llewellyn, a deep-voiced, barrel-chested man who stood 6-foot-6, found initial success by mortgaging everything he owned to turn a tattered chain of supermarkets in Harlem and the Bronx, the Fedco Foods Corporation, into a company with $100 million in annual sales.
 Mr. Llewellyn's use of a leveraged buyout in 1969 to buy Fedco came years before the tactic became commonplace.
 ''For an African-American businessman to receive multimillion-dollar financing in the 1970s was a landmark event,'' said Robert Towbin of the investment bank L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg and Towbin, as quoted by the Encyclopedia of African-American Business.
 In 1971 Jackie Robinson, a friend, asked Mr. Llewellyn to join the board of the Freedom National Bank in Harlem, of which Mr. Robinson was chairman. Mr. Llewellyn succeeded Mr. Robinson in 1973, and the next year took a leave of absence from Fedco to be the bank's acting president. He succeeded in sorting out Freedom's finances, partly by bringing in capital from white-controlled financial firms. (The bank ultimately failed in 1990 under other leadership.)
 During the Carter administration, Mr. Llewellyn was appointed to head the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, an agency that supports American investment in emerging foreign markets. He also accepted business-related assignments from President Bill Clinton. 
 Part of Mr. Llewellyn's success stemmed from tax laws aimed at furthering minority ownership of communications companies. When he and some black partners bought a television station in Buffalo in 1985, the seller, Capital City Communications Inc., could get millions of dollars of tax advantages by selling to a member of a racial minority. As a result, Mr. Llewellyn's group succeeded even though it offered a lower price than other suitors. 
 Mr. Llewellyn's associates said his deal-making skills transcended race, however. ''No one ever had to bend any rules for J. Bruce Llewellyn,'' Mr. Jackson once told USA Today. ''He has the entrepreneur's spirit, the will to risk for reward.'' 
 Mr. Llewellyn reprised the Buffalo deal when he assembled a group to buy NYT Cable TV, a New Jersey concern, from The New York Times Company in 1989 for $420 million. Mr. Llewellyn put up 20 percent of the price (the minimum percentage required to get tax breaks for minority ownership) while the Comcast Corporation and Lenfest Communications Inc. each picked up 40 percent. Mr. Llewellyn became chairman.
 James Bruce Llewellyn was born to Jamaican immigrants on July 16, 1927, in East Harlem. His father, Charles, a newspaper linotype operator, moved the family to White Plains when Bruce was 2. His sister, Dorothy Cropper, became a judge on the New York State Court of Claims. Gen. Colin Powell was a close friend of the family's.
 In White Plains, Mr. Llewellyn worked in a restaurant his father acquired. He sold Fuller Brush products door to door and read Fortune magazine. Graduating from high school when he was 16, Mr. Llewellyn joined the Army in a special cadet program. He later became the youngest officer in his battalion.
 Afterward he used Army severance pay to buy a liquor store in Harlem. While running it, he attended the City College of New York on the G.I. Bill and graduated in 1955. After attending Columbia Business School and the New York University School of Public Administration and Social Service without graduating from either, he earned a law degree from New York Law School in 1960.
 He then entered private legal practice and went on to several city and federal government jobs in small business and housing.
 During the power blackout of 1977, riots caused $1 million damage to his Fedco stores, a warehouse and a computer center. But the company rebounded, and by the time he sold the chain for $20 million to Krasdale Foods in 1982, he had quintupled sales and nearly tripled the number of stores.
 In 1985, Mr. Llewellyn realized his dream of becoming the first black to own a major bottler when he won control of the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company, using stock he owned in a New York bottling company. He added new routes, products and equipment, and the plant thrived. 
 Mr. Llewellyn's marriage to Jacqueline Brown ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Shahara Ahmad; two daughters from his first marriage, Lisa Llewellyn and Alexandra Clancy; one from his second, Jaylaan Llewellyn; his sister, Judge Cropper; and a granddaughter.
 In recent years Mr. Llewellyn suffered from kidney and heart problems and had lived apart from his wife. In 2008, Mr. Lewis, Maurice Sonnenberg, and Donald McHenry, a former United Nations ambassador, were appointed guardians to look after Mr. Llewellyn's health and financial and legal affairs. 
 To many people in business, Mr. Llewellyn showed that investing in the black community could be profitable, as it was in the 1970s when he tailored his merchandising and employment practices to the black consumers and workers at his Fedco stores. 
 His often-repeated point was that political and social power grew out of economic power. ''Minorities have to understand that the world revolves around the golden rule,'' he wrote in Fortune magazine in 1990. ''Those who have the gold, rule.''

HEADLINE: As a Hiring Filter, Credit Checks Draw Questions

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
In defending employers' use of credit checks as part of the hiring process, Eric Rosenberg of the TransUnion credit bureau paints a sobering picture.
 Retailers lose more than $30 billion a year because of employee theft, he says. Workplace violence costs employers $55 million a year in lost wages. A third of employees provide bogus information on their resumes.
 Screening the backgrounds of employees ''is critical to protect the safety of Connecticut residents in their homes and offices, in their cars and in all other places they travel,'' Mr. Rosenberg testified to Connecticut legislators in February 2009, explaining why TransUnion markets its credit reports to employers. 
 Trouble is, researchers say there is no evidence showing that people with weak credit are more likely to be bad employees or to steal from their bosses, a fact that Mr. Rosenberg himself later admitted. 
 ''At this point we don't have any research to show any statistical correlation between what's in somebody's credit report and their job performance or their likelihood to commit fraud,'' he said in separate testimony to Oregon legislators in January.
 With millions of Americans nursing damaged credit reports after a bruising recession, some lawmakers are seeking to limit the use of credit reports as a factor in hiring.
 Legislators in more than a dozen states have introduced bills to curb the use of credit checks during the hiring process, and three states have passed such laws. 
 At the federal level, Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, is pursuing his own legislation that would prohibit employers nationwide from using credit checks to discriminate in hiring.
 Supporters of such laws say they are necessary because an increasing number of employers are doing credit checks even though there is no proof that bad credit is a marker of risky employees. 
 Furthermore, they say the practice unfairly tars the huge pool of people whose credit was damaged by layoffs, medical bills or other factors beyond their control. They also say it disproportionately screens out minorities.
 ''Bernie Madoff had a pretty good credit score,'' said Matthew Lesser, a Connecticut state representative who introduced a bill early last year that would have limited employers' use of credit reports. 
 ''And yet there is this consistent message that if you have a bad credit score, there is something wrong with you.''
 Jerry K. Palmer, a psychology professor at Eastern Kentucky University, said his studies, though relatively small, found no correlation between the quality of an employee's credit report and that worker's job performance or likelihood to quit.
 He said he was not aware of any studies that showed a correlation between poor credit and employee fraud or violence. But he noted that more research was needed to show what credit reports could predict.
 Even so, the industry that sells credit checks has remained firm, mounting a counterattack against legislation with some success. 
 Bills introduced in California, Maryland and Connecticut, for example, have been stalled amid opposition from credit bureaus and other businesses.
 In arguing against the legislation in Connecticut, Mr. Rosenberg, director of state government relations for TransUnion, testified, ''This restriction could jeopardize the health and safety of many Connecticut residents who have come to rely on safe and secure environments, and risks the financial status of businesses across the state.'' 
 Mr. Rosenberg did not return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for TransUnion, Steven Katz, reiterated the company's stance that credit reports were a valuable tool for employers.
 Several other large credit bureaus also suggest in their marketing materials that credit checks are an important security measure for companies. ''Every time you hire a new employee, you put a lot on the line,'' an Experian brochure reads. ''The wrong decision could jeopardize your firm's assets, reputation or security.'' 
 Kristine Snyder, a spokeswoman for Experian, said the ability to assess risk was important for business owners, particularly those running small companies, given the level of employee fraud. She said the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners found that important indicators of potential fraud were employees living above their means and those experiencing financial difficulties.
 ''Employers should have information available to them that protects their businesses from catastrophic losses so that workers can continue to stay employed and remain productive,'' she said.
 Stuart Pratt, chief executive of the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group, said he worried that legislation to limit the use of credit reports would limit employers' ability to evaluate potential job candidates. He said such information was particularly useful in evaluating employees who have access to sensitive information or who deal with money.
 ''It's our view that a credit report is a piece of a much larger employment puzzle,'' he said. ''It's a piece of a puzzle, not the absolute yes or no toggle switch.''
 In a survey released earlier this year by the Society for Human Resource Management, 13 percent of employers said they used credit checks on all job applications, while 47 percent said they used credit checks for certain applicants.
 Among the employers surveyed, 54 percent said the primary reason they used credit checks was to prevent theft and embezzlement. Ninety-one percent said they used credit checks for applicants applying for positions with fiduciary or financial responsibility. 
 (Most of the proposed bills allow for credit checks to be used for positions that involve the handling of money or sensitive information.)
 Employers can generally use credit checks -- but not credit scores -- during the employment process as long as they obtain written permission from the potential employee. But they are prohibited from denying someone a job based on selection criteria that are not directly related to the job, said Adam Klein, an employment discrimination lawyer in New York.
 ''Whenever employers say it's just another tool we use, and it doesn't necessarily discount somebody, that's a bunch of bull,'' said Lauryn Beer, who lives in Washington and says her credit has suffered from years of underemployment. 
 ''It's used as a weeding-out process.''
 Ms. Beer, a writer and human rights activist, said she believed she had lost several potential jobs because of her credit. 
 ''The normal specious argument is, it goes to reliability,'' she said. ''I'd like to know where the proof is?''

HEADLINE: Dow Surges Briefly Above 11,000, Then Slips Back

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average briefly traded above 11,000 points on Friday, the latest mile marker in a yearlong rally that has catapulted the stock market from the depths of the financial crisis.
 The Dow's surge reflected a growing sense on Wall Street that the recovery might be accelerating. Risk-shy investors are snapping up stocks amid signs that consumer spending is improving and the economy is adding jobs. 
 But for all the optimism, some say they believe the market has come too far too fast. The major indexes have reached levels few could have fathomed in the recession's darker days, climbing at least 68 percent in the last year. 
 On Friday, the Dow closed at its highest level since September 2008, when the near collapse of the financial system rattled global markets. But it remains a long way from the roaring days before the recession: the index is more than 3,100 points below its record high in October 2007.
 ''We're in 'off to the races' mode for a moment, but this is going to be a year of fits and starts,'' said Marc Harris, co-head of global research for RBC Capital Markets. ''This is an economy that is recovering -- that is going to get better. But don't assume a straight line.''
 By the end of trading, the Dow had fallen slightly below the 11,000 mark, closing at 10,997.35 after rising 70.28 points, or 0.64 percent on the day.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.93 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,194.37, while the Nasdaq climbed 17.24 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,454.05. Major indexes in Europe and Asia also rose.
 Friday's enthusiasm came amid reports that the European Union had agreed on the technical details of a loan for Greece, allowing it to borrow at a rate lower than the record 7.5 percent interest that traders were demanding earlier this week.
 ''They can't allow it to continue to deteriorate any further,'' Owen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Deutsche Asset Management, said of Greece. ''They're going to have to step in soon.''
 A surge in energy stocks also helped drive Friday's gains. Chevron offered a better-than-expected first-quarter outlook, giving its stock a 2.4 percent jolt, to $79.50. ConocoPhillips rose 2.6 percent to $55.32 a share and Exxon Mobil gained 1.3 percent, to $68.76.
 Even with concern over swelling debt burdens hanging over financial markets, the prognosis for the American economy has turned increasingly bright.
 A report on Friday showed wholesale inventories in the United States rose 0.6 percent in February, exceeding expectations, and sales climbed to the highest level since 2008.
 Wall Street got another bright data point last week when the government said 162,000 jobs were created in March. Many analysts saw the report as a turning point for the labor market.
 As unemployment eases, Americans are expected to spend more. Spending has ticked modestly upward for five consecutive months, and businesses are already noticing the shift. Major retailers like Macy's and Target reported their strongest monthly sales growth in a decade in March, with collective sales increasing 9.1 percent. 
 Still, despite the rosy data, some investors remain concerned that the ebullience of Wall Street's rally is out of step with the slow pace of renewal. Unemployment is still startlingly high, and the housing market is stumbling despite significant government support. 
 In addition, the federal government is expected to begin withdrawing economic life-support programs in the near future. The Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates low in the near future to spur lending, but that could change as the end of the year approaches. 
 Interest rates were steady on Friday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32 , to 97 29/32, and the yield slipped to 3.88 percent from 3.89 percent late Thursday.
 Much of the optimism on Wall Street rests on an expectation that earnings will continue to strengthen this year. First-quarter financial results will begin to trickle out next week, and analysts expect to see an overall rise of 22.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. The pressure to perform is high after a glittering finish to 2009, when 72 percent of companies exceeded forecasts.
 As the second quarter begins, investors are looking for signs that companies have found stable revenue streams and that lending has picked up. If the results are strong, money may begin pouring back into equities, after the jitters of the financial crisis prompted many investors to turn to the bond market.
 ''It's going to be harder to get to 12,000 than it was to get to 11,000,'' said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. ''We're certainly heading up, but it's a question of how much and to what degree.''

HEADLINE: Kyrgyzstan's Deposed President Is Urged to Seek Exile

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan -- A tenuous calm settled on this traumatized city on Friday, with an interim government made up of the deposed president's staunchest opponents claiming that it was rapidly consolidating control. 
 The acting head of the government, Roza Otunbayeva, said at a news conference that the president, Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev, had been offered safe passage into exile if he agreed to step down. ''We will guarantee his security, only his personal security, if he resigns,'' Ms. Otunbayeva said. 
 Mr. Bakiyev, who fled to the south of the country on Wednesday, has refused to give up power and has made vague threats about trying to re-establish his authority. Local news outlets reported that he was moving from place to place in the south, where he has deep family roots, accompanied by his personal security detail. 
 In an interview on Friday from the southern city of Jalal-Abad, he told the BBC that he feared for his life if he returned to Bishkek, and that he would remain in the south to head off a civil war with the north. 
 Ms. Otunbayeva said that the government was asserting control in the south, having installed governors in Jalal-Abad and another southern city, Osh. 
 Kyrgyzstan's acting prosecutor general, Baitemir Ibrayev, said at a news conference on Friday that he had brought charges of mass murder against Mr. Bakiyev's son, Maxim, and two other family members. 
 ''We have information that the shootings were carried out on direct orders from these three,'' Mr. Ibrayev said. 
 As many as 75 people were killed and more than 400 were wounded when riot police officers opened fire on antigovernment demonstrators here on Wednesday, provoking a violent backlash that left many of those same police officers bloodied and running for their lives. Protesters burned and looted government buildings and businesses, and President Bakiyev was forced to flee.
 Gen. James L. Jones, the White House national security adviser, said the United States was monitoring developments in Kyrgyzstan but offered little assessment of the recent events. He noted that the Obama administration hoped to keep open the sprawling Manas air base in Kyrgyzstan. 
 ''Obviously, Manas is a very important air base for our operations in Afghanistan,'' he told reporters on Air Force One.
 Thousands returned on Friday to the capital's central square, the scene of this week's violence, this time to pay quiet tribute to the dead and even express tentative hopes for a better future.
 ''Kyrgyzstan now has a unique chance to try to build a democracy for the second time,'' said one of the mourners, Ravil Bikeyev, 57, a businessman. He was referring to the so-called Tulip Revolution of 2005, which carried Mr. Bakiyev into office. As president, Mr. Bakiyev had promised to allow democracy to flourish in Kyrgyzstan, only to become what human rights groups called an increasingly repressive autocrat. 
 ''The first time, we failed, and Bakiyev usurped all the power,'' Mr. Bikeyev said. 
 With some government buildings still smoldering, many here said they were resolved to continue the fight even at the risk of further violence if it meant getting rid of a president they said had done little but corrupt and impoverish their country. 
 ''We are hungry but proud, and we will never back down,'' said one of the mourners, a 50-year-old teacher named Ishenbek Ashirov, who was standing near piles of flowers that marked the places where demonstrators were shot on Wednesday. 
 Witnesses said that the police and soldiers opened fire without warning as thousands of demonstrators marched on the imposing, Soviet-era government headquarters, called the White House. Portions of the fence were still splashed with blood.
 A makeshift memorial with flowers and a homemade placard marked the spot near the fence where witnesses said four young men were shot to death, possibly by snipers posted on the roofs of surrounding buildings. 
 ''The shots were aimed well,'' said Marat Sorgymbayev, 58, a retired military officer, who was at the protest on Wednesday. ''The wounds were in the head and the heart.''
 ''There was a young man close to me,'' he said. ''We were moving in the direction of the White House, and I looked away and he fell. When I checked him there was no pulse. The bullet hit him in the forehead.''
 In a stuffy room at City Hospital No. 4 here, several men lay battered and broken. One, an engineer, had a sniper's bullet lodged in his leg.
 Another, long unemployed, was shot through the arm. 
 Taland Borgulev, a 36-year-old mechanic, had a blood-soaked bandage wrapped around a bullet wound on his thigh. All had joined the crowds in capital for what they thought would be a peaceful protest against a corrupt and authoritarian government -- only to be cut down in a hail of bullets.
 ''The soldiers stood in a row and shot into the people,'' Mr. Borgulev said from his hospital bed on Friday. ''Many people died -- children 16, 17 years old,'' he said. ''Those who were there were patriots.''
 Sabyrbek Dzhumabekov, the director of City Hospital No. 4, Bishkek's main trauma center, said that more than 80 percent of his patients had gunshot wounds. 
 Many of the hospital's wounded said they did not regret joining the protests, adding that they would do so again if it would help improve their lives and those of their families. Few here considered the geopolitical ramifications of the tumult. The future of the American military base just outside Bishkek and an off-again-on-again quarrel with Russia seemed far from people's minds. 
 ''We came out of our own free will,'' said Adiled Moldobayev, a 22-year-old student who was shot in the leg. ''We want a future, to have normal jobs and normal lives. We want only this.'' 
 Protesters, however, were not the only victims of this week's violence. Police officers were also wounded, some seriously. On Friday, blood still streaked the facade of a police precinct's headquarters, which was attacked by 30 or 40 people wielding rocks and at least one automatic weapon, the police said. The building was riddled with bullets, and the windows were smashed. There were no reports of deaths. 
 One officer was standing guard at the entrance on Friday, armed with a Kalashnikov rifle. Others milled around outside, wearing civilian clothes instead of their uniforms to avoid being easily identified. They were not the ones who opened fire on civilians, they said, but were waiting for orders from the interim government about what to do next.
 ''The police are hungry, and we have been here for three days eating only bread,'' said one officer who declined to be identified. ''But in order to preserve stability, we are standing guard.''

HEADLINE: A Voice Of Reason

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The Republican Party is not simply the ''just-say-no'' party. It's also a shameless advocate of the free lunch. Ronald Reagan famously told us he could jack up defense spending, cut taxes and balance the federal budget all at the same time.
 George W. Bush put two big wars on a credit card. And now we have the perennially clownish Newt Gingrich, in an embarrassing rant against President Obama, assuring the deluded G.O.P. faithful that, yes, the party can indeed bring down the federal deficit while cutting taxes. 
 The Great Recession and the debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been savage enough to reintroduce the G.O.P. to reality.
 One of the reasons so many conservative Republican absurdities became actual U.S. policy was the intellectual veneer slapped upon them by right-wing think tanks and commentators. The grossest nonsense was made to seem plausible to a lot of people -- people who wanted to believe in a free lunch. When Mr. Reagan told the country that ''government is the problem,'' the intellectual handmaidens of the corporate and financial elite were right there to explain in exhaustive detail why that was so.
 The result, in addition to the terrible consequences of Iraq and Afghanistan and the damage to America's standing in the world, was the tremendous (and tremendously debilitating) transfer of wealth from working people in the U.S. to the folks already in the upper echelons of wealth and income. The elite made out like bandits -- often literally. 
 The liberal or progressive community was slow to counter the remarkable effectiveness of this intellectual offensive from the right. But during the 1990s and into the early-2000s, that began to change. And one of the progressive organizations that has done a really good job (but has never been particularly well known) is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
 Demos, headquartered in New York City, grew out of a series of meetings of scholars, activists, journalists and elected officials who were concerned about the ever-increasing influence of the right on public policy. ''The thinking was that there should be more moderate, liberal and left-of-center voices,'' said Miles Rapoport, the group's president. The group was formed in 2000, a year that would later see the disputed election that gave the presidency to Mr. Bush. 
 It didn't take long for Demos to begin issuing loud warnings about the danger that ever-increasing debt was posing to American households, while pointedly disputing the argument that over-the-top credit card debt was primarily the result of excessive consumer spending.
 Working people from the middle class down were in serious trouble, and Demos, along with many other voices (the bankruptcy expert and middle-class advocate Elizabeth Warren comes quickly to mind) was sounding the alarm long before the Great Recession hit like a Category 5 hurricane.
 In a 2003 report called ''Borrowing to Make Ends Meet,'' Demos spotlighted the increasing gap between the incomes and the day-to-day living costs of many low- and middle-income families. That report was updated steadily in subsequent years, and in 2007 Demos was reporting: ''Many households have tried to cope with this financial imbalance by relying on credit cards to cover basic expenses that earnings do not meet. Homeowners, ominously, have then relied on cashed-out home equity -- $1.2 trillion over the last six years -- largely to pay down those debts and to cover other costs of living.''
 The Bush crowd during this period had taken us into Iraq and was fashioning its own fantasy of free-lunch economics.
 In 2006, Tamara Draut, Demos's vice president of policy and programs, wrote a book called ''Strapped: Why America's 20- and 30-Somethings Can't Get Ahead.'' Ms. Draut made the case that the hallmarks of adulthood -- from getting an education to buying a home to finding a good job with decent benefits to raising children and beginning to save for retirement -- had been eroded by the shortsighted public policies that have prevailed in recent decades.
 What has been left are just the remnants of the American dream.
 Ronald Reagan and the right-wing zealots who revere him have preached a gospel that, when carried to its logical conclusion, would all but abolish government. It's a failed philosophy.
 Demos has responded with admirable real-world scholarship, a highly respected fellows program to encourage new writers and thinkers and steadfast efforts to promote civic engagement. (It's a big champion, among other things, of same-day voter registration.)
 It's not just comforting but essential to have sane countervailing voices like Demos to remind us that government action is necessary to plan for the common good, to set proper rules for economic activity and to be a bulwark against predatory practices in the private sector.
 Demos is holding its 10th anniversary celebration on May 11, and Ms. Warren will be one of the honorees. If you think about it, raise a toast in the group's honor.

HEADLINE: Many Filers Confused By Stimulus Tax Credit

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
As the deadline approaches for filing tax returns, the process of claiming a tax break created by the stimulus package has proved to be more work than millions of people had bargained for.
 The new tax credit, championed by President Obama as a follow-through on his campaign promise to provide broad-based tax relief, affects 95 percent of all Americans by cutting $400 from the total tax bill for individual filers and $800 for married couples. 
 In an effort to jump-start the sputtering economy by putting the money into people's pockets as quickly as possible, the government also decided to pay the credit upfront and instructed employers to reduce the amount of federal withholding deducted from workers' paychecks over the last year. 
 But what millions of taxpayers did not realize was that to have the credit deducted from the total amount of taxes owed, they are required to complete a new form, Schedule M. For millions of retirees, the procedure also requires an additional step because they have to deduct the tax break, known as the ''Making Work Pay'' credit, from other tax credits they may have received.
 While either of those procedures takes only a few minutes, I.R.S. officials said that the unfamiliarity with the process of claiming the credit had led to errors in more than four million of the 82 million returns processed as of this week. The government expects to receive 60 million more returns by the filing deadline on Thursday, so it is possible that millions of additional returns will also contain similar errors.
 The I.R.S. said its examiners would correct those errors, file the Schedule M for the taxpayers who neglected to do so and recalculate the filers' taxes to reflect the credit. But the sheer volume of errors involving the tax credit has added to the workload of the agency and could result in delays of several weeks or more for taxpayers whose returns were incomplete.
 ''We're making sure people get the credits they are entitled to,'' said Michelle Eldridge, a spokeswoman for the I.R.S. ''But it's causing delays.''
 While mistakes involving the tax credit are by far the most common error tax examiners are encountering this year, I.R.S. officials say that the error rate -- less than 6 percent -- is not surprising for any new provision in the tax code. The Obama administration also contends that, despite the extra paperwork for taxpayers and the delayed returns, the tax credit succeeded in nudging the economy toward recovery by injecting $65 billion into circulation quickly.
 But putting the credit into effect has nonetheless been challenging. 
 In November, the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration reported that the I.R.S. instructions regarding the credit might have led some employers to reduce withholdings too much. As a result, the audit warned, 15 million or more taxpayers might find that their refunds would be smaller than expected, or they might even owe taxes. 
 I.R.S. officials say that because of a variety of other tax credits and changes to the code, those problems have not materialized and refunds are actually larger this year than last. But the complications involving taxpayers filing for the Making Work Pay credit have been widespread.
 Some filers neglected to claim the credit on line 63 of their 1040 forms or to file the Schedule M. Social Security recipients and federal retirees who received $250 stimulus checks were also required to deduct that amount from their Making Work Pay tax credits, adding to the confusion.
 ''Even those of us who do it for a living are puzzled by this thing, so people doing their own returns have no idea what to do,'' said Ron Lee, an accountant in Davenport, Iowa. ''It's good intentions to get the money out there and reduce taxes. But it creates an accounting headache.'' 
 Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, said the Obama administration had made extensive efforts to alert taxpayers to the new credits. In March, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the commissioner of the I.R.S., Douglas H. Shulman, appeared at a White House event to publicize the new tax credits. The Obama administration also placed a tax-saving tool on the White House Web site to help taxpayers understand which credits they could claim.
 ''Helping the American people understand tax relief they are eligible for is an administration priority,'' Ms. Brundage said in a written statement, ''and we will continue to work to help the American people navigate this process during these difficult economic times.'' 
 With millions of last-minute filers yet to prepare their returns, I.R.S. officials advised taxpayers to consult with www.irs.gov, or the telephone help line, at (800) 829-1040, if they need assistance. 
 ''And the No. 1 way to reduce errors and get your refund as quickly as possible is to file electronically,'' said Ms. Eldridge of the I.R.S.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Start-Ups, Not Bailouts'' (column, April 4):
 How does Thomas L. Friedman square his enthusiasm for a brain drain of highly skilled knowledge workers from third-world countries with his oft-stated belief that these underdeveloped countries cannot achieve economic prosperity without those same entrepreneurial scientists, engineers, physicians and managers exercising their talents in their native lands?
 It is not as if such capabilities are in such abundance that providing incentives to import them to the United States is without a depleting consequence back home.

HEADLINE: Romney On Health Care: A Particular Spin

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
BEDFORD, N.H. -- When it comes to health care, Mitt Romney is hoping to have it both ways, even as he accuses the White House of doing the same.
 In the weeks since President Obama and the Democratic Congress enacted their health care overhaul, Mr. Romney, the once and presumably future candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, has confronted an issue that is alternately viewed as a strength and a vulnerability.
 As he promotes himself as a problem-solving pragmatist, Mr. Romney can justifiably point to the landmark universal coverage law in Massachusetts that he, as governor, proposed in 2006. But as he appeals to conservative activists and Republican primary voters, he is trying to draw nuanced distinctions between his Massachusetts law and the federal legislation that shares many of its fundamental elements, including a requirement that people have insurance.
 The core of his argument is a federalist assertion that the new law usurps powers that properly reside with the states. 
 ''Whether you like what we did or think it stinks to high heaven,'' he said of the Massachusetts plan in a speech here on Thursday, ''the point is we solved it at our level.''
 He then compared the two plans: ''I like the things that are similar, I don't like the things that are different, and that's why I vehemently oppose Obamacare.''
 Whether Mr. Romney can sell that formulation in a black-or-white political culture may become one of the compelling questions of the 2012 campaign.
 He is already under assault from conservative writers and potential Republican rivals like Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota. The Democrats, meanwhile, are working to make the topic as uncomfortable as possible for him.
 The Democratic National Committee has posted a video compilation of Mr. Romney's comments praising the Massachusetts health insurance mandate. Twice last week, Mr. Obama pointedly observed that Mr. Romney seemed to be lambasting a federal plan that was derivative of his own Massachusetts model. 
 ''I keep on scratching my head,'' Mr. Obama said at a fund-raising reception in Boston. ''I say, 'Boy, this Massachusetts thing, who designed that?' ''
 In response, Mr. Romney is reminding audiences that Mr. Obama has cast the Republicans as the ''party of no,'' devoid of ideas. ''And yet,'' Mr. Romney said in Bedford, ''he's saying that I was the guy that came up with the idea for what he did. He can't have it both ways.''
 He added, ''If ever again somewhere down the road I would be debating him, I would be happy to take credit for his accomplishment.''
 Mr. Romney, 63, is more than halfway through a three-month, 42-stop tour to promote his best-selling manifesto, ''No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.'' All profits from the book, which calls for renewed muscularity in both domestic and foreign policy, will go to children's charities, he said in an interview.
 Although Mr. Romney said he would not decide whether to run until after the midterm elections, his tour has the trappings of a perpetual campaign. It included a visit to Iowa in late March as well as three stops this week in New Hampshire.
 At a bookstore in Manchester on Wednesday, those seeking signed copies were given red-white-and-blue placards proclaiming ''Mitt Romney: No Apology.'' Volunteers wore T-shirts listing the book tour dates on the back, as if Mr. Romney were Bruce Springsteen. Aides collected contact information for Mr. Romney's database.
 When the House passed the health care bill last month, Mr. Romney came out swinging, calling the process ''an unconscionable abuse of power.'' On book tour stops, he has endorsed Republican Congressional candidates who support repealing the law, providing them with checks from his political action committee. 
 In his book, Mr. Romney cites the Massachusetts experience in identifying three necessary components for universal coverage. They are tax incentives for people to buy health insurance, sliding-scale premiums for those with low incomes, and exchanges that encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. All three are significant pieces of the new federal law.
 He gives short shrift to the state's insurance mandate, which like the federal law requires most residents to purchase coverage or pay a tax penalty. In the interview, he stressed that his initial proposal would have allowed residents to opt out of the requirement if they signed a bond demonstrating that they could cover their health costs. The Democratic-controlled Legislature did away with that provision, but Mr. Romney signed the measure anyway.
 ''The bill was a step forward,'' he explained in the interview, noting that he vetoed some provisions that were then overridden. ''It's a far cry from perfect.''
 At his appearances, Mr. Romney is almost always asked to compare the two laws. Aware that conservatives detest the federal legislation, he minces few words.
 ''It's worse than New Coke or the Edsel,'' he said Wednesday at Saint Anselm College, near Manchester. ''Had they brought the federal bill to my desk when I was governor, I would have vetoed.''
 One difference, he said, is that Massachusetts, unlike Washington, did not finance its plan with a tax increase. But Massachusetts officials acknowledge that they were able to make the numbers work only by gaining federal permission to redirect Medicaid dollars that compensated hospitals for treating the uninsured. Since Mr. Romney left office in 2007, the state has raised taxes to keep the program afloat during the recession.
 Mr. Romney also pointed out that the national law would make heavy cuts in Medicare, although that is a purely federal program. He said it imposed price controls on insurance premiums, although it in fact only allows the government to review rate increases, not to reject them. 
 Another distinction is that the Massachusetts law made little effort to slow the growth of health costs. Those costs have escalated, Mr. Romney said, because state regulators have required residents to purchase policies that are far more generous than the catastrophic coverage he envisioned.
 In his book, Mr. Romney writes that costs could be controlled by eliminating financial incentives for unnecessary treatment and instead paying doctors and hospitals an annual fee for caring for patients. That is also the approach being embraced by Mr. Romney's successor, Gov. Deval L. Patrick, a Democrat. 
 At the book signing in Manchester, many Romney fans said they were satisfied with the distinctions he drew between the two plans. But David J. Citarelli, a financial consultant who voted for Mr. Romney in the 2008 Republican primary, said passage of the national law had focused his concerns about the insurance mandate. 
 ''This time,'' he said, ''I'll have to listen to what he has to say about why he wanted that to be part of the Massachusetts health care law. If you say it's not O.K. for the federal government to do it, how can you say it's O.K. for the states?''

HEADLINE: Executives Say Fannie Mae Is Torn by Conflicting Goals

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Too many conflicting goals make it all but impossible for the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to return to their earlier form, according to former executives of Fannie Mae and former regulators who tried to keep a watch on the companies. 
 They testified Friday during the third day of hearings by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission into the role of subprime lending in the crisis. 
 The structure of the companies, known as government-sponsored enterprises, or G.S.E.'s, required them ''to maintain a fine balance between financial goals and what we called mission goals,'' said Daniel H. Mudd, who served as chief executive of Fannie Mae from June 2005 until the federal government seized control of the company in September 2008. 
 That led to conflicts between pursuing profitability and public policy, between paying competitive salaries and not wasting taxpayer money, and between choosing loosened financial constraints or tough regulation.
 ''On one hand,'' he continued, ''without revenue and profits and growth, the company could not attract global capital to the U.S. housing market, and on the other hand, without meeting the mission goals for affordable housing and liquidity, the G.S.E.'s could not meet the requirements of their Congressional charter.''
 Similar sentiment was expressed by James B. Lockhart, who directed the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, beginning in May 2006.
 He concurred with the suggestions by commission members that heavy spending on lobbying by the mortgage companies allowed them to head off most Congressional attempts to raise their capital requirements.
 ''The G.S.E.'s' structure allowed them to be so politically strong that they resisted the very legislation that might have saved them,'' Mr. Lockhart said.
 While the Senate is likely to begin debate on a financial reform bill soon and the House has already approved one, a revamping of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is unlikely to be part of that legislation.
 The two companies account for about 90 percent of all home loans being made, meaning that it is hard to conceive of the government not having a role in the home finance market. The Obama administration has said, however, that it wants to revamp the current system.
 Mr. Mudd recommended one possible structure. ''I would have the G.S.E.'s focused on principally first-time home buyers,'' he said, giving them ''fixed-rate 30-year loans with 20 percent down, the old-fashioned way.'' 
 He added, however, ''the notion that you would be able to go back to a fully private structure,'' without government participation, ''cannot be logistically accomplished in our lifetime.''
 Several members of the commission, which was chartered by Congress to examine the causes of the financial crisis, said that they thought a big part of the problem was not conflict in the structure of the mortgage companies but in the incentives of executives. 
 The decision to plunge deeply into the market for subprime loans, for example, even as many other institutions were beginning to steer clear of the sector, was driven by the desire to increase profits as a way to increase earnings-related compensation, they said.
 ''You've just told us that you were motivated by a public purpose, but I don't see that reflected anywhere in how you actually got paid,'' said Heather H. Murren, a commission member. She is a former Merrill Lynch securities analyst and co-founder of the Nevada Cancer Institute.
 That suggests their motivation was not as much related to the company's public mission, she added, ''but really, rather, to achieving financial goals.''
 Mr. Mudd replied that the company, in recruiting employees to manage its complicated risk policies and to devise the financial instruments that allowed it to finance such a large portion of the mortgage market, was competing for employees not with nonprofit groups but with well-paying for-profit companies and with Wall Street.
 Compensation levels came up at another point, after Mr. Mudd and Robert J. Levin, Fannie Mae's former chief business officer, commented that Congress had sometimes charged the company with unattainable goals. At some times, they said, a mandated allocation of the company's portfolio to low-income housing exceeded market demand. 
 Asked whether they could have adjusted the company's focus to better reflect the market, Mr. Levin replied, ''That wasn't done at my pay grade.''
 Bill Thomas, the former California lawmaker who is the panel's vice chairman, pounced.
 ''My understanding is, between 2000 and 2008, you made $45 million,'' Mr. Thomas said. He added: ''I'm just amazed, Mr. Levin, if the kind of decisions that ran the company in the ground were above the $45 million mark, which was your pay grade.''
 The two mortgage-company executives did show some contrition, as has been the usual procedure for executives or regulators who have faced tough questioning by the commission. 
 ''I was the C.E.O. of the company and I accept responsibility for everything that happened on my watch,'' Mr. Mudd said.
 Armando Falcon, who led the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise oversight before Mr. Lockhart, implied that accepting responsibility now hardly addressed the causes of the crisis. 
 ''The companies were not unwitting victims of an economic down cycle or flawed products and services of theirs,'' he said. ''Their failure was deeply rooted in a culture of arrogance and greed.''

HEADLINE: Greenspan Criticized for Characterization of Colleague

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the summer of 2007, as he was dying from blood-cell cancer, Edward M. Gramlich, a former member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, sent a handwritten note to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman under whom he had served.
 At the time, the economy was reeling from subprime mortgage failures that had brought the housing market to its knees. News accounts noted that in 2000, Mr. Gramlich, alarmed about abusive loans, had urged Mr. Greenspan to send examiners to look into the lending practices of the bank holding companies the Fed oversees. Mr. Greenspan rebuffed the idea. 
 In the note, Mr. Gramlich tried to comfort Mr. Greenspan. ''I suppose we all go out with one item of unfinished business,'' he wrote. ''For me it is that I truly wish the press would stop kicking you around on the subprime supervision issue. What happened was a small incident and, as I think you know, if I had felt that strongly at the time, I would have made a bigger stink.''
 Mr. Gramlich, known as Ned, died of acute myeloid leukemia weeks later, at age 68.
 The note was provided to The New York Times on Friday. Two days earlier, Mr. Greenspan had told the panel appointed by Congress to examine the causes of the financial crisis that Mr. Gramlich had chosen not to formally raise the issue with the Fed's board.
 That characterization angered friends and colleagues of Mr. Gramlich, who said it distorted the fact that Mr. Gramlich was one of the few people to sound an early alarm about subprime mortgages. 
 ''That was totally outrageous,'' said Michael D. Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending. ''Ned was the one raising the flag about these loans. While he thought they could be useful, he had concerns about their sustainability and about foreclosures. And he was just shut down.''
 Mr. Calhoun called the testimony ''a desperate effort to rationalize Greenspan's own failures.''
 In a statement on Friday, Mr. Greenspan said his testimony should not have been interpreted as criticism. ''I wasn't finding fault with him at the hearing,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''On the contrary, he knew more about consumer issues than any of the board members, myself especially. I relied on him. I believe I voted with him on every single issue that he brought to the board.''
 In testimony, Mr. Greenspan said Mr. Gramlich was ''one of the best governors I think the board has ever had, and a very close friend of mine.'' 
 Under questioning from Phil Angelides, the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, however, Mr. Greenspan appeared to suggest that Mr. Gramlich shared responsibility. 
 ''Mr. Chairman, why, in the face of all that, did you not act to contain abusive, deceptive subprime lending?'' Mr. Angelides asked, noting Mr. Gramlich's warnings. ''Why did you allow it to become such an infection in the marketplace?'' 
 Mr. Greenspan noted that Mr. Gramlich was chairman of the committee that oversaw consumer credit. ''And indeed, we always looked to him to decide which we should be doing and which we shouldn't be doing, because he had the most knowledge,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''He chose not to bring those issues to the board.''
 That statement rankled economists who know both men.
 ''The Fed is this powerful and privileged institution, and it has a bully pulpit that it can use even when it doesn't have the direct authority to regulate,'' said Alicia H. Munnell, an economist at Boston College and a former research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. ''I think it's never appropriate for a Federal Reserve official to say, 'It's not our job.' In some ways, Alan Greenspan is saying that.''
 Paul N. Courant, an economics professor and the university librarian at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where Mr. Gramlich taught for many years, was more critical. 
 ''If Greenspan were as honorable and loyal as Gramlich, we wouldn't be having this conversation,'' Mr. Courant said in an interview, ''because Greenspan wouldn't have raised the point in the way he did in the hearing the other day.'' 
 Told about the note, Mr. Courant said that Mr. Gramlich, a longtime friend, was not one to settle scores. ''Ned wrote a lot of letters in the last couple of months of his life,'' Mr. Courant said. ''He knew he was dying. He was an extremely thoughtful and -- I don't know if this word means anything anymore -- a polite man. He was writing thank-you notes to many people. It doesn't surprise me at all that he wrote one to Greenspan. He didn't use those notes to stir up trouble.''
 NeighborWorks America, a nonprofit corporation created by Congress to support community development organizations, has a fellowship and a board room named for Mr. Gramlich, who represented the Fed on the board of the group. 
 ''He is clearly one of the heroes in this effort,'' said Kenneth D. Wade, chief executive of the organization, also known as the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. ''He did sound the alarm earlier than many others and attempted to do, it appears, what he could from the vantage point he was in.''

HEADLINE: The Risks and Returns of Municipal Bonds

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Municipal bonds are among the few tax shelters left for high-net-worth investors, but many of the entities backing them -- cities, states and public works projects -- are in such fiscal trouble that many investors are taking a closer look at these historically secure securities. 
 As Mary Williams Walsh wrote last week in The Times, some states have taken extreme steps to balance their budgets in the face of declining revenue and rising bills. These include Hawaii going to a four-day school week, Connecticut trying to create its own accounting rules and California making companies pay 70 percent of their 2010 tax by June 15. 
 If any company had initiated similar shock measures, its bond holders would have probably fled. But Brad Gewehr, head of fixed-income research at UBS Wealth Management Americas, said March nearly set a record for new municipal bond sales. 
 To add to investor confusion, one of the main credit rating agencies has re-evaluated how it rates municipalities, resulting in higher ratings even for California, the state often ranked as the worst fiscally. There is a logical explanation for this. Municipal and corporate bonds have been held to different criteria, and this readjustment is meant to rectify that. But the timing is at best counterintuitive.
 ''Initially, I don't think someone is going to wake up and say California is an A1 and everything has changed,'' Mr. Gewehr said, noting that the state's rating has risen three notches under the new criteria.
 But it does raise a question: What are the real risks of holding municipal bonds when states and municipalities are struggling to pay their bills?
 NO GUARANTEES The reality is that municipal bonds have a historically minuscule default rate. Even in California, the state's constitution says bond holders are second only to primary education to be paid from tax receipts. 
 ''We would not assume that any state can't go under,'' said Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, an investment advisory firm. ''If the government bailed out a bank, don't you think they'd bail out a state?'' 
 But there is another more pressing issue than an outright default: what happens if an investor wants to sell the bonds before the maturity date? Right now, given the fiscal problems in some states like California, New York, Florida and Illinois, it could be difficult to sell the bonds for close to their original price. ''I sold a Philadelphia bond this morning and I was kissing the ground that I got 85 cents on the dollar,'' said Mary P. Talbutt-Glassberg, vice president and fixed-income portfolio manager at Davidson Trust Company. 
 Getting less than you paid for a security is always a risk. But Ms. Talbutt-Glassberg said that even investors who held their bonds to maturity could be in for a surprise if the municipality's finances deteriorated. 
 ''What if when the bond matures, they hand you another one?'' she said, of a forced rollover into a new bond to pay off the old one. ''What do I do if I needed the money for college tuition?''
 While people who own munis issued by the state where they pay taxes get a bigger tax break then those who hold the bonds of another state, there is a greater case now to forgo some of that tax benefit for broader diversification. 
 IS THE MARKET RIGHT? The prevailing thinking is still that all the bad news about municipalities has been priced into the bonds. This has led to two lines of thought. 
 The first is that this is a great time to buy municipal bonds, because things can only get better. ''The market's taking its cue from California and pricing these bonds as if they're a lot more likely to default than they are,'' said Milton Ezrati, senior economist at Lord Abbett. 
 By his reckoning, any small improvement in a municipality's finances could quickly raise the prices of its bonds. 
 The second argument, perhaps not surprisingly, is that this is a risky time to buy municipal bonds. While Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital Management in Los Angeles, agreed that the market had reacted quickly to bad news, she disagreed on the amount of improvement needed to raise the outlook for municipal bonds. 
 ''Any minor improvement will be a godsend, but it will have a small impact,'' she said. ''Everything is not going to be all right.'' The condition of public finance is such, she said, that a bond price moving up does not mean all is well. 
 Where both camps agree is on the need to be more selective in picking municipal bonds. George Strickland, managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, which focuses on municipal bonds, said default rates were historically high in 2008 and 2009. They were still well under one-half of 1 percent, but he is being more selective in what he buys. 
 ''There are a lot of moving parts right now,'' Mr. Strickland said. ''The city of Los Angeles says it's running out of money and won't be able to pay its bills, and Harrisburg and Detroit are flirting with bankruptcy.'' 
 WHAT ARE MUNIS FOR? The credit crunch showed that even safe assets are not as safe as we think. People who put their money in the Reserve Primary's money market fund found this out the hard way when they could not withdraw their cash in September 2008. 
 Municipal bonds have historically been desirable because of both their safety and tax savings. Even now, Mr. Fisher argued, they have lower risk. 
 He calculated the returns from the peak of the economic cycle in October 2007 to February 2010 if an investor had divided his assets in the classic split of 60 percent stocks to 40 percent bonds. 
 The 60 percent tracked the S.& P. 500 index. But he put the 40 percent in a three-year municipal bond fund and also in a long-term corporate bond fund. Rebalancing the portfolio quarterly, the results were nearly identical: with the muni fund, the portfolio was down 3.53 percent and with the corporate bond fund it was down 3.58 percent. And that was before the tax benefit from the municipal bonds was factored in.
 ''The returns were the same, but the risks were a lot more with corporate bonds and the taxes were higher,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''Our view is the purpose of owning fixed income is to reduce risk.''
 Regardless of what states do to get their fiscal houses in order, federal taxes are still set to rise next year. That will keep municipal bonds an attractive tax shelter for wealthy investors -- if they choose carefully.

HEADLINE: A Better Way to Protect Consumers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Derailing Help for Consumers,'' by Bob Herbert (column, March 27):
 The concerns of small business about the impact of specific provisions in the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency legislation are legitimate and deserve to be heard. 
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has long called for modernizing our financial regulatory system to protect consumers, help ensure abundant, affordable access to capital for individuals and businesses, and provide the basis of new economic growth that will help create millions of new jobs.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses we represent, however, are concerned that the agency would have unprecedented powers over the economy and have authority far beyond banks and other providers of financial products. The language in the current bill is vague and could impose new regulations on any business that permits customers to pay in more than four installments or on a business that applies interest charges for late payments -- like your orthodontist.
 Small businesses are also concerned that the agency would have unchecked authority to write its own rules without oversight by Congress, the Federal Reserve or even the president.
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has proposed a Consumer Protection Council to coordinate regulatory and enforcement actions, eliminate gaps, provide consistent disclosure standards and identify areas in which new regulations are necessary. This would be a more efficient approach that would not hurt the economy or restrict investment.
 Mr. Herbert says, ''Ordinary Americans need someone on their side in the wild world of consumer credit.'' We agree! Americans also need someone on their side to create jobs and protect the economy. Our plan does all three.

HEADLINE: New York State Backs Remorseful Buyers at Rushmore Tower

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Call it the multimillion-dollar typo.
 On Friday, the New York State attorney general's office ruled in favor of a group of buyers who were looking to back out of their multimillion-dollar contracts at the Rushmore, an expensive Manhattan condominium building along the Hudson River. The buyers found an unusual loophole -- a seemingly minor typo in a date in the densely worded 732-page offering plan -- and used it to argue that they deserved their hefty deposits back.
 The developers, at risk of losing tens of millions of dollars in sales, fought back, saying they had made a trivial error that should be ignored. But on Friday, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo's office, which arbitrates such cases, released a decision agreeing with the buyers. 
 ''The attorney general finds in favor of purchaser regarding purchaser's application for the release of the down payment,'' the ruling concluded.
 The decision brought to an end a dispute that began last year, when 23 buyers who paid about $10 million in deposits on $70 million in apartments filed the application with the attorney general's office. The case grew to include 41 buyers. 
 The Rushmore, at 80 Riverside Boulevard, near West End Avenue, is a gleaming and fairly new 41-story tower surrounded by parks. Units in the building sold quickly when they first went on the market, but as the economy fizzled, the developers -- the Extell Development Company and the Carlyle Group -- offered discounts to new buyers. Many of the earlier buyers subsequently sought a way out of their contracts. Some complained of construction that had yet to be completed and hoped to recoup their deposits and walk away, while others wanted an opportunity to negotiate a better deal.
 When the developers resisted, the group seized on the typo. 
 State regulations require that a developer provide an operating budget for the first year of a new condominium. But the developer is also required to submit a new budget if the first closing does not take place by the end of the budget year. When that happens, the developer must also give the buyers a right to rescind their contracts.
 In this case, the typo got in the way. Instead of stating that buyers had the right to back out if the first closing did not occur before Sept. 1, 2009, the offering plan stated that buyers had the right to back out if the first closing did not occur before Sept. 1, 2008, which was the first day of the budget year, not the last.
 Ultimately, the first closing took place in February 2009.
 The sponsors argued that they made a trivial mistake -- a typo that lawyers refer to as a ''scrivener's error'' -- that should be overlooked. But the attorney general's office disagreed. It sided with the buyers. 
 ''We're quite pleased that the attorney general decided to enforce the contracts as written,'' said Richard N. Cohen, a lawyer for 32 of the buyers. 
 Two or three of his clients want to renegotiate, Mr. Cohen said, but ''most people just want their money back.'' He said his clients would be refunded about $15 million in down payments.
 Reached by telephone Friday night, Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, said that the building was finished and more than 50 percent sold.
 ''It's a beautiful, spectacular building,'' he said. ''I think personally that any of these people who don't turn out to buy at the Rushmore will regret it.''
 He added that some of the affected units had already been resold.
 ''We certainly have seen some people that were trying to get out of the contract come in and close,'' he said, ''and we probably will see some of the other people come in and purchase units.''

 BODY:
LET'S talk about getting naked.
 I don't mean this as a come-on, though you're looking mighty fine today -- have you been working out?
 No, we're here to talk about financial transparency. Which is, metaphorically speaking, getting naked.
 If you don't see the connection, first consider the new generation of body scanners being used at airports around the world. The Obama administration intends to spend hundreds of millions of dollars for more of the machines. Unlike basic metal detectors, they can spot nonmetallic weapons smuggled under clothing -- like a packet of explosive powder in someone's underwear. The scanners, which present a ghostly image of each passenger's body under their clothing, are fairly controversial. Groups like the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, call them a ''digital strip search.'' 
 England is deploying them, but ran into concerns that scanning younger fliers might violate child pornography laws. In Germany, puckish protesters stripped at Berlin-Tegel airport, showing off anti-scanner slogans inked on their bodies and making a bold point about privacy. 
 Here in the United States, Congress originally approved the scanners' use as a secondary search for people who aroused suspicion, but now we'll all have a chance for a little high-tech streaking. The government has tried to reassure people that it has taken steps to address privacy concerns: people can opt for a pat-down search instead of exposure by the scanners, for example. 
 The administration assures us that the machines can't store images, and that the person viewing the images will be in a room without gawkers or gigglers. EPIC, however, obtained documents that suggest the government's assurances might not be entirely supported by the facts: some users can change settings to increase image clarity and store pictures.
 The government clearly thinks it's a good idea to trade privacy for safety. So why not go naked financially, too? 
 Here's my logic, such as it is: Experts blamed the near-collapse of the American economy on shadowy derivatives and hidden debt exposure, which is a lot like having powdered explosives in our financial underpants. So maybe we need more, um, transparency.
 I don't say this because I like being naked. I'm not a naturist, though I do remember, back in my college days in Austin, Tex., a couple of sheepish visits to a skinny-dipping stretch of lakeside known as Hippie Hollow. 
 I just think that if we really believe in transparency, we ought to be willing to stand up for the concept in the extreme, and put the privates back in privacy. Those captains of finance who boldly took risks with the American economy? The next time they testify before Congress, they go au naturel. Force the emperors to show that they really have no clothes, under the bright lights of national television, and I guarantee that you'll see malfeasance shrink. C-Span ratings might get a boost, too, though most companies would have to hire more attractive executives before that would work.
 Maybe we should take the idea even further: everybody strips, if not by shedding their clothes, then at least by exposing their assets. We're already rendered nearly nude, metaphorically, when we apply for a mortgage refinancing or a credit card. Have you seen the information they can pull on us from databases? We're walking around like patients in hospital gowns, with the back flapping free and feeling the breeze; let's drop the meaningless scrap of fiscal cotton and have all of our data out there all the time.
 How? If you're shy, there's no need to tattoo your mutual fund account numbers on your chest, or your mortgage balance on your nether parts. Embroidery on your shirt and a string of revealing numbers on the signature lines of your e-mail will do just fine. With the full-money monty and no secrets, we might avoid future financial embarrassment.
 You might be thinking, ''Schwartz, you idiot'' -- and believe me, you wouldn't be the first. But my idea is not new. One of my favorite movies, ''L.A. Story,'' provides a pretty good example of fiscal nudity in action: A trendy restaurant demands the economic data on each guest. (The maitre d' asks, ''You think with a financial statement like this you can have the duck?'') The only problem with this brilliant visualization is that ''L.A. Story'' was a comedy, so people didn't take it seriously. 
 I decided to call an expert to test my theory. Nicky Hoffman, the managing director of the Naturist Society, works with people who get naked for fun. (The first time she addressed a Naturist Society conference, she says, she was a bit nonplussed, so they told her to imagine the audience with their clothes on.)
 Ms. Hoffman initially warmed to my theory, especially when it comes to airport security. ''They should let us go through naked -- then you wouldn't have any of these problems,'' she said with a laugh.
 But when I started talking about financial nakedness, and putting our monetary information out there for all the world to see, even Ms. Hoffman became a little skittish. ''It's invasive,'' she said. ''I'd rather have somebody see my body than see my bank account.''
 That's a problem. If Ms. Hoffman is against it, how can I expect the rest of my nation to strip for our financial health? 
 It's O.K. I didn't want to see Richard Fuld, the former chairman of Lehman Brothers, in the buff anyway.

HEADLINE: Mr. Broadway Storms Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 ROCCO LANDESMAN, the larger-than-life Broadway producer, was digging into a hefty cheese steak and fries in the Philadelphia train station one night last month, waiting to catch the Acela back to his new home in Georgetown. Mr. Landesman, whose culinary tastes are not nearly as sophisticated as his tastes in theater, had a hankering for some Popeyes fried chicken. But, hey, this was Philadelphia, so he figured he'd have the cheese steak.
 It had been a grueling day of touring art galleries and talking up local business leaders and city officials, another chapter in the self-education of Mr. Landesman, who last August traded his Broadway career for a government job: chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, the federal grant-making agency. Ever since, he has been giving himself crash courses on the arts in American life and the peculiar customs of the nation's capital.
 Mr. Landesman is not exactly the Washington type; he is a fast-moving, risk-taking entrepreneur who is colorful (his passions include horse racing, gambling, baseball and alligator cowboy boots) and blunt. Now Mr. Broadway is busy transforming himself into Mr. Bureaucracy. It has been, he confesses, a bit of a challenge. 
 ''You have to be very careful what you say,'' he said, as his press secretary hustled to the table with bottles of chili sauce and Tabasco. Mr. Landesman took the chili sauce and kept talking.
 ''Everyone's parsing every word that you utter, and I'm not used to that,'' he said. ''If the consequences are just you, it's one thing. But everything has all these repercussions. I'm trying to find a balance because I have to be me, and I pride myself on being candid and direct and saying what I think. But occasionally I have to think about what I say.''
 On Tuesday, the new, perhaps more politic Mr. Landesman will make his debut on Capitol Hill to testify about his agency's 2011 proposed budget. In Washington budget testimony is a big deal: a chance for department chiefs to lay out their agendas and beg Congress for cash. Mr. Landesman, who is trying to use his star power to develop the Endowment into a catalyst that can generate far-reaching investment in the arts, has made clear that he has big ideas for his little agency.
 The trouble is, he doesn't have much money. On the up side, the culture wars that nearly put the agency out of business in the 1980s and 1990s now seem a thing of the past. But in an era of deep recession Washington is consumed with cutting the deficit, not spending more on the arts.
 President Obama is requesting $161.3 million for the Endowment, the same as his request for the current fiscal year: a piddling sum in a city where budgets are typically measured in billions. Before coming to Washington, Mr. Landesman called the agency's budget ''pathetic.'' Now, he insists, he will be ''pounding the table'' for it.
 ''Understandably, I don't think the administration appreciates my complaining about the budget all the time,'' he said. ''If every head of every agency did that, you'd have a pretty unruly situation.'' He paused for a moment to admonish himself: ''I've got to cut down on the whining.''
 So instead of just whining, Mr. Landesman has become politically creative, hitting the road to promote his new slogan, ''Art Works.'' It is a muscular phrase, intended to persuade Americans -- including those Americans who happen to be members of Congress -- that investment in art can build stronger communities and revive a flagging economy. Typically his tours are arranged by local foundations, key patrons of the arts. Always his mantra is the same: ''Arts jobs are real jobs.''
 Along the way he has become a kind of Pied Piper for the arts. In Peoria, Ill., a city he chose after sticking his foot in his mouth with an impolitic comment about the quality of theater there, he took in a high school production of ''Rent.'' In Philadelphia he took a bus tour of the city's famed murals. In San Diego he strolled through Balboa Park wearing yellow cowboy boots and a turquoise tie. And it was no accident that he turned up Monday in Idaho, home of the top Republican on the panel that controls Endowment financing. 
 Meanwhile, in Washington, Mr. Landesman has been sticking to his script, avoiding in-depth interviews as he prepares for his testimony. He is also quietly cultivating powerful allies in Mr. Obama's cabinet, hoping to make an end run around his budget constraints by joining with agencies that have more money than his. 
 If the Transportation Department is paying for pedestrian walkways and light rail, Mr. Landesman reasons, why not bring in artists to paint murals? If the Housing and Urban Development Department is revitalizing blighted neighborhoods, why not include gallery space? 
 Shaun Donovan, the housing secretary, and Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, are enthusiastic, and the White House is on board, although details are sketchy. (''We really have to put it down on paper,'' Mr. LaHood said.) And there was something else he liked: at one of those staid Washington dinners Mr. Landesman turned up in a tuxedo and playful hot-pink bow tie.
 ''He was probably the only guy in the room,'' Mr. LaHood said, ''who could have gotten away with that tie.''
 To understand where Mr. Landesman is going, it helps to know a few well-documented facts about where he has been. 
 He grew up in St. Louis, where his father and uncle ran a cabaret theater, the Crystal Palace, drawing performers like Woody Allen and Barbra Streisand before they became big names. (His Midwestern roots may account for his culinary preferences; when he is on the road, one of his favorite restaurants is Steak 'n Shake.)
 He dabbled in acting as an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin, then studied dramatic literature and criticism at the Yale School of Drama, where he received a doctorate and taught for four years, until 1978. 
 In the three decades since, Mr. Landesman, 62, has built a resume, both professional and otherwise, that defies categorization. As president and later owner of Jujamcyn Theaters, the third largest of Broadway's big theater companies, he put on smash hits like ''The Producers'' and influential dramas like Tony Kushner's ''Angels in America.'' He has also run a mutual fund; bought and sold racehorses; co-owned two minor league baseball teams; and, in an achievement hailed by anyone who has ever written about him, won $1.3 million by hitting the trifecta at the Kentucky Derby. 
 In 1994, in an interview with The New Yorker, Mr. Landesman expounded on his philosophy of life by extolling the virtues of carrying large wads of cash. ''The most important thing in life is a sense of possibility,'' the magazine quoted him as saying, ''and you simply can't have it with less than $10,000 in your pocket.'' 
 Friends thought he was nuts to take the Endowment job. He was not even recruited; he volunteered. He was sitting in his office at the St. James Theater on 44th Street when a good friend and fellow producer, Margo Lion, who advised the Obama campaign on arts policy, mused aloud that she was looking for candidates for a new chairman. 
 ''He said, 'I'll do it,' and we all laughed,'' Ms. Lion recalled.
 Mr. Landesman wasn't kidding. ''I felt if you were ever going to do public service, if you were going to do more than write checks or serve on a couple of boards, if you didn't do it now, in this administration, when would you ever do it?'' he said. ''I don't know what else I was going to do in theater anyway. I was having a good time, butto some degree I was on autopilot.''
 In retrospect, Ms. Lion said, it was the right fit. ''I think it was the perfect intersection of opportunity and timing for him psychologically,'' she said. ''Even though he talks country music and wears cowboy boots and likes to eat at Arby's, the truth is he's a very deep thinker. He seems to be having a great time. He keeps saying, 'Everybody here is so smart.' ''
 One of Mr. Landesman's first acts was to hire Joan Shigekawa, an elegant, soft-spoken woman who worked for the Rockefeller Foundation, as his senior deputy chairwoman. They met for the first time on a Wednesday over lunch, and on Sunday he offered her the job. She recalled, ''I said: 'You're not even confirmed yet. How can you be making these job offers?' '' 
 In her previous post Ms. Shigekawa had financed research examining the nexus between art and community redevelopment, and she gave Mr. Landesman a stream of academic papers. The studies became the intellectual underpinning for a new signature initiative: Our Town, a $5 million pilot project aimed at helping 35 communities plan and develop arts districts and projects that emphasize design. 
 Mr. Landesman will formally unveil the plan on Tuesday on Capitol Hill; if it is successful, he hopes to expand it. The arts field is eager. ''For too long the arts have been siloed as something that is kind of separate from life, separate from the economy,'' said Gary Steuer, chief cultural officer for the City of Philadelphia. ''Rocco is really eager to blow that out and take it to another level, to really look at the role of arts in economic development.''
 When he arrived in Washington, the first thing Mr. Landesman did was redecorate. The chairman's suite in the Old Post Office Pavilion, a historic structure on Pennsylvania Avenue, was painted the usual shade of government white. Mr. Landesman left white for the trim and ordered claret for the walls and buttercup for the ceilings. He hung his father's paintings (the elder Landesman was a part-time artist) and installed an old-fashioned city parking meter -- a gift from Ms. Lion -- on his desk. He uses it to keep things moving. 
 ''Rocco doesn't like long meetings,'' Ms. Shigekawa said.
 He sought counsel from people schooled in the ways of Washington, like Jim Leach, the former Republican congressman, now chairman the National Endowment for the Humanities, and Bill Ivey, who led the Arts Endowment under President Bill Clinton. Mr. Ivey, who was saddled with the fallout from controversies over agency grants for Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs and Andres Serrano's urine-submerged crucifix, met Mr. Landesman years ago through a shared love of country music and sees him as someone who can restore the Endowment's confidence and prestige.
 ''He is the kind of personality who can move it out of its defensive crouch, into a more upright stance,'' Mr. Ivey said. ''He's a risk taker. I think he's a leader who can make sense to many members of Congress, who are also, frankly, risk takers.''
 Still, Mr. Landesman must be careful not to push Congress too hard. Representative Norm Dicks, the Democrat from Washington State who until recently was chairman of the subcommittee that controls Endowment financing, remembers giving Mr. Landesman a gentle lesson in how the capital reacts to overambitious newcomers.
 ''He asked me, 'Well, why don't you just put in a whole bunch of money?' '' Mr. Dicks said. ''I just said: 'Listen, I'm trying to take this in increments. I want to have those 45 or 50 Republicans that vote for the N.E.A. stay with us, and if we went too far, too fast, we'd threaten that.' '' 
 Republicans are more receptive than in decades past, but not entirely convinced by Mr. Landesman's argument that arts jobs are just as good as construction jobs. Many balked when the Endowment received $50 million in stimulus money. 
 ''If it created jobs, you'd have 435 members of Congress saying, 'Let's put in more money to the N.E.A.,' '' said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia. ''The only shovel-ready aspect of it is that they need a shovel to clean up some of the bull they believe in over there.''
 Despite the challenges Mr. Landesman often seems like the happiest guy in town. Mr. Donovan, the housing secretary, said that so many people in Washington now know the new Endowment chief that no one bothers to use his last name. ''It's a little bit like Madonna at this point,'' he said. 
 Not long ago Mr. Landesman convened a meeting of the National Council on the Arts, an Endowment advisory body. He picked up the gavel and, looking amused at himself, confessed that he had never held one before. He pounded it on the table, calling the session to order with an impish grin. ''I take no responsibility,'' the new chairman declared, ''for what is about to happen.''

HEADLINE: An Internet for Everybody

BYLINE: By SUSAN CRAWFORD. 
Susan Crawford, a former special assistant to President Obama for science, technology and innovation policy, is a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.

DATELINE: Ann Arbor, Mich. 

 BODY:
 LAST week, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the Federal Communications Commission lacks the legal authority to tell Comcast not to block certain uses of its Internet access services. This decision has become a rip-the-Band-Aid-off moment for the regulatory agency, forcing it to reconsider its effort to impose ''network neutrality'' by requiring that Internet access providers treat all content equally. 
 It also puts a substantial roadblock in the path of the commission's National Broadband Plan, which proposes to spend billions of dollars to help provide Internet access, rather than phone access, for people in rural areas. 
 But the F.C.C. needn't change either strategy. It can regain its authority to pursue both network neutrality and widespread access to broadband by formally relabeling Internet access services as ''telecommunications services,'' rather than ''information services,'' as they are called now. All the commission needs to do is prove it has a good reason. 
 It wouldn't be the first time that the F.C.C. relabeled Internet access services -- and certainly not the first time it addressed the need for equal access. Until August 2005, the commission required that companies providing high-speed access to the Internet over telephone lines not discriminate among Web sites. This allowed innumerable online businesses -- eBay, Google, Amazon, your local knitter -- to start up without asking permission from phone and cable companies. There was nothing unusual about this legal requirement; for more than 100 years, federal regulators had treated telegraph and telephone service providers as ''common carriers,'' obligated to serve everyone equally.
 But under the Bush administration the F.C.C. deregulated high-speed Internet providers, arguing that cable Internet access was different from the kind of high-speed Internet access provided by phone companies. Cable Internet access providers, the commission said, really offered an integrated bundle of services -- not just Internet connection but also e-mail, Web hosting, news groups and other services. So the F.C.C. declared that high-speed Internet access would no longer be considered a ''telecommunications service'' but rather an ''information service.'' This removed all high-speed Internet access services -- phone as well as cable -- from regulation under the common-carrier section of the Communications Act. 
 This was a radical move, because it reversed the long-held assumption that a nondiscriminatory communications network was essential to economic growth, civic welfare and innovation. At the same time, the F.C.C. said that it would retain the power to regulate Internet access providers if the need arose, under another section of the Communications Act. 
 The Bush F.C.C. hoped that deregulation would prompt greater competition in Internet access services. But a wave of mergers instead reduced it. Prices stayed high and speeds slow. And eventually the carriers started saying that they wanted to be gatekeepers -- creating fast lanes for some Web sites and applications and slow lanes for others. 
 In its decision last week, the appeals court said that the ''information services'' label given to high-speed Internet access providers means the F.C.C. cannot prohibit companies like Comcast from engaging in discriminatory activities. But if the F.C.C.'s labeling of high-speed Internet access providers undermines its ability to tell them what to do, how can it ensure that consumers get the information they need about real speeds and prices? How can it ensure that basic communications services -- which, these days, means Internet access -- are widely available? 
 The F.C.C. has the legal authority to change the label, as long as it can provide a good reason. And that reason is obvious: Americans buy an Internet access service based on its speed and price -- and not on whether an e-mail address is included as part of a bundle. The commission should state its case, relabel high-speed Internet access as a ''telecommunications service,'' and take back the power to protect American consumers.

HEADLINE: Africa's Drug Problem

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB. 
James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author, most recently, of ''The Freedom Agenda.''

 BODY:
On the tarmac of Osvaldo Vieira, the international airport of the West African coastal country of Guinea-Bissau, sits a once-elegant Gulfstream jet, which in the normal course of events would have no reason to land in a country with no business opportunities and virtually no economy. In recent years, however, Guinea-Bissau has emerged as a nodal point in three-way cocaine-trafficking operations linking producers in South America with users in Europe; the value of the cocaine that transits this small and heartbreakingly impoverished country dwarfs its gross national product. The Gulfstream arrived unexpectedly from Venezuela on July 12, 2008, and taxied to a hangar at the adjacent military airbase -- where soldiers formed a line and unloaded its contents. The contents, reportedly more than a half-ton of cocaine, vanished. The crew was arrested and released. The army permitted the government to impound the plane only after several days. Since then, the plane has sat in the harsh sun, a reminder of Guinea-Bissau's helplessness before forces far more powerful than itself. 
 The most evident of those forces are South American crime syndicates with billions of dollars at their disposal and new markets to explore. But the dynamic before which Guinea-Bissau and its neighbors along the West African coast are truly helpless is globalization, which ensures that producers will find a way to deliver all things insatiably desired, whether good or bad. West Africa, which neither produces nor consumes significant quantities of cocaine, is a victim of changes in global supply and demand. Partly because of heightened American and South American efforts in recent years, the flow of cocaine to the United States diminished. Traffickers increasingly turned to Europe, where cocaine use grew significantly over the last decade. European law-enforcement officials responded by cracking down on air and maritime routes from South America. And the traffickers in turn adapted by establishing the West Africa connection.
 Just as the efficient marketplaces of the world's financial capitals serve as the nexus for global trade, so ungoverned or remote places offer an indispensable service for global criminals. And West Africa includes 10 of the 20 lowest scorers on the United Nations' index of development; governments are correspondingly brittle and corrupt. Guinea-Bissau furnished grim proof of the region's political frailty a week and a half ago, when mutinous soldiers overthrew the army chief of staff, whom Western officials had viewed as a bulwark in the fight against drug trafficking. Guinea-Bissau and its neighbors offer to South American drug traffickers what the impenetrable terrain of the Hindu Kush offers to Al Qaeda and the Taliban -- a place beyond the reach of law. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that 40 tons of cocaine, with a street value of $1.8 billion, crossed West Africa on the way to Europe in 2006. The number has now dropped significantly, but many law-enforcement officials view this as a pause before further adaptation.
 In the last few years, West African states began to wake up to the dangers of the drug trade, which is swamping their tiny economies and corrupting -- or further corrupting -- their politics. American and European leaders have, if belatedly, become equally alarmed: the U.N. Security Council has recognized drug trafficking as a threat to international peace and security. Last summer, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on the subject. Douglas Farah, a former investigative journalist who now studies crime and terrorism at the International Assessment and Strategy Center, a research institution in Alexandria, Va., testified that criminal organizations and terrorists ''use the same pipelines, the same illicit structures and exploit the same state weaknesses.'' Such organizations are increasingly converging and even forming ''hybrid'' bodies like the FARC in Colombia. Farah predicted the emergence of such groupings in West Africa ''in the very near future''; they may, he added, already exist. So far, however, the international community has found it as frustrating to stem the flow of cocaine through West Africa as it has to root out jihadists in North Waziristan.
 According to U.N. reports, as well as American law-enforcement and intelligence officials, cocaine crosses the Atlantic from South America either in small planes, including Cessna turboprops outfitted with an extra bladder of fuel, or in commercial fishing vessels or cargo ships. The drugs are then transported in bulk along one of several routes. Some are taken to the international airports in Dakar, Senegal and Accra, Ghana or elsewhere, where they are generally swallowed in relatively small amounts by couriers and flown to European cities. Other shipments are transported northward by truck or carried overland across ancient smuggling routes before crossing the Mediterranean into southern Europe. The African couriers and crime syndicates are often paid in ''product,'' which has the additional effect of creating a local market for cocaine.
 Alexandre Schmidt, head of the U.N. drug office in West Africa, says he was struck by the astonishing nimbleness of the traffickers, who seem to pick up and discard routes and countries spontaneously. Nigerian gangs have begun to assert more control over the front end of the process and also increasingly dominate -- and profit from -- the delivery of the drugs to Europe, whether by sea or air. Schmidt says that while the traffickers route drugs through the weakest states, they take advantage of the stronger ones, like Senegal and Ivory Coast, for logistics and money laundering.
 Trafficking patterns have begun to evolve in frightening directions. Last summer, authorities in Guinea, a country neighboring Guinea-Bissau that is widely viewed as a virtual narcostate, alerted the U.N. drug office to elaborate laboratories and a vast cache of ''precursor'' chemicals, which could have been used to manufacture as much as $170 million worth of the drug Ecstasy, as well as to refine cocaine. In November, an old Boeing 727, which had taken off in Colombia, crossed West African airspace and touched down on an airstrip controlled by terrorist groups in the desert of Mali. The plane was almost certainly carrying cocaine and perhaps guns as well; no one knows, since the cargo was unloaded before the plane was burned. Late last year, in a separate case, federal prosecutors in New York indicted three Malian men who they say had promised to transport drugs across the desert in league with Al Qaeda, which would serve as the security arm of the operation; officials said one of the men is caught on tape claiming that he regularly supplied extremist forces with gasoline and food.
 Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, is among the most pitiful of African capitals. On my first morning in town, I walked over to the harbor, where the elegant Portuguese villas along the water had turned black with mold. Back in the center of town -- a distance of three blocks -- I peeked into the Mercado Central, which looked like an archaeological ruin, with concrete pillars standing in a wasteland; it burned down years before. Scarcely anything has been built since the independence movement finished forcing out the Portuguese in 1974 (not that the Portuguese did much to develop the country, any more than they did in Angola or Mozambique). Vendors selling fruit and palm oil and cheap hardware lined the streets, as they would in any provincial African town. Swarms of children in filthy T-shirts thrust forward empty tin cans, crying ''esmola'' -- alms. Everyone seemed to be hungry.
 Guinea-Bissau has fertile soil, and it enjoys the intrinsic advantage of an Atlantic coastline. But generations of colonial neglect have been followed by decades of sovereign neglect. Coups and attempted coups are a regular feature of its brief history. President Joao Bernardo Vieira, ousted in 1999, was permitted to return in 2005, a period that coincided with the first stirrings of the three-cornered drug trade. Vieira and elements of the military swiftly established links with the traffickers. Geography conspired as well, for the roughly 90 islands of the Bijagos of Guinea-Bissau provided the perfect drop-off point for drug shipments. Antonio Mazzitelli, Schmidt's predecessor at the U.N. drug office, says Guinea-Bissau sold narcotraffickers access to several islands in the Bijagos; the country's minister of justice at that time suggested to him that the international community secure islands of its own as a counterstrategy.
 Guinea-Bissau offered proximity to Europe, a purchasable state structure, a desperate citizenry and a hopelessly overmatched police force. The Judiciary Police numbered a few dozen and had no vehicles and few weapons, handcuffs, flashlights -- a serious problem in a capital with no streetlights -- or even shoes. Their prison consisted of a few locked rooms with barred windows in their headquarters on the road leading out of the capital. Corruption was rife. And yet they made some spectacular arrests. Jorge Djata, the deputy chief of the drug squad, told me that in September 2006, he received word of a shipment of drugs coming into Bissau from a town to the northwest. He and several colleagues jumped into one of the rattletrap Mercedes taxis that ply the city's streets, followed the car to a house rented by Colombians and took them by surprise. The haul was 674 kilograms, or nearly 1,500 pounds, of cocaine with a street value of about $50 million. 
 What happened next, however, defines the problems of law enforcement in countries like Guinea-Bissau even more than does the lack of shoes and guns and cars. Djata and his colleagues took the three Colombians and the drugs to their headquarters. Then, Djata says: ''We got a call from the prime minister's office saying that we must yield up the drugs to the civil authorities. They said the drugs would not be secure in police headquarters, and they must be taken to the public treasury.'' A squad of heavily armed Interior Ministry police surrounded the building. Djata said his boss replied, ''We will bring the drugs ourselves, and then we will burn them.'' Government officials refused. Djata and his men relented, and the drugs were taken to the public treasury. And soon, of course, they disappeared -- as did the Colombians.
 The high-ranking military officials who coordinated the arrival and unloading of the Gulfstream in 2008 were never charged, and the case was closed for lack of evidence. Ansumane Sanha, who served until recently as one of three magistrates investigating drug cases, told me that South American dealers were frequently issued Guinea-Bissau passports. They drove around the dusty, pitted streets of Bissau in Hummers and Jaguars. The parliamentary elections of November 2008, though generally deemed fair by international observers, were viewed by the Bissau-Guineans themselves as a raucous bidding war. ''The streets were full of 4-by-4 cars,'' recalls Luis Vaz Martins, the president of a local nongovernmental organization, the Human Rights League of Guinea-Bissau. ''The parties would give cars to any influential man. I've never seen so many members of Parliament who were drug dealers.'' Vaz Martins says the dealers scrambled for cabinet posts, above all the ministries of interior and fisheries. Why fisheries? ''This is the most important,'' Vaz Martins explains. ''The drugs come by plane, and they're dropped into the sea, and if you're the minister of fisheries, you can send boats to pick them up.'' The navy had a few boats as well, used for the same purpose. The police, of course, had no boats. 
 Guinea-Bissau seems hopelessly afflicted with bad government. On the evening of March 1, 2009, the army chief of staff, Gen. Batista Thagme Na Waie, was assassinated in an explosion. Hours later, President Vieira was hacked to death. Vieira may have had Thagme killed; or the murder may have been carried out by drug dealers who felt double-crossed. Soldiers loyal to Thagme appear to have killed the president in revenge, though some speculate that forces in the military were responsible for both assassinations. Neither murder has been solved or is likely to be. The killings eliminated at a stroke two of Guinea-Bissau's founding fathers as well as two of its most notorious figures. Trafficking dropped in the aftermath, possibly because drug lords no longer knew who could guarantee their security. Thagme was replaced by Gen. Jose Zamora Induta, an intellectual respected for his integrity. In July, Malam Bacai Sanha, another figure then believed to have no known ties to trafficking, was elected president. But the recent coup may have dashed all hopes for reform. Not only was Induta deposed, but mutinous soldiers also liberated from a U.N. office a notorious naval official who had once been forced to flee the country after allegations of drug corruption. That figure, Adm. Jose Americo Bubo na Tchuto, is now the new deputy chief of staff.
 During my visit -- before the coup, of course -- senior government officials assured me that all the bad things were in the past. The justice minister, Mamadou Saliu Djalo Pires, whom international enforcement officials view as one of their key allies, said, ''The new cabinet is very conscious of the problem of impunity.'' He said prosecutors were working on indictments in the Gulfstream case; high-ranking military officials would be brought to justice. In fact, the military still essentially controls Guinea-Bissau, and few believe that General Induta exercised real control over senior officers. Nevertheless, the international community felt at the time that it finally had partners it could work with and had been lining up with offers of equipment and training. While I was in town, the French ambassador held a ceremony to hand over to the police three new 4-by-4 vehicles, worth about $70,000. The United Nations drug office held a daylong workshop with officials representing Portugal, Spain, the European Union and other countries, as well as key domestic enforcement figures.
 The police have a new headquarters in a converted colonial-era structure with pillared galleries. They have computers, courtesy of the U.N. drug office. Stacks of filing cabinets from a company in Muscatine, Iowa, still in their shrink wrap, were sitting next to the driveway when I arrived. Sixty new recruits were recently trained in Brazil, bringing the total force to about 180; one member of the force told me that they were now being paid about $100 a month -- and, more important, actually receiving their wages. The U.N. drug office had agreed to pay for fuel for the new fleet of cars and motorbikes. Still, the day I visited, the computer terminals, like the filing cabinets, were sitting in plastic covers, and I had the strong impression they hadn't been used. It was 3 in the afternoon on Friday, and most of the squad had knocked off for the weekend. 
 The advent of a seemingly more progressive administration didn't appear to have changed much. Jorge Djata of the drug squad told me that the police often had to ask for fuel, money or a boat before going out on an operation. ''And if we ask, sometimes we have to wait for 48 hours,'' he said. ''In the meantime, the plane has landed and flown away.'' Lucinda Eucarie, the widely respected new director of the Judiciary Police, confirmed that the Ministry of Fisheries often refuses to supply boats, though she diplomatically declined to give a direct answer to my question of whether the ministry was controlled by drug traffickers. Even before the coup, Alexandre Schmidt said he often felt vexed at the Bissau-Guineans. The demands for help and the accompanying sense of dependency seem bottomless. Still, he said that he believed in Madame Lucinda, as she is universally known, and in other senior officials, and he was more hopeful about Guinea-Bissau than about a number of other countries in the region. 
 Of course, that was then. When I reached Schmidt in France in the hours after the soldiers' mutiny, he sounded distraught -- in no small part because of tanks that had surrounded the office of his U.N. colleagues in Bissau. ''The situation is extremely weird,'' he said. ''With the U.N.'s presence in doubt with the return of this new regime, where do we stand with narcotics efforts?'' And President Sanha, whom he had viewed as an ally, has apparently endorsed the coup.
 Everybody wants to help West Africa with its drug problem: the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime and other U.N. bodies, Interpol, the European Union, the West African regional organization known as Ecowas, individual European states and the United States. The United Nations, Interpol and Ecowas are spending $50 million in four countries partly to build ''transnational crime units,'' interagency bodies that will gather information, conduct investigations and turn over their findings to prosecutorial authorities. An agency of Ecowas monitors money laundering throughout the region. A group of European countries deploys ships and narcotics officers to interdict boats carrying drugs from West Africa to Europe. A multitude of U.S. government agencies, coordinated by the new African Command, provide equipment to law-enforcement groups, as well as training for those groups and naval and coastal officers. But those who know the problems best tend to be the least confident. Flemming Quist, the senior law-enforcement adviser at the U.N. drug office in Dakar, says that he feels hopeful about programs like the transnational crime units, but adds, ''We can keep on pumping in training and equipment, but if we don't solve corruption, it's not going to achieve the full affect.'' Can outsiders solve corruption? Quist doesn't think so. 
 Schmidt has an idea about what to do with the Gulfstream jet: Sell it and invest the proceeds in social programs. Converting drug contraband into clinics would send just the right message. Unfortunately, other officials told me that the plane has been sitting in the tropical sun so long that it might have to be sold off in pieces.

HEADLINE: Are We Flying Too High Again?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE stock market continued to defy gravity and expectations in the first quarter, even as important segments of the economy remained tightly tethered to Earth. That, too, defied expectations, but of greater strength, not less.
 The rally that began amid lingering fears of a depression and collapse of the global financial system passed its first birthday last month. By the end of March, it had taken the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up about 75 percent over all, including a gain of 4.9 percent in the first three months of this year. 
 Through much of 2009, investors were expecting the economy to emerge from recession -- but the rebound has been tenuous and spotty, not the surge that typically occurs. The nation's economic output increased at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and is estimated to have risen at about half of that pace in the first quarter of 2010.
 Some investment advisers question how the recovery, or what there is of it, has been achieved -- and they are concerned whether a healthy level of growth can be maintained. And, as they wonder how long the stock market can keep advancing, they're encouraging investors to be increasingly selective and safety-conscious. 
 ''Stock selection is important now,'' said Sarah H. Ketterer, co-manager of the Causeway Global Value fund. ''Whole markets and sectors aren't going to rise. 
 Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment management firm in Newport Beach, Calif., dismissed the stronger data since autumn as a ''sugar rush'' resulting from various stimulus programs, including the Federal Reserve's policy to keep interest rates very low. Growth has been engineered by these actions, he said, and not by companies eager to expand their businesses or consumers with lengthening shopping lists.
 Employment conditions are improving somewhat, but often not as much as forecast. A net 162,000 jobs were created in March, less than the 225,000 or so that had been expected, and many of those jobs were temporary government positions for the census. A measure of private-sector employment compiled by Automatic Data Processing and released in late March showed a decline of 23,000 net jobs for the month, compared with Wall Street expectations of a 40,000-job gain.
 Improvement in the housing market has been harder to detect. Prices, which began to sink in mid-decade, have yet to recover appreciably.
 Sales of previously owned homes spiked briefly last fall as buyers took advantage of a tax credit intended to prop up demand, but they have since fallen back to the lowest volume in a decade. Sales of new homes remain very close to their lowest levels since data began to be compiled in their present form nearly 50 years ago.
 ''There has not been enough of a real foundation under the recovery to give confidence,'' Mr. Arnott said. ''What we have is an economy that's no longer in free fall.''
 The costs of the programs that have broken the fall are high, he added, and the burden of repaying them will be felt for a long time, keeping growth subdued. 
 Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF, also finds little to cheer about in the economic data.
 ''We do have some economic growth, compared to what we had before,'' he said, but he added that the nation also has ''high unemployment that could go even higher, and we're setting records for the length of unemployment.'' He also noted tepid readings in surveys of consumer confidence.
 Investment advisers have been enumerating these same economic shortcomings practically since the rebound in stocks began. Still, the rally has continued, taking fund portfolios up with it.
 The average fund specializing in domestic stocks rose 5.6 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Morningstar. That just about matches the gain in the market once stock dividends are factored in.
 Funds focusing on foreign stocks were up 2.3 percent. The lag is attributable in part to strength in the dollar, which reduces returns of assets denominated in other currencies.
 The deterioration of Greece's public finances, a result of heavy spending even before the recession last year made it fashionable worldwide, also played a big role. As the quarter ended, Greece's solvency and its continued place in the euro zone remained uncertain, as did the ability of other countries in the region to avoid going to the brink or beyond.
 ''There's a domino effect that looms out there,'' Ms. Ketterer said. ''You cut off one diseased limb, but what about others? Speculators are going after Spain, Ireland and Italy.''
 The average fund in Morningstar's database investing in taxable bonds, domestic or foreign, was up 2.6 percent in the quarter. The so-so performance of funds investing primarily in long-term government bonds, which rose 1.2 percent, offset strength in high-yield bond funds, which gained 4.4 percent.
 PATRICK GALLEY, chief investment officer at RiverNorth Capital Management, attributes the continued outperformance of stocks in part to a lack of better ideas. ''Investors have few choices,'' he said. ''Money market funds are yielding nothing, and a lot of investors who bought fixed-income funds are getting concerned about rising rates.''
 One fundamental that seems to be underpinning the stock market is earnings. The S.& P. 500 companies showed a collective earnings gain of 14.9 percent for 2009, and analysts polled by S.& P. expect growth of 69.6 percent for the first quarter, compared with the deeply depressed first quarter of 2009.
 Mr. Arnott, however, isn't impressed. He attributes much of the improvement to companies ''slashing expenditures'' rather than increasing sales.
 Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, acknowledges that this accounts for part of it. Lately, though, he said, signs have emerged of a more robust recovery. ''We're starting to see revenues pick up,'' he said. ''Companies are talking about improved sales.''
 That should keep earnings healthy for a while, Mr. Levkovich said. But he warns that growth is likely to subside as comparisons with past quarters become less favorable and as companies hire back workers.
 ''There will be strong earnings rebounds across industries'' for a while, he predicted. ''You can't do this forever, but you can do it for several quarters, probably for the balance of the year. But how good is this ultimately for 2011?''
 THAT will be on investors' minds more and more as the year continues and they look past the recovery in earnings and wonder about the potential impact of some thorny economic and political matters, he said. He emphasized taxation issues as tax cuts enacted during the Bush administration expire, as well as Federal Reserve interest rate policy and trade relations with China.
 ''As we move toward midyear, it'll get more challenging,'' Mr. Levkovich said of the backdrop for financial markets.
 ''These issues are probably going to be what cause the first break'' in the stock market, he said. ''These intermediate concerns are all very legit. Nobody really knows the answers to those questions, and they make us concerned.''
 He's not alone. Caution is widespread among advisers, who either counsel minimal exposure to stocks, as Mr. Arnott does, or great selectivity.
 Mr. Levkovich likes the areas of industrial equipment, home building, energy and software but not retailing. For Mr. Hammond, who expects a flat market in coming months, ''tech is still not a bad thing.'' He has doubts, though, about the ability of emerging-market stocks to keep rallying.
 The industrials area was the strongest of 11 specialty fund sectors tracked by Morningstar, up 13.4 percent in the quarter. Energy was one of the weakest, down 0.3 percent, and tech had mediocre returns, up 3.1 percent.
 Ms. Ketterer warns that the precarious state of government finances, across the developed world and especially in Europe, could result in ''a pretty unfortunate future of deleveraging and slow growth.''
 She expects ''a very modest uptick in terms of equity returns over the next 24 months.'' In her view, gains of two to three percentage points above those available on Treasury bonds are about all that investors can expect.
 Similar to Mr. Levkovich, she says her favorite sectors include industrial equipment and energy. She also likes such niches as industrial gases and specialty chemicals. 
 Ms. Ketterer envisions such pickiness and circumspection, traits of little use for much of 2009, as becoming more widespread. ''Investors are thinking about stocks instead of just buying them all,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Hunted Become the Hunters as Uganda Enlists Former Rebels to End a War

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
OBO, Central African Republic -- The night is inky, the helicopters are late and Cmdr. Patrick Opiyo Makasi sits near a dying cooking fire on a remote army base, spinning his thoughts into the darkness.
 ''It was either them or me,'' Commander Makasi said of the countless people he has killed. ''Them or me.''
 The Lord's Resistance Army, a notoriously brutal rebel group, snatched him from a riverbank when he was 12 years old, more than 20 years ago, and trained him to burn, pillage and slaughter. His name, Makasi, means scissors in Kiswahili, and fellow soldiers said he earned it by shearing off ears and lips.
 But now he has a new mission: hunting down his former boss. 
 In an unorthodox strategy that could help end this seemingly pointless war, the Ugandan Army is deploying special squads of experienced killers to track down the L.R.A.'s leader, Joseph Kony, one of the most wanted men in Africa, who has been on the run for two decades.
 These soldiers, like Commander Makasi, are former L.R.A. fighters themselves, and just about all of them were abducted as children. They recently surrendered and are now wading through black rivers and head-high elephant grass across three of the most troubled countries in the world -- the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan -- where the last remnants of the L.R.A. are believed to be hiding. They say they know all of Mr. Kony's tricks.
 Some critics may not think this wise, putting so much trust in men whose moral compass had been turned upside down for so long.
 But the Ugandan government is desperate to finish this conflict, which ravaged northern Uganda and killed thousands. The government's policy is to grant amnesty to all L.R.A. fighters except the top three, who have been indicted by the International Criminal Court: Mr. Kony; Okot Odhiambo, his deputy; and Dominic Ongwen, another commander who is widely believed to have planned a massacre in Congo in December in which hundreds of civilians were bludgeoned to death. 
 The American government considers the L.R.A a regional menace and is helping the Ugandans by providing millions of dollars of military support, namely, trucks, fuel and contracted airplanes.
 Some American officials said that they had mixed feelings about the former rebels' being involved, though they said that the decision was the Ugandans' and that in this case, as one American officer put it, ''these guys may be some of the best they got.'' 
 The battlefield statistics seem to bear this out. In the past 18 months, American officials say, the Ugandan Army has killed or captured more than half of Mr. Kony's men, including his finance and communications officers, as well as several other high-ranking commanders.
 ''And let's be realistic,'' added the American officer, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. ''These ex-L.R.A. guys don't have many skills, and it's going to be hard for them to reintegrate.
 ''But one thing they are very good at,'' the officer said, ''is hunting human beings in the woods.''
 The woods around Obo are thick, wet and endless. These are the brown and green jungles camouflage was made for. At night, they swallow what little light emanates from the cooking fires flickering on the Ugandan base. The Ugandans find themselves several hundred miles from home, in a country not even bordering theirs, because Mr. Kony has brought them here. 
 Mr. Kony, a former Catholic altar boy who became possessed by spirits (including one named Who Are You?) and went on to lead a bizarre rebellion with thousands of followers, gravitates to where government is weakest. His movement started in the late 1980s, ostensibly to liberate oppressed Ugandans, when Uganda was just emerging from civil war. As soon as Uganda rallied behind a strong central government, Mr. Kony scurried off to southern Sudan, where the Sudanese government gave him sanctuary.
 When a peace plan in the early 2000s brought some stability to southern Sudan, Mr. Kony moved again, marching his fighters, child brides and military-grade weaponry first to eastern Congo, whose lawlessness has drawn dozens of renegade groups, and then to Central African Republic, a vast, scarcely inhabited country where the government is invisible in many parts and the economy so underdeveloped that one of the country's signature products has become pictures made from insect wings. 
 In the past few months, the L.R.A. has killed dozens of civilians in remote villages and replenished depleted ranks by kidnapping children -- just as it always has. Mr. Kony seems to be circulating between Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan, which is a problem for the Ugandans, because while they have permission from the authorities in Congo, Central African Republic and southern Sudan, they are not allowed to cross into northern Sudan. Recently rescued women who were part of his conscripted harem said that he still had adequate supplies, including a solar-powered television. 
 ''Sometimes he watches movies to cheer himself up,'' said one woman, Alice Auma. ''Rambo's his favorite.'' 
 In a way, certain chapters of this conflict have unfolded like a bad script, since so many times, when Mr. Kony and his band of killers have been surrounded in the bush, facing superior firepower, with the credits about to roll, he escapes.
 But that may be changing. Every day, dozens of squads of Ugandan soldiers, several thousand in total, suit up at dawn with assault rifles and belt-fed machine guns slung over their backs, rubber Wellington boots pulled up to their shins and their bodies powered by a few scalding cups of tea and some banana porridge.
 Commander Makasi, 35, leads one of these squads. The Ugandan officers seem impressed by his professionalism and say that of the several hundred former rebels who have worked for the army, few, if any, have defected. Human rights observers said the Ugandan military had performed admirably in this operation.
 ''I'm really pleased by their behavior,'' said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. ''And they're doing a hell of a hard job.''
 There is the mud and the vines that wrap around legs like bolas and a certain leaf that causes such anguish when brushed against, even through thick clothes, that several Ugandan soldiers had to be airlifted out of the jungle because they dug holes into their flesh by madly scratching themselves. 
 On top of that, the rebels are savvy bush fighters. Mr. Kony is known to sometimes walk backward to leave misleading footprints or to wade through streams, leaving no tracks at all. 
 Eventually, though, seasoned hunters like Commander Makasi find a spit-out piece of sugar cane or a depression in the mud where a fighter might have recently slept. Then they close in. A typical skirmish will be a few shots fired by the retreating L.R.A., and a hail of bullets from the Ugandan side.
 But Commander Makasi said Mr. Kony was not necessarily fleeing. 
 ''I know this man,'' he said. ''He's looking for a place to stay and get strength. He is trying to rebuild.''

HEADLINE: Finding Success on Roads Less Traveled

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
THREE of the top-performing fund managers in the first quarter have made careers out of the unloved and unknown. One seeks out stocks when other investors shun them. Another buys shares in tiny, overlooked companies. And the third searches in two of the world's less-developed markets: Africa and the Middle East.
 A Contrarian's Success 
The first of these managers, Wally R. Weitz, calls himself a contrarian -- he zigs while others zag. He avoided oil stocks during the recent commodities boom and clung to old-fashioned media companies when competitors dumped them. 
 Two of his funds, and , finished among the quarter's better performers. The funds' holdings overlap -- Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment of both in December -- but their strategies diverge. 
 Hickory buys more small and midcap stocks. Partners III holds larger companies and can use debt and short-selling to try to bolster its results. Hickory returned 15.99 percent in the first quarter, while Partners III returned 16 percent. 
 Mr. Weitz didn't have to look far to find Berkshire, since he hails from its Omaha, its home city. Both Mr. Weitz and the Berkshire C.E.O., Warren E. Buffett, are value-oriented investors who seek stocks trading below their estimates of intrinsic worth. That often leads them to companies that have fallen out of favor.
 Both, for example, held shares of the Washington Post Company in December, even as many investors shied away from newspaper stocks. 
 Mr. Weitz departs from Mr. Buffett in liking technology companies. Lately, that affection led him to Google. Dozens of C.E.O.'s from old-fashioned media companies -- broadcast and cable TV, in addition to newspapers -- have told him that Google threatens their livelihood more than anything else, he said. Google isn't a typical value holding, since it lacks a steady dividend or lots of tangible assets, but Mr. Weitz jumped in when the stock slid last year.
 Mr. Weitz isn't fainthearted: if he likes a stock, he'll load up. In December, Hickory owned stakes in only 33 companies and Partners III, 38. That compares with about 186 for the average stock mutual fund.
 He also prefers to sock away cash rather than buying shares whose prices aren't low enough to give him a margin of safety. His funds often have cash troves -- about 20 percent of assets in December, compared with less than 5 percent for the average stock fund. 
 Mice That Roared
 If Mr. Weitz's holdings tend to be well-known names, Michael J. Corbett's investments are anything but. His fund, Perritt Emerging Opportunities, buys the smallest stocks available: the so-called microcaps. Its median holding has a market capitalization of about $40 million, compared with $9.4 billion for the Standard & Poor's 500. 
 An advantage of working in a neglected corner of the market is that few managers and analysts follow the companies. In theory, a lack of competition creates opportunity -- you can more easily find and fell the fattest trees when you're the only lumberjack in the woods. 
 But it doesn't assure positive returns. Tiny companies tend to be riskier than other stocks. As Mr. Corbett likes to say, one lost contract can kill them. Thus, the returns of funds that invest in them skip and skitter more than those of, say, an S.& P. 500 index fund.
 Mr. Corbett's fund is typical in this regard. Last year, it beat the S.& P. by 34 percentage points, but in 2008, it underperformed the index by 22 percentage points. 
 ''The failure rate among smaller companies is high, but the best returns come in the small-company space,'' he said. ''It's just that a lot of investors don't have the patience for it. What people miss is that the fund is a portfolio, so the level of risk is less than what they might think.'' 
 In other words, buying lots of Lilliputians -- Mr. Corbett held 147 in December -- guards against big losses in any one. If he's right more often than he's wrong, his shareholders should make money. Lately, he has been, with the fund returning 13.7 percent in the first quarter.
 Politics and Economics
 Joseph Rohm, manager of , works in a segment of the investing world that sometimes makes Mr. Corbett's microcaps look steady and staid. One of his favorite markets -- Nigeria -- is subject to a United States State Department advisory, telling American travelers to avoid its oil-producing region because of risks of kidnapping and armed attack. Mr. Rohm does business mostly in the country's relatively peaceful capital, Lagos. 
 But when picking some stocks for his fund, he has to consider the possibility of civil unrest as well as the usual commercial and economic ups and downs. No matter how good a company looks, political perils can make it an imprudent investment. Mr. Rohm's fund returned 12.7 percent in the first quarter. 
 Companies in the Middle East comprised about two-thirds of the portfolio in February. The largest holding was Aldar Properties, a real estate developer in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. Despite a big stake in the U.A.E. -- 13 percent of the fund in February -- Mr. Rohm managed to avoid getting burned by the financial crisis last fall in Dubai, the second-largest of the seven emirates. His only holding there is DP World, a worldwide port operator.
 ''We didn't feel comfortable with the level of external debt and lack of transparency'' in Dubai, he said. 
 Most of the fund's African holdings are in South Africa, though Mr. Rohm says he has lately aimed to increase his investments elsewhere on the continent, particularly in Nigeria, which has 150 million people. It's home to one of Mr. Rohm's favorite recent picks: Guaranty Trust Bank. 
 ''I really like the Nigerian banking industry, which is probably the fastest-growing globally in terms of loans,'' he said. ''Guaranty is more of a corporate than a retail bank,'' he added, and its top managers ''understand running a multinational.''

HEADLINE: The Rhythm Of the City, Unmuffled

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
While many city neighborhoods have been turned into sanitized and silenced versions of themselves, East Harlem is boisterous and pulses with energy. Strains of Latin music waft from car windows, elevated trains screech from above and wind chimes clink in community gardens. Street art is everywhere: on the sides of buildings, on trash in abandoned lots, among transformed town houses and around new restaurants. Here are ways to navigate its chaos and ebullience.
 1 P.M. Take the No. 6 train to East 103rd Street, East Harlem's pulsing center, and head to El Paso Restaurante Mexicano, 1643 Lexington Avenue, (212) 831-9831. The restaurant is crowded with young families munching on tacos, twentysomethings gossiping over salads and regulars staking out corner tables. Try the ensalada de pollo ($9) and cheese huaraches ($4) for a hearty lunch. 
 2 P.M. Stroll to Metropolis Studios, 105 East 106th Street, (212) 722-5500. The 11-story building may not impress from the outside, but, according to Philip Mancino, a part-owner, it is where NBC resided when it converted its Rockefeller Center studios from radio to television. Don't be surprised if you spot celebrities nearby. When Mr. Mancino bought the building in 1981, Michael Caine was filming ''Deathtrap'' there; one of his favorite memories, Mr. Mancino said, was when Ringo Starr disappeared from a shoot to go toy shopping on Third Avenue. More recently, Emeril Lagasse filmed his cooking show there. The Museum of the City of New York is running a tour on June 11 from 2 to 4 p.m. Call (917) 492-3395 for reservations.
 2:30 P.M. Walk beneath the train tracks to the northwest corner of Park Avenue and 106th Street to the Graffiti Hall of Fame, a set of murals that run along Park Avenue and on the interior walls of the new $1.7 million playground at the Jackie Robinson Educational Complex. (During the week, the playground is closed to the public.) The hall is run by graffiti artists, and the latest murals include works by Tats Cru and TDS Cru and feature candy-colored inspirational words like ''excellence,'' a fierce-looking bee and a dedication to Michael Jackson.
 3 P.M. Walk west to the Raices Latin Music Museum, 1 East 104th Street, (212) 427-2244, which shares its building with El Museo del Barrio. Raices is little more than a bright yellow hallway flanked by rehearsal rooms that thunder with music, but it is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, and it features a rich exhibit on the roots of Latin music in New York City. Exhibit highlights include a rainbow-sleeved rumba shirt worn by Sunny Bravo, and Tito Puente's purple- and blue-beaded shekere, a gourd instrument.
 4 P.M. Spruce up your wardrobe at Goliath, 175 East 105th Street, (212) 360-7683. Specializing in hard-to-find brands and limited-edition clothing like Yote City T-shirts and crew necks, this street-clothes boutique attracts foreign tourists. (Rosemary Frazier, the owner, says she is ''big in Japan.'') It also draws local residents who linger at the wooden bar left over from Mr. D's, the tavern that formerly occupied the space. Recent best sellers include Goliath T-shirts inspired by Absolut vodka and other liquor brands ($20 to $35), and a Nike Air Force 1 shoe in honor of Black History Month ($135). Be warned: Ms. Frazier said 95 percent of her merchandise is for men, because demand for women's street wear has shrunk with the recession.
 5 P.M. Refuel at Yo In Yo Out, a year-old French restaurant at 1569 Lexington Avenue, (212) 987-5350. Yoanne al-Hassani Magris -- Chef Yo -- has worked at the Russian Tea Room, among other places, and she concentrates on main courses while her sister, Jade al-Hassani, a trained pastry chef, prepares croissants and desserts. The restaurant is heavy on family recipes. The flavorful shot-glass-size tiramisu and panna cotta ($1.25 each) are based on their Greek grandmother's recipe.

HEADLINE: No Regulation? No Insurance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Trying to Tame the Unknowable'' (Economic View, March 28), in which N. Gregory Mankiw said that Americans should acknowledge the limitations of financial regulation: 
 Let's see. The American people have shelled out billions to bail out banks and have lost jobs, homes, equity, savings and security. Perhaps Congress should go along with the industry's request and say: ''Sure, no regulation -- sell and disclose what you want, hedge what you want. But as regulation goes so shall the government backing.'' How much faith would investors place in banks, for example, without the F.D.I.C.?
 It's simple: If you want government backing, play by the rules. Take them or leave them. Oh, by the way, we're raising the interest rate on your bailout to 36 percent.

HEADLINE: In a Tough Economy, Old Limits on Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Kimberly E. Kaplan recently received a notice telling her that she and her three children were about to lose their monthly welfare benefit of $584 because they had reached the time limit on cash assistance and she had not made adequate efforts to find work.
 Ms. Kaplan, 43, is required to work 20 hours a week, but is seeking a hardship exemption. Her 4-year-old son, Landon, has psychological and behavioral problems, and she said that ''it's a full-time job to take care of him.''
 Rhode Island has the nation's third-highest unemployment rate, but the welfare rolls here continue to decline because of the time limits and stringent work requirements. 
 Since the start of the recession in December 2007, the number of Americans receiving benefits under the main federal-state welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, has increased less than 10 percent, even though unemployment has nearly doubled and the number of people receiving food stamps has grown more than 40 percent, to 39 million.
 Congress overhauled the welfare law in 1996 to emphasize work, and in a booming economy the changes were widely considered a great success. 
 But the latest trends are prompting federal officials to ask whether welfare is fulfilling its mission in tough economic times. Congress and the Obama administration are considering changes as the program comes up for renewal this year.
 ''TANF seems far less responsive to the growing need than other safety net programs, such as food stamps or unemployment insurance,'' said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security. 
 Carmen R. Nazario, the assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of welfare policy, said, ''Some states with some of the worst economic conditions are not seeing significant caseload increases.''
 Indeed, in a recent report, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said, ''We found no clear association between the change in the number of families receiving cash assistance in a state and its unemployment rate.''
 Ronald T. Haskins, who helped write the 1996 law as an aide to House Republicans, said, ''There's definitely a problem.'' 
 ''Many states have been too slow to take destitute families back on the rolls,'' Mr. Haskins said. ''In 1996, both Republicans and Democrats assumed that welfare rolls would rise during a recession as jobs got harder to find.''
 Rhode Island changed its welfare program in 2008. Under the new program, known as Rhode Island Works, people can receive cash assistance for no more than 24 months in any 60-month period, with a lifetime maximum of 48 months of benefits. The lifetime limit had been 60 months.
 Benefits go mostly to families headed by women. For Coralis I. Concepcion and her three boys in Woonsocket, R.I., cash assistance ended on Jan. 31. 
 They lost a monthly benefit of $584, and the impact, she said, has been drastic. ''If we go out locally, we usually walk instead of using the car,'' she said. Ms. Concepcion, 23, began receiving cash assistance four years ago, when her first son was born, and she said she had filed more than 200 job applications in the last year.
 ''It's very difficult to find any job,'' Ms. Concepcion said. ''I am competing against people with bachelor's and master's degrees. I went to high school through the 10th grade.''
 Cash assistance is also running out for Meagan L. Fontaine, 24, and her 5-year-old girl and 2-year-old boy. She has a temporary subsidized job as an administrative assistant at Project Hope, a social service organization run by Catholic Charities in Pawtucket, R.I.
 ''It's horrible,'' Ms. Fontaine said. ''I apply for 45 jobs in a week. You don't get calls back, or you get an interview but no job. Employers are so picky. They can pick anyone they want in these hard times.''
 Workers in the Head Start program see the effects of the new welfare rules in several ways. 
 Many children eligible for Head Start are from families receiving cash assistance. But Dee L. Henry, who has worked at the Woonsocket Head Start program for 35 years, said, ''For the first time, we are seeing significant numbers of families who report no income whatsoever, zero, because they have reached the time limit on cash assistance or have been sanctioned for not meeting work requirements.''
 Besides teaching the children, Head Start workers visit the families at home at least three times a year. And sometimes they observe ominous signs of domestic violence.
 Jody A. Ragosta, a Head Start worker in Woonsocket, said: ''I see moms who have been cut off cash assistance and can't find work. In some cases, they return to the father or another man who was abusive, in the hope that he can provide financially for the kids.''
 As Congress turns its attention to the temporary assistance program, Republicans suspect that Democrats want to dismantle parts of the 1996 law and expand welfare once again. Democrats say they want to preserve the emphasis on work, but reward states for lifting families out of poverty, not just reducing the welfare rolls.
 The 1996 law changed the culture of cash assistance. The number of people on welfare fell more than expected, the employment of single mothers increased and child poverty declined. 
 But those trends have not been sustained. Child poverty has increased. Since 1996, the proportion of poor children receiving assistance has declined by more than half. Fewer than half of eligible families participate in the program. 
 Rhode Island officials said the state had been less than aggressive in carrying out the 1996 welfare law. They allowed welfare recipients to attend education and training programs for years while other states emphasized work above all other activities.
 When Rhode Island began to overhaul its welfare program in 2008, the state unemployment rate was about 7 percent and state officials believed that jobs would be readily available to welfare recipients even if the rate climbed to 9 percent. They never expected the rate to soar to its current level of 12.7 percent.
 Given the high jobless rate, Donalda M. Carlson, associate director of the Rhode Island Department of Human Services, said: ''I thought the applications for temporary assistance and the rolls would grow. To our surprise, it has not happened.''
 Ms. Kaplan was granted a three-month extension of cash benefits late last year so she could care for her son. But the Department of Human Services said she did not use the time for the designated purpose, ''to transition off cash assistance'' and become self-sufficient.
 She says that if she goes back to work, her son will lose home-based therapeutic services that help him develop social skills and deal with his anger.
 A similar deadline is looming for Amanda R. Choiniere, 22, and her 17-month-old daughter. Ms. Choiniere said she had graduated from high school with a certificate as a nursing assistant and had training as a pharmacy technician but could not find a job. 
 She is learning to be a bookkeeping and accounting clerk in a vocational education program at Rhode Island College. She has no idea how she and her daughter will get by when their cash assistance runs out in June.
 ''I'll be stuck,'' Ms. Choiniere said.

HEADLINE: Lech Kaczynski, 60, a President Close to the U.S. and Suspicious of Russia

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY and DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Lech Kaczynski, who died Saturday in a plane crash in western Russia, rose from childhood fame as an actor to become president of Poland. He was 60. 
 Half of an unusual tandem of power, Mr. Kaczynski was elected president in 2005 from the nationalist-conservative Law and Justice Party, led by his identical twin, Jaroslaw, whom he later appointed prime minister. 
 Swept into office as voters repudiated the group of former Communist officials who had dominated the country's politics for much of the preceding decade, Mr. Kaczynski and his brother struggled at the top. They frequently put Poland on a collision course with its European Union partners and Russia, while polarizing voters at home with a shift to the right. 
 ''His approach is to first destroy and then think about what to build,'' Lech Walesa, hero of the Solidarity movement and former president, said in 2006 of Lech Kaczynski, who once served as Mr. Walesa's national security chief.
 Poland joined the European Union in 2004, but Mr. Kaczynski often preferred dealing with the United States. 
 As soon as Mr. Kaczynski took office in the presidential headquarters in the center of Warsaw, he forged close relations with Ukraine and Georgia, determined to bring them closer to NATO and eventually have them admitted to the American-led military organization. 
 His defense of those two countries often upset leading members of the European Union, especially Germany, which was concerned that an expanded NATO would make Russia feel threatened and lead to new East-West tensions. Mr. Kaczynski, however, believed passionately that a strong NATO would prevent Russia from reasserting its influence over Eastern and Central Europe.
 Mr. Kaczynski was born on June 18, 1949, when Warsaw was in ruins. His suspicions of Russia and Germany had deep roots. His father, Rajmund, an engineer, and his mother, Jadwiga, who studied linguistics, had been active in the Polish resistance against the Nazis.
 He and his brother -- who could be told apart only by a mole on Lech's left cheek -- became famous at age 12 when they starred in a film version of ''The Two Who Stole the Moon,'' a beloved children's story. They began their rise to political prominence in the underground Solidarity movement in the 1980s.
 They were close, at first, to Mr. Walesa, but they fell out with his movement during the 1990s, claiming that the intellectuals, led by Adam Michnik, had made too many compromises with former Communists and the secret police. The brothers remained active in politics, with Lech Kaczynski serving as justice minister from 2000 to 2001 and gaining popularity by emphasizing his tough stance against crime. 
 He became mayor of Warsaw in 2002, and critics began to see his brand of nationalism -- he and his brother wanted a complete break with the past by purging the civil service and the media of former Communists -- as overzealous and provincial. But the twins were helped in their rise to power by an image of honesty in a country that had witnessed one corruption scandal after another for years. 
 Yet he was not reluctant to create tensions with Moscow or Berlin. Poland joined NATO in 1999, part of the first bloc of former Communist countries, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, to join the alliance.
 ''It was obvious to us that this was the only tough security structure there was in the world, and that the membership of NATO would only mean benefits for Poland,'' Mr. Kaczynski said in an interview last year. 
 He added that did not mean that Russia's leaders had ''abandoned their ideas to regain influence, like using natural resources, natural gas, as a weapon and trying to influence politicians.'' 
 ''Indeed,'' he said, ''back in the early 1990s, my impression was that Poland's entry into NATO would finally resolve those questions. And here I must admit I was wrong.''
 He lobbied hard for the United States to deploy part of its controversial shield against ballistic missiles in Poland, arguing that it would enhance Poland's security against Russia. Those plans, supported by President George W. Bush, were scaled back by President Obama. 
 A devout Roman Catholic, Mr. Kaczynski was regarded as skeptical of the European Union while he fought to defend Poland's sovereignty against Brussels and to protect its traditional, conservative values. In 2008, he argued against ratifying the union's Lisbon Treaty for fear its prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation would become Polish law. 
 Mr. Kaczynski's star had been fading in recent years, and he would have faced a difficult re-election battle this year. 
 His wife, Maria, an economist, also died in the crash. Mr. Kaczynski is survived by his brother, Jaroslaw, who was forced to step down as prime minister in 2007 after a bruising party defeat at the polls. He is also survived by his daughter, Marta; two granddaughters, Ewa and Martyna; and his mother.

HEADLINE: Americans Face Tighter Credit

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Even as prospects for the American economy brighten, consumers are about to face a new financial burden: a sustained period of rising interest rates.
 That, economists say, is the inevitable outcome of the nation's ballooning debt and the renewed prospect of inflation as the economy recovers from the depths of the recent recession. 
 The shift is sure to come as a shock to consumers whose spending habits were shaped by a historic 30-year decline in the cost of borrowing.
 ''Americans have assumed the roller coaster goes one way,'' said Bill Gross, whose investment firm, Pimco, has taken part in a broad sell-off of government debt, which has pushed up interest rates. ''It's been a great thrill as rates descended, but now we face an extended climb.'' 
 The impact of higher rates is likely to be felt first in the housing market, which has only recently begun to rebound from a deep slump. The rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has risen half a point since December, hitting 5.31 last week, the highest level since last summer. 
 Along with the sell-off in bonds, the Federal Reserve has halted its emergency $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage debt, placing even more upward pressure on rates.
 ''Mortgage rates are unlikely to go lower than they are now, and if they go higher, we're likely to see a reversal of the gains in the housing market,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School. ''It's a really big risk.''
 Each increase of 1 percentage point in rates adds as much as 19 percent to the total cost of a home, according to Mr. Mayer. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the rise to continue, with the 30-year mortgage rate going to 5.5 percent by late summer and as high as 6 percent by the end of the year. 
 Another area in which higher rates are likely to affect consumers is credit card use. And last week, the Federal Reserve reported that the average interest rate on credit cards reached 14.26 percent in February, the highest since 2001. That is up from 12.03 percent when rates bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2008 -- a jump that amounts to about $200 a year in additional interest payments for the typical American household.
 With losses from credit card defaults rising and with capital to back credit cards harder to come by, issuers are likely to increase rates to 16 or 17 percent by the fall, according to Dennis Moroney, a research director at the TowerGroup, a financial research company. 
 ''The banks don't have a lot of pricing options,'' Mr. Moroney said. ''They're targeting people who carry a balance from month to month.''
 Similarly, many car loans have already become significantly more expensive, with rates at auto finance companies rising to 4.72 percent in February from 3.26 percent in December, according to the Federal Reserve.
 Washington, too, is expecting to have to pay more to borrow the money it needs for programs. The Office of Management and Budget expects the rate on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury note to remain close to 3.9 percent for the rest of the year, but then rise to 4.5 percent in 2011 and 5 percent in 2012.
 The run-up in rates is quickening as investors steer more of their money away from bonds and as Washington unplugs the economic life support programs that kept rates low through the financial crisis. Mortgage rates and car loans are linked to the yield on long-term bonds.
 Besides the inflation fears set off by the strengthening economy, Mr. Gross said he was also wary of Treasury bonds because he feared the burgeoning supply of new debt issued to finance the government's huge budget deficits would overwhelm demand, driving interest rates higher.
 Nine months ago, United States government debt accounted for half of the assets in Mr. Gross's flagship fund, Pimco Total Return. That has shrunk to 30 percent now -- the lowest ever in the fund's 23-year history -- as Mr. Gross has sold American bonds in favor of debt from Europe, particularly Germany, as well as from developing countries like Brazil.
 Last week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly crossed the psychologically important threshold of 4 percent, as the Treasury auctioned off $82 billion in new debt. That is nearly twice as much as the government paid in the fall of 2008, when investors sought out ultrasafe assets like Treasury securities after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of the credit crisis.
 Though still very low by historical standards, the rise of bond yields since then is reversing a decline that began in 1981, when 10-year note yields reached nearly 16 percent.
 From that peak, steadily dropping interest rates have fed a three-decade lending boom, during which American consumers borrowed more and more but managed to hold down the portion of their income devoted to paying off loans. 
 Indeed, total household debt is now nine times what it was in 1981 -- rising twice as fast as disposable income over the same period -- yet the portion of disposable income that goes toward covering that debt has budged only slightly, increasing to 12.6 percent from 10.7 percent.
 Household debt has been dropping for the last two years as recession-battered consumers cut back on borrowing, but at $13.5 trillion, it still exceeds disposable income by $2.5 trillion.
 The long decline in rates also helped prop up the stock market; lower rates for investments like bonds make stocks more attractive.
 That tailwind, which prevented even worse economic pain during the recession, has ceased, according to interviews with economists, analysts and money managers. 
 ''We've had almost a 30-year rally,'' said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. ''That's come to an end.'' 
 Just as significant as the bottom-line impact will be the psychological fallout from not being able to buy more while paying less -- an unusual state of affairs that made consumer spending the most important measure of economic health.
 ''We've gotten spoiled by the idea that interest rates will stay in the low single-digits forever,'' said Jim Caron, an interest rate strategist with Morgan Stanley. ''We've also had a generation of consumers and investors get used to low rates.''
 For young home buyers today considering 30-year mortgages with a rate of just over 5 percent, it might be hard to conceive of a time like October 1981, when mortgage rates peaked at 18.2 percent. That meant monthly payments of $1,523 then compared with $556 now for a $100,000 loan.
 No one expects rates to return to anything resembling 1981 levels. Still, for much of Wall Street, the question is not whether rates will go up, but rather by how much. 
 Some firms, like Morgan Stanley, are predicting that rates could rise by a percentage point and a half by the end of the year. Others, like JPMorgan Chase are forecasting a more modest half-point jump. 
 But the consensus is clear, according to Terrence M. Belton, global head of fixed-income strategy for J. P. Morgan Securities. ''Everyone knows that rates will eventually go higher,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Basketball Grad School for 3 Ivy League Stars

BYLINE: By ADAM HIMMELSBACH

 BODY:
PORTSMOUTH, Va. -- One month after finishing an exceptional basketball career at Harvard, Jeremy Lin was playing for a team sponsored by a water sealant company.
 This is a part of the N.B.A. dream most people do not see, a part without mascots or cheerleaders or pep bands. At the Portsmouth Invitational, a predraft camp for 64 of the nation's top college seniors, no one is defined by team colors. That is good for Lin, whose Ivy League roots could otherwise leave him overlooked among players from North Carolina, Michigan State and Connecticut.
 As Lin drove the baseline and made a difficult layup in his first game Wednesday night, the public-address announcer recited his name and university to the pro scouts, agents and fans in the high school gym. He accentuated the word Harvard, perhaps to draw attention to the unusual.
 In five of the last eight years, no Ivy League players attended this four-day, invitation-only showcase. But this year there are three -- Lin, and Cornell's Ryan Wittman and Jeff Foote -- giving their conference as many representatives as the Big East. 
 ''I can't remember a time that we've had three Ivy guys at the same time,'' said Marty Blake, the N.B.A.'s director of scouting. ''We'd get one or two from Penn or Princeton, but not much beyond that.''
 Portsmouth is not a camp for first-round draft picks. It is a camp for those on the fringe. Six of the 64 players from last year's camp were drafted, all in the second round.
 But for players from the Ivy League, where there are no athletic scholarships and little national television exposure, the camp is a rare opportunity. No Ivy League player has been drafted since Jerome Allenof Pennsylvania was selected 49th over all by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 1995.
 Lin, Wittman and Foote are long shots to be drafted this year, but all are considered pro prospects. Their presence at this camp -- combined with Cornell's run to the Round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament, the first Ivy team to advance that far since 1979 -- has signified a shift in the perception of Ivy League basketball.
 ''Obviously, in the last couple of years, the caliber of Ivy League players has changed,'' said the Washington Wizards assistant Randy Wittman, a former first-round draft pick who also happens to be Ryan Wittman's father. ''These guys wouldn't have been invited to the camp unless they were looked at as players who can reach the N.B.A.''
 The former Senator Bill Bradley, who starred at Princeton before his Hall of Fame career with the Knicks began in 1967, remains the most well-known Ivy-to-N.B.A. (with a detour to Oxford) success story.
 But the flag bearer of the modern era is probably center Chris Dudley, who graduated from Yale in 1987. He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers and had a 16-year career.
 ''You have a hurdle to overcome,'' Dudley, who is running for governor of Oregon, said in a telephone interview. ''You have to prove you belong. There's a perception that you're a team player, but not as athletic and maybe not as capable of carrying it over to the next level.''
 In 1990, Walter Palmer, who went to Dartmouth, was chosen by the Utah Jazz with the 33rd overall pick, but he played just 48 career games. Allen, who is now Penn's coach, averaged 2.9 points a game over two N.B.A. seasons. The former Penn guard Matt Maloney played for six seasons after signing with Houston as an undrafted free agent in 1996.
 ''There are very few guys from the Ivy League that have made it, and it's because of the power conferences,'' the Orlando Magic assistant general manager Dave Twardzik said. ''The Ivy League players are at a disadvantage in terms of television exposure. But these days, scouting is so sophisticated that if you're good enough, you'll get a look.''
 Lin, Wittman and Foote have skills that would translate well to the N.B.A., but they are also followed by questions about their strength and athleticism.
 The 6-foot-3 Lin, who was a first-team all-Ivy League guard for the Crimson the last two years, is a skillful passer and he attacks the rim well. He said he did not consider the N.B.A. a realistic dream until recently. Over his first two games at the Portsmouth Invitational, he averaged 9 points and 5.5 assists.
 ''I guess I have to prove to myself whether I have a shot or not,'' Lin said. ''Right now I'm just trying to take this all in and not put too much pressure on myself.''
 Wittman, a 6-7 shooting guard, and Foote, a 7-foot center, came to the tournament with a bit more recognition, because of the Big Red's N.C.A.A. tournament run, which ended with a loss to top-seeded Kentucky in a regional semifinal.
 Wittman, the Ivy League's player of the year, scored 17.5 points a game for Cornell. He is an excellent shooter with the size that professional teams covet.
 Foote is the most raw of the three, but as the two-time Ivy League defensive player of the year, he may have the most potential. He made 11 of 13 field-goal attempts and averaged 11 points and 6.5 rebounds in his first two games here, and has good footwork for a player of his height. 
 ''There's a stigma that we're just smart guys who can't play,'' Foote said, ''but I definitely feel like we're turning that around.''
 Ryan Blake, the N.B.A.'s assistant director of scouting, said Wittman or Lin could become the first Ivy League player to be drafted in 15 years.
 ''But it's not just about the second round, it's about opportunity,'' Blake said. ''If they don't get picked, both of them are going to have their numbers dialed by N.B.A. teams immediately. From there, you just see what happens.''
 Of course, if professional basketball options eventually turn fleeting, all three players will have Ivy League degrees. Wittman and Foote are applied economics and management majors, and Lin is majoring in economics. But Foote said that if he entered the white-collar world, he would feel like many soon-to-be college graduates.
 ''I have no idea what I'd want to do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Where a Cellphone Is Still Cutting Edge

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
What if, globally speaking, the iPad is not the next big thing? What if the next big thing is small, cheap and not American?
 America went into a frenzy last weekend with the iPad's release. But even as hundreds of thousands here unwrap their iPads, another future entirely may be unfolding overseas on the cellphone.
 Forgotten in the American tumult is a global flowering of innovation on the simple cellphone. From Brazil to India to South Korea and even Afghanistan, people are seeking work via text message; borrowing, lending, and receiving salaries on cellphones; employing their phones as flashlights, televisions and radios. 
 And many do all this for peanuts. In India, Reliance Communications sells handsets for less than $25, with one-cent-a-minute phone calls across India and one-cent text messages and no monthly charge -- while earning fat profits. Compare that to iPad buyers in the United States, who pay $499 for the basic version, who might also have a $1,000-plus computer and a $100-plus smart cellphone, and who could pay $100 or more each month to connect these many devices to the ether.
 Not for the first time, America and much of the world are moving in different ways. America's innovators, building for an ever-expanding bandwidth network, are spiraling toward fancier, costlier, more network-hungry and status-giving devices; meanwhile, their counterparts in developing nations are innovating to find ever more uses for cheap, basic cellphones.
 America does not share the world's romance with the cellphone. Since returning last year from India, I have been struck by how often calls drop here and surprised that text-messaging, so vital to Indians, has yet to entrench itself in America, where so much messaging travels on the Internet.
 A recent report by the World Economic Forum and Insead, the French business school, concluded that Americans rank below 71 other nations in their level of cellphone penetration, even though they lead in other areas of connectivity. Some Americans are not connected at all. Millions of others are beyond the phone, so to speak: though they own one and use it, they also own other devices, and the phone is not be-all-end-all.
 But it is from Kenya to Colombia to South Africa -- the kind of places that have built cellphone towers precisely to leapfrog past the expense of building wired networks, which have linked Americans for a century. In such places, cellphones are becoming the truly universal technology. The number of mobile subscriptions in the world is expected to pass five billion this year, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a trade group. That would mean more human beings today have access to a cellphone than the United Nations says have access to a clean toilet.
 And because it reaches so many people, because it is always with you, because it is cheap and sharable and easily repaired, the cellphone has opened a new frontier of global innovation.
 Babajob, in Bangalore, India, and Souktel, in the Palestinian territories, offer job-hunting services via text message. Souktel allows users without Internet or fancy phones to register by texting information about themselves. A user who then texts in ''match me'' will receive a listing of jobs suitable to her, including phone numbers to dial.
 In Africa, the cellphone is giving birth to a new paradigm in money. Plastic cards have become the reigning instruments of payment in the West, but projects like PesaPal and M-Pesa in Kenya are working to make the cellphone the hub of personal finance. M-Pesa lets you convert cash into cellphone money at your local grocer, and this money can instantly be wired to anyone with a phone.
 These efforts arise from a shortage of bank accounts in Africa. But they create the possibility of peer-to-peer finance that could be useful even in wealthy countries -- for example, allowing small businesses in rural areas to collect money without credit-card systems.
 I called Western Union, the Colorado-based money-transfer service, to ask if I could send money to a mobile phone. ''Basically, we do not have that kind of option right now,'' the agent told me. An American company, Obopay, does offer phone-to-phone payments. Its founder, Carol Realini, got the idea when volunteering in Africa.
 The phone has also moved to the center of community life in many places. In Africa, urban churches record sermons with cellphones, then transmit them to villages to be replayed. In Iran and Moldova, phones helped to organize popular uprisings against authoritarian governments. In India, the cellphone is used in citizen election monitoring, and in equipping voters, via text message, with information on candidates' incomes and criminal backgrounds.
 Recognizing the role of cellphones in developing nations, the White House last year made a point of releasing President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, in Cairo, in 13 languages over text message. It has made no similarly publicized gesture in the United States, even though not everyone has Internet access. (The administration proposes to remedy that by widening broadband access.)
 All of which suggests the presence of an innovation gap between the world's richest societies and the poorest -- not in device design so much as in usage. And there is a question about whether the United States, which gained so much from the Internet revolution, will similarly profit from the entry of billions more people from the developing world into a massive worldwide middle class -- consumers now but not yet rich, with a simple cellphone and a less-is-more sensibility.
 Certainly, America's innovative new devices may find important roles at home -- perhaps in distributing news and books and entertainment, which have struggled to adapt to the digital age. That alone could make their invention revolutionary.
 But is desire replacing need as the mother of American inventions? Will domestic demand for ever sleeker, faster, fancier devices make it harder for Americans to innovate for the vaster, less opulent world outside, still dominated by frugal wants? Perhaps.
 Ken Banks, a British entrepreneur who works in Africa and developed FrontlineSMS, a text-messaging service for aid groups, put it this way: ''There's often a tendency in the West to approach things the wrong way round, so we end up with solutions looking for a problem, or we build things just because we can.''
 Well, yes. Then again, the mobile phone itself began that way. In 1987, when Michael Douglas famously carried one in ''Wall Street,''it was an exorbitant gadget for high rollers. Now it's more common than a toilet.

HEADLINE: Heading Off the Next Financial Crisis

 BODY:
David Leonhardt's suggestions for reregulating the banks and shadow banks are commendable. However, I would like to express a word of caution based on a concern that the problems that led to the economic meltdown have been only partly addressed. What about some workable suggestions for cleaning up the detritus in the form of the hundreds of billions of dollars in toxic assets that remain on the balance sheets of the 19 stress-tested bank holding companies, which could cause inestimable economic damage in the event of a double-dip recession? MORLEY GORSKY Toronto 
 Referring to the fact that regulators often overlook signs of excess risk taking, Leonhardt makes the point that ''in a way, this issue is more about human nature than about politics.'' Overlooked in his discussion, however, are differences in human nature between the sexes. Since the crisis hit in September 2008, there has been wide notice taken of the fact that those responsible were, with no notable exceptions, men. The role of testosterone-driven risk taking for status and power is perhaps the major cause of these devastating crises.
 Among the long-term solutions that ought to be considered is requiring gender balance on regulatory boards, including all Federal Reserve boards. Illinois and Iowa have enacted Gender Balanced Appointments Acts; why can't similar laws be enacted on the federal level? Congress could also go a step further, following the lead of Norway and Spain, and require gender-balanced membership on corporate boards. Finally, Leonhardt mentioned that Canada has avoided much of the crisis's aftershocks and has a female chief financial regulator. It is also worth noting that no woman has ever been appointed to U.S. Treasury secretary or chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. MARC BEALLOR Brooklyn

HEADLINE: When Half a V-8 Is Enough

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
SCARSDALE, N.Y. 
 JACKIE SARIL'S nickname is Marisa Tomei, not that the two look much alike. For starters, Ms. Saril, who co-owns a public relations firm, has red hair. But her broad knowledge of vintage American cars reminds her friends of Mona Lisa Vito, Ms. Tomei's caricature of a fast-talking, gum-chewing, surprisingly car-smart New Yorker in the 1992 film ''My Cousin Vinny.''
''My grandfather babysat me,'' Ms. Saril recalled one recent rainy afternoon at Chat American Grill, a stylish restaurant here, about a half-hour north of Manhattan. ''I was 5 years old, and he lived down the street from me in Brooklyn.'' 
 The two would sit in folding chairs in front of his house -- ''typical Brooklyn,'' she says -- and he would identify the cars that drove past. ''That's a Buick, that's an Oldsmobile, that's a Chevy,'' she recalled her grandfather saying. ''By the time I was 6, I was making lists of cars. That was my fun.'' 
 Ms. Saril says she has always wanted to buy a classic car. When her grandfather died, she considered his 1967 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight, even if it was not exactly a classic. But she was always too busy with her career or her family to entertain the idea seriously. 
 Then, as her 40th birthday approached, she made a lowball bid on eBay for a blue-and-white 1961 Pontiac Tempest Custom Coupe. She won it for $3,500. 
 ''My husband said I could buy a car for myself,'' she said. ''Then he went away on business. Three days later, I bought this. He said, 'Already?'''
 Ms. Saril arrived at the restaurant dressed in various shades of blue, perhaps in tribute to her car: blue jeans, a cobalt shawl-collar sweater and royal-blue suede boots. 
 She was clutching a two-inch plastic accordion organizer filled with Tempest ephemera. ''It's not enough to have the car,'' she said. ''You've got to have the stuff.''
 The stuff included a copy of a Pontiac news release that announced the debut of the Tempest two-door at the International Auto Show in New York in 1961. 
 She pulled out a copy of the original order form for her car, which had been bought at a dealership in San Francisco. She quickly decoded the vehicle identification number and ran down the options list on the order form. 
 ''Didn't go for the air-conditioner,'' she said. ''Interesting. No power steering, no power brakes.'' 
 Next, she pulled out a back issue of Motor Trend (in a clear plastic sleeve) that named the Tempest the magazine's Car of the Year for 1961. She had an original sales brochure and a Pontiac color chip chart to show how the Tempest looked from the factory (in Tradewind blue) and the color it had been repainted (a two-tone of Bristol blue and white).
 Ms. Saril said some of her archive was found through the Pontiac-Oakland Club International. Other memorabilia, like a 1978 issue of Special Interest Autos that featured a tribute to the Tempest, were found in eBay searches.
 To some, the Tempest moniker conjures images of the powerful GTO, which was based on later models of the Tempest. But the original 1961 model emerged from more practical needs.
 ''It was General Motors' response to the Beetle,'' Ms. Saril said, telling a sadly familiar tale of a foreign automaker selling compact cars in America while Detroit, accustomed to building large gas-guzzling vehicles, struggled to catch up.
 ''In 1960, Volkswagen was having an impact on sales with its Beetle,'' Ms. Saril said. ''Detroit had huge cars with huge tailfins. Volkswagen took advantage of that. The guys at General Motors looked at what was going on and realized they needed a car to compete with the Beetle.''
 G.M. first came up with the Corvair, which shared the Beetle's rear-engine layout. The Corvair was an immediate success, and the other G.M. divisions came up with their own versions of the small economy car, said Greg Walters, director of Little Indians, a chapter of the Pontiac-Oakland club for 1961-63 Tempest and LeMans models. 
 He was referring to G.M.'s Y-Body cars, which included the Buick Special and Oldsmobile F-85. Mr. Walters said in an e-mail message that Pontiac had a radical idea -- to use the same production line that built its V-8 to also make a new economy 4-cylinder in the same machining operation by simply using half of the 389-cubic-inch V-8. And thus, the slant-4 engine was born. 
 But the slant-4 wasn't the only mechanical oddity in the early Tempest. ''They then tried an even more radical idea of using a rear-mounted modified Corvair transaxle coupled to an amazing torque shaft that is bent in a three-inch downward bow inside a tunnel that couples the entire drivetrain into one unit,'' Mr. Walters said. ''The bow was needed to pre-load it to eliminate vibrations.'' 
 There were two benefits to the invention, which has since come to be known by the less than affectionate nickname of ''rope drive.'' 
 The first benefit was a balanced distribution of weight over the front and rear wheels, improving the handling. Second, according to Mr. Walters, the rope drive ''allowed a nearly flat floor like the Corvair and VW had.'' The other G.M. divisions opted for a conventional driveshaft tunnel, with a hump in the floor and a more conventional drivetrain.
 For Ms. Saril, the slant-4 and rope-drive fit the bill. ''I knew I was looking for something quirky,'' she said. 
 After lunch, Ms. Saril drove to see her mechanic, Joe Cermele, at Sal's Auto Service in Scarsdale, where her 1983 Mercedes-Benz 380SL was being checked for an engine idling problem. ''After I bought the Tempest, I got the Mercedes,'' she said, explaining that she had a temporary infatuation with buying vintage cars that ended with the Mercedes. 
 ''They just put a new idle relay in because the car was racing,'' she explained. ''I self-diagnosed the car on the computer and brought it in this morning. I said, 'I figured out what's wrong with the car.' And Joe said, 'We know.'''
 Mr. Cermele, who is delightful enough for Mayberry, smiled as he appeared out of the garage. ''Remember how beautiful it was Friday afternoon?'' he asked a visitor, picking up the story where Ms. Saril had left off. ''How many women would be interested in going online all day? But she had the first part of the fix.''
 Ms. Saril says the Tempest has had few problems, but she concedes she does not drive it too much -- about 1,000 miles in four years. 
 ''It's a spring car,'' she said. ''It doesn't have air-conditioning.'' She has added new carpeting, shoulder strap seat belts (bought on the Internet) and backup lights (optional in 1961, according to Mr. Cermele). 
 Mr. Cermele volunteered, as if further proof were needed, that Ms. Saril was unlike the rest of his clientele, who are mostly men.
 ''I have a 1939 Chevy inside,'' he said. ''I had a 1968 Chevy last week. They all said, giving me the card, 'I want to do this, this, this, this, this, this, this. Don't tell my wife.''' Ms. Saril, he said, is the opposite.
 Ms. Saril interrupted: ''I come in and say, 'Don't tell my husband what we have to do. Here's my credit card.'''
 The trunk serves as a repository for her shopping spree flotsam: a couple of whitewall tires, a vintage car radio in a box, two side mirrors that don't match her car, a spare hubcap (''That's gold,'' Mr. Cermele said), the original seat belts, an owner's guide and a chassis and body repair manual.
 With her head buried in the trunk, Ms. Saril riffled through the parts, some of which had clearly been long forgotten, and she seemed genuinely excited. 
 ''This is a treasure trove!'' she said.

HEADLINE: Ex-Copycats Find Their Own Styles

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
WITH savvy marketing to value-driven consumers, Kia and Hyundai have been reporting big sales gains in a sluggish market. Simultaneously, the Korean automakers have been honing their own signature styles -- a point reinforced by new models introduced at the New York auto show this month -- and are becoming visually desirable rivals to Japanese, American and even German brands.
 On the day before Kia was set to unveil its 2011 Optima at the show, Tom Kearns, the head of Kia's California design studio, was discussing the redesigned sedan with a reporter when he pulled off the cloth hiding the still-secret car. On the lonely lower level of the Javits Center, the temporary exposure seemed safe enough. 
 But spectators began to stop and stare. Almost panic-stricken and fearful that a full-scale crowd would gather, Kia's public relations people implored Mr. Kearns to replace the veil quickly.
 Not long ago, few would have given any Kia a second look. But the Optima was ''undoubtedly the star of the show,'' Eric Gallina wrote on the Web site of Car Design News, the London-based professional journal that he edits.
 The Optima and another redesigned Kia that made its debut in New York, the 2011 Sportage crossover, expand on a look already on the streets in the form of the small Forte sedan, the sporty Forte Koup and the jaunty Soul.
 After years of turning out generic knockoffs of Japanese best sellers, Kia began its design awakening in 2006 when it hired Peter Schreyer, a German who had been Audi's head designer, as its design director. Mr. Kearns, a soft-spoken American, joined Kia after helping to design the CTS sport sedan for Cadillac.
 One of Mr. Schreyer's first moves was to establish a distinct Kia face. The ''tabbed'' grille first appeared on the Kee concept car in 2007. The feature was called the Tiger grille, but Mr. Schreyer has backed away from the nickname -- not because of any association with the golfer, but because ''tiger'' suggests outdated notions about Asian economies. Mr. Kearns calls it the ''Kia signature grille.''
 Kia's design theme, Mr. Kearns says, is ''simplicity, but with precision.'' He added, ''Peter emphasizes simplicity, the single line drawn without picking up the pen.'' For the Optima, that single line is the roofline. He said the designers wanted the car's silhouette ''to be recognizable from a long distance.''
 Mr. Schreyer said he wanted the car to appear low, with a coupelike profile; the rearmost roof pillar is particularly low, making the entire car seem lower and wider. An arch of chrome sweeps over the roof, Mr. Kearns noted, and attaches to the rear glass in a totally new way. Another character line runs from the headlamps to the rear deck.
 ''It is a more sophisticated design,'' Mr. Kearns said. By sophistication, he explained, he was referring to subtle surfaces that keep the viewer's attention. The complex interplay of lines and curves, highlights and shadows around the Optima's roof helps to hold a viewer's interest beyond a simple glance.
 There is a lot of flexibility in the Kia design language. The midsize Optima is aimed at a very different market than the Soul, a small youth-oriented ''urban utility,'' but both share the tiger face. ''The Soul says youthful, bold, simple,'' Mr. Kearns said. Its design is another variation on simplicity.
 The new Sportage's ''spearing shoulder line,'' grille and headlights show its family ties to the Optima.
 The state of Hyundai design was represented at the show by two versions of its midsize Sonata, a hybrid and the turbo 2.0T, and by the high-end Equus.
 The Sonata and the Tucson crossover share with the Genesis sedan and coupe elements of a design language that Hyundai calls ''fluid sculpture.'' Hyundai's executive vice president for design, Suk Geun Oh, has promised that the company's designs will be not simple, but provocative and aggressive.
 The Hyundai look is expressive, too. Like the Genesis Coupe, the Sonata is characterized by twisting forms that represent torque and sharp creases that imply straight-line acceleration. The Equus, a new top-of-the-line $50,000 alternative to the Lexus LS sedan, has the most sedate shape of the line.
 Hyundai's future designs are likely to be even more expressive, based on the i-flow concept car revealed at the Geneva auto show in March. ''Hyundai is more flowing and emotional than we are,'' Mr. Kearns of Kia said.
 Neither Kia nor Hyundai is aiming to create a design that is particularly Korean. Like Samsung or LG in electronics, the companies project themselves as global companies whose home turf is technology, not geography. ''We don't have a lot of history,'' Mr. Kearns said. He conceded that few Korean designers work in the company's studios, which like Hyundai's are situated in Irvine, Calif.; South Korea; and Germany.
 So successful were the Hyundai designs from Irvine that Mercedes hired away Hyundai's chief designer, Joel Piaskowksi; he was replaced by Phil Zak, formerly of General Motors.

HEADLINE: Innovation, By Order of The Kremlin

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW
 AROUND the time that Apple Computer was making it big in California, Andrey Shtorkh was getting a first-hand look at the Soviet approach to high tech: he guarded the fence keeping scientists inside Sverdlovsk-45, one of the country's secret scientific cities, deep in the Ural Mountains. 
 Ostensibly, the cities were closed to guard against spies. Its walls also kept scientists inside, and everybody else in the Soviet Union out. While many people in the country went hungry, the scientific centers were islands of well-being, where store shelves groaned with imported food and other goodies. 
 Security in these scientific islands was so tight, though, that even children wore badges. Relatives had to apply months in advance for permission to visit. ''It was a prison, a closed city in every sense,'' recalls Mr. Shtorkh, then a young soldier. 
 Today, he is the publicist for an improbable new venture. The Russian government, hoping to diversify its economy away from oil, is building the first new scientific city since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even more improbably, it is modeled, officials say, on Silicon Valley. 
 The site, still nameless and near a village outside Moscow, is conceived not as a secretive, numbered city in Siberia but as an attempt to duplicate the vibrancy and entrepreneurial spirit of America's technology hotbed. 
 Russia's rich scientific traditions and poor record of converting ideas into marketable products are both undisputed, cited as causes for the Soviet collapse and crippling dependence on mining and petroleum. Not surprisingly, then, its leaders look longingly at Silicon Valley. 
 ''The whole country needs some sort of breakthrough,'' Viktor F. Vekselberg, the Russian business oligarch appointed co-director of the project, said in an interview. Mr. Vekselberg was chosen in part because of his investments in solar power, an unusual venture for one of the oligarchs who made fortunes in commodities. ''The founding of the innovation city, in form and substance,'' he says, ''could be a launching pad for the country as a whole.'' 
 He calls the city ''a test run of business models'' to rebuild Russian science for the capitalist era.
 Once developed, the site is intended to incubate scientific ideas using generous tax holidays and government grants until the start-ups can become profitable companies. Its backers in government and the private sector describe it as an effort to blend the Soviet tradition of forming scientific towns with Western models of encouraging technology ventures around universities. 
 Skeptics see a deeper strain of Russian tradition: trying to catch up with the West by wielding the power of the state. Looking askance at the incongruous blend of the Kremlin's will and the openness prized by Silicon Valley, they refer jokingly to the new city as Cupertino-2. 
 ''We should not expect the same mechanisms that work in Silicon Valley to work in Russia,'' says Evgeny V. Zaytsev, a co-founder of Helix Ventures, a life sciences venture capital company based in Palo Alto, Calif., and a member of the advisory board of AmBar, the Russian business association in the real Silicon Valley. ''The government will be involved, because that is the way it works in Russia.'' 
 Indeed, the new city was conceived by what is called the Commission on Modernization, deep within the Kremlin bureaucracy. 
 The Russian government, though, has a long and conflicted relationship with entrepreneurs and scientists. There is still a thriving tradition of government crackdowns on private business with capricious enforcement of the tax laws, making entrepreneurship difficult.
 For now, Russia's hoped-for Silicon Valley is a panorama of muddy fields, birch groves, warehouses and storage sheds belonging to a state agricultural institute. The site was chosen for its proximity to another ambitious project, the Skolkovo business school, housed in a futuristic building financed by millions in donations from the oligarchs, including Mr. Vekselberg.
 While similar ideas have been bandied about for years, this one was approved -- and blessed with $200 million in government money -- within a month of a visit in January to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by senior Kremlin leaders, including Vladislav Surkov, the powerful deputy director of the presidential administration. Mr. Surkov says the new city will isolate new businesses from the bureaucracy that handcuffs the Russian economy today.
 A government-financed foundation will build and run the city. Directors of existing state-financed tech companies -- including Rusnano, a nanotechnology fund headed by Anatoly Chubais, a leading architect of Russia's controversial post-Soviet privatization -- will serve on the board and contribute money. Separately, a scientific council will decide which companies can locate at the site. The infrastructure should be in place within three years, Mr. Vekselberg says. 
 Mr. Zaytsev grew up in the Siberian city of Barnaul, got an M.B.A. at Stanford and worked for venture capital firms before founding his own. He approves of the experimental spirit of the new city. But he is skeptical that bureaucrats will be able to channel the money in ways that will transform Russia into a competitive force in consumer technology. Rusnano and the other state-financed venture businesses have had few successes thus far. 
 ''The less control, the better,'' Mr. Zaytsev says. If the government ''controls the venture funds, no real venture funds will come.'' 
 FOR a time, the Russian elite embraced petroleum as the ticket to restore the country's domestic economy, its standing in the world and its power in regional politics. Vladimir V. Putin, then the president, took to citing the stock price of Gazprom as a national accomplishment. 
 But Gazprom, a company that inherited title to the world's largest natural gas reserves, is now valued by investors at well below Apple, a company that sprang from a garage.
 Indeed, the Kremlin's sensitivity to its trailing position in the wired world was on full display this year at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Putin, now the prime minister, and Michael S. Dell found themselves on the same discussion panel, and Mr. Dell asked in passing how he might help Russia develop its information technology sector. 
 Mr. Putin answered icily: ''We don't need help. We are not invalids. We don't have limited mental capacity.''
 For nationalistic Russian officials, it only rubs salt in the wounds that Silicon Valley companies so easily recruit bright Russian scientists. AmBar, the Russian business association, estimates that 30,000 to 60,000 Russian-speaking professionals work in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
 A marquee name in the high-tech world, the Google co-founder Sergei Brin, immigrated to the United States from Russia with his parents when he was a child. Had Russia been a different place, perhaps Mr. Brin might have started Google there instead of in Silicon Valley.
 Russia is hardly the first country to seize on the idea of copying Silicon Valley. In Malaysia, for example, a jungle has been cleared for a computer city called Cyberjaya that is a self-declared effort to imitate the south Bay Area. China has a cluster of high tech in Tianjin, outside Beijing, and France in Sophia Antipolis, near Nice, all created with an infusion of government aid -- and all eventually successful in attracting and fostering private business. 
 In the midst of the oil boom, Russian officials suggested luring back Russian talent by building a gated residential community outside Moscow, designed to look like an American suburb. What is it about life in Palo Alto, they seemed to be asking, that we cannot duplicate in oil-rich Russia? 
 The new effort, though, goes well beyond good housing. It also embraced the idea of encouraging new companies to commercialize the work done at university laboratories.
 Russian officials looked at Asian techno-parks with favorable tax treatment and established four of their own -- in Tomsk, Dubna, Zelenograd and St. Petersburg. Three were based in former closed scientific cities.
 The visions for Russia's Silicon Valley, though, are grander still. A proposed law would liberalize a host of tax, customs and immigration rules in ways that businesses have wanted for years. For example, the planners say they have studied the role of streamlined immigration rules in drawing talent to Silicon Valley.
 President Dmitri A. Medvedev appointed Mr. Vekselberg the co-director of the project, a position that will probably evolve into one of two directors of the foundation to manage the new city. As a first order of business, he is to recruit a foreign businessman to co-direct the city with him; he has so far sent out about 100 letters to foreign business contacts who are potential candidates. 
 For now, his own money is not tied up in the site. But Mr. Vekselberg's Renova group, whose primary assets are in metals and oil, has a significant investment in solar energy through a 44 percent stake in Oerlikon, a thin-film solar panel maker based in Switzerland.
 Mr. Vekselberg said he was surprised by his appointment but is now a true believer in the project and would like to attract a mix of start-ups, established companies and academic institutions. Mr. Medvedev, in a televised meeting about the new city, emphasized commercialization: ''The new technologies which we are creating are not toys for eggheads,'' he said. 
 The new town is intended to advance five scientific priorities laid out by Mr. Medvedev -- communications, biomedicine, space, nuclear power and energy conservation -- and to encourage cross-fertilization among disciplines. Property will not be owned, but rented, and the government will offer grants for scientists who struggle to find private financing.
 ''In California, the climate is beautiful and they don't have the ridiculous problems of Russia,'' Mr. Shtorkh said. To compete, he said, Russia will form a place apart for scientists. ''They should be isolated from our reality,'' he added. 
 Officials have painted the Russian Silicon Valley in sweeping ideological terms. Russia, they say, will again be defined by the depth of its scientific talent, rather than by its mines and wells. The government has appointed as scientific director a Nobel laureate in physics, Zhores Alferov -- whose discoveries in the 1950s were cited by the Nobel committee as paving the way for cellphones (which the Soviet Union, incidentally, never made). 
 HIGH-TECH entrepreneurs who stayed in Russia are more skeptical. Yevgeny Kaspersky, founder of the Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus company, says that he is pulling for the site to succeed but that the government should confine its role to offering tax breaks and infrastructure. 
 He started his own business in Moscow in the 1990s, working nights on his hobby of capturing and studying computer viruses, but he benefited from a special economic zone for start-ups only when he opened an office in Tianjin in 2003. The Chinese government gave him free office space for a year and a tax holiday. 
 ''Russia has a lot of talented software engineers but not a lot of successful businesses,'' he said. ''People still have an iron curtain in their minds.''
 The old scientific cities were entangled with the military, but they also reflected futuristic and utopian strains in Soviet thinking. Isolating scientists in Siberian enclaves -- removed from the struggle for groceries that defined many other citizens' lives -- and provisioning them with laboratories yielded results in the Soviet nuclear weapons and space programs. With talented, low-cost work forces, the cities remain attractive, even to foreign investors: I.B.M., Intel and others have opened offices and labs in formerly closed Russian cities.
 The problem, critics say, is that the government today intends to corral Russian engineers and scientists without knowing what it wants. The model, instead, should be maximum exposure to competition and the vagaries of consumer demand.
 ''They don't understand what they need,'' said an adviser to the Kremlin, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''They don't need another atomic bomb, and they don't need new televisions.'' 
 The planners, meanwhile, are looking for a name. One suggestion was ''Innograd,'' for Innovation City, echoing with a self-deprecating humor the boisterous Soviet nomenclature for new ventures like ''Magnitogorsk,'' or Magnetic Mountain -- the name given to a gigantic steel mill in the Ural Mountains. 
 Another option was ''Gorod Solntsa'' or Sun City, a reference to the nearby Moscow neighborhood of Solntsovo. This suggestion, though, may undermine the idea of turning a new page, as Solntsovo is also the name of a famous organized-crime group from the 1990s that got its start in the area. 
 Mr. Shtorkh, the former closed-city guard, prefers an Apple-esque iteration: iGorod.

HEADLINE: 'Keep Your Ear to the Streets'

 BODY:
Each week on the City Room blog, editors select a New Yorker to answer readers' questions. Here are excerpts from last week's Q. and A. about the history and culture of hip-hop with Jorge Pabon, a performer and choreographer known as Pop Master Fabel. This week, Alison Lowenstein, the author of ''City Kid New York: The Ultimate Guide for NYC Parents with Kids Ages 4-12'' (Rizzoli/Universe 2010), is responding to readers' questions about activities children can enjoy in the city.
 Q. Is it true that black youths in the United States have abandoned hip-hop culture? 
 Chris Cager
 A. The black youth in the United States have always represented some form of hip-hop culture. Although we did have moments when there weren't as many black youths actively b-boying/girling (break dancing) or D.J.-ing competitively, there was always a few who continued to be active. 
 Most of the first generation b-boys/girls were black youths who eventually moved on to other aspects of the culture such as emceeing (rapping), D.J.-ing and audio production. If you attend the various hip-hop competitions and events you will clearly see that the black youths are still in full effect.
 Q. Why is it the culture of hip-hop continues to grow, expand, study itself and drive new styles overseas, but in the United States, it seems like the pioneers are disgruntled, the mainstream does not care, and the underground is so weak in terms of resources and impact that they are nonexistent? Can you explain to those unaware what the fifth element of hip-hop is?
 Mr. Ask A Question
 A. The United States still has a true hip-hop scene, but it's less visible because the media's primary focus is on the rap industry. All throughout the States there are many events that help keep the culture alive.
 Yearly events such as the anniversaries of the Universal Zulu Nation and Rock Steady Crew attract an international audience and continue to be influential worldwide. Dance competitions are also held regularly throughout the nation. We also have various turntablist (D.J.) competitions like the Disco Mix Club battles, as well as theater and film festivals. Hip-hop curricula are being incorporated in all sorts of learning institutions.
 Activists who continue to fight for social justice, self-empowerment and awareness also use art forms within the culture. For the past seven years my wife, Christie Z-Pabon, has coordinated a series of outdoor events titled the ''Tools of War True School Park Jam Series.'' From June through September, you can come to New York City and experience hip-hop in its purest form.
 I disagree that the underground is weak in terms of resources. We actually have plenty of ways we can keep this culture alive and the youth engaged, but people need to continue to sustain the initiative. If you keep your ear to the streets you will find pockets of active hip-hop practitioners throughout the nation.
 According to Afrika Bambaataa, who is one of the founding fathers of the culture, the fifth element of hip-hop is knowledge. Bambaataa often says that it should actually be considered the first element, because without knowledge we would not be able to indulge in the various components and practices within the culture.
 Q. Can you give me a few examples of organic hip-hop movements that have spawned globally? I am very interested in how music, more specifically hip-hop, can shape community, and I missed the boat on that phenomenon in the United States. I am not one of the people who say hip-hop is dead; I think it has become a commercialized product different from the bottom-up culture that it used to be when you pioneered it, but I wonder if there are still examples of it functioning as a bottom-up culture in other parts of the world.
 Christian Hayden
 A. The Cuban and Brazilian hip-hop scenes are prime examples of organic hip-hop movements. They both share deeper African roots and culture that helped form the foundation for their take on hip-hop. Their messages are often socially and politically driven by a desire for change or social, political or economic identity. Since their cultures are composed of intricate polyrhythmic sounds and brilliant visuals, the hip-hop they produce is chock full of flavor and many layers. 
 In 1986 and 1988 I had the honor to perform in Cuba with Ann Marie DeAngelo's dance theater group. I met with locals who were already expressing themselves with elements of hip-hop.
 In 1988, I was popping (a robotic dance form) at the beach and a teenager approached me and said he knew how to dance like me. He immediately started to get down with a pretty decent understanding of the foundations of popping. I asked where he had learned, and he told me he and his friends would set up high-powered antennas to their TV sets and catch frequencies from Miami. The Cubans have always had a cultural imperative and tapped into the world's hip-hop vibrations by any means necessary. Cuban hip-hoppers have visited the United States for several years as part of various cultural exchange programs. Their love and passion for the culture has been heartfelt worldwide.
 In 1996, we performed the first hip-hop Off Broadway musical, titled ''Jam on the Groove,'' in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil. On our very first performance date we were greeted by dozens of b-boys and girls, aerosol artists, emcees and D.J.'s outside the theater. They were dressed in 1980s throwback gear, like a scene out of the film ''Wild Style.'' We were quite impressed at their skill level and authentic adaptation of the culture. In the last few years, the Universal Zulu Nation has established chapters in Brazil. These die-hard hip-hoppers continue to use the culture as a vehicle for peace, unity, love and having fun.

HEADLINE: Carving Out a Junior-Size Niche

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
MICHAEL ROSENBERG, 58; Burhan Okuyan, 52; and Yosef Shimron, 52, all veteran shopkeepers on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, don't know one another. Mr. Rosenberg is in clothing; Mr. Okuyan, art framing; Mr. Shimron, computer services. Yet all three, on their own, figured out the same thing. And that discovery has helped them survive the Great Recession when so many shops around them have closed: adults who stop spending on themselves in bad times will still spend on children.
 Since the downturn, Mr. Rosenberg has switched the clothing at his shop from 60 percent women's to 80 percent newborn and children's. Mr. Okuyan started working with nearby schools, and now says he's more likely to get an order to frame a 3-year-old's refrigerator art than a lithograph or an oil by an established contemporary artist. Mr. Shimron has placed a big sign in his window offering lessons for children in building a computer, one of several kid services he's added in the last year. 
 While they expect to survive the recession, all three have been hurt. Mr. Rosenberg says business is down 20 percent; Mr. Okuyan, 15 percent; Mr. Shimron, nearly 50 percent. Still, they count themselves lucky. Every day, Mr. Rosenberg walks down Amsterdam Avenue from his apartment on West 90th to his shop near West 79th and tabulates the recession's impact. ''Twelve empty storefronts,'' he said. Mr. Okuyan just has to look out his window onto Broadway: ''We lost a flower shop, vitamin store, bookstore, Malaysian restaurant, women's clothing store.''
 GRANNY-MADE (381 AMSTERDAM, BETWEEN 78TH AND 79TH) Mr. Rosenberg opened the store, which features handmade sweaters, 25 years ago. It was mainly a women's shop with a men's section and a few children's things. While his clothing is priced mid-range (women's machine-knit sweaters start at $60), well into the previous decade he was able to sell British hand-knit women's sweaters for $800. ''That's gone,'' he said. ''We did a lot of women's suits, sportswear, reversible skirts -- totally dropped after the recession.'' He used to phone his female regular customers after Labor Day, inviting them to come see the new fall clothes, but stopped in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed. ''I didn't know who was hurt and who wasn't,'' he said. ''I felt it'd be unseemly to call.''
 As sales dropped -- and a women's shop closed a few doors down -- he noticed children's sales were not falling as much. ''I always listen to my customers, and what I'd hear from mothers and grandmothers was, 'How can you not spend on a baby?' '' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''We started carrying swaddling blankets, first toys, birth clothes, we even do clothes for prenatals now. We just expanded into christening gowns, people were asking and they'll spend -- from $106 to $192.''
 ''Girls' dresses have been explosive -- 6 months to 8 years. We stay out of the teenaged years -- they get difficult.''
 Lee Anne MacDonald, 64, a writer and publicist, shops less for herself these days, but still buys for her grandchildren at Granny-Made. ''You have to remember a little girl on her birthday, you have to remember the little boy who's truck crazy,'' she said. ''It's the idea of hope. They're our future.''
 Long-term customers ask, ''When did you become a baby store?'' In just 650 square feet of space, from a business that typically does $40,000 in sales a month, Mr. Rosenberg spotted a national trend.
 While children's clothing sales are down 7.5 percent nationally over the last two years, adult clothing is down 8.9 percent, according to a survey by NPD, a market research company. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports employment at men's stores is down 25 percent since the recession began; employment at women's stores is down 1.5 percent, but at children's stores it is up slightly. ''People want their kids to be insulated from the recession,'' said Ellen Davis, a National Retail Federation spokeswoman. ''We notice it in holiday spending -- back-to-school didn't decline as much as other holidays.''
 It's still been hard for Mr. Rosenberg. He went into his retirement account to pay vendors and meet his payroll. Children's items are lower-priced, producing a smaller profit. ''Our average adult sweater is $150,'' he said. ''You have to sell a lot of $30 rompers to make up.'' But last month, he did $52,000 in sales, his strongest March in several years.
 METRO FRAMART (2459 BROADWAY, AT 91ST) When the economy dived, Mr. Okuyan, who's been in this neighborhood for 20 years, began sending $50 framing gift certificates to architects, interior designers, synagogues, churches and schools, trying to draw some traffic into his store. Only schools responded, auctioning the certificates at fund-raisers. ''Parents started coming in,'' he said. They would put the $50 certificate toward a $200 frame.
 Children's art has risen to about 25 percent of his business, from about 5 percent, since the recession. ''Look around,'' he said pointing to shop walls covered with framed works by contemporary artists. ''They're not selling. That's why they're on the walls.''
 On the other hand, Mr. Okuyan is framing three finger-paintings by Ava Jacoby, age 21 months, which will cost the artist's mom $1,082.64. ''I'd never spend that on a frame for myself,'' said Michelle Jacoby, 34, who's giving them as a gift to her husband for his law office. ''He's turning 40, and there's nothing else he'd want, than something from his daughter.''
 It's broadened Mr. Okuyan's view of art. ''All kids are artists, that's how we look at it now,'' he said.
 Like his customers, Mr. Okuyan has cut back while still spending on his children. ''I just bought my kids new phones, expensive ones,'' he said. ''My wife and I are taking their leftovers. I don't want them to feel left behind their friends or inferior to anyone.''
 His daughter, a senior at George Washington University, went to Puerto Rico for spring break; his son, a sophomore at the University of Rochester, went to Europe last summer. And Mr. Okuyan, who used to take three weeks of vacation a year, hasn't taken any since the recession. ''I can't afford not to work,'' he said.
 DESKTOP USA (517 AMSTERDAM, AT 85TH) Mr. Shimron opened his business as a copy store 20 years ago and has adapted through the years, now providing a wide array of computer and graphic design services. In the last year, while revenues are down, his children's business is up 15 percent. ''We used to get people who needed a business prospectus bound and printed,'' he said. ''We don't see that now.''
 He's started advertising one-on-one homework help for children at $50 an hour. (''Do you want your child to excel in school? Our team can assist your child on homework assignments.'')
 A big sign in the window says: ''Can Your Child Build His/Her Own Computer? Absolutely. Let's Do It Together.''
 Instruction plus buying the computer parts can cost a parent $1,000, but Michelle Fraczek, 30, a business manager, thought it was worth it for her only child, Maya Chavez, 11. Though the mother has cut out most spending on herself -- beauty appointments, new clothes, eating out -- she believed that learning to build a computer would be such an advantage for her daughter. ''This will give her a head start in school,'' Ms. Fraczek said. ''I think of it as a necessity that she has the skills to be able to do anything on a computer. I wish I did. If I don't do it now, when the economy eventually improves and it's Maya's time, she won't be ready.''

HEADLINE: A Frisky Korean Colt In the Pony Car Corral

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
IN the category of ''never the twain shall meet,'' it would be hard to top this pair: fans of American muscle cars and devotees of Asian sport coupes. 
 You might assume there would be some common ground -- a grudging respect, or even furtive cross-shopping -- between them. After all, a Ford Mustang and a Mitsubishi Eclipse are both built for fun at lower-than-house-payment prices. 
 Instead, there are battle lines defined largely by age and outlook: boomers and Detroit loyalists line up behind V-8 muscle like flag-wavers at an Olympic hockey final, while college-age buyers want to download turbo-juicing software to their high-revving tuner cars from across the Pacific. 
 Don't expect to find these enthusiasts playing nicely on the same Web forum. 
 In recent years, Japan's carmakers have mostly quit the game. The Toyota Celica and Supra are long gone, as is the Honda Prelude, and coupes derived from front-drive mass-market sedans like the Honda Accord and Nissan Altima are more practical than passionate. The Eclipse, once a star, has become as soft-bellied and hard to justify as a 40-year-old designated hitter.
 But out of left field, or at least to the left of Japan, a new player has emerged. Even as American car companies crank out a gumball assortment of pony-car revivals -- Mustang, Chevy Camaro and Dodge Challenger -- a warrior from Korea has entered the no-fire zone: the Hyundai Genesis Coupe, the kind of rear-drive, road-flogging, date-snaring car that makes young people want to take a second job, or at least plead with the parents. 
 Starting at $22,750 for the tepid 4-cylinder turbo model, or $25,750 for the more desirable 306-horsepower V-6 version, the Genesis is the only well-priced Asian coupe that won't shrivel before the American pony-car onslaught. It's also the only Asian coupe that should matter to people who can't drum up $37,000 for the Infiniti G37. 
 As with every Hyundai, including the Genesis luxury sedan on which it is based, the coupe takes its competitive cues from the film ''All About Eve.'' Sidling up to the G37, the Genesis Coupe is the ingenue, its style and performance seemingly no threat to the big-name star (the Bette Davis character on screen, for readers under 40). But the Hyundai has been slyly absorbing the star's lessons, including a set of exterior curves that seems clearly inspired by the Infiniti.
 Especially in lean times, car buyers have been catching on to Hyundai's blossoming talents -- and wondering why they should spend more for the boldface name that offers no apparent advantage. Yet what works beautifully for Hyundai's affordable sedans and crossovers hasn't always translated to other segments. 
 A weak link has been performance. Fitful attempts at sporty cars, like the Tiburon coupe, betrayed a Korean car culture with precious little experience in manufacturing speed or sex appeal, whether on the street or in motorsports.
 That's what makes the Genesis Coupe a groundbreaker for Hyundai. It's not as fast as the Infiniti and not at all luxurious, though you'd have no right to expect riches for a price that undercuts the G37 by $11,000. But the Genesis may actually top the Infiniti in pure entertainment value: the Hyundai is younger, louder and more visceral, eager to shake its tail through power slides that the Infiniti would sniff at as immature behavior. 
 The Genesis is also a surprisingly deft handler, powered by a husky-voiced 3.8-liter V-6. In short, there's a bona fide rear-drive performance car underneath that handsome body. 
 Compared with the boldness of the exterior, the cabin is straightforward. But it's also straitlaced; you might prefer more visual assurance that this is a quick car. The controls are simple and well executed; the front seats are stylish and firmly bolstered (though the leather on one test car was showing wear after 10,000 miles). And plastic trim on the dash and doors has the shiny look and knock-knock feel associated with budget cars. 
 Because of the sloping roofline, any rear passenger who's remotely tall will find his head polishing the rear glass. The trunk is more accommodating; despite a slender opening, it can accept weekend luggage or a cartload of groceries. But this isn't a car for fetching a carton of eggs. Instead, the Hyundai's errand is to nip at, reel in and otherwise pester drivers of more expensive cars -- Infinitis, Nissan Zs, BMWs, you name it. At the underdog game, the Hyundai excels. 
 Or, I should say, the V-6 version excels. The turbocharged 4-cylinder, an engine shared with the Mitsubishi Lancer Ralliart, is tuned more for smoothness and economy than for big-boost performance. (The E.P.A. rates the 4 at 21 m.p.g. in town and 30 on the highway with a 6-speed manual.) It produces just 210 horsepower, compared with 237 in the Mitsubishi, running out of breath just when you expect the fun to begin. This shortfall could be overcome by dropping Hyundai's new 274-horse direct injection 4, coming later this year in the Sonata, into the Genesis Coupe.
 For now, the 3.8-liter V-6, with 306 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque, is the speedster's choice. On regular-grade gas, it is rated at 17 miles per gallon in town (18 with an automatic transmission) and 26 on the highway. In Motor Trend's hands, the Genesis V-6 squirted from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 5.5 seconds, clipping the quarter-mile in 14 seconds at just over 100 m.p.h. 
 That V-6 Track model ($30,250 with the 6-speed manual; $31,750 with a 6-speed manual-shift automatic) adds features including 19-inch alloy wheels and summer tires; Brembo brakes with four-piston front and rear calipers; a stiffer suspension; a Torsen limited-slip differential; aluminum pedals; and a rear spoiler. 
 The spec-obsessed Camaro or Mustang owner might scoff, but in the right hands, the V-6 Genesis will keep pace with Detroit's born-again pony cars -- even the ones with V-8 engines -- on coiling roads. At just under 3,400 pounds, the Hyundai is nearly 250 pounds lighter than the Infiniti and about 350 pounds less than a Camaro V-6. 
 Compared with the vaguer sensations of the Detroiters, the Hyundai transmits sports-car feedback that lets you fling it into curves aggressively. For a rear-drive car, the Hyundai is still nose-heavy, carrying 55 percent of its weight up front. And the front wheels want to push wide in turns when the tires are near their traction limit. 
 Yet the Hyundai wants to go faster: once you have the Genesis set in a turn, its cornering attitude can be adjusted with a love tap on the brake or throttle. Switch off the stability control system and the Genesis can also be provoked into controllable drifts that will have drivers howling along with the tires. 
 The strangest part of the Hyundai is its engine-control computer, which cuts power for a few buzz-killing seconds if you accidentally rev the engine to its limiter. The other knock, aside from a bit of notchiness in the manual shifter, is a heavy clutch: I was testing a Camaro SS at the same time as the Genesis, and the Hyundai's pedal felt as tiring in urban stop-and-go as the Chevy's. 
 But any rough edges in the Genesis test car were smoothed by the price tag -- $28,250 for a well-equipped 3.8 Grand Touring model. That V-6 price splits the difference between the V-6 and V-8 Camaros and Mustangs. Ultimately, it's hard to recall the last all-new Asian nameplate that has crammed this much style and performance into such an affordable package. The fact that Asia's best budget coupe now comes from South Korea, not Japan, might embarrass engineers and executives at Honda and Toyota.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Having read ''Contesting Jobless Claims Becomes a Boom Industry'' (''The Safety Net'' series, front page, April 4), as chief executive of a reputable national unemployment firm, I am compelled to defend our industry generally. 
 Agents motivated by short-term gains and market share undoubtedly damage our profession. Reputable agents understand that done correctly, legally and ethically, our expertise cannot be reduced to a commodity or dumbed down to a clerical function. Service contracts must cover the real costs of professionally managing this critical ''safety net''; otherwise, there will be casualties (beyond an inflated tax rate) for employers. 
 There will always be those who will game the system and abuse the trust placed in them. I encourage employers to apply some common sense. Don't be wooed by low fees and promises to do it all. The unintended consequences and real costs are considerable.

HEADLINE: In Currency Games, the Prize May Be a Trade War

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
THE United States and China have edged away from a trade war, but both sides are keeping their powder dry.
 China is quietly preparing for a modest appreciation of its currency, the renminbi, after weeks of criticism from American officials, The New York Times reported last week. Currency markets anticipate a 3 percent climb in the renminbi against the dollar over the next year. 
 But an increase that modest is unlikely to satisfy the growing number of members of Congress who are demanding that China hike the value of the renminbi by 25 to 40 percent against the dollar -- a sharp shift that they say is needed to reduce America's trade gap and to save domestic jobs. If China doesn't comply, they say, the United States should impose tariffs aimed at making Chinese products more expensive and American products more competitive. 
 But be careful what you wish for.
 The chances of China passively accepting American-imposed tariffs or punitive legislation are ''pretty close to zero,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a Brookings Institution scholar and a former adviser on China in the Clinton administration. Unilateral American action would almost certainly invite retaliation.
 China is now America's second-biggest trading partner, behind Canada, and it holds more than $1 trillion in United States Treasury and government agency debt. If economic hostilities erupted, it isn't clear which side would have the upper hand. 
 The two countries have become mutually dependent in many ways, and could do considerable damage to each other and to the rest of the global economy, Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell economist, said in an interview. 
 ''The bargaining strengths of the two countries are finely balanced,'' he said in Congressional testimony in February. ''But the changing perceptions set up a dangerous game of chicken that could spin out of control if unrealistic expectations and the desire to pander to domestic audiences trumps rational collective policymaking in one or both countries.''
 Aside from imposing tariffs on American goods, China could stop buying Treasuries, for example. Even hinting that it is doing so might drive up yields and drive down prices, and deliver a blow to an already fragile American economy. This would hurt China, too, of course, because the value of its own assets would fall and one of its main markets would be damaged -- and the fallout could spread elsewhere. 
 The point is not that this is likely, but that it could be quite dangerous if it occurred. 
 Faced with the prospect of direct economic conflict, leaders of the two countries have been backpedaling sharply over the last two weeks. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Wang Qishan, China's vice premier, met in Beijing to discuss bilateral economic issues on Thursday. President Obama and Hu Jintao, China's president, are expected to continue the dialogue in Washington this week. Further bilateral talks have been scheduled.
 The Geithner visit came only days after the Treasury decided to extend an April 15 deadline at which Mr. Geithner was to have certified whether China was a currency ''manipulator,'' a move that could lead to tariffs.
 Last month, 130 members of Congress demanded in a letter that the Treasury affix that label to China. Furthermore, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, along with three colleagues, have introduced legislation that might tie the Treasury's hands by requiring it to identify ''fundamentally misaligned currencies,'' without any need to prove ''intent.'' 
 Senator Schumer said that China had disappointed him before, so he intended to move forward with the legislation. ''We are dubious that this time would be any different, but will await the details,'' he said in a statement. The cheap renminbi was enabling Chinese manufacturers to take jobs from Americans, he said.
 Chinese officials say they are concerned about losing jobs, too. China's enormous exports -- made possible, in part, by voracious American consumers -- have helped generate enough prosperity to ensure a reasonable degree of social stability, several China experts said. A drastic and abrupt revaluation of the renminbi could be quite disruptive -- and that would not be palatable to the ruling Chinese Communist Party.
 If Chinese officials aren't pushed too hard by the American government, Mr. Prasad said, and if economic conditions are propitious, they might allow their currency to appreciate a bit further than the markets anticipate, perhaps by 5 percent over the next year. Other developing countries that compete with China might then also allow their currencies to strengthen. 
 All of that would probably not have a big effect on America's trade imbalance, however, implying that the currency dispute could flare up as the November elections approach, especially if unemployment remains high. 
 Over the longer term, allowing its currency to trade more freely on global markets could help China restructure its economy. While the United States needs to increase national savings and limit consumption, China faces a very different set of issues. 
 In a new report last week, the World Bank found that despite remarkably steady and rapid growth in China's G.D.P., even during the global financial crisis, the country's economy remained unbalanced, relying too heavily on huge infusions of state-supplied credit into capital-intensive industries. 
 ALTHOUGH its foreign-exchange reserves are enormous, its banking system is still relatively primitive. Credit does not flow easily to small businesses or to service industries that might generate large numbers of jobs, and China's central bank does not yet rely on interest rates as a lever to guide the economy. 
 A generation after Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms that have transformed a Soviet-style command economy into a powerful hybrid, the job is still incomplete. Making the renminbi a stronger global currency might advance China's own economic agenda. The question is whether it will be able to do so without the distraction of a trade war.

HEADLINE: Health Care Overhaul May Help a Fund Sector

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
NOW that President Obama has finally gotten his sweeping health overhaul passed, mutual fund managers can breathe a sign of relief. Finally, there is some certainty about the changes, and most of them appear to be beneficial for health care stocks. 
 ''There does not seem to be any onerous cost control,'' said Les Funtleyder, a heath care analyst at Miller Tabak, an insititutional brokerage firm and asset manager. 
 Citing other positives for the sector, Derek Taner, the lead manager of the AIM Global Health Care fund, said, ''There is just an expansion of coverage'' and ''not a lot of surprises.'' 
 Many fund managers had already factored in the potential impact in assembling their portfolios. Health care stocks have not rallied as investors try to analyze and quantify the nuances of the longer-term impact. 
 Over all, fund managers tend to be bullish on most health-related sectors with the exception of the health insurance industry, where it's harder to gauge the impact of new regulations. 
 Mr. Taner said he had added companies like CVS Caremark to his portfolio, on the theory that pharmacies would benefit because there would be higher volumes of prescriptions filled. He has also been buying shares of some lab companies, like Quest Diagnostics, because he thinks the demand for medical tests will rise. 
 Some managers had already chosen to insulate their funds from any changes initiated by health legislation by investing in stocks that rely heavily on emerging economies. ''It is where the growth is going to be,'' said Eddie Yoon, who manages Fidelity Select Medical Equipment and Systems, with $1.5 billion in assets. ''In the developed countries, these companies will just continue to face increasing regulation.''
 This year through March, the fund was up 8.3 percent, or 1.8 percentage points better than the health category and 2.9 percentage points better than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar. 
 Mr. Yoon has invested nearly 13 percent of the assets in Covidien, a maker of general surgery products, on the theory that whatever happens in the United States will be offset by greater spending overseas as developing countries race to build more infrastructure and create new hospitals.
 The fund's second-largest holding is Baxter International, a medical devices and biosciences company, that gets 55 percent of its revenue outside the United States. ''Across the world people are spending more on health care,'' Mr. Yoon said.
 Mr. Funtleyder sees the new law as beneficial for most health care companies. Hospitals will get a larger number of insured patients, he said, while biotech companies will get longer patent protection and new research-and-development tax credits.
 ''Coverage will expand and so will costs, but the cost issue will be a 'kick the can down the road' thing,'' he said. The only people who will be hurt, he said, are some with high incomes (over $200,000 for single taxpayers and $250,000 for couples): ''They will have to pay 3.8 percent more in tax on their investment income.''
 In the wake of the new bill, the only negative he sees is a potential problem for insurance companies, like WellPoint, the UnitedHealthGroup and Aetna, because at some point they will have to cover all potential clients. ''Then the question is, will they price these things so that they can avoid losing money?'' he asked.
 Christopher Davis, a senior analyst who follows health care funds for Morningstar, explained the pluses and minuses this way: ''There may be some riskier patients that will be added to the pool of people they have to insure. But there are a lot of young people who did not get insurance that will become customers.''
 Mr. Taner agreed that insurance providers faced many challenges. ''The outlook is cloudier because Medicare Advantage is going to get cut,'' he said, referring to a program that covers the elderly under private health plans. He noted that the companies participating in Medicare Advantage were being reimbursed at a rate higher than traditional Medicare plans. But that premium will be phased out over several years. 
 In addition, insurers have been active in the individual and small group markets, where margins are high. But now, he said, each state will establish an exchange where small companies and individuals can compare rates more easily and shop for the cheapest plan. 
 David Chan, who has managed the Prudential Jennison Health Sciences fund for more than a decade, says he is convinced that removing uncertainty has been beneficial for the health care industry.
 Mr. Chan had never owned hospital stocks until recently because they were too easily affected by changes in government policy. But he said that the risk had been offset by the numbers of new patients who would now be insured. 
 Still, his portfolio has a lot of pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Amag Pharmaceuticals. ''Largely speaking, we bet on new drugs,'' he said. ''Celgene, for example, has a big oncology drug for the treatment of myeloma, and we believe it will grow regardless.''

HEADLINE: Who's Not Sorry Now?

 BODY:
''I'm sorry that the financial crisis has had such a devastating impact on our country. I'm sorry for the millions of people, average Americans, who have lost their homes. And I'm sorry that our management team, starting with me, like so many others, could not see the unprecedented market collapse that lay before us.'' 
 -- Charles O. Prince III, former chairman and chief executive officer, Citigroup, April 8, 2010
 ''We all bear responsibility for not recognizing this, and I deeply regret that.'' 
 -- Robert E. Rubin, former Treasury secretary and former director, Citigroup, April 8, 2010
 The latest public hearings of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, held last week, made headlines for eliciting more apologies from financiers who presided over the market collapse.
 You may recall a similar flurry last year, when Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was widely credited for having apologized for his firm's role in the financial crisis. 
 We did not buy it then; Mr. Blankfein never said what he was sorry for or to whom he was apologizing. And we are not buying it now. 
 Mr. Prince says he ''could not'' foresee the impending collapse, when he could have and should have seen it coming. Certainly, others did. Mr. Rubin has said that under his employment agreement, he was not responsible for the bank's operations. But he was a towering figure at Citi, a source of its credibility and prestige. That implies responsibility, no matter what his contract said. Add all that to the ''I wasn't the only one'' context of both men's comments, and their regret translates as, ''We feel bad about an accident we were powerless to prevent.''
 Except that the financial crisis was not an accident and they were not powerless. The crisis was the result of irresponsibility and misjudgments by many people, including Mr. Prince and Mr. Rubin. Citi, under their leadership, epitomized the financial recklessness that ruined the economy. 
 More important, the ''apologies'' are distractions. The purpose of the inquiry is not catharsis. It is to determine the causes of the crisis and present the truth. A successful inquiry would compel the government to take appropriate corrective action.
 The commission has managed to unearth some compelling testimony. (Last week's hearings produced detailed evidence of how the mortgage-investment pipeline came to be stuffed with toxic loans.) But the inquiry can strangely lack vigor. It has not issued any subpoenas for documents -- satisfied so far with voluntary submissions -- and does not administer oaths to witnesses it interviews in private. Lying to a federal investigator is illegal under oath or not, but experience shows that taking an oath is a powerful incentive to tell the whole truth. 
 The commission is supposed to finish its work by Dec. 15. In the meantime, Congress's efforts at financial reform appear to be weakened daily by politicians who are more concerned with campaign donations than regulating the financial system. This week, for instance, a Senate committee is expected to propose new regulations for derivatives that are more loophole than rule.
 Sorry, indeed.

HEADLINE: Kyrgyz Leader Gives Clinton Some Assurance on Use of Base

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER and MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan -- The United States made its first high-level contact with the interim government of Kyrgyzstan on Saturday, getting assurances that the new leadership would live up to previous agreements and allow American use of an airport that plays an important role in supplying the war effort in Afghanistan. 
 But a statement posted on the State Department Web site did not say exactly how long the United States could count on using the airport. 
 The initial agreement last June was supposed to last a year, and the long-term prognosis for the use of the airport has been considered murky, in part because Russia has bridled at the American presence in a region it considers part of its zone of influence. 
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called the transitional leader, Roza Otunbayeva, in Bishkek, the capital, late Saturday evening, according to the State Department and Ms. Otunbayeva's chief of staff.
 In the State Department statement, Philip J. Crowley, a spokesman, added that Mrs. Clinton was sending Robert O. Blake, an assistant secretary of state, to Kyrgyzstan. 
 The new government here, which took control after protesters stormed the presidential building early last week, also has been moving quickly to solidify its relations with Russia. About an hour before Mrs. Clinton called, the prime minister of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, put in a second courtesy call since the government was overthrown on Wednesday.
 Earlier in the day on Saturday, the United States Embassy issued a statement that stopped short of endorsing the new government.
 ''We remain a committed partner to the development of Kyrgyzstan for the benefit of the Kyrgyz people and intend to continue to support the economic and democratic development of the country,'' the statement said. The United States has provided medical aid from the military airport, it said.
 After two days of looting and several cases of arson, the capital was calm for a second day on Saturday.
 Azimbek Beknazarov, an acting minister for economic affairs, said at a news conference that he knew the whereabouts of the ousted president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, but that the government would not try to arrest him, for now. 
 Mr. Bakiyev has taken refuge in the south of the country and, authorities say, is moving from place to place in the company of a small group of supporters. 
 On Saturday, the authorities here said they had learned that Mr. Bakiyev had been distributing weapons to supporters in the region. But Edil Baisalov, Ms. Otunbayeva's chief of staff, dismissed any threat of a civil war in Kyrgyzstan.
 He said the officer corps and army garrisons in the south were loyal to the new government. 
 The opposition leaders took power after street protests that began with a demonstration against rising utility rates in a provincial city.
 On Wednesday, soldiers guarding Mr. Bakiyev's offices opened fire on demonstrators, killing as many as 75 people before the protesters swarmed into the building. 
 Mr. Bakiyev took power in 2005, also after a popular uprising, promising democracy and an end to corruption. His opponents say that he quickly became as corrupt and authoritarian as his predecessors.
 After Mr. Bakiyev fled the capital on Wednesday, Ms. Otunbayeva, a former foreign minister, announced that she would lead a ''people's government'' until a new constitution could be written and elections held. The next day, she spoke by phone with Mr. Putin, who offered support.
 Ms. Otunbayeva traveled twice to Moscow before the uprising, in January and March, Mr. Baisalov said, and she told Russian officials about ''the nature of the relationship of the Kyrgyz people to Bakiyev.'' 
 He said the same message, foreshadowing the overthrow of the government, was given to the American and European officials.
 Mr. Baisalov said that Russian diplomacy in the region had shifted since the ''color revolutions'' that overthrew entrenched leaders and installed pro-Western governments in the former Soviet Union -- in Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004 and Kyrgyzstan in 2005 -- and that the new government here had taken note.
 ''It's no longer the Pavlovian response that if you talk to the Americans, you must be pro-American,'' said Mr. Baisalov, a civil society activist who returned from exile in Sweden to join the new government. ''It's much more nuanced.'' 
 Russia now has a ''pragmatic'' stance that accepts some Western influence, while seeking recognition for the aid to the Kyrgyz economy it has provided.
 Outside the Kyrgyz capital, several victims of the violence received a hero's burial at a cemetery in the foothills of the Tian-Shan Mountains reserved for significant national figures, including those killed in Stalin's purges in the 1930s. 
 The ceremony was complete with rifle volleys and speeches by the country's interim leaders, who described those who died as patriots.
 Ms. Otunbayeva said the people shot by government troops and the police ''fought for the freedom of our people.'' She vowed to find those responsible, but she asked the relatives of the dead to be patient.
 ''We will do all we can to seek justice for our people,'' she said.

HEADLINE: From Senate Majority Leader, a Promise to Take Up Immigration Overhaul

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Steve Friess contributed reporting from Las Vegas and William Yardley from Seattle.

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, told an exuberant crowd at an immigration rally Saturday in Las Vegas that Congress would start work on an immigration overhaul as soon as lawmakers return this week from a recess.
 ''We're going to come back, we're going to have comprehensive immigration reform now,'' he said in a speech to more than 6,000 people, mostly immigrants, gathered downtown.
 ''We need to do this this year,'' Mr. Reid said, drawing cheers from the crowd, which included many Latinos. ''We cannot wait.'' 
 Mr. Reid surprised immigrants and advocates with his direct commitment to moving forward with legislation on the volatile issue, with the Senate already divided by the passage of a health care overhaul. Also, as a result of Justice John Paul Stevens's announcement last week that he would retire, the Obama administration and the Senate will have to focus this summer on winning confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. 
 The Democratic leader was nearing the end of a week of hard campaigning in his bid for re-election in Nevada, which is facing record unemployment and the nation's highest foreclosure rate. After seeing small turnouts at several campaign stops, he appeared elated by the boisterous gathering in Las Vegas. 
 ''We're going to pass immigration reform, just as we passed health care reform,'' Mr. Reid said in a five-minute speech. Latino voters, who strongly support an overhaul, were crucial to President Obama's upset victory in the state in 2008. 
 The rally was the largest among demonstrations Saturday in seven cities nationwide, with immigrants pressing Congress and the administration to pass an overhaul bill this year. 
 Organizers said they planned the rallies, on the last weekend before lawmakers return to Washington after the Congressional recess, to follow up a big rally on March 21 on the Washington Mall. They are battling to keep immigration overhaul on Congress's agenda, even as the political odds have appeared to worsen almost daily. 
 The demonstrations were tinged by growing criticism of the administration from immigrant groups and labor unions that support the overhaul. They say it has continued to pursue tough enforcement leading to thousands of deportations, but has made no progress on legislation to open a path to legal status to millions of illegal immigrants.
 ''I'm very unhappy with President Obama because he said this would be the first thing he did when he was elected,'' said Rafael Lopez, 21, an immigrant living in Las Vegas. ''I'm worried because the Republicans are anti-immigrant,'' he said, adding that he feared that Republicans could make important gains in the elections in November.
 Mr. Reid told the crowd that he believes he has 56 votes in the Senate in support of the immigration legislation. ''We need a handful of Republicans,'' he said, calling on immigrant groups to help mobilize support among them for the overhaul. 
 He outlined legislation that would include border security measures and a temporary guest worker program for future immigrants. To gain legal status, illegal immigrants would face ''a penalty and a fine, people will have to work, stay out of trouble, pay taxes, learn English,'' he said. ''It's not so bad, is it?'' he asked the crowd. 
 Opponents of such legislation said yesterday that they thought the chances for passage of an overhaul remained slim while the country is facing high unemployment.
 ''It just doesn't look very feasible as the next big thing,'' said Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, an organization that favors reduced immigration. ''I don't think even Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are radical enough to go back to their districts and say American workers don't have priority when it comes to American jobs.'' Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, is the speaker of the House.
 In Chicago, at a rally that drew more than 1,000 people, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, the No. 2 leader in the Senate, echoed Mr. Reid's promise to try to enact the overhaul this year. Speaking of President Obama's role in pressing for health care legislation, Mr. Durbin said, ''We need that same determination and that same commitment to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year.''
 He said he would work to bring Republicans to support the legislation. 
 Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, have been working on an immigration bill. Mr. Graham said recently that he did not believe there was sufficient support among Republicans to move forward.
 ''That is our challenge,'' Mr. Durbin told the rally in Chicago, ''to bring together the Democratic voices as well as good-thinking Republicans to make this a reality of immigration reform. We can do this.''
 More than one thousand people also turned out for a rally in Seattle, and there were smaller events in El Paso, New York City, Philadelphia, and Providence, R.I.
 In the past week, some immigrant advocates had become openly angry with the Obama administration, saying its enforcement policies had led to thousands of deportations. 
 The advocates said they were reacting to news reports that agents were working to meet deportation quotas, even after senior immigration officials had said they were no longer guided by such numerical goals. 
 In several California cities, members of the Service Employees International Union, one of the largest labor organizations supporting immigration overhaul, protested Thursday and Friday in front of immigration agency offices. 
 Eliseo Medina, an executive vice president of the union, said the group had been expecting Mr. Obama to shift enforcement policy after the high-profile workplace raids of the Bush administration. But Mr. Medina said that thousands of immigrants in the union who do not have work authorization had been fired from jobs in recent months while deportations continued.
 ''It's pretty clear that our optimism about a change of policy was misplaced,'' Mr. Medina said in an interview. ''What they are doing makes no sense, so we are just basically mobilizing to fight back.''

HEADLINE: No One Is to Blame for Anything

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
''I was right 70 percent of the time, but I was wrong 30 percent of the time,'' said Alan Greenspan as he testified last week on Capitol Hill. Greenspan -- a k a the Oracle during his 18-year-plus tenure as Fed chairman -- could not have more vividly illustrated how and why geniuses of his stature were out to lunch while Wall Street imploded. No doubt he applied his full brain power to that 70-30 calculation. But the big picture eludes him. If the captain of the Titanic followed the Greenspan model, he could claim he was on course at least 70 percent of the time too. 
 Greenspan was testifying to the commission trying to pry loose the still incomplete story of how the American economy was driven at full speed into its iceberg. He was eager to portray himself as an innocent bystander to forces beyond his control. In his rewriting of history, his clout in Washington was so slight that he was ineffectual at ''influencing the Congress.'' The ''roots'' of the crisis, he lectured, dated back to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In other words: Wherever the buck stops, you had better believe it's not within several thousand miles of the Oracle. As he has previously said in defending his inability to spot the colossal bubble, ''Everybody missed it -- academia, the Federal Reserve, all regulators.'' 
 That, of course, is not true. In last Sunday's Times, one of those who predicted the bubble's burst -- Michael Burry, an investor chronicled in ''The Big Short'' by Michael Lewis -- told in detail of how Greenspan and others in power ''either willfully or ignorantly aided and abetted'' the reckless boom and the ensuing bust. But Greenspan is nothing if not a representative leader of his time. We live in a culture where accountability and responsibility are forgotten values. When ''mistakes are made'' they are always made by someone else. 
 This syndrome is hardly limited to the financial sector. The Vatican hierarchy and its American apologists blame the press, anti-Catholic bigots and ''petty gossip'' for a decades-long failure to police the church's widespread criminal culture of child molestation. Michael Steele, the G.O.P. chairman, has tried to duck criticism for his blunders by talking about his ''slimmer margin'' of error as a black man. New York's dynamic Democratic duo of political scandal, David Patersonand Charles Rangel, have both attributed their woes to newspapers like The Times, not their own misbehavior. 
 Such is our current state of national fecklessness that the gold medal for prompt contrition by anyone on the public stage belongs, by default, to David Letterman. He wasted little time in telling a national audience point blank that he had done ''something stupid,'' hurt those he loved and had a ''responsibility'' to ''try to fix it.'' In the land of Rod Blagojevich and Tiger Woods, the candid late-night talk show star is king.
 Woods's apologetic Masters press conference last week came only after months of stalling, sponsor defections and well-publicized ''rehab.'' Along the way he briefly hired Ari Fleischer, the former Bush press secretary, to help manage his mess. Fleischer is not the only Bush spin artist to re-emerge as a hired damage-control hand in the post-Bush era. Dan Bartlett, a former presidential counselor, is a honcho at Public Strategies, the company recently enlisted by Goldman Sachs to help erase the indelible tattoo of ''a great vampire squid'' imprinted on its image by Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone. 
 Former Bush propagandists will never lack for work in this climate. It's remarkable how often apologists for Wall Street's self-inflicted calamity mirror the apologists for Washington's self-inflicted calamity of Iraq. In the case of that catastrophic war, its perpetrators and enablers almost always give the same alibi: ''Everyone'' was misled by the same ''bad intelligence'' about Saddam Hussein's W.M.D. Hence, no one is to blame and no one could have prevented the rush to war. 
 That, of course, is no more true than Greenspan's claim that ''everyone'' was ignorant of the potentially catastrophic dangers in the securitization of subprime mortgages. There were dissenters in the press, intelligence agencies and Congress who did doubt the W.M.D. evidence and asked tough questions akin to those asked by financial apostates like Michael Burry during the housing bubble. But these dissenting voices were either ignored, ridiculed or censored in the feverish rally to war just as voices like Burry's were marginalized in the feverish rally of the Dow.
 In the crash's aftermath, those who created, sold and hyped mortgage-backed securities and exotic derivatives (''financial weapons of mass destruction,'' as Warren Buffett called them) are just as eager to escape accountability as those who peddled Saddam's nonexistent nukes. In an appearance at the 92nd Street Y in New York last month, the former Citigroup guru Robert Rubin floated the same talking points as Greenspan. He described Wall Street's meltdown as ''a crisis that virtually nobody saw coming,'' citing regulators, auditors, analysts and commentators. It seems they were all the passive dupes of AAA ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's on toxic subprime assets, just as all those Iraq cheerleaders were innocently victimized by the bad C.I.A. intelligence on Saddam's assets.
 No top player in the Bush administration has taken responsibility for his or her role in selling faulty intelligence products without exerting proper due diligence. There have been few unequivocal mea culpas from those who failed in their oversight roles during the housing bubble either -- whether Greenspan, the Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson or Timothy Geithner in his pre-Obama incarnation leading the New York Fed. 
 In his own testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission last week, Rubin took no responsibility for his record, as Clinton Treasury secretary, in opening the floodgates of deregulation that would fatten his wallet in his post-Washington migration to Citigroup. Nor did he own up to his role as a proselytizer for increased risk at that mammoth bank, where the bad bets would ultimately require a $45 billion taxpayers' bailout. Rubin maintains that he had no significant operational responsibility as chairman of Citigroup's executive committee -- a role that paid him well over $100 million while there. But as Roger Lowenstein writes in his new book, ''The End of Wall Street,'' Rubin's responsibilities did include writing a letter to shareholders in early 2007 for the Citigroup annual report. In sharp contrast to Jamie Dimon's contemporaneous letter to shareholders at JPMorgan Chase -- which darkly confronted potential ''negative scenarios'' from ''recent industry excesses'' -- Rubin glossed over any gathering clouds. 
 Last week Rubin testified he ''deeply'' regretted what happened, but his invocation of collective guilt -- ''we all bear responsibility'' -- deflected any accounting for his own individual actions. Even Blagojevich did better than this in his new role as a contestant on the reality show ''Celebrity Apprentice.'' When Donald Trump ''fired'' him a week ago, the former Illinois governor at last said, ''I take full responsibility.''
 Surveying America's moral landscape in his Inaugural Address, Barack Obama called for ''a new era of responsibility.'' And he has tried to live up to his own creed. ''I'm here on television saying I screwed up and that's part of the era of responsibility,'' he said after Tom Daschle withdrew as a cabinet nominee. The president has also taken responsibility for screw-ups ranging from his administration's tardy discovery of bonuses given to bailed-out bankers at A.I.G. to its failed surveillance of the Christmas Day bomber. Though the president is never shy about attributing a $1.3 trillion annual deficit to his predecessor, he is usually quick to hold himself accountable as well for the $787 billion in deficit spending added by his stimulus package.
 Obama has been less forceful in stewarding a new era of responsibility when it comes to adjudicating unresolved misdeeds in the previous White House. ''Turn the page'' is his style, even if at times to a fault. Many of the Bush national security transgressions, including the manipulation of the case for war, are rapidly receding into history and America's great memory hole.
 The president will not have the luxury of mass amnesia when it comes to the recent economic past. The tax-free Iraq war, as cunningly conceived by the Bush White House, directly affected only those American families whose sons and daughters volunteered to fight it. But the Great Recession has affected nearly everyone. Most of its victims are genuinely innocent bystanders who lost their jobs and savings while financial elites cashed in on the crash. 
 Both as policy and politics, a serious reckoning for those who gamed the system is a win-win. Yet the fear that the Obama administration is protecting its friends persists. On the same morning that Rubin testified last week, Eamon Javers of Politico wrote about his continued influence on his many acolytes in the White House. That includes Geithner, whom Rubin talked with repeatedly in the weeks before the president released his financial regulatory reform proposal last June.
 Americans still waiting on Main Street for the recovery that lifted Wall Street once invested their hopes in Obama. Getting the new era of responsibility only 70 percent right won't do.

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Robilotti, Rit Aggarwala

 BODY:
Dr. Elizabeth Victoria Robilotti and Rohit Thomas Aggarwala were married Saturday at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. The Rev. David P. Dwyer, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. 
 Dr. Robilotti, 32, is keeping her name. She is a third-year resident in internal medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, and is to begin a fellowship in infectious diseases at Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., in June. She graduated cum laude from Columbia, from which she also received master's degrees in history and public health. She received a medical degree at New York Medical College.
 She is the daughter of Martha B. Robilotti and Gerard D. Robilotti of Newtown, Conn. The bride's father retired as executive vice president of Danbury Health Systems, the holding company of Danbury Hospital, from which the bride's mother retired as an internal auditor. He is on the board of New York Medical College. Her mother is now an agent in the Danbury office of William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty, and president of the Cyrenius H. Booth Library in Newtown. 
 Mr. Aggarwala, 38, known as Rit, is the director of long-term planning and sustainability in the office of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He oversees plans for the city's infrastructure and environment. He is also Mr. Bloomberg's chief adviser on environmental policy. He recently announced plans to step down from those positions in June, and will join Dr. Robilotti in California.
 The bridegroom is a trustee of St. Stephen's School, a private high school in Rome. He graduated from Columbia, from which he also received an M.B.A. and a Ph.D. in history. He received a master's in history from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. 
 He is a son of Jean Horrigan Aggarwala and Narinder K. Aggarwala of White Plains. His mother retired as a teacher of English as a Second Language at Rye Neck Middle School and Rye Neck High School, both in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Until last December, she taught at the English Language Institute at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. 
 His father retired as a senior project management officer at the United Nations Development Program in New York. He supervised economic development projects in Afghanistan and Somalia.
 Though the couple spent many years on the Columbia campus, they did not meet until 2002, when they were both on the board of the Columbia College Alumni Association.

HEADLINE: Giannoulias Campaign Trying to Control Message

BYLINE: By DANIEL LIBIT

 BODY:
Alexi Giannoulias's campaign for the United States Senate has something rare in politics: advance notice that a disaster is about to strike, and time to prepare for it. The fate of Mr. Giannoulias's candidacy may hang on how his campaign handles the challenge.
 Federal bank regulators have set an April 24 deadline by which Broadway Bank -- his family business turned political millstone -- must raise $85 million in new capital or risk liquidation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Inside Mr. Giannoulias's political headquarters on LaSalle Street downtown, surrounded by the sturdy edifices of major banks, the staff looks at April 24 as the deadline in their effort to seize control of a narrative that endangers Mr. Giannoulias's bid for national office.
 The campaign has conducted focus-group studies to look at advertisements designed to inoculate Mr. Giannoulias, a 34-year-old Democrat, against the political fallout if the bank collapses, and has discussed the possibility of an emotive speech by him to clear the decks. 
 Grappling with Broadway Bank as a factor in the campaign has been nothing short of ''surreal,'' said Eric Adelstein, Mr. Giannoulias's chief media consultant. Not only does the bank face an all-but-certain collapse, the candidate's conduct while working at Broadway has come into question, from recent disclosures in The Chicago Tribune about the bank's loans to felons and an article by the Chicago News Cooperative about its push into aggressive lending that paved the way for the bank's current troubles. 
 Campaign staff members still regard the issue as manageable. They view the coming days as a chance to change the focus of the campaign. 
 ''We'll take on the bank now,'' said Kathleen Strand, the campaign's communications director.
 Then, addressing Mr. Giannoulias's Republican opponent, Representative Mark Steven Kirk, Ms. Strand added: ''We're on the way to this happening, where people are going to say: 'What are you about, Mark Kirk? What are you going to bring to the table in the United States Senate?' '' 
 The effort to reshape the campaign has started with a push to explore ways that Mr. Giannoulias might burnish his image if Broadway Bank collapses. In mid-March, the campaign conducted 12 hours of focus groups -- six groups of swing voters, over three days, at sites both in suburban Chicago and downstate -- testing the impact of the bank's troubles on voters' views of the candidate. 
 In an edited video clip of the focus groups that was shown to the Chicago News Cooperative, a moderator asked participants about their impressions of Broadway Bank as it related to Mr. Giannoulias. The strong majority of the people who saw the video played down the relevance of the issue.
 ''This is where I think there is a little bit of a disconnect between all the geniuses and the voters,'' Mr. Adelstein said. 
 As part of the planning for the focus groups, Mr. Adelstein made a test campaign commercial in which Mr. Giannoulias stares into the camera lens and tries to relate the plight of his family's bank to the larger context of the country's economic struggles. 
 While the campaign has decided not to take to the air with that kind of ad yet, ''the key take-away from that is we are ready, we have our plan,'' Ms. Strand said.
 The campaign is also giving serious consideration to a speech Mr. Giannoulias could deliver about the bank, taking the cue from Barack Obama's Philadelphia speech two years ago in which Mr. Obama, then a presidential candidate, addressed the incendiary remarks on race by his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. Mr. Giannoulias's advisers indicate they would use such a speech only if needed, and only if they thought it would resolve the bank issue in the campaign.
 Some outsiders think that tactic would be risky.
 ''It has to put the period to this issue,'' said Delmarie Cobb, a Democratic strategist who was hired to do damage control for Senator Roland W. Burris last year. ''If there are still more questions left after the speech than were answered, if new questions emerge, you're in trouble.''
 The campaign has tried to avoid raising the bank issue since a March 3 news media blitz in which Mr. Giannoulias sought to address questions about his role at Broadway Bank. And it has tried to take control of the message war in recent weeks by hammering Mr. Kirk over a statement he made at a Republican dinner, his pledge to ''lead the effort'' to repeal the recent health care overhaul legislation if elected to the Senate.
 But the effort to change the subject ran aground when an April 2 article in the Tribune reported that the bank had lent $20 million to two crime figures involved in illegal gambling and prostitution.
 ''Take that story out of the picture, we have had a pretty good couple of weeks in the press mostly built around the health care angle,'' said Mike Rendina, Mr. Giannoulias's campaign manager who assumed his duties on March 1 after running the failed gubernatorial primary bid of Dan Hynes, the Illinois comptroller.
 ''It wasn't like we were quiet for two weeks and then the story hit again,'' Mr. Rendina continued. ''There has been a real back-and-forth on other issues that we think is eventually where things are going to end up. But we'll see what happens.''
 Campaign officials know they do not have much time. Even after the Broadway Bank deadline passes, the expected start of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich's trial in June will again highlight the topic of political corruption in Illinois's Democratic establishment. 
 With all this in mind, the campaign has put considerable heft behind its communications operation. Ms. Strand had previously done opposition research on Mr. Kirk for the Chicago arm of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. Besides Mr. Adelstein, a well-regarded political media consultant, other advisers include Pete Giangreco of the Chicago-based firm The Strategy Group, who served as Mr. Obama's top direct-mail consultant during the 2008 presidential primaries.
 But the campaign's budding effort to depict Mr. Giannoulias as just another small-business person caught up in the economic downturn will most likely face unrelenting attack from Republicans.
 ''It's difficult to see how in the wake of the Blagojevich scandal and the corruption we've seen from the Democrats' Chicago political machine, voters would elect the first mob banker to the U.S. Senate,'' said Brian Walsh, communications director for the National Republican Senate Committee. ''Giannoulias's questionable lending practices and association with unsavory underworld figures will be central to this campaign because they go directly to the questions of judgment and leadership.'' 
 Even Democratic stalwarts in Chicago doubt that Mr. Giannoulias's handlers can make the Broadway Bank issue go away.
 ''If the bank fails, there is no way the issue can be put to rest,'' said Dan Rose, a veteran Democratic political consultant. ''It will live on perennially in commercials and on the Internet as long as the opponent wishes.'' 
 The campaign workers still believe, however, that they can succeed by comparing the bank's troubles to those of many other struggling family businesses. 
 ''Here is a family business,'' Mr. Adelstein said of Broadway Bank, adding that members of Mr. Giannoulias's campaign staff are experiencing the pressures a business is going through. He said that even though they are not at the bank, ''We sort of feel it,'' he said. ''It is pretty tangible. It is not an abstraction.'' Ms. Strand thinks the attention of voters and candidates soon will turn elsewhere.
 ''This is President Obama's Senate seat,'' she said, ''so we're going to be dealing with what we'd all expect in a local and statewide level, but we're also going to be dealing with national attention. We already are.''

HEADLINE: Look at Assessor Race. Isn't Democracy Grand?

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
Joe Berrios is two-legged evidence that the greatest outrages in politics tend to involve what's absolutely legal. 
 This enduring truth suggests why the Chicago electorate, having set a record in the Feb. 2 primary for its worst turnout, might actually be roused to vote in the November election for the confounding, mystery-shrouded post of Cook County assessor.
Mr. Berrios is a former state representative and a multitasking phenomenon worthy of a course at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy Studies. He's the Cook County Democratic chairman, a lobbyist for the Illinois Coin Machine Operators Association and Illinois Licensed Beverage Association and the longest-serving member of the important, anonymous, incestuous Cook County Board of Review. 
 Like the assessor's office, which sets our property tax rates, the board is so enveloped in complexity that its inscrutability ensures a lack of accountability. The chance that any local journalist has covered one of its meetings is about the same as his covering the august South Cook County Mosquito Abatement District. 
 But the board is critical to corporate Chicago and the lucrative commercial real-estate tax appeals practices of certain law firms, including that of Michael Madigan, speaker of the Illinois House. It's where you appeal the assessor's decisions. 
 It's partly why Mr. Berrios and Mr. Madigan are worthy of a Discovery Channel special: the first pair of Hispanic-Irish conjoined twins attached at the checkbook. Mr. Berrios lobbies Mr. Madigan on legislation, while Mr. Madigan appeals to Mr. Berrios for tax relief for clients -- saving them many millions of dollars. 
 The two men can make political donations to each other, just like litigants before the board can contribute to Mr. Berrios's campaigns and Springfield lobbyists can enrich Mr. Madigan. And the duo can plot in political tandem since Mr. Madigan runs the state Democratic Party while Mr. Berrios runs the county party apparatus. 
 Isn't democracy grand? Mr. Berrios spent part of his youth living in the awful, defunct Cabrini-Green housing project. He's now a Horatio Alger hero, Chicago-style, faithful servant of coin operators, Anheuser-Busch and high-rise developers avoiding a fair share of taxes.
 Mr. Berrios won the Democratic primary for assessor but is aghast that Forrest Claypool has announced an independent candidacy. Mr. Claypool is the reform-minded Democratic Cook County commissioner who served Mayor Richard M. Daley (twice) as chief of staff -- as have enough others to fill the United Center -- and head of the Park District. 
 He's also close to two Chicagoans working in the White House, namely President Obama and David Axelrod. He might be County Board president now if then-Senator Obama hadn't been too coy by half and waited until the day before the 2006 primary to back him. 
 Mr. Berrios says that Mr. Claypool should have run in the primary and that to the victor goes the spoils. Such a rationale did not prevail when party honchos showed the exit to Scott Lee Cohen, the pawnbroker who won the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor. 
 Mr. Claypool needs 25,000 valid signatures by June 21 to get on the ballot, then a lot of free publicity and some luck. As important as the assessor's post is, it's not one to galvanize voters, especially in a year when an awful economy, high unemployment and the imminent trial of an impeached Democratic governor are all there to suppress interest. 
 So he'll have to educate us and get our apathetic selves to the polls. He needs to explain how the system is broken; why the assessed values of our homes seem to bear little link to their market value; how the heck the infamous ''multiplier'' works in calculating values, and why good intentions won't be undermined by the review board. 
 Representative Mike Quigley, an ally of Mr. Claypool, cites the ''bully pulpit'' aspect of the job, including pressing for change, like putting online the results, justifications and attorneys of record for all appeals. 
 But I'd also love to know why assessor is even an elected position. ''Good question,'' Mr. Claypool said. He then argued that the post is so influential, and can do such damage in the wrong hands, there needs to be political accountability. 
 Cross your fingers and hope for a re-invention. Just imagine somebody pressing to eliminate donations to review board members by the people who practice before it. 
 That's probably do-gooder dreaming. It's more realistic to hope that if Mr. Berrios does win, he'll at least invite us all over to headquarters for free licensed beverages and video poker.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Detours Into Reality Tourism

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Visitors know all too well this pretty city's sights, what with the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf and the clang-clang-clangy cable cars. 
 But now San Francisco's civic boosters have decided they want to add a highly unlikely stop to the tourist itinerary: the Uptown Tenderloin, the ragged, druggy and determinedly dingy domain of the city's most down and out. 
 And what is the appeal?
 ''We offer a kind of grittiness you can't find much anymore,'' said Randy Shaw, a longtime San Francisco housing advocate and a driving force behind the idea of Tenderloin tourism. ''And what is grittier than the Tenderloin?'' 
 Indeed, after years of neglect and bitter battles over its gentrification, the Tenderloin remains one of the most stubborn challenges in San Francisco, a city that prides itself on its looks, its way of life and its bold solutions to social ills, whether they involve offering universal health care (the city was the first to do so) or banning plastic bags (ditto).
 So it is that armed with a recent listing on the National Register of Historic Places, community and city leaders are readying the Tenderloin for its big moment, complete with plans for a new museum, an arts district and walking tours of ''the world's largest collection of historic single-room occupancy hotels.'' And unlike, say, the Tenement Museum in New York, which offers tours of a long-unused Lower East Side apartment building, a trip to the Tenderloin could go a step further.
 ''We can bring people into an SRO and show them where people are living now,'' Mr. Shaw said, referring to the single-room occupancy dwellings, or residential hotels, in the area. ''And that's a real plus.'' 
 Mr. Shaw's plan has the backing of Mayor Gavin Newsom, who announced a city grant last month to help promote ''a positive identity for the Tenderloin'' and to draw tourism to the area, in part by posting hundreds of plaques on buildings throughout the neighborhood ''to create great visual interest for those walking down the community's streets.'' 
 And oh, what streets those are. Wedged between tourist-friendly Union Square and its liberal-friendly City Hall, the Tenderloin is one of the mostly densely populated areas west of the Mississippi, officials say, with some 30,000 people in 60 square blocks, almost all of which have at least one residential hotel. The district's drug trade is so widespread, and so wide open, that the police recently asked for special powers to disperse crowds on certain streets. Deranged residents are a constant presence, and after dark the neighborhood can seem downright sinister, with drunken people collapsed on streets and others furtively smoking pipes in doorways. 
 All of which, Tenderloin fans contend, is as much a part of San Francisco as flashier, decidedly less seedy attractions like Chinatown or Coit Tower. 
 ''I think a lot of San Franciscans appreciate the Tenderloin,'' said Don S. Falk, the executive director of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that has renovated and operates 15 residential hotels in the Tenderloin. ''It's part of their identity.'' 
 Encouraging adventure-seeking San Franciscans to visit may be easier than selling the Tenderloin to tourists, city tourism officials say. Laurie Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, called the recent efforts ''a step in the right direction,'' but added that it was a ''very, very long road'' to make the neighborhood appealing. 
 ''At this point in time, there aren't many reasons for visitors to go there,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ''We don't really point people away from there, but our job is to point people to things that they can do. And there's so many things to do in San Francisco.'' 
 But Mr. Shaw begs to differ, saying the area is chockablock with historical nuggets, like the Hotel Drake, where Frank Capra lived as a starving young director in the early 1920s, or the Cadillac Hotel, built a year after the great 1906 earthquake and fire and where Muhammad Ali later trained. Jerry Garcia also lived at the Cadillac, and he and the Grateful Dead recorded several albums in the area at what is now Hyde Street Studios, as did other Bay Area bands like Creedence Clearwater Revival and Jefferson Airplane.
 ''And when Miles Davis came to town,'' Mr. Shaw said, ''he played in the Tenderloin.'' 
 Mr. Shaw, who plans to open a $3 million museum in the Cadillac, believes that baby boomer music fans -- and particularly baby boomer Deadheads -- will be a core demographic for the Tenderloin, as well as those interested in the neighborhood's ''rich vice history,'' which includes gambling dens, speakeasies and pornographic-movie houses.
 ''Most of which are gone,'' the museum's brochure notes, almost sadly.
 Experts agree that the neighborhood has historical value, in part because its entrenched poverty and the city's own prohibitive zoning have prevented development.
 ''Money sometimes is the enemy of historic preservation,'' said Jay Correia, a historian with the California Office of Historic Preservation, which recommended the Tenderloin to the national register. ''The irony is because the Tenderloin was economically disadvantaged, there were no funds to modernize.''
 And while battles over maintaining low-income housing derailed some past efforts to develop the neighborhood, even Mr. Falk, of the nonprofit housing development corporation, says a little new development would not be a bad thing.
 ''In 1981, gentrification was the most important issue; in 2010, quality of life is the most important issue,'' Mr. Falk said. ''People with disposable income help local businesses be successful, and those local businesses help support homeless people.''
 In addition to tourism -- visitors spent nearly $8 billion in San Francisco in 2009 -- city officials are also trying more traditional approaches, including applying for a $250,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts for public art on the neighborhood's western border and backing a proposed 250,000-square-foot retail project on its eastern flank.
 Mr. Shaw hopes to break ground on his museum by next year and will start posting promotional placards -- inviting visitors to ''walk, dine, enjoy'' the Uptown Tenderloin -- this summer. And more plaques are to be mounted on more buildings soon.
 Whether posters and plaques are enough to conquer poverty remains to be seen. Chris Patnode, a ruddy-faced self-described wanderer who is staying in a local SRO, said he liked the idea of Tenderloin tourism and seemed to be willing to welcome outsiders. Just as long, of course, as they know when to come knocking. 
 ''In daylight, it'd be O.K.,'' said Mr. Patnode, 48. ''But people aren't going to want to come down here at night. I don't even want to be here at night. And I'm staying here.''

HEADLINE: Not Yet Athens on the Potomac

BYLINE: By ROB COX and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Greece may be enviable as the ancient cradle of democracy -- but no country wants to emulate its contemporary fiscal troubles. Markets are exacting a heavy price for Greece's budget woes. Yet it is hardly the only country that would fall into crisis if creditors lost faith. Indeed, the United States government is running a deficit of Greek proportions, although its total debt load is much less frightening.
 A spike last week in the yield on United States government debt -- the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hit 4 percent -- ignited fears over the creditworthiness of the world's largest economy. Those faded when investors piled into the next Treasury auction, pushing the 10-year yield back down to 3.88 percent by the end of the week. 
 Bond yields, and the cost of financing they imply, are an important gauge of the pressure in financial markets. Leaders of highly indebted countries need to watch them closely. But there are other signs. Herewith, a dashboard for America's financial stewards:
 CREDIT-DEFAULT SWAPS The idea that the United States would ever default on its debts used to seem absurd. But years of big deficits and the gargantuan government rescue of the financial system during the credit crisis have introduced some doubts, while the development of a lively market in sovereign-debt credit-default swaps has made it possible for investors to put money behind their views.
 America's credit-default swaps reached a record high along with the crisis in March 2009, when investors had to pay $100,000 to insure $10 million of Treasuries. The going rate has dropped to around $41,000. That pales in comparison to the amount -- more than $400,000 -- required for similar Greek protection. On this front, the United States still looks far from Greek.
 CURRENCIES When investors lose confidence in a nation, its legal tender feels the sting. Before European leaders provided a long-awaited financial rescue line to Greece on Sunday, the euro had taken a pounding, thanks to the euro zone's most troubled member. It's down about 6 percent against the dollar and against the yen since the beginning of the year. The euro's losses are clearly the dollar's gain, but the buck has also climbed 4 percent against a broader basket of currencies. On this score, too, the market is signaling that Washington is a far cry from Athens.
 STOCKS Equity markets are good rough indicators of how investors look at a country's prospects -- the productivity of its enterprises and the health of its financial system. Greece's stock market, unsurprisingly, is on the ropes. It's down 9 percent so far this year while the DAX of more creditworthy Germany is up 5 percent. The S.& P. 500 has gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year. That's a sign that investors in United States stocks aren't worried.
 OPTIONS VOLATILITY Options on stock market volatility can be an even more sensitive indicator of fear than the market itself. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which is a measure of expected swings in the S.& P. 500, is sometimes called the ''fear index.'' Right now it is exhibiting more calm than fright. On Friday it stood at around 16, below its level in August 2008. Of course, that low was followed by a huge economic and financial storm.
 Bond yields, credit-default swap spreads, currency strength, stock markets and options volatility: none of these market measures in isolation provides a significant read on the state of sovereign finances -- of the United States or any other country. Taken as a whole, though, they provide a good indication of the perceptions of the widest possible swath of investors in credit, equity, derivatives and currency markets.
 These altimeters of American financial health are not flashing red, orange or even yellow. But they are more current than leading indicators. It might not take much for sentiment to shift. Any sign that the government is not taking seriously its need to reduce the deficit, perhaps by embarking on another stimulus plan, could tip any of these.
 As Lawrence H. Summers, who heads the White House's National Economic Council, said in a speech last week, the ability of great nations ''to mobilize to solve problems before they are absolutely imminent crises is what determines their longevity.'' This market dashboard is a useful way to mark that progress.

HEADLINE: Health Care, Used and Overused

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''In Medicine, the Power of No'' (Economic Scene column, April 7):
 David Leonhardt is right about the importance of reducing the use of health care services of limited or no value. The surest way to do that is for doctors and patients to build strong, trusting relationships and, then, for doctors to talk straight to their patients about what is best for them given the state of their health and the power of available treatments. Since we go to doctors for their expertise, it is reasonable to expect that we would accept their recommendations. 
 And there is the rub. Today's insurers discourage doctors from spending enough time with patients to build those relationships. But, even when they exist, doctors are often reluctant to give ''bad news.'' And, finally, if patients don't undergo the latest treatment, doctors lose the income from it, and the hospital will lose the income from the CT scan not ordered.
 So, until these conditions change -- including the nature of the incentives -- those who say ''no'' are likely to be fairly rare.
 Stephen M. Davidson Boston, April 7, 2010
 The writer is a professor at the Boston University School of Management and the author of ''Still Broken: Understanding the U.S. Health Care System,'' being published this month.
 To the Editor:
 We must acknowledge the two elephants in the room when discussing overconsumption of medical care by Americans.
 First, Americans are insulated from the cost of their own health care by the structure of the insurance market, especially very low deductible plans. If something seems to be free, people will use more of it.
 Second, doctors practice defensive medicine, like ordering tests they know are probably unnecessary, because of potential liability and a very aggressive plaintiffs' bar. The best way to reduce unnecessary CT scans is with substantial tort reform.
 Unfortunately, neither of these two primary drivers of overuse of health care services is addressed by Obamacare, leaving liberals no place to go except to support the very rationing that the measure's opponents knew would be its necessary outcome.
 Ross Kaminsky Nederland, Colo., April 7, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Leonhardt reported that American overconsumption of health care is at fault for increasing health care costs. He defined a three-stage process to discourage unnecessary care: research into what treatments work, information for patients about treatment risks and benefits, and a reward system for better care.
 Although each step is necessary, the article skirts around the role of doctors and how their incentives ultimately drive health care costs.
 Doctors provide the means for Americans to overconsume health care. Instead of pointing the finger at Americans, we should shift health care away from fee-for-service and toward pay-for-performance and bundled payments that would discourage doctors from overprescribing treatments and tests.
 Couple that with the Medicare oversight board, and health care has a fighting chance of lowering costs.

HEADLINE: Towers at Ground Zero Might Add to Space Glut

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
As much as the twin towers of the first World Trade Center became an international symbol of New York ascendant, the 232 acres inside the buildings undercut private landlords with cheap, subsidized space, took a decade to attract significant nongovernment tenants and were not financially successful until the 1990s.
 The tentative agreement struck last month by ground zero's owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, with the developer Larry A. Silverstein has some urban planners and real estate executives wondering whether New York is destined to repeat the past. 
 The agreement negotiated by Christopher O. Ward, the authority's executive director, seeks to avoid oversaturating the market by providing for the construction of towers in phases. 
 Still, the development of Mr. Silverstein's three towers will require huge subsidies, tax breaks and government tenancies at a time when analysts are predicting that the downtown commercial vacancy rate could climb to a very unhealthy 18 percent by 2013. That is the year the first Silverstein tower and One World Trade Center, which the Port Authority is building, are scheduled to open. It could be ''deja vu all over again,'' said Robert L. Freedman, executive chairman of FirstService Williams Commercial Real Estate. 
 At the same time, some planners, brokers and downtown advocates say that with Lower Manhattan evolving into a lively residential and commercial community, the district will need buildings with a mix of retail, apartments, hotels and offices, rather than the huge office towers planned for the trade center. Those towers, they say, are better suited for financial firms than for the kinds of companies now moving downtown.
 ''The growth in the city's economy has come from small and mid-sized firms,'' said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent planning group. ''And the companies that have moved downtown in recent years tend to be smaller: business services, design, legal and engineering firms.
 Federal agencies, state government and a single private tenant, Vantone, a Chinese real estate company, are expected to lease almost half of One World Trade Center, the $3 billion, 1,776-foot-tall building formerly known as the Freedom Tower.
 Under pressure from the city and the speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, the authority agreed in principle to $1 billion in financing for the first of Mr. Silverstein's towers, a building of 2.3 million square feet. The developer will also use tax-free bonds and insurance money. But so far, the only tenants are the authority and city agencies, for a combined 1.2 million square feet. 
 If Mr. Silverstein can raise $300 million and lease 400,000 square feet to corporate tenants, then the city, the state and the authority will provide up to $600 million in financial support for his second tower, which will be 2.5 million square feet. His third tower will wait until there is enough demand to justify construction.
 The subsidies from the authority are about one-third to one-half of what Mr. Silverstein, who leased the complex from the authority six weeks before it was destroyed, originally sought. But the buildings would also be eligible for millions of dollars a year in rent rebates and reductions in commercial rent tax, which were quietly extended by the State Legislature last month. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg embraced the tentative agreement last month, saying it would accelerate the redevelopment of the downtown area. He noted that in the past five years, ''More than 200 firms in a wide range of industries have relocated to Lower Manhattan, taking 4.4 million square feet of space.'' 
 But the mayor's numbers also indicate that the average lease was 22,000 square feet, a size more representative of small businesses than a 500,000-square-foot block of space that might be rented by a corporation or financial institution. 
 On paper, the commercial market downtown looks better than nearly every other central business district in the country. But real estate brokers report that rents are still falling, because of the expectation that large blocks of vacant space will be coming on the market. Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation will vacate about 600,000 square feet in 2012 at 55 Water Street, and Goldman Sachs is already leaving 85 Broad Street and One New York Plaza, moving to a new headquarters across West Street from the trade center. AIG, the insurance giant, and Merrill Lynch are shrinking. 
 Even Mr. Silverstein's tower at 7 World Trade Center, which opened in 2006, is still 20 percent vacant. 
 Combined with the new towers, the brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle estimates that the vacancy rate for first-class space could hit 18 percent by 2018.
 ''Somebody's going to get crushed in the interim,'' said Barry M. Gosin, chief executive of another brokerage, Newmark Knight Frank. ''The downtown market would be better served by having mixed-use buildings with a hotel, retail and a modicum of commercial space to support a 24/7 neighborhood. That would be far more attractive for new residents and workers.''
 The Port Authority dedicated the original trade center, a 10-million-square-foot office complex, on April 4, 1973, in a heavy downpour that seemed only to emphasize that the city was in the grip of the worst downturn since the Depression. The stated purpose of the trade center was to provide a single home for international commerce, but it came at the very moment the shipping industry was in its death throes. 
 Private landlords complained bitterly that the trade center, with its cheap space and low taxes, was undercutting their ability to attract tenants. Still, the complex was plagued by a high vacancy rate, and its biggest tenant was government: The authority, the United States Customs Service and more than 40 state agencies accounted for over 3.3 million square feet. 
 The trade center did not overcome its stigma as a government complex until 1985, when the authority signed a lease with its first major financial tenant, Dean Witter Financial Services, for 24 floors, at $31 per square foot, which was three times the rent paid by state agencies. 
 ''It was a breakthrough,'' said Bertram F. French, vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield, who represented Dean Witter. The authority, he said, paid a price to get the firm, taking over Dean Witter's leases scattered at buildings across the city. ''Most developers wouldn't assume that kind of risk,'' he said.
 But occupancy fluctuated wildly at the trade center until the late 1990s, when corporations fleeing high Midtown rents moved to the trade center. 
 After the attack on the trade center, in December 2002, Mr. Bloomberg outlined his vision for downtown and warned against rushing to replace the 10 million square feet of office space. ''If we are honest with ourselves, we will recognize that the impact on our city was not all positive,'' he said of the trade center. ''The twin towers' voracious appetite for tenants weakened the entire downtown market.'' 
 Increasingly after 2006, however, Mr. Bloomberg argued in favor of completing construction at the trade center as quickly as possible. The mayor backed Mr. Silverstein's effort to get the Port Authority to finance his towers after the developer was unable to get tenants or financing for the projects. Reluctant to finance speculative office space again, the authority agreed to limit its subsidies and impose a number of conditions on construction.
 ''How can you build a building when there's no demand?'' said Donald Schnabel, a downtown broker who retired in January after 47 years in the business. ''I'm not convinced that downtown can absorb all the space.''

HEADLINE: A Priest's Accuser: Tickling, at First, Then a Descent Into Sexual Abuse

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and KATIE ZEZIMA; Jesse McKinley reported from Oakland, Calif., and Katie Zezima from East Longmeadow, Mass.

 BODY:
OAKLAND, Calif. -- A San Francisco woman who says she was molested by the Oakland priest at the center of a case that has raised questions about Pope Benedict XVI's handling of sexually abusive clergy members described in vivid terms on Sunday how she was sexually abused and intimidated by her attacker.
 The woman, Melinda Costello, said she had been abused for several years, beginning at age 7, as a parishioner in nearby Fremont, Calif., where the Rev. Stephen Kiesle was working at a church as a seminarian in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
 Ms. Costello, now 48 and on disability because of arthritis, says that Mr. Kiesle -- who was ordained as a priest in 1972 -- first playfully invited her to sit on his lap, part of a youthful demeanor that he fostered, she said, including wearing purple tennis shoes in church. 
 ''He was considered to be the Pied Piper,'' Ms. Costello recalled in an interview. ''He was a kid. And who doesn't like a big kid?''
 But Ms. Costello says Father Kiesle's touching and tickling soon progressed to fondling her chest and genitals. ''He told me the devil was inside me,'' she said, adding that the priest sometimes cast his actions as an exorcism. ''I always knew that I was uncomfortable and that it wasn't right.''
 Her account came on the same day a priest in Massachusetts used his sermon to condemn the church's handling of the broader sexual abuse scandal, describing some in the clergy as ''felons'' and suggesting that Benedict resign.
 ''We must personally and collectively declare that we very much doubt the veracity of the pope and those of church authority who are defending him or even falling on the sword on his behalf,'' said the priest, the Rev. James J. Scahill of St. Michael's Parish in East Longmeadow.
 ''It is beginning to become evident that for decades, if not centuries, church leadership covered up the abuse of children and minors to protect its institutional image and the image of priesthood.''
 Nearly a decade after the abuse described by Ms. Costello, Father Kiesle was convicted in 1978 of tying up and molesting two boys in another California church rectory. But he was not defrocked until 1987 -- despite concerns voiced to the Vatican over several years by Bishop John S. Cummins of Oakland.
 Mr. Kiesle, who could not be reached for comment, served three years of probation for his 1978 conviction and underwent treatment. In 2004, he was convicted of a second sex offense -- molesting a girl in 1995 in Truckee, Calif. -- and sentenced to six years in prison.
 He now lives in Walnut Creek, Calif., where he is registered as a sex offender. 
 Questions about the slow pace by which Father Kiesle was removed from the clergy have intensified since it was learned that Benedict -- then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and a top Vatican official -- had signed a 1985 letter telling Bishop Cummins that Father Kiesle's case needed more time and that the ''good of the universal church'' should be considered in coming to a decision.
 A Vatican lawyer has defended the church's handling of Father Kiesle's case, saying that it had acted ''expeditiously'' by its own standards and that the onus was on Bishop Cummins to make sure the priest did not abuse again.
 The handling of the sexual abuse problems by the church -- and the future pope -- has caused deep rifts.
 From his pulpit on Sunday, Father Scahill, a vociferous and frequent critic of the church's handling of the sexual abuse crisis, delivered a scathing sermon in which he said, ''There surely is solid ground here for severe doubt'' about what the Vatican says it knew about the sexual abuse.
 ''And if by any slimmest of chance the pope and all his bishops didn't know -- they all should resign on the basis of sheer and complete ignorance, incompetence and irresponsibility,'' Father Scahill said.
 For the last eight years, Father Scahill, 63, has criticized how the church and the Diocese of Springfield, where his church is located, have handled the sexual abuse crisis. His criticism began, he said in an interview after his sermon, after parishioners came to him in 2002, distraught about the crisis that was shaking the Archdiocese of Boston and the Diocese of Springfield.
 ''They said something has to be done, shepherd our concerns,'' Father Scahill said. ''That's what priests are supposed to do, be a shepherd.
 Mark Dupont, a spokesman for the diocese, said Father Scahill's comments ''don't reflect the Diocese of Springfield or the priests of this diocese or the bishop.'' He said, ''We think the comments are unfortunate and an unfortunate use of the pulpit.'' 
 Other reaction to the sermon was mixed. One parishioner stood up and yelled ''heretic'' during one reading of the sermon, Father Scahill recalled, and said he supported the pope. But others praised the priest.
 ''I think it's very brave,'' said Jean Montana, 82, who greeted Father Scahill after the 10 a.m. Mass, where he received a standing ovation. ''You have to give him a lot of credit.'' 
 She added: ''I agree with him. I totally agree that something has to be done.'' 
 In Oakland, the diocese has confronted sexual abuse scandals in the past. On the grounds of the Cathedral of Christ the Light, where Ms. Costello spoke with reporters on Sunday, there is a small ''healing garden'' devoted to victims of such crimes. ''We remember, and we affirm,'' reads a plaque in the garden, which contains a shattered heart-shaped stone. ''Never again.''
 Mike Brown, a spokesman for the diocese, said Father Kiesle was removed from active ministry in 1978. 
 ''For all purposes, his life in the diocese was over,'' Mr. Brown said, adding that his continued membership in the priesthood from 1978 to 1987 had been mischaracterized. ''It's been implied that the diocese just let him roam about as an employee, but that's not the case.''
 Mr. Brown said, however, that the diocese would be examining records this week to determine what role -- if any -- Father Kiesle might have had in church activities during that period. 
 At the cathedral on Sunday, Hector Rivera, an unemployed construction worker attending services, said he was frustrated by the continued reports of pedophilic priests. ''They work for God,'' Mr. Rivera said, his 4-year-old son standing beside him. ''They shouldn't be doing it.'' 
 Mary Barnes, a nurse from Berkeley, said she believed Benedict should step down because he failed to lead in a time of crisis. ''To have the highest levels of our church giving out excuses for not protecting our children is unforgivable,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''It's the farthest thing imaginable from the message of Jesus.'' 
 For Ms. Costello, who settled a civil suit with the church several years ago, it took years to come to grips with her abuse, she said. No longer a Catholic, she said she could not even tell anyone about the attacks until she was safely into her adulthood.
 ''I was terrified,'' she said. ''He was God.''

HEADLINE: Rift in Family as the Whitney Plans a 2nd Home

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL and KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
When the cosmetics heir Leonard A. Lauder gave $131 million to the Whitney Museum of American Art two years ago, it was the biggest donation in the institution's history, and it came with one important stipulation: The Whitney could not sell its popular but cramped home on Madison Avenue in the foreseeable future. 
 Now an expansion plan that involves building a second museum downtown has opened a rift on the museum's 45-member board, which includes some of the wealthiest art patrons in New York.
 On one side is the majority that favors the construction project, saying it is integral to the future of a renowned museum with a world-class collection of American art by the likes of Edward Hopper and Alexander Calder. On the other side is a handful of longtime members, including Mr. Lauder, the chairman emeritus, who view the plan as a vanity project the Whitney can ill afford. Also at stake is the fate of the signature building on the Upper East Side, designed by Marcel Breuer and synonymous with the Whitney since it opened, in 1966. 
 The institution has been grappling with space problems for decades. When it moved to its current home, it had 2,000 works in its collection. That has since mushroomed to about 18,000, but there is only enough space to show some 150 at a time. As the collection continues to grow, many larger works have never been displayed because there simply isn't the room.
 Since the 1980s the institution has tried to expand its landmark building, hiring star architects like Michael Graves, Rem Koolhaas and Renzo Piano to design additions. But each time the effort was abandoned, either because of the cost or the design or both. 
 Now board leaders insist they are going forward. ''This isn't just the Whitney dreaming again,'' said Brooke Garber Neidich, co-chairwoman of the board. When asked about the reality of running two museums, she said: ''There is a chance we can run two locations. It's just down to money.'' 
 Not everyone is so sure. Although Mr. Lauder declined to be interviewed, people close to him have described his opposition. His is a key voice because as the Whitney's biggest benefactor, he has given tens of millions of dollars in postwar American art in addition to multimillion-dollar cash gifts.
 And Gilbert C. Maurer, a longtime board member and former president said: ''This is like the politicians who love to build bridges but hate to paint them. I'm not as involved as I once was, but I think that like all institutions in this economy, it's probably possible to build a building. The challenge is how are you going to operate it. And that's worrisome.'' 
 When the board meets next month, several issues may be thrashed out: Does it have the funds to operate both sites? Should it abandon the uptown building? Can it come up with a compromise between the two?
 Ms. Neidich said the Whitney could afford it. ''The museum has been in the black for years,'' she said. ''We are prudent fiscal guardians. The fact that we were able to raise more than half the money at this moment in time says something.'' 
 The institution has quietly been gathering financial support for the $680 million project, which would involve a new 185,000-square-foot building on a city-owned site at Washington and Gansevoort Streets in the meatpacking district. Whitney officials say they have promises and signed pledges totaling $371 million and expect to have $105 million more from the sale of adjacent brownstones and its annex building uptown. 
 But the Whitney's endowment is just $190 million, and a big question is whether the museum can afford to operate two sites. Officials there declined to say what it estimates running the new building will cost other than to note that $230 million of the $680 million is designated for the endowment. The museum said that like many nonprofit institutions, it limits its use of the endowment for operating expenses to 5 percent of the interest generated in a year. 
 Experts say it is hard to see how the museum could keep up two sites. Elizabeth Ellis, a principal in AEA Consulting, which often advises museums on operating costs for new or expanded spaces, said the Whitney currently has operating expenses of roughly $315 per square foot. ''It's probably safe to assume that they could realize some economies of scale with this new facility,'' Ms. Ellis said in an e-mail message, but added that it was hard to imagine less than $200 to $225 per square foot. That would imply combined yearly operating expenses of at least $60 million, a substantial increase from the Whitney's expenses of $36 million in the 2008 fiscal year.
 Yet Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney's director, said the downtown site was necessary if the institution wanted to stay relevant. ''It became apparent that to try to expand uptown meant building vertically or ruin the integrity of the Breuer building,'' he said. ''And vertical museums don't work because in order to show the kind of art being made today, we need large open spaces.'' 
 The Whitney could find no building to renovate that was large enough to meet its needs. Mr. Piano's design for the new Whitney would give the institution a six-floor space more than twice the size of its Madison Avenue home. 
 As for the uptown building, according to Mr. Lauder's stipulation, it cannot be sold -- and Mr. Weinberg and several trustees say they have no intention of doing so. But board members won't say how long they are required to keep it; under their agreement with Mr. Lauder, the number of years cannot be disclosed. 
 The museum has, however, reached out to other cultural organizations, including the International Center for Photography, the Dia Art Foundation and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, about potential partnerships with the Whitney in which they might share costs and collaborate on exhibitions. 
 Flora Miller Biddle, a longtime board member and a granddaughter of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who opened the museum, said of the uptown building, ''I imagine it will remain very much a part of the Whitney.'' 
 Last year, the Whitney signed a contract with the city's Economic Development Corporation to buy the city-owned site, at the entrance to the High Line, the abandoned elevated railway line that has recently been transformed into a park. The museum would pay $18 million, about half the appraised value of the property. It has until 2013 to close on the purchase and until 2014 to begin construction. The Whitney has been making nonrefundable monthly payments of $50,000, credited toward the purchase price, to continue until the closing date, which has yet to be determined. 
 The city has allocated $55 million toward the downtown building and remains upbeat. ''We continue to actively work with them,'' said Kate D. Levin, the commissioner of cultural affairs, adding, ''I understand they may decide to close on the property and break ground substantially sooner.'' 
 Since Mr. Piano first showed Mr. Weinberg and the trustees his design, he has streamlined it to cut costs. Originally there were angled walls, but those have since been straightened, which is cheaper, Mr. Weinberg said. And two planned basements to accommodate climate-control systems have been reduced to one, with some of this equipment being moved to the roof. 
 ''It may be the first green museum in New York,'' Mr. Weinberg said. 
 Even with a more modest design some board members worry, citing the $41 million American Center in Paris, designed by Frank Gehry, as a cautionary tale. Just four years after it opened in 1992 the institution, devoted to the promotion of American culture, was forced to close because it could not afford the $6 million annual operating costs. Mr. Weinberg was its artistic director.
 ''The two are not comparable,'' Mr. Weinberg said. ''The American Center had no track record of fund-raising and tried to do too much in too short a period of time. The Whitney has been raising a vast amount of money and is a fiscally sound institution.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Whitney Museum of American Art, using information from a publicist for the Whitney, misstated the museum's policy on endowment spending. The museum restricts the use of its endowment fund to cover yearly operating expenses to 5 percent of the fund's value, not 5 percent of the interest income generated by the fund.

HEADLINE: Merger of Energy Producers To Form $3 Billion Company

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The power companies Mirant and RRI Energy said on Sunday that they had agreed to an all-stock merger, creating a $3.1 billion independent electricity producer.
 The new company will be called GenOn Energy and will be based in Houston, RRI's hometown. GenOn will have a combined generating capacity of nearly 24,700 megawatts, stretching across the Northeast, the mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, the Midwest and California. Both companies are wholesale power producers and do not sell directly to retail consumers. 
 Mirant's chairman and chief executive, Edward R. Muller, will hold those titles in the combined company. He is to retire in 2013 and will be succeeded by Mark M. Jacobs, RRI's chief executive. GenOn's board will have five directors each from Mirant and RRI.
 ''From the beginning of our discussions, we always focused on a true merger of equals,'' Mr. Muller said on Sunday in an interview.
 In recent years, power companies have sought out mergers to help them gain scale and cut costs. This year, FirstEnergy of Ohio agreed to buyAllegheny Energy for $4.7 billion in stock.
 Power producers have faced declining prices for electricity in recent years, although analysts forecast an increase in prices as the economy recovers.
 Mr. Muller and Mr. Jacobs said the two companies had talked about a potential combination for some time, driven by what they saw as continuing consolidation in the power industry. Both companies generate electricity using coal, oil and natural gas.
 ''We had concluded that there was a significant value proposition for our shareholders,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 Under the terms of the deal, Mirant shareholders will own about 54 percent of the combined company, and RRI shareholders 46 percent. Mirant shareholders will receive 2.835 shares in RRI for each of their shares, or the equivalent of about $11.20 at Friday's closing price.
 Shares in Mirant closed on Friday at $10.73, having fallen 18.4 percent over the last 12 months. Shares in RRI closed on Friday at $3.95, having fallen 14.1 percent over the same period.
 The deal is expected to close at the end of the year, pending approval from shareholders and regulators, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The deal's closing is also dependent on both companies' refinancing of some of their debt.
 Mr. Muller and Mr. Jacobs said they expected the merger to yield about $150 million in annual cost savings, beginning in 2012.
 Mr. Muller acknowledged that the deal would bring about job cuts, though he did not elaborate. 
 Mirant has tried making deals before: in 2006, it made an unsolicited $7.8 billion bid for NRG Energy but withdrew after vociferous opposition from NRG.
 Mirant was advised by JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. RRI was advised by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

HEADLINE: Conflicting Signs For Midterm Elections

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
As if Republicans did not have enough cause for optimism this year, the pollster Neil Newhouse offers this lesson from history: Since John F. Kennedy occupied the White House, presidents with approval ratings below 50 percent have seen their parties lose an average of 41 House seats in midterm elections. 
 This year, a gain that large would return the House to Republican control. President Obama's most recent Gallup Poll rating: 45 percent. 
 There's more. Of Mr. Obama's last nine elected predecessors, none saw his approval ratings rise between January and October of his first midterm election year.
 That points to a Republican breakthrough that would snatch the speaker's gavel away from Representative Nancy Pelosi -- if 2010 follows historical patterns.
 But American voters have smashed plenty of precedents lately, most spectacularly by electing an African-American as president in 2008.
 ''As soon as a political scientist comes up with a sweeping generality about American politics,'' said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, ''it will immediately be falsified.''
 End of 'Dead-Ball Era'
 Two decades ago, Democratic strategists bemoaned the ''Republican lock'' on electoral votes for president; in California, the most populous state, the party of Reagan won 9 of 10 elections from 1952 to 1988. But in 1992, Bill Clinton picked the lock -- and no Republican has carried California since. 
 Two years later, the Democrats lost their own redoubt. Led by Newt Gingrich, Republicans won control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years. 
 For 15 straight midterm elections, from 1938 through 1994, the party holding the White House lost House seats. Then Mr. Clinton's Democrats gained seats in 1998 -- despite the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Republicans did it again under President George W. Bush in 2002.
 As Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Bush started their careers in the 1970s, an increase in split-ticket voting appeared to signal the decline of partisanship and the rise of the political independents. 
 In reality, that phase marked the realignment of partisanship, especially in the South -- not its demise. By 2004, Mr. Bush ran a successful re-election campaign on the theory that truly independent swing voters had all but vanished.
 For a time, partisan polarization tempered shifts in the makeup of Congress; neither Republicans nor Democrats gained as many as 10 seats in the five House elections between 1996 and 2004. With the nation evenly divided and gerrymandered districts narrowing the political playing field, James E. Campbell of the State University at Buffalo dubbed it ''the dead-ball era'' of Congressional competition.
 Then Republicans lost more than 50 seats in 2006 and 2008. Within a fearful Democratic Party, no strategist doubts that the ball remains very much alive this year.
 Unusual Elements
 This midterm campaign involves several historically unusual elements. In addition to Mr. Obama, those include passage of comprehensive health care reform after 70 years of failure and the aftermath of a deep recession with a taxpayer bailout of Wall Street.
 With the health care bill signed into law, the president hopes to convince Americans of its virtues while making clear that he has not stopped working on economic recovery. But one new lesson for the age of 24/7 multiplatform news coverage may be the diminished power of the presidential megaphone.
 ''Yeah, he's got the bully pulpit, but so do 5,000 other people,'' said Daron Shaw, a University of Texas political scientist who advised both presidential campaigns of Mr. Bush. He predicted that Mr. Obama's approval rating, now that voters have taken his measure, would hardly budge this year.
 Though the unemployment rate remains stuck around 10 percent, the economy in March enjoyed its strongest job growth in three years. The stock market has been booming. Democratic candidates hope that continued good news between now and November will begin alleviating the sour mood of voters.
 Some models of political behavior suggest that there is little time for that. Attitudes toward the economy tend to harden in springtime, Mr. Campbell said, since the second quarter is ''the last one people have an opportunity to process'' before Election Day.
 Ray C. Fair, an economist at Yale and a student of the relationship between economic conditions and political outcomes, argued that history shows voters take account of third-quarter performance, too. His model of 2010 economic performance projects that Democrats will draw 51.63 percent of the two-party vote for the House.
 That translates to roughly 224 seats -- enough for Democrats to retain control of the House.
 Could 21st-century shifts in the political and media culture be scrambling such calculations? ''Give me another 20 elections,'' Mr. Fair responded, ''then we can test that.''

HEADLINE: Aerospace Business Has Its Doubts About Administration Plans to Revamp NASA

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giants with decades of experience working on America's space program, will happily sell rockets to carry astronauts into space, but the companies are leery about taking a leading role in President Obama's vision for a revamped National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 The prospect of NASA relying on smaller companies -- unproven upstarts in the view of critics -- could create yet another hurdle in convincing an already skeptical Congress of the idea of relying on commercial companies to provide taxi transportation to the International Space Station.
 ''I don't think there is a business case for us,'' John Karas, vice president and general manager of human spaceflight at Lockheed Martin, said about space taxis. 
 Publicly, Boeing has been enthusiastic. ''We have a vested interest in the International Space Station,'' Brewster H. Shaw, vice president and general manager of Boeing's NASA Systems business unit, said in February after NASA awarded the company $18 million to draw up a preliminary design of a capsule that could serve as the basis of a commercial crew system. ''We want to see I.S.S. live up to its potential by having a robust logistics for the delivery of cargo and crew.''
 But Loren B. Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a policy group financed by military contractors, said Boeing is more skeptical in private. 
 In 1995, Boeing began pursuing the commercial space business through an international partnership called Sea Launch; it also developed the Delta IV rocket to launch both military and commercial satellites. The company lost money in both efforts, with Sea Launch filing for bankruptcy in 2009. To stem the Delta IV losses, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which was also losing money with its Atlas V rocket, set up a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance in 2006.
 ''Senior Boeing executives have told me that they are skeptical about new launch opportunities, given the losses they incurred on previous initiatives such as Sea Launch and the Pentagon's expendable launcher program,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''They are unlikely to invest large amounts of money on the new NASA vision.''
 Mr. Obama has called for the cancellation of NASA's current Constellation program to send astronauts back to the Moon. In its place, the administration would like to spend $6 billion over five years to finance the development of rockets and crew capsules by commercial companies. 
 NASA officials have said the program would be set up to attract new and established companies. The money would most likely be split between two or more companies.
 In pitching the idea, administration officials have said that commercial companies have always built the rockets and spacecraft that carried American astronauts and that it would not be a radical shift to turn to aerospace companies with decades of experience. They also contend that competition would spur innovation and drive down the launching costs, which, in turn, would open vibrant new markets. 
 NASA has not described details of the planned competition, and the companies said they would take a look at what the agency proposes. 
 ''Assuming the business case is right, we're all in,'' said Keith Reiley, program manager for Boeing's capsule development.
 The business case depends on how much money NASA will be asking the companies to invest. In traditional ''cost plus'' development, NASA pays for everything. In that case, Mr. Reilly said, ''of course, we'd be happy to do that.''
 If NASA were to ask the companies to shoulder all of the financial risk, however, Boeing would certainly not participate. The key would be how the $6 billion would be divided. ''Hopefully,'' Mr. Reilly said, ''those issues will get resolved.''
 Both Boeing and Lockheed were stung during the last burst of optimism for the commercial space business about a decade ago. They invested several billion dollars -- Lockheed to develop its Atlas V, Boeing for the Delta IV -- in the hopes that the huge market for commercial satellites would supplement their traditional business of launching American military spy satellites.
 The market did not materialize, and what business there was went to European and Russian rockets that were cheaper. With the United Launch Alliance, Boeing and Lockheed Martin share costs and profits equally. The joint venture now operates in the black, but the companies did not recoup their original investments, and much of the infrastructure they built remains underused.
 ''I think people who have been in the launcher business for many years find it hard to take the president's plan seriously,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''They think it sounds like an elaborate wake for the human spaceflight program more than a plan for moving forward.''
 The hoped-for commercial market for space taxis hinges on one small company, Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas, which is teaming up with Boeing on its capsule design. 
 Founded by Robert T. Bigelow, a real estate investor who made a fortune with the Budget Suites hotel chain, Bigelow Aerospace is developing inflatable space habitats that it hopes to market as research facilities to companies and foreign nations looking to establish a space program. 
 The company's plans are ambitious. It is already negotiating with United Launch Alliance for seven Atlas V launches in 2014. 
 ''That nearly doubles the output of the Atlas V in any given year,'' said Michael N. Gold, director of Bigelow's Washington office. ''It's really a snowball effect here,'' he said, with economies of scale expected to drive down the costs.
 The result of the launches in 2014 would be a private space station that could house 12 astronauts -- twice as many as the International Space Station. Plans call for a second, even larger Bigelow station two years later, with room for 24 astronauts. The company projected 148 to 176 launches between 2014 and 2022.
 ''We're extremely confident in the market,'' Mr. Gold said. The only missing pieces, he said, are the rockets to carry people to and from the Bigelow stations. 
 But if Bigelow's plans do not unfold as the company projects, and if NASA were the only customer, the space taxi business might be too small -- perhaps just two flights a year to the International Space Station -- and too risky for Boeing or Lockheed Martin to invest much time and money.
 James McAleese, a defense consultant in McLean, Va., said that large aerospace firms like Boeing and Lockheed typically generate returns of 11 percent or 12 percent on their investments, and that for riskier enterprises like space, the companies would be looking for even higher returns. ''I don't believe there's a burning desire to get into the spacecraft piece of the business,'' he said. 
 If a commercial market developed, that could still be a lucrative business, said Mr. Karas, of Lockheed Martin, who once led the company's expendable rockets business. But he added, ''Personally, this is exactly the same rhetoric as last time.'' 
 Still, even if Boeing and Lockheed declined to bid directly on NASA's plans, at least some of the astronauts would probably be traveling in Atlas Vs or Delta IVs built by those companies. 
 The NASA competition may seek proposals solely for spacecraft -- the crew capsules or winged craft atop the rockets -- rather than the rockets themselves. The spacecraft makers would specify which rocket a craft would launch on. 
 One likely bidder, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., is developing both a crew capsule, the Dragon, and its own rocket, the Falcon 9. Other possible competitors, like Blue Origin, a start-up by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, would build only the capsule and put it on top of an existing rocket, with the most likely choice being United Launch Alliance's Atlas V.
 The joint venture would sell rockets -- the lower-end versions of the Atlas V cost about $150 million each -- to the spacecraft makers. Thus, the alliance -- and, indirectly, Boeing and Lockheed Martin -- would continue their involvement with NASA's space program, but in a secondary role.
 Michael C. Gass, president and chief executive of United Launch Alliance, has said that upgrading the low-end version of the Atlas V for astronauts -- adding a monitoring system to alert controllers of problems with the rocket and modifying the launching pad to handle astronauts -- would cost $400 million. 
 ''When you start getting into a heavier crew transfer vehicle and a dedicated launch facility, it's over a billion dollars, but less than two,'' Mr. Gass said. Those improvements ''should be funded by the U.S. government'' without additional investment from Boeing and Lockheed, he said. 
 Even with Bigelow already negotiating launches, Mr. Gass said, he did not yet see a definite commercial market. ''The commercial market could develop,'' he said. ''Right now, we're approaching it as incremental.''

HEADLINE: Jet Fuel Sales to U.S. Base Are an Issue in Kyrgyzstan

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Michael Schwirtz contributed reporting from Teyit, Kyrgyzstan.

 BODY:
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan -- Back in 2005, the last time angry crowds toppled the government of Kyrgyzstan, the United States found itself in an awkward position: among the rallying cries was an allegation that the ruling family had benefited handsomely from Pentagon contracts. Now, substantially the same thing appears to be happening again.
 Senior leaders in the interim government that took power last week are accusing the United States of allowing family members of the ousted president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, to enrich themselves with contracts supplying jet fuel to Manas Air Base outside Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. 
 Companies controlled by the president's 32-year-old son, Maksim, who became a loathed figure during the uprising, skimmed as much as $8 million a month from fuel sales to the base, according to senior leaders in the new government, relying on a monopoly and favorable taxes. 
 That such accusations became a factor in last week's uprising speaks to the entrenched cronyism of former Soviet states, where power often blends seamlessly with wealth.
 For the United States the base is integral to the logistics of supplying fuel, troops and equipment to Afghanistan. The uprising on Wednesday, in which more than 80 people died, has created some uncertainty about those logistics.
 While establishing offices and mulling what to do with the president, who is in the south of the country, officials have already begun releasing details of an elaborate payment system for up to a quarter million gallons of jet fuel used at the base each day. 
 They accuse the United States of having used that system to curry favor with the ousted president in order to hold onto the air base, the only remaining Amerian military refueling site in Central Asia after Uzbekistan closed a base in a dispute with the United States over human rights. 
 ''Whatever the Pentagon's policy of buying warlords in Afghanistan, the state of Kyrgyzstan demands more respect,'' Edil Baisalov, chief of staff of the interim leader, Roza Otunbayeva, said in an interview. ''The government of Kyrgyzstan will not be bought and sold. We are above that.''
 Officials with the military agency that buys fuel, the Defense Energy Supply Corporation, have said no United States laws would be violated if contracts were awarded to companies owned by relatives of a foreign heads of state. 
 In an interview with The New York Times on Sunday, Mr. Bakiyev denied that his family profited from the deals. ''Money that comes in for services at the Manas airport does not go into the pocket of the president,'' he said. ''It goes into an account that everyone can check. Everything goes through the bank.''
 The contracts to supply the base have been coveted, and delicate. 
 In the haste of the buildup for the war in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, companies controlled by Aidar Akayev, son of Askar Akayev, who was then the president, had wound up with lucrative contracts to sell fuel to Manas, according to Kyrgyz officials. A lawyer for Mr. Akayev's son has also said the contracts were not illegal.
 Nonetheless, when President Akayev was deposed in 2005, the prosecutor's office under the new leader, Mr. Bakiyev, opened a criminal investigation, asked for F.B.I. cooperation and hired an independent corporate investigations company to untangle the arrangement.
 According to a report prepared by that investigator, who asked not to be identified, as he was not authorized to disclose the report, the primary source of aviation grade kerosene used at the base is an oil refinery in the Siberian city of Omsk, owned by the oil division of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant.
 Red Star, a company with offices in London and Bishkek, contracted with Defense Energy Supply to buy the fuel and move it across several Central Asian countries to Manas. Chuck Squires, a former American Army lieutenant colonel, was hired to handle the contract. 
 The outside investigator met with Mr. Bakiyev to present the initial findings, and characterized his responses as: ''Thank you very much for your job. Your services are no longer needed.'' The investigator said he suspected the new president was in fact taking over the same business model. 
 ''They changed the names of the companies but the scheme remained the same,'' he said. 
 Some of Red Star's business had been assumed by another company, the Mina Corporation Limited, he said. 
 Turusbek Koyenaliyev, an aide to the new acting minister for economic affairs, said one company supplying the base today was Manas Aerofuels. He said it was controlled by Maksim Bakiyev, the son of the president. 
 Manas Aerofuels and the Mina Corporation share office space in the Hyatt Regency hotel in Bishkek. A man who opened Mina's door said the company sold jet fuel to Manas but declined to answer other questions. On a list of companies in the business center provided by Hyatt, the contact for Mina is a ''Mr. Squires.''
 In interviews, the acting prime minister, the president's chief of staff, a former foreign minister and a former acting president asserted that the younger Mr. Bakiyev was the owner of the fuel-supply companies. They were unable to provide documentation, citing the chaotic state of the government. 
 Omurbek Tekebayev, the former acting president, said in an interview that the trading companies made money selling cheap Russian jet fuel at world prices to the American base.
 Until April 1, when the Russian government abruptly imposed a steep tariff on refined products for Kyrgyzstan, these exports were tariff-free under a customs agreement. Within Kyrgyzstan, sales to the base were exempt from the usual 20 percent sales tax, Mr. Tekebayev said. 
 The Bakiyev family, Mr. Tekebayev said, assumed control of part of the business immediately after the 2005 uprising.
 Alikbek Jekshenkulov, who was serving as Mr. Bakiyev's foreign minister at the time, said the ruling family consolidated its control of the trade in 2006, after Mr. Bakiyev issued the first of several public threats to expel the base. The threat, he said, was used to compel the transfer of the remaining fuel contracts to the Bakiyev-family-controlled firms. 
 Mr. Jekshenkulov, in an interview, said he met with Mr. Bakiyev to object and explain that others, too, would like the business. ''I said, 'There is a war between the clans to sell gas to the base. There ought to be an open tender, so people will believe it is honest, and you can be clean as a politician,''' Mr. Jekshenkulov said. ''As always, he just nodded his head and said, 'That's all.' ''
 ''Nothing changed,'' Mr. Jekshenkulov said. ''They changed the names.''
 Partly as a result of this confrontation, however, Mr. Jekshenkulov said he was dismissed as foreign minister in February 2007, and later joined the opposition, which was repressed under Mr. Bakiyev. Last year, he was imprisoned in solitary confinement from March until August.

HEADLINE: Defending The Papers He Fought

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com http://twitter/carr2n

 BODY:
This is the kind of shape the newspaper business is in: Brian Tierney, a former public relations executive with a reputation for going after reporters, has become the last man standing in a fight to keep Philadelphia's newspapers out of the hands of lenders.
 Mr. Tierney, who ran his own communications company before buying The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News in 2006, is the kind of newcomer that longtime newspapermen love to hate. He's slick, he cut his teeth in public relations, and he loves to wrap his mouth around a catchy phrase.
 Right now, rhetoric is all he has left. Philadelphia Newspapers, the company that owns the two papers, entered bankruptcy in February 2009 after laboring under declining performance and $318 million in debt. He maintains that he or another media-oriented owner (and not the debtholders) should hang on to the papers as a civic good, and he has prevailed in court so far. 
 The issue may seem local -- Mr. Tierney has suggested the future of news in Philadelphia is at stake -- but it resonates across the country. Many newspapers were sold in the last few years in deals that involved a great deal of debt. As the recession deepened in 2008, media watchers wondered how the world might look if lenders owned newspapers. 
 We're finding out: as revenue to service all that debt has evaporated, there have been 13 major bankruptcies in the newspaper industry. The Star Tribune in Minneapolis is being operated by its creditors, and just last Thursday executives at the Tribune Company, which was bought by Sam Zell with $13 billion in debt, said they had reached an agreement to hand the keys to its creditors, among them the hedge fund Angelo, Gordon & Company.
 Mr. Tierney wants to hang on to the keys, or at least, he says, to deliver the Philadelphia newspapers to ''someone who wants to be in the business, not somebody who bought the debt for 12 cents and is trying to flip it for a little more.'' He has said, ''I have a fiduciary duty, not just to the lenders, but to the employees and other people who depend on this paper.''
 An auction for the property had been set for April 27, and Mr. Tierney's lawyers argued that the senior lenders, which include the CIT Group, Angelo, Gordon and Credit Suisse, should not be allowed to use the debt they are owed to bid for the company, a so-called credit bid.
 Improbably, Mr. Tierney's position won the argument in front of a federal appeals court that disallowed the credit bid on March 22, but last Wednesday the plot thickened again when lenders asked that the auction be delayed to give them time to appeal.
 In the months of brawling, Mr. Tierney has accused lenders of illegally taping him and exercising bad faith in and out of court. At a news conference last week, he took particular aim at Angelo, Gordon, a fund that specializes in distressed assets. 
 In addition to a senior debt position in Philadelphia, Angelo, Gordon has a significant stake in the Tribune Company, which owns The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune; Freedom Communications, which owns The Orange County Register; and The Star Tribune in Minneapolis.
 On Thursday, he called Angelo, Gordon ''a secretive hedge fund that has its fingers on the throat of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune and will someday, they hope, basically control the news in three of the four largest news markets in the country if they are able to capture Philadelphia as well.''
 The judges denied the debtholders' request on Thursday, and the decision was upheld on Friday. The auction will go off as scheduled and be followed by a confirmation hearing to investigate whether all parties received fair value for their interests in the newspapers.
 ''I'm glad how the day went on Thursday,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''I was able to hold a press conference so people could see what we are dealing with.''
 Thomas Fuller, the executive in charge of distressed assets at Angelo, Gordon, did not respond to a request for an interview, nor did Fred S. Hodara, lead lawyer for the senior lenders, but he sent an e-mail response to The Philadelphia Inquirer suggesting that Mr. Tierney is throwing rocks from inside a glass house.
 ''Here's a broken promise,'' Mr. Hodara wrote. ''He borrowed $400 million to finance his acquisition of the company and is now doing everything he can to dishonor the desires of those to whom he made the promise to repay those obligations.''
 There's not much logic in any owner running a newspaper into the ground, but Mr. Tierney argues that if the lenders take control, the newspapers could end up with so much debt that bankruptcy could become a serial exercise. 
 Martin J. Bienenstock, an experienced bankruptcy lawyer at Dewey & LeBoeuf, a Manhattan law firm, has no involvement in the case, but he has some strong opinions about Mr. Tierney's effort to thwart the senior lenders.
 ''Piercing the prose for a moment, you have management trying to choose its owners at the expense of creditors' rights,'' he said, adding that the court's decision to block a credit bid made little sense to him.
 Mr. Tierney is an unlikely warrior on behalf of newspapers. In his previous incarnation as a communications executive, he had pounded journalists on behalf of various clients. But even though the newspapers' fortunes have declined, he has come to be seen as a champion of local, involved ownership and would like to continue to run the newspapers.
 Buzz Bissinger, the author and Inquirer columnist, is as surprised as anyone at seeing Mr. Tierney in this new role. 
 ''When he first got the papers, I was as suspicious as anyone else, because Brian had spent a lot of time fighting with the paper, but he ended up falling in love with it,'' he said. ''He is a tough guy who I think is acting in good faith.''
 The asset being fought over shrinks with each passing day. Mr. Tierney said that the newspapers made $17 million last year on $325 million in revenue and predicts that even with an economic recovery the newspapers will be down 12 to 17 percent this year.
 Add in the almost $30 million in fees associated with the fight over control, and the company will not survive the summer if there are further delays in resolving its debt. If an auction goes off as planned, the auction would deliver cash to debtholders, lower the debt and the payments needed to service it, and with luck, stabilize the newpapers' operations going forward.
 Mr. Tierney is already out the $10 million he invested in the property, taking a hit along with other local investors, and he said that he would feel he had done his job if either a stalking-horse bid put together by local interests or another media-savvy company took control. He said he had contacted more than 200 potential bidders.
 ''I've flown all over the country and talked to people who might be interested,'' he said. ''It can be a decent business, and I will do anything I can to get it in the hands of people who want to run it for five or 10 years.''
 The sadder fact may be that it may not matter that much who prevails in the auction and the confirmation hearing that follows. Alan D. Mutter, a media consultant, said advertising sales in the newspaper industry had dropped to $27 billion in 2009, from $49 billion in 2005, so just getting rid of debt won't be enough no matter who owns newspaper properties.
 Mr. Tierney may have come to newspapers later in life, but he said, ''I've drunk the Kool-Aid.''
 ''Think of what we are doing right now, talking about the implications of this story and this case. Isn't it great?'' he said, and then pivoted quickly to put on his old public relations hat. ''Am I going to grimace when I read this?''

HEADLINE: Georgia On My Mind

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As we look for ways to prevent future financial crises, many questions should be asked. Here's one you may not have heard: What's the matter with Georgia?
 I'm not sure how many people know that Georgia leads the nation in bank failures, accounting for 37 of the 206 banks seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation since the beginning of 2008. These bank failures are a symptom of deeper problems: arguably, no other state has suffered as badly from banks gone wild.
 To appreciate Georgia's specialness, you need to realize that the housing bubble was a geographically uneven affair. Basically, prices rose sharply only where zoning restrictions and other factors limited the construction of new houses. In the rest of the country -- what I once dubbed Flatland -- permissive zoning and abundant land make it easy to increase the housing supply, a situation that prevented big price increases and therefore prevented a serious bubble. 
 Most of the post-bubble hangover is concentrated in states where home prices soared, then fell back to earth, leaving many homeowners with negative equity -- houses worth less than their mortgages. It's no accident that Florida, Nevada and Arizona lead the nation in both negative equity and mortgage delinquencies; prices more than doubled in Miami, Las Vegas and Phoenix, and have subsequently suffered some of the biggest declines.
 But not all of Flatland has gotten off lightly. In particular, there's a sharp contrast between the two biggest Flatland states, Texas -- which avoided the worst -- and Georgia, which didn't. 
 This contrast can't be explained by the geography of the two states' major cities. Like Dallas or Houston, Atlanta is a sprawling metropolis facing few limits on expansion. And like other Flatland cities, Atlanta never saw much of a housing price surge.
 Yet Texas has managed to avoid severe stress to either its housing market or its banking system, while Georgia is suffering severe post-bubble trauma. The share of mortgages with delinquent payments is higher in Georgia than in California; the percentage of Georgia homeowners with negative equity is well above the national average. And Georgia leads the nation in bank failures.
 So what's the matter with Georgia? As I said, banks went wild, in a scene strongly reminiscent of the savings-and-loan excesses of the 1980s. High-flying bank executives aggressively expanded lending -- and paid themselves lavishly -- while relying heavily on ''hot money'' raised from outside investors rather than on their own depositors. 
 It was fun while it lasted. Then the music stopped.
 Why didn't the same thing happen in Texas? The most likely answer, surprisingly, is that Texas had strong consumer-protection regulation. In particular, Texas law made it difficult for homeowners to treat their homes as piggybanks, extracting cash by increasing the size of their mortgages. Georgia lacked any similar protections (and the Bush administration blocked the state's efforts to restrict subprime lending directly). And Georgia suffered from the difference.
 What's striking about the contrast between the Texas story and Georgia's debacle is that it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the issues that have dominated debates about banking reform. For example, many observers have blamed complex financial derivatives for the crisis. But Georgia banks blew themselves up with old-fashioned loans gone bad.
 And for all the concern about banks that are too big to fail, Georgia suffered, if anything, from a proliferation of small banks. Actually, the worst offenders in the lending spree tended to be relatively small start-ups that attracted customers by playing to a specific community. Thus Georgian Bank, founded in 2001, catered to the state's elite, some of whom were entertained on the C.E.O.'s yacht and private jet. Meanwhile, Integrity Bank, founded in 2000, played up its ''faith based'' business model -- it was featured in a 2005 Time magazine article titled ''Praying for Profits.'' Both banks have now gone bust. 
 So what's the moral of this story? As I see it, it's a caution against silver-bullet views of reform, the idea that cracking down on just one thing -- in particular, breaking up big banks -- will solve our problems. The case of Georgia shows that bad behavior by many small banks can do as much damage as misbehavior by a few financial giants. 
 And the contrast between Texas and Georgia suggests that consumer protection is an essential element of reform. By all means, let's limit the power of the big banks. But if we don't also protect consumers from predatory lending, there are plenty of smaller players -- both small banks and the nonbank ''mortgage originators'' responsible for many of the worst subprime abuses -- that will step in and fill the gap.

HEADLINE: Arbiters of Recessions Wary of Certifying an Upturn

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and LOUISE STORY; Louis Uchitelle contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For the record, this recession isn't over yet. 
 A committee of economists, charged with determining the official turning points in the nation's business cycles, certifies the beginnings and ends of recessions. But this time, the committee members say, the evidence is not so easy to decipher.
 The committee plans to announce on Monday that it cannot yet declare an end to the recession that began in December 2007, several members indicated on Sunday. Such an acknowledgment is rare in the history of setting dates to business cycles and could affect the behavior of investors and consumers. 
 Despite a recent uptick in employment and income, the decision of the committee at a meeting on Friday reflects a lingering worry that the economy could turn downward again in a so-called double-dip recession. 
 Several economists on the committee, which has seven active members, said they considered such a turn to be unlikely. But, they said, the duration and severity of the contraction have made it hard to determine with authority that a recovery has begun. 
 The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, officially began rising in the second half of 2009, suggesting that a recovery might have quietly started. But the committee takes other factors into consideration, like employment trends and consumer confidence.
 Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, are former members of the committee, and its position could potentially affect their outlook on monetary and fiscal policy. 
 The two previous recessions, in 1990-91 and in 2001, each lasted eight months and were mild enough that the committee felt confident in pronouncing them over in a year or less. As it was, the current recession was 11 months old before the committee announced its start date.
 Now, the committee, which is part of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group, says that the timing of an upward turn has been harder to discern than in the past. Moreover, the government has revised several statistics after they were initially released, making it more difficult to say when the economy hit bottom.
 ''Hypothetically, if there were a new sharp downturn that came along tomorrow, would it count as a new recession or part of the same recession?'' asked Jeffrey A. Frankel, a member of the panel, officially known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee. ''In the latter case, we would have made a mistake by calling the trough last year and saying the recession was over.'' 
 In interviews, several committee members carefully chose their words. Citing job gains in March, Mr. Frankel, an economist at the Harvard Kennedy School, declared on his blog last week, ''The recession is over.'' He said he made that case when the committee met Friday in Cambridge, Mass., but added that he could see that a strong argument could be made for holding off on a pronouncement. 
 Another committee member, Robert E. Hall of Stanford, said, ''The odds favor the view that a true expansion has begun and that the recession beginning in 2007 is over.''
 But he added that ''one cannot totally rule out the unlikely possibility that the economy might resume contraction again soon.''
 Under such a situation, he said, the upswing that began in the second half of 2009 would be ''only an interruption in a longer contraction, and not an expansion.'' But he added, ''Currently, forecasters are assigning low probability to such a development.'' 
 A third committee member, James H. Stock, a Harvard economist, has also been associated with the belief that the recession ended last year. On Sunday, Mr. Stock would not describe the discussion.
 But he said: ''It's incumbent on the N.B.E.R. to maintain its decades-long tradition of care in the detailed assessment of the date of turning points. That is a far more difficult task than I think many commentators understand.''
 A fourth committee member, Martin S. Feldstein, also of Harvard, warned in January of the risk of a double-dip recession. ''There is a significant risk the economy could run out of steam sometime in 2010,'' he said at a meeting of the American Economic Association. Reached on Sunday, Mr. Feldstein declined to elaborate publicly on his views. 
 Mr. Frankel and Mr. Hall have been quoted as saying that the recession has ended. In the Internet era, those comments generated more buzz than the bureau is accustomed to. Asked why the committee would not just wait, several members cited the public interest and a desire for transparency.
 James M. Poterba of M.I.T., who is the president of the national bureau and a committee member, also would not tip his hand. There is no formula for defining a recession, even though it is often casually described as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The committee relies on interpretation to determine the beginning or end of one. 
 The last time it made such a cautious statement was in December 1990, when it said that a recession had most likely begun between June and September but that it could not make a determination until the contraction was sufficiently long and deep; the committee announced four months later that the recession had started in July 1990.
 It seems nearly certain that the present recession will end up lasting longer than the 16-month recessions of 1973-75 and 1981-82. They had been the longest downturns since the 43-month period from 1929 to 1933 that was the first phase of the Great Depression. 
 The committee, created in 1978, has assigned the start and end dates of economic contractions for every business cycle since 1854. It has long emphasized that it looks only backward, and does not make forecasts or predictions.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about efforts by a committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research to determine the end date of the recession that began in December 2007 misstated the day of the committee's meeting. It was Thursday, not Friday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Faults Regulators Over a Bank

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Regulators failed for years to properly supervise the giant savings and loanWashington Mutual, even as the company wobbled under the weight of risky subprime mortgages, a federal investigation has concluded. 
 The two agencies that oversaw Washington Mutual, the investigation found, feuded so much that they could not even agree to deem the company ''unsafe and unsound'' until Sept. 18, 2008. 
 By then, it was too late. A week later, amid a wave of deposit withdrawals, the government seized the bank and sold it to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. It was by far the largest bank failure in American history. 
 The report, prepared by the inspectors general for the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is expected to be released Friday. A draft was obtained by The New York Times. The release coincides with hearings this week by the Senate subcommittee on investigations, which is treating Washington Mutual as a case history of the financial crisis. 
 Based on research conducted from March to November 2009, the report examines the conduct of the bank's primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, an independent arm of the Treasury that regulates savings associations, and the F.D.I.C., which insured the institution's deposits. 
 The thrift supervision office was supposed to ensure the company's safety and soundness, while the F.D.I.C. was tasked with assessing risks to its deposit insurance fund.
 The report found that Washington Mutual had failed primarily ''because of management's pursuit of a high-risk lending strategy that included liberal underwriting standards and inadequate risk controls.'' The strategy accelerated in 2005 and came to a crashing end in 2007 with the drop in the housing market. 
 But the report also leveled unexpectedly sharp criticism at the F.D.I.C., which by July 2008 concluded that the bank needed $5 billion in capital to withstand future potential losses. The report said the F.D.I.C., which had questioned the Office of Thrift Supervision's assessments of the bank's soundness, could have stepped in earlier and acted as the primary regulator, but decided ''it was easier to use moral suasion to attempt to convince the O.T.S. to change its rating.''
 With more than $300 billion in assets, WaMu was the largest institution regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision and accounted for as much as 15 percent of its total revenue from assessments, the report found. 
 Although regulators found problems with the quality of the mortgages it had originated and with the wholesale loans it bought through outside brokers and banks, the office consistently deemed WaMu ''fundamentally sound,'' giving it a rating of 2, the second-highest on a five-point scale used to assess a bank's condition, from 2001-7. Moreover, the office relied on WaMu's own tracking system to follow up on regulators' findings. 
 The office did not lower the rating to 3 (''exhibits some degree of supervisory concern'') until February 2008, and to 4 (''unsafe and unsound'') until September 2008, days before WaMu collapsed. ''It is difficult to understand how O.T.S. continued to assign WaMu a composite 2 rating year after year,'' the report found. 
 O.T.S. officials said the agency had accepted the findings; the F.D.I.C. said it could not comment until the report was completed.
 The report said it would be ''speculative to conclude that earlier and more forceful enforcement action would have prevented WaMu's failure,'' but also said such actions, if taken in 2006 or 2007, might have pushed managers to move aggressively to correct weaknesses and stem losses.
 The report said the F.D.I.C. ''met resistance'' from the thrift supervisor when it assigned additional examiners to look at WaMu from 2005-8 and when it challenged the 2 rating in 2008.
 In the summer of 2008, as WaMu teetered on the brink of failure, the two regulators still could not agree. ''The O.T.S. as primary regulator wanted to rehabilitate WaMu and keep it in business,'' the report states. ''The F.D.I.C., on the other hand, as an insurer wanted to resolve the institution's problems as soon as possible to maintain the value of WaMu in order to reduce the cost of any failure.'' 
 The inspectors general, Eric M. Thorson of the Treasury and Jon T. Rymer of the F.D.I.C., concluded that the F.D.I.C. should make its own risk assessments of institutions large enough to pose significant risk to its insurance fund. 
 The chairman of the House panel holding this week's hearings, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement that he hoped the hearings would inform the debate over changes in financial rules, which the Senate could take up as early as this week, after its return from a spring recess. Two former WaMu executives, Kerry K. Killinger and Stephen J. Rotella, are expected to testify Tuesday.
 ''The recent financial crisis was not a natural disaster; it was a manmade economic assault,'' Mr. Levin said. ''It will happen again unless we change the rules.''
 The WaMu report could also influence the work of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, created by Congress to investigate the financial disaster.

HEADLINE: Characters Welcome to Cut a Rug (or Clean One)

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
The USA cable channel, in promoting series like ''Burn Notice,'' ''Psych'' and ''White Collar,'' proclaims, ''Characters welcome.'' That could be a motto for Madison Avenue, too, as more commercials feature recurring characters who can help spots stand out amid the clutter.
 Examples of characters who emote 30 seconds at a time include the Postal Service employee extolling the virtues of Priority Mail flat-rate boxes (''If it fits, it ships''), the lonely Maytag repairman, the three amigos whose ardor for Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch and Raisin Bran Extra cereals gets them into comic predicaments and the over-enthusiastic pitchwoman for Orbit gum.
 Now, Stanley Steemer, the company that cleans carpets, floors, furniture, air ducts and other things around the house, is joining the ranks of marketers that use commercial characters to peddle their wares. A humorous campaign now under way nationally introduces two employees -- known as technicians in company parlance -- who drive to service calls in the familiar Stanley Steemer yellow van. 
 One employee, played by David Theune, is chatty, recounting his experiences in the field to his co-worker, played by Ernie Macias, who silently takes it all in. The talkative technician is a bit of a know-it-all, but he is genuinely interested in imparting his wisdom to his colleague, who seems new on the job.
 The new characters are accompanied by a new version of the vintage Stanley Steemer jingle, ''Go 1-800-STEEMER,'' which now also touts the company's Web site (1-800-Steemer.com or).
 The new characters are appearing in television commercials, which are running in both 15-second and 30-second versions, as well as in video clips that can be watched on the Stanley Steemer channel on You Tube. Stanley Steemer spends an estimated $50 million to $60 million each year on advertising.
 The campaign is the first work from the new Stanley Steemer creative agency, Young & Laramore in Indianapolis, whose hiring was announced in February. It is a homecoming for the creative account, which Young & Laramore had handled from 2003 to 2005 before losing it to the Loomis Agency in Dallas. 
 Five years later, the assignment boomeranged back to Young & Laramore, which scrambled to come up with a new campaign in time for spring.
 ''Young & Laramore worked in a relatively short time frame,'' says Justin Bates, president at Stanley Steemer International in Dublin, Ohio.
 ''We had a very good experience with Young & Laramore'' the first time around, he adds, ''and with everything that had gone on with the economy we realized it was very important to have the right creative going into 2010.''
 Typically, an economic downturn can benefit the carpet-cleaning business, Mr. Bates says, as people who are loath to buy new carpeting decide to clean their existing carpets. 
 But early last year, ''a lot of people stopped spending money altogether,'' he adds, which hurt the company's results.
 ''It wasn't our best year,'' Mr. Bates says of 2009, but there was hope for an upturn because carpets were ''still getting dirty.''
 The state of the housing market also affects Stanley Steemer, he adds, because when homes are moving carpets can get cleaned twice: Once when the owners prepare to sell and again by the buyers after they move in.
 The new campaign was developed by Young & Laramore after discussions with some of the technicians who work in Indianapolis, Mr. Bates says, which reinforced a belief that ''to our customers, Stanley Steemer is two uniformed technicians who show up at their house in the yellow Stanley Steemer van and do a great job for them.''
 ''Our technicians, and our vans, are our brand,'' he adds.
 That approach helps differentiate Stanley Steemer, Mr. Bates says, because most of the work in the category is centered on testimonials or demonstrations.
 ''It seems like every carpet-cleaning company in the country has the shot with the wand,'' he adds, referring to a piece of equipment, next to a section of carpet that is ''clean on one side and dirty on the other.''
 By comparison, the new Stanley Steemer commercials offer ''a little bit of humor, a little bit of information and shots of the van,'' Mr. Bates says.
 ''If you're fast-forwarding,'' he adds, laughing, describing TV viewers who use TiVo or DVRs to zip through commercials rather than watching them, ''you see two shots of the van, at least.''
 Viewers who do that, however, will miss out on some funny advertising as Mr. Theune, an improvisational comedian, and Mr. Macias give excellent performances that bring their parts to life.
 For instance, in one commercial, the van is driving along a street when the chatty technician, who is driving, stops when he sees a roll of stained carpeting discarded with the trash in front of a house.
 ''No!'' he shouts, adding a plaintive, ''Why?''
 ''I could have saved this one,'' he says twice, shouting it the second time toward the house. The spot ends with him weeping.
 In a second commercial, the talkative technician is recalling ''those challenge jobs'' that ''keep me coming back for me,'' including one, shown in a flashback, with goats in a living room.
 ''Don't tell me about a dog,'' he says to his silent partner. ''Tell me about four dogs, an exploding crock pot. How 'bout a couple of free-ranging house chickens? Now that's what I call a day's work.''
 A third commercial presents the chatty technician conveying a pearl of wisdom to his colleague: ''You know, I always say, know the species, know the stain.''
 Cut to them seated in a living room as a large beast walks about. ''See, based on size, lanolin-free coat and his ear shape,'' the talker says, ''I know it's an alpaca.'' 
 He contrasts that with someone else, presumably a rival carpet cleaner, who ''doesn't think and says, 'Hey, look, it's a llama,' '' and erroneously treats the mess as if it were llama stains.
 The intent is to represent the employees, when it comes to their jobs, as ''fanatics'' who have ''done it all,'' says Tom Denari, president at Young & Laramore.
 The idea that a technician would know that ''an alpaca is different than a llama,'' he adds, gives the campaign a way to humorously detail the distinctions between Stanley Steemer and its rivals.
 ''You don't want to get caught at a party'' with the talkative employee, Mr. Denari says, laughing, because his work is so important that ''it's all he'll ever talk about.''
 ''But if you have a carpet problem, you want this guy,'' he adds, ''because he'll get it right for you.''
 The scripts for the commercials are ''based on loose reality,'' Mr. Denari says, derived from the information gathered during the time the agency employees spent in the field with the technicians.
 ''Before they all go out for the day'' the technicians meet to discuss work situations, he adds, likening it to the trademark scene during episodes of the police series ''Hill Street Blues'' when the sergeant, played by Michael Conrad, ended his briefings with the words ''Let's be careful out there.''
 In addition to the three commercials about cleaning carpets, there are two others that are focused on other services provided by Stanley Steemer.
 In one spot, for water removal, the technicians are in their van, on their way to deal with a flood -- or, as the chatty one puts it, ''All is know is we've got a floor in trouble.''
 Cut to them inside a home, standing in the living room, looking at a large aquarium that has been shattered by a baseball bat. All around are drinking glasses and plastic containers with rescued fish inside, swimming around.
 Neither technician says a word as their shoes make squishing sounds in the soaked carpet. These words appear on screen: ''24-hour water emergency service available.''
 In a second spot, for air duct cleaning, the technicians are inside a home with surgical masks around their necks. 
 ''I like to think of the duct system as the lungs of the house,'' the talkative one says to his quiet co-worker, and they are ''helping the house to breathe.''
 ''Now, I know I wouldn't say I'm a doctor,'' he adds, ''but I wouldn't say I'm not a doctor, either.'' The words ''$50 off air duct cleaning'' appear on screen as the commercial ends.
 The spots for the services other than carpet cleaning will be mixed in with those for carpet cleaning in different proportions in different markets, Mr. Bates says, to ''see what happens.''
 For example, in some markets as many as 30 percent of the commercials that run will be for air duct cleaning, he adds.
 The 15-second versions of the spots will run nationally on broadcast networks and cable channels. The 30-second versions will run in local markets on broadcast stations and cable systems.
 Stanley Steemer handles local media buying internally, Mr. Denari says, while national buying and planning are handled by Starcom in Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe.
 On the Stanley Steemer YouTube channel, visitors can watch the commercials as well as extended versions of some and outtakes from others.
 There are also plans for print advertisements and online ads, Mr. Denari says.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Narrows Loss as Demand and Prices Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Alcoa said on Monday that it narrowed its first-quarter loss as demand for some aluminum products picked up and prices improved. 
 For the quarter that ended March 31, Alcoa reported a net loss of $201 million, or 20 cents a share.
 That compared with a net loss of $497 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company was struggling with the impact of the recession.
 Alcoa's most recent results include $295 million, or 29 cents a share, in one-time charges related to the health care reform law and the closing of two smelters.
 Revenue rose nearly 20 percent, to $4.9 billion, from $4.1 billion.
 The company said it expected sales to improve with the growing popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and sustainable products made with aluminum.
 ''Our markets are gradually improving, and both policy trends and consumer sentiment bode well for aluminum demand,'' said Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa's chief executive. 
 Alcoa's average realized price per metric ton of aluminum in the first quarter was $2,331, up from $1,567 in the same period a year earlier.
 Alcoa, which is based in New York, reported its results after the close of market trading. In the after-hours session, its stock fell 7 cents, to $14.50 a share. 
 Alcoa is the first company in the Dow Jones industrial average to issue earnings results this period. Its performance can reflect economic trends because of its broad customer base, which includes industries as diverse as aerospace, construction, electronics and beverage cans.

HEADLINE: Arts School in Harlem

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Harlem Arts School Shuts Over Financial Problems'' (news article, April 3):
 The closing of the Harlem School of the Arts is another casualty brought on by hard economic times, and once again the ones who suffer are our children. In underserved areas, centers like the Harlem School of the Arts serve an important role in the community and represent what President Obama recently meant when he said ''the best anti-poverty program is a world-class education.'' 
 The Harlem School of the Arts offered a beacon of light to the neighborhood and leveled the playing field. If the doors shut for good (as will happen if no last-minute rescue occurs), it's not just the immediate loss of service, but a reverberating loss that will stunt a generation.
 Economic upheaval should be a time when we protect institutions that provide a haven for our young people to develop their talents and strive for a better future. We must all dig deeper into our pockets, reorder our priorities and realize that an arts education is not a luxury, but as important as the air we breathe in ensuring our children's success.
 Kim Jack Riley New York, April 5, 2010
 The writer is director of the Arts Horizons LeRoy Neiman Art Center in Harlem.
 To the Editor:
 I am saddened that while New York's wealthy ''art lovers'' line up to give as much as $10 million for a seat on the boards of New York's elite arts institutions (''Trustees Find Cultural Board Seats Are Still Highly Coveted Luxury Items,'' Arts pages, April 3), the Harlem School of the Arts, an organization that democratizes access to the arts, inspires young artists and helps ensure the continuation of our great artistic traditions, is being forced to close for lack of funds.
 It seems that those who want to help the arts flourish in society should want to help make them accessible beyond high society.

HEADLINE: 4 Pulitzers for Washington Post; The Times Wins 3, Sharing in an Online Milestone

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The Washington Post won four Pulitzer Prizes on Monday for its work in 2009, and The New York Times won three, while ProPublica became the first of the new breed of online, nonprofit news organizations to win the most prestigious award in print journalism.
 The winning journalism this year covered a broad range of topics, but largely steered clear of those that had most dominated the national discussion in 2009: the financial meltdown, the rise of the Tea Party movement, the debate over health care and the partisan rancor in Washington. 
 The Bristol Herald Courier of southwestern Virginia, circulation 29,000, won the coveted prize for public service, for work by Daniel Gilbert, revealing that many energy companies failed to pay royalties on natural gas drilling and that the royalties that were paid were not reaching the local people who deserved them.
 In the arts, Paul Harding won the fiction prize for his novel ''Tinkers,'' while the drama award went to the musical ''Next to Normal,'' with music by Tom Kitt and book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. Liaquat Ahamed won the history award for ''Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,'' the biography prize went to T. J. Stiles for ''The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt'' and the general nonfiction prize went to David E. Hoffman, an editor and a former Moscow bureau chief at The Post, for ''The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy.''
 Jennifer Higdon won the music prize for her Violin Concerto, and the Pulitzer board voted a special, posthumous citation to the country singer-songwriter Hank Williams. The poetry award went to Rae Armantrout for ''Versed.''
 At The Post, Kathleen Parker, a political columnist, won the award for commentary; Sarah Kaufman won for criticism, for her writing on dance; a Washington Post magazine article by Gene Weingarten about parents who cause the death of their children by leaving them in sweltering cars won the prize for feature writing; and Anthony Shadid, a longtime Iraq correspondent, won for international reporting. Mr. Shadid, who now works for The Times, also won for his Iraq coverage in 2004. Mr. Weingarten's prize is also his second; he won for feature writing in 2008.
 ''We're obviously delighted, and we're particularly pleased with the range of work the Pulitzer Board chose to recognize,'' said Marcus W. Brauchli, executive editor of The Post. 
 Sheri Fink won in the investigative category, in a joint project of ProPublica and The Times, for her extraordinarily detailed reconstruction of what has been described as euthanasia by doctors at a New Orleans hospital after they were stranded by Hurricane Katrina. 
 Dr. Fink, who has an M.D. and a Ph.D., is a staff writer for ProPublica, and the article was published in The New York Times Magazine.
 Barbara Laker and Wendy Ruderman of The Philadelphia Daily News also won an investigative reporting prize, for exposing a rogue police narcotics squad.
 Michael Moss of The Times won in the explanatory category, for an investigation of the dangers of contaminated meat and porous government enforcement of food safety; and Matt Richtel of The Times won for the series ''Driven to Distraction,'' about the potentially fatal threat posed by drivers who indulge in texting and other electronic distractions.
 Dr. Fink's award is a landmark for ProPublica, founded in 2007, and other digital news outlets. Over the last few years, the Pulitzer Board has relaxed the eligibility rules, allowing news sites to submit work published only online.
 Raquel Rutledge of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel won the local reporting prize, for exposing fraud in Wisconsin's child care subsidy program, a series of articles that led to criminal indictments and changes in state law. 
 Coverage of the shooting death of four police officers in a coffee shop won the breaking news award for the staff of The Seattle Times.
 Mary Chind of The Des Moines Register won the breaking news photography award for her photograph of ''the heart-stopping moment when a rescuer dangling in a makeshift harness tries to save a woman trapped in the foaming water beneath a dam,'' while the feature photography prize went to Craig F. Walker of The Denver Post for his portraits of a teenaged Army recruit through enlistment, training and deployment in Iraq.
 Tod Robberson, Colleen McCain Nelson and William McKenzie of The Dallas Morning News shared the award for editorial writing. 
 Mark Fiore, a self-syndicated cartoonist, won the editorial cartooning award for his animated work that appears on SFGate.com, the first purely online entry ever to win a Pulitzer.

HEADLINE: SUNY to Focus on Revitalizing the State

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
The State University of New York wants to expand its online offerings and capitalize on changes in health care and education over the next five years in an effort to turn the system into an economic engine for the state, according to a strategic plan to be unveiled on Tuesday by its chancellor, Nancy L. Zimpher.
 The plan, almost a year in the making, is the result of Dr. Zimpher's tour of all 64 campuses and several town-hall-style meetings that focused on different themes, from diversity to sustainability. She had pledged such a process when she was appointed chancellor early last year and had won praise for a similar undertaking as president of the University of Cincinnati. 
 The 21-page plan -- relying on broad strokes more than on specifics -- lays out more than a dozen initiatives and declares that from ''2010 forward, SUNY's priority is the economic revitalization of the State of New York and a better quality of life for all its citizens.''
 The plan calls for better coordination among colleges and universities in the system, which has more than 465,000 students, and a deeper involvement by student bodies and faculties in their communities, which, in many areas upstate, are still ailing in the wake of manufacturing's retreat. 
 Among the specific ideas in the plan are an ''urban-rural teacher corps'' that would redirect teacher preparation from theory toward more practical classroom skills, a movement also championed by President Obama's education secretary, Arne Duncan; a new online health care database that would test and develop national standards for treatment and delivery; and an entrepreneurial SWAT team of sorts that would identify research projects with commercial promise and help move them to market. 
 The plan also contemplates a significant expansion of SUNY's online educational offerings, with an eye toward developing an international market. SUNY now offers 4,700 courses online in 153 degree programs.
 By making a case that an investment in SUNY is an investment in the state's struggling economy, Dr. Zimpher is trying to stanch the deep cuts in state support to the SUNY system. Since 2008, SUNY's campus budgets have been cut six times by a total of $424 million.
 She is also hoping to win passage of Gov. David A. Paterson's proposed legislation that would let the SUNY and the City University of New York boards set their own tuitions while allowing differing rates, depending on the programs, within those systems. The bill would also give SUNY regulatory relief in signing contracts, leasing land and procuring equipment.
 The strategic plan does not depend on passage of the legislation, which has support in the Senate but has run into trouble in the Assembly, where some lawmakers are concerned about the tuition proposals. But Dr. Zimpher said that the new revenue she expects from the legislation, called the Public Higher Education Empowerment and Innovation Act, would help its future.
 ''The way we have thought about it is that the strategic plan is the road map and the empowerment act is our license to drive,'' she said. 
 She added, ''The speed with which we can implement, and the comprehensiveness of our implementation, depend on the elements of the act.''
 Another goal of the plan is to keep SUNY graduates in the state. The plan notes that, nationally, 43 percent of the founders of start-up companies establish them in the state where they receive their academic degrees. Only about 20 percent of New York's college graduates who found companies do so in the state. The plan would bring successful local entrepreneurs to campuses to serve as mentors for students and professors.
 To help students set down roots near campuses, the plan recommends creating partnerships between colleges and cultural institutions that would provide free or discounted admission for students and faculty.
 In the area of energy and sustainability, the plan says, SUNY's resources ''sometimes fall short of their potential'' because of a lack of coordination; it recommends better integration of ''energy specialists'' from academia, business and government. 
 The plan also pledges a 30 percent reduction over the next decade in energy consumption by SUNY, whose annual bill is $280 million. ''We're a big user,'' Dr. Zimpher said, ''so we need to be a big saver.''

HEADLINE: History Is Hardly on Greece's Side

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and NICHOLAS PAISNER

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund is back at the peak of its power and relevance. But with Greece it has taken on a novel challenge: helping to repair a sovereign government's finances with neither a default nor a currency devaluation. No bailout in modern history has managed such a feat.
 With 30 billion euros ($40.5 billion) pledged by Greece's partners, and up to 15 billion ($20.2 billion) more expected from the I.M.F., this would be a monster package, equivalent to almost 20 percent of Greece's economic output. Yet, it may not be enough. 
 When debt burdens become intolerable, nations typically adopt an ''all of the above'' approach, forcing haircuts on creditors and allowing the national currency to sink.
 Occasionally, nations can choose between the two. When countries struggled to honor obligations to bond holders (Mexico in 1994, Korea in 1997 and Turkey in 2000) gigantic devaluations were necessary. In each of these I.M.F.-brokered workouts, local currencies lost close to 60 percent of their value against the dollar.
 Rarer still are nations that have restructured while holding on to a cherished currency peg. Panama succeeded in the late 1980s, but only at the cost of an ugly default, which at one point seemed to threaten even repayment of sacrosanct I.M.F. loans.
 Sadly for Greece, it would need to blaze a trail to repair its finances while also dodging default and devaluation. Early signs from Latvia, trying the same, are discouraging. Fiscal restraint has contributed to a nearly 20 percent fall in output while still leaving the deficit at 8 percent of G.D.P.
 On financial grounds alone, the feat looks tough for Greece. Before its record-breaking default in 2001, Argentina's public debt was 62 percent of G.D.P. and its deficit 6.4 percent. Greece's obligations are almost twice that size, with debt to G.D.P. at 114 percent and a deficit of 12.7 percent. Argentina defaulted and its currency dropped heavily.
 Greece's ace is its euro zone membership. The federal government in the United States has hauled several delinquent sub-sovereign entities back from the brink of default, including New York City in 1975 with a $2.3 billion credit line. But it did so with great regret, on a modest scale (the loan amounted to just about 3 percent of the city's output), and has let more than 30 municipalities go bust since 1980. Still, it's hard to imagine frugal German taxpayers providing more cash if the current aid proves insufficient.
 An I.M.F. package may help euro zone leaders plug the gap for a while. But if history is any guide, Greece still remains at risk of default or a humiliating exit from the euro.
 Sticking With UBS
 UBS's worst days may be behind it. The Swiss bank said on Monday that it expected to make a pretax quarterly profit of at least 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion). With two profitable quarters under its belt, the turnaround appears to be under way.
 The firm did not provide a divisional breakdown, but it seems as if the fixed income, currency and commodity trading unit had a bumper quarter. Volatile currency and bond markets, as Greece flirted with default, have helped. But UBS insiders also say it has been taking market share back from crisis winners.
 It also appears UBS is stemming the flow of client assets from its private bank and wealth management arms.
 After UBS lost some 56 billion Swiss francs ($52.5 billion) in the last quarter of 2009, many investors feared the businesses were mortally wounded. Outflows have now slowed considerably.
 There are still doubts whether UBS can hit its ambitious targets. It is looking for annual pretax profit of 15 billion Swiss francs ($14 billion) in the ''medium term,'' about 50 percent ahead of the current pace. That will be a challenge.
 Fixed-income markets aren't likely to stay in their current sweet spot. What's more, UBS, led by Oswald J. Grubel, its chief executive, still must show its private bank can bring in assets -- not just stanch their departure.
 Still, investors who have stuck with UBS are seeing their patience pay off. Following a 38 percent rise in the stock price since its mid-February low, UBS now trades at about 12 times this year's earnings. That's not cheap.
 But with the bank's recovery looking more assured, the shares could easily have further to run in the short term.

HEADLINE: Nets Are Looking Ahead to a Fresh Start in a New Home

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Larry Brown coached the Nets' first N.B.A. game here, long before it was named Izod Center and long before it was named Continental Airlines Arena. 
 ''We got off to a horrible start,'' Brown said of a power outage during an exhibition loss to the Knicks in 1981 at the freshly minted Brendan Byrne Arena. ''There was some concern whether I'd last three weeks into the season. Maybe that was an omen.''
 Things became brighter for Brown, but not so much for the arena. Brown did not get to open the building. The honors instead went to Bruce Springsteen. Brown did help close it on Monday, at least as far as the N.B.A. is concerned. 
 After nearly 3 decades and 1,173 N.B.A. games, the Nets will move to Newark's Prudential Center for an expectant two-year pit stop en route to a new home in Brooklyn. 
 Brown, who coached the Charlotte Bobcats in a 105-95 win in the Nets' final game at Izod Center, did not wax nostalgic. 
 ''If you've outlasted buildings, I guess you gotta feel like you've had a long career,'' he said. 
 That an opposing coach held a more significant bond to the arena than any player or coach on the Nets' roster was a sign of Brown's unrest (after the Nets, he coached the University of Kansas, then the Spurs, Clippers, Pacers, 76ers, Pistons and Knicks before landing in Charlotte) and the topsy-turvy state of the Nets.
 The Nets join several New York-area sports teams -- the Yankees and Mets and Giants and Jets -- to find a new home. But the Nets' departure is different. They announced intentions to move to Brooklyn several years ago, ostracizing much of the fan base. 
 Since then, the organization slashed payroll and traded recognizable faces. They lost millions of dollars each year while performing for what can kindly be described as a tidy crowd. 
 There were few moments of reflection Monday. Center Josh Boone is finishing his fourth year with the team and is the franchise's longest-tenured player by two years. No former great players came to commemorate the move. At halftime, the court hosted a musical chairs contest. Center Brook Lopez's thank you to the announced crowd of 14,118 and a video montage were some of the only hints of the move.
 ''I'm not going to pretend this has been easy on a day-to-day basis,'' the interim coach Kiki Vandeweghe said. ''It's been tough.''
 The Nets flirted with the N.B.A.'s worst record before their recent uptick. They have 12 wins, and one game left, in Miami. 
 Still, Vandeweghe attempted to paint a brighter picture. 
 ''They all like to play, so they don't want it to end,'' Vandeweghe said of his roster before quickly adding, ''on some level.''
 All good things come to an end. Logic would say that bad things end, too. The move is more a necessary purging than a fond parting. The future is hopefully bright, the present hopelessly bleak. The Nets look forward to turning the page, having already unveiled a new slogan: ''It's All New.'' They await a high draft selection and the expected deep pockets of the prospective owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov.
 There are good memories. The arena hosted two N.B.A. finals teams. There are also bad memories. Those teams lost both finals. 
 ''Two minutes left in the building,'' the public-address announcer Gary Sussman said as the time wound down. 
 When the buzzer sounded, the departing majority owner Bruce C. Ratner stood and clapped from his courtside seat. On the other side of the court, another fan tossed confetti into the air. A row of seven fans put paper bags over their heads. Lingering fans were invited to shoot free throws.
 ''I would change it by putting more public transportation so more people can come to games,'' point guard Devin Harris said. ''Other than that, it's perfect.''
 REBOUNDS
 An N.B.A. spokesman said the Russian oligarch Mikhail D. Prokhorov was still on pace to acquire majority ownership of the Nets, despite a congressman's denouncing Prokhorov's dealings in Zimbabwe. ''U.S. companies are not prohibited from conducting business with specifically identified individuals or entities in that country,'' the spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement. ''The N.B.A. is aware of no information that Mr. Prokhorov is engaged in business dealings with any of these individuals or entities.'' The response followed a New York Post article that stated that Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, asked for Prokhorov to be investigated for violating economic sanctions with business in Zimbabwe. Prokhorov's Onexim Group called it ''erroneous media reports.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A ''Rebounds'' note in some editions on Tuesday about Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the prospective majority owner of the Nets, quoted incorrectly from a statement by the N.B.A. In addressing a report that a company owned by Mr. Prokhorov might be in violation of economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe, the statement said, ''U.S. companies are not prohibited from doing business in Zimbabwe; rather, they are prohibited from conducting business with specifically identified individuals or entities in that country.'' The statement did not say, ''U.S. companies are not prohibited from conducting business with specifically identified individuals or entities in that country.''

HEADLINE: A Dissenter on the Recession Committee

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Louis Uchitelle contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a rare public dissent, a member of the committee that officially dates the turning points in the nation's business cycles said on Monday that he thought that the recession ended last June and that the panel should have said so. 
 The committee, part of the National Bureau of Economic Research, announced on Monday that it could not yet ascertain a trough signifying the end of the contraction and the start of an expansion.
 ''I strongly disagree with the committee's decision,'' the member, Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, said in a statement afterward. 
 The panel, known as the Business Cycle Dating Committee, was established in 1978 and has assigned the dates of peaks and troughs for every business cycle since 1854. 
 In a meeting on Thursday, the committee, which has seven active members, decided to make the unusual announcement that it had met but could not declare the recession over. Discussions over the details continued by e-mail through the weekend.
 ''Although most indicators have turned up, the committee decided that the determination of the trough date on the basis of current data would be premature,'' the panel said.
 ''Many indicators are quite preliminary at this time and will be revised in coming months,'' the panel added. ''The committee acts only on the basis of actual indicators, and does not rely on forecasts.''
 The committee also reaffirmed its earlier announcement that the recession began in December 2007. 
 If the recession did end in June, it would have lasted about 18 months, two months longer than any recession since the Great Depression. 
 Mr. Gordon said on Monday that he had been ''the outvoted minority of one'' on the panel. 
 ''It is obvious that the recession is over,'' Mr. Gordon said, adding that real gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, had recovered strongly from a low point in the spring of 2009 and would soon reach, or nearly reach, its previous peak in late 2007. 
 Indicators of industrial production, manufacturing and other economic variables pointed to last June as the trough, he said.
 Other members of the committee have expressed concern that the upturn in economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, while real, could be followed by a so-called double-dip recession. Such a downturn could, depending on its timing and magnitude, potentially be considered part of the same recession that began in 2007. 
 Mr. Gordon said, ''The committee thought that, even if that probability was extremely small, it would be very costly to the committee to be proved wrong after the fact,'' if it prematurely declared the recession over. 
 He said that there were ''no plausible shocks'' that could drive the economy below its last trough. Rather, if another cyclical downturn were to occur in the next year or two, Mr. Gordon argued, it would be considered a new recession, just as the 1981-82 recession was considered separate from the downturn of January to July 1980.

HEADLINE: Naming a New Chief, MasterCard Signals It Is Open to Changes

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
MasterCard named a onetime star at Citigroup as its next chief executive on Monday, a widely expected move that could nonetheless shake up the giant payment company. The appointment of the executive, Ajay Banga, is to take effect on July 1, the company said. MasterCard hired Mr. Banga as president and chief operating officer last August and signaled early that he would succeed Robert W. Selander, who has held the top job since 1997. 
 Mr. Banga was also appointed to the company's board, effective immediately. The promotion is a sharp turn for MasterCard, which has a reputation for being as conservative and refined as the surroundings of its campus in Purchase, N.Y. 
 Mr. Banga, 50, has substantial international experience, having spent much of his career managing Citigroup's overseas credit card and consumer banking businesses. Before joining MasterCard, he spent a year overseeing the bank's operations in Asia, splitting time between Manhattan and Hong Kong. 
 He also has a background in brand management. Early in his career, he helped introduce the Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises to India. 
 Where Mr. Selander is reserved, Mr. Banga is outgoing and gregarious and is known for his extensive network of contacts, stretching from New York to New Delhi. Mr. Banga, a native of India, is also a Sikh and wears the turban that distinguishes worshipers of his religion.
 Mr. Selander, 59, is retiring from MasterCard with a pile of cash. He took home more than $149 million over the last nine years in salary, bonuses and stock he cashed out, according to an analysis of corporate filings conducted by Equilar, a compensation research business. He also has a pension worth $3.7 million and an additional $33.3 million in stock and options. 
 Mr. Banga was estimated to have made about $13.5 million in 2009, according to filings, mostly from a large sign-on bonus and stock award to make up for compensation he was giving up by leaving Citigroup. MasterCard has not released the final details of Mr. Banga's compensation.
 He joins a small but influential group of India-born corporate leaders, including Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup and Indra K. Nooyi of PepsiCo. 
 Mr. Banga delights in pointing out that he did not attend an elite American university, as did his other chief executive countrymen. Instead, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from Delhi University in India and is an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
 Vindi Banga, Mr. Banga's brother, was a top executive at Unilever, the food and household goods giant, until he resigned last month. The financial press in India once ranked the brothers among the country's most influential leaders. 
 At a news conference on Monday, Ajay Banga said he had spent his first months at MasterCard traveling the globe to meet clients, employees and regulators. He said he would focus on improving revenue growth and market share in the company's core businesses of credit, debit and prepaid cards. He said he also would emphasize innovation in areas like mobile payments and online commerce and diversifying the company's revenue stream across the globe. 
 About 45 percent of MasterCard's revenue comes from the United States. Visa, its main rival, by contrast, reports deriving 59 percent of its revenue from the United States and is more than twice as big. 
 Mr. Banga said that MasterCard, like its competitors, is benefiting from a broad trend away from cash and checks and toward electronic forms of payment.
 Adam Frisch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Mr. Banga's experience would come in handy because emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are important areas of growth for the payment industry. He also said MasterCard needed to remain a leader in new technologies like mobile payments because many new competitors are emerging in those areas.
 Mr. Frisch praised Mr. Selander's tenure at MasterCard, where he will remain on the board through 2010. But after 13 years at the helm, ''a change of C.E.O. may be a good thing,'' Mr. Frisch said. 
 ''Mr. Banga's reputation is that of someone who's not afraid to change things around,'' Mr. Frisch said. ''I think there's a fair amount that Ajay will leave unchanged, but it will be interesting to see how he puts his stamp on the company.''

HEADLINE: The Long Story of a Long Revolution

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
''Invictus'' isn't the only recent film to look at apartheid and the complicated legacy it left in South Africa. But unlike Clint Eastwood and his cast, Connie Field has taken the documentary route in ''Have You Heard From Johannesburg,'' a series of seven films that will have its world premiere this week at Film Forum in Manhattan. 
 Clocking in at eight and a half hours, ''Have You Heard From Johannesburg,'' which takes its title from a line in a 1976 song by Gil Scott-Heron, is meant to inspire and inform, not just entertain. 
 ''I come from a perspective where nothing is neutral, but which recognizes that it is very important to have multiple perspectives,'' said Ms. Field, whose earlier projects include the acclaimed 1981 film ''The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter.''
 Ms. Field has been working on the ''Johannesburg'' project since the mid-1990s, when she finished ''Freedom on My Mind,'' a documentary about the civil rights movement in the United States that was nominated for an Academy Award. She said she had originally conceived of a four-hour television series, but after her first trip to South Africa in 1996 she gradually came to realize that a much richer and complex tale was waiting to be told.
 The struggle against apartheid was not just a South African story, she said, but also had an international component. That led her to focus on the relationship between the domestic South African anti-apartheid movement and its allies abroad, and took her to places like the United States, Britain, the Netherlands and Norway.
 ''This was the largest and most globalized human rights struggle of the 20th century, and unique in that what the outside world was asked to do was very strategic,'' she said. ''It's really a model of how people in a country in an oppressive situation can work with people elsewhere'' to ''move from racism and colonialism to more democratic societies.''
 The ''Johannesburg'' project is something of a departure for Ms. Field, 60, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area and is best known for her work on American themes. The initial suggestion came from a friend who went with her to see Nelson Mandela speak at the Oakland Coliseum in 1990, and by the middle of the decade, she said, ''I had decided I really wanted to do something that was international.'' 
 Because of the sheer size of the series, the films, which range from 57 to 95 minutes each, will be shown in blocks of two or three during their two-week run at Film Forum, which starts Wednesday. Some of them, however, were made so that they can stand independently. 
 A preliminary version of ''From Selma to Soweto,'' the fifth in the series, for instance, was released in 2006 under the title ''Apartheid and the Club of the West,'' and examines the role that black Americans played in moving the United States from support of white rule to sanctions. Another of the films, ''Fair Play,'' looks at the international sports boycott against South Africa, while ''The Bottom Line'' analyzes grass-roots efforts to force multinational companies to divest their holdings in South Africa, which ultimately crippled the regime.
 The films benefited from the willingness of many of the leaders of the African National Congress, the party that today governs South Africa, to share their memories of pacific resistance, jail, exile and armed struggle. But Mr. Mandela is not the central figure in the series. He was imprisoned from 1962 to 1990, almost the entire period the films cover, and by the time Ms. Field began filming in South Africa, he was already president of the country and unavailable for the detailed interview she wanted. 
 Some other subjects -- like the longstanding and sometimes violent rivalries among the A.N.C., the Pan Africanist Congress and Zulu-dominated organizations -- receive only cursory treatment or are omitted altogether.
 ''Had I been able to make 12 hours, all of that would have been there,'' Ms. Field said. ''But in order to tell the story clearly, I had to come up with a formula that was somewhat chronological but also schematic. So you have to end up having to make choices, and as you shape things, some things had to fall by the wayside and ended up on the cutting-room floor, including some people who are heroes to me.''
 If ''Have You Heard From Johannesburg'' can be said to have a hero, it would be Oliver Tambo. He led the A.N.C. from exile in London for nearly 30 years, acting as the public face of the anti-apartheid movement and in later years communicating secretly via computer diskette with Mr. Mandela, the film reveals. But he died a year before democratic rule was finally achieved.
 ''It is not a personal story about him,'' Ms. Field said. ''But he is kind of the unsung hero, the central backbone of this entire movement. Nobody knows much about him, and they should.''
 The films also include footage from interviews with members of the white Afrikaaner elite and Orwellian official propaganda that shows cheerful blacks said to be delighted at ''homelands'' where they ''can control their own destiny.'' 
 Former Presidents P. W. Botha and his successor F. W. de Klerk are represented mostly by their often bellicose public statements. But three officials from lower levels of the bureaucracy make remarkably frank admissions to Ms. Field about their efforts to continue apartheid as an economic and political system.
 Like ''The Battle of Algiers,'' the 1966 film about the violent struggle against French colonial rule in Algeria, ''Have You Heard From Johannesburg'' functions almost as a manual on how to topple an unjust regime. Ms. Field's films demonstrate ''that with decades of persistence and faith, it is possible to build up a movement against very powerful forces,'' said E. S. Reddy, a retired Indian diplomat who led the United Nations' efforts against apartheid and appears in the series.
 ''You have to be patient and build up,'' he continued. ''So long as the issue is very clear, it is possible to move mountains by giving people facts, and she has done very well in showing that.''

HEADLINE: In-Flight Food Tries to Be Tasty

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Those bland sandwiches sold by airlines to economy-class passengers? They're on the way out. 
 Even as the last major airline -- Continental Airlines -- is ending free economy-class meals on domestic flights this fall, carriers are changing their whole approach to food. 
 Air Canada has introduced healthy food options, like vegetarian sandwiches and yogurt parfaits, and Alaska Airlines has a new healthy snack pack. American Airlines is working with Boston Market. JetBlue is about to start selling food on select long-haul flights. Some carriers are expected to offer combination meals and other promotions similar to those available at fast-food restaurants. 
 And United Airlines is testing the sale of some food items sold on domestic flights, and a variety of sandwiches, in its Red Carpet lounges at Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. It will also let passengers preorder in-flight food by the end of the year. 
 The new offerings are in large part the result of the new economics of in-flight food. Kevin Jackson, managing director of consumer marketing for US Airways, said that when airlines gave away food, ''the motivation was to minimize cost.'' Now that most airlines are selling food, they have an incentive, he said, to ''provide better choice and quality for passengers.''
 In addition, the airlines are competing with new restaurants and take-out food businesses in the airports. Executives of HMSHost and OTG Management, which operate airport food businesses, said sales were thriving, and to-go options -- Wolfgang Puck Gourmet Express, California Pizza Kitchen's stand-alone airport kiosks and Cibo Express, among them -- were proliferating, particularly since the demise of free food on most domestic flights. 
 With many more options on the ground, most hungry travelers seem to be bringing food on board. A survey conducted by Forrester Research in the fourth quarter of 2009 found that 19 percent of leisure travelers and 21 percent of business travelers bought a meal or snack on a plane in the previous year. If a free in-flight meal was not offered, only 6 percent of travelers polled in Zagat Survey's 2009 airlines poll said they typically purchased food on-board, but 56 percent said they bought it in the airport.
 Indeed, in-flight food sales are not huge money-makers for the airlines. Tom Douramakos, chief executive of GuestLogix, a company based in Toronto that makes the hand-held devices and software used by most North American carriers for in-flight sales, said carriers generated a net profit of only 5 or 10 cents on a $10 sale of in-flight food. But, he said, gross profit on sales of in-flight liquor generally can go as high as 50 to 80 percent on a $10 drink.
 That may explain the growing offerings of elaborate specialty drinks on flights. These include Virgin America's absinthe and Sprite cocktail, United Airlines' Trader Vic's mai tai cocktails on Hawaiian flights and a pomegranate martini served by Delta Air Lines and US Airways. Carriers continue to serve free nonalcoholic drinks on most flights. 
 For the most part, American airlines stopped serving free meals in economy class on domestic flights after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks cut deeply into their profits. As airlines sought new ways to generate revenue and cut costs, food was one of the first places they looked.
 Jim Compton, Continental's executive vice president of marketing, said in an e-mail message that the airline expected that introducing in-flight food sales this fall would ''add about $35 million per year to our bottom line.'' According to Henry H. Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, most of this profit will come from eliminating the cost of serving free food.
 The airlines' adoption of GuestLogix's equipment, used by flight attendants for what are usually credit card sales of food and drinks, and to keep track of inventory, makes the sales process easier for both carriers and passengers: Airlines can monitor the popularity of items and use the information to provision flights, while travelers do not have to fumble for change and can get expense receipts for purchases. 
 Mr. Douramakos predicted that GuestLogix's technology would allow airlines to offer more combination meals, including a drink, snack and sandwich or salad, an option now available on Air Canada. He said he expected carriers to distribute coupons with food or drinks bought in-flight, good for discounts on future purchases, and also to deeply discount items that remained unsold as a flight progressed. The technology, he added, will allow airlines to operate more like restaurateurs. 
 The question is whether all the changes in on-board food will actually influence travelers' behavior. Richard Wong, a transportation lawyer in Washington, said he refused to buy food in-flight ''because there's nothing attractive about it'' and prefers to dine on hamburgers and French fries sold by Five Guys at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
 On the other hand, Rob Volpe, a market researcher in San Francisco who is an elite-level participant in United Airlines' frequent-flier program, said he was a devotee of United's on-board food items, like a yogurt parfait and snack boxes with small portions of a variety of items. And he has purchased the parfait and a mozzarella and tomato sandwich at Red Carpet lounges. 
 ''I've been buying snack boxes since they were first rolled out, and I'm always delighted to be offered something healthy,'' he said. ''It's kind of a picnic in the air. It's one less thing I have to carry on board when I have bags, and it's something I don't have to think about while I'm trying to get to my flight.'' 
 However in-flight food sales change in the future, one thing will probably remain constant: Snacks like Pringles and candy will undoubtedly remain best sellers.
 When there are ''healthy and less healthy options,'' the less healthy are always more popular, said Paul Platamone, who supplies food to airlines for LSG Sky Chefs, an in-flight catering company. 
 ''It has to do with the travel mentality,'' he said. ''When you're on the road, you become a bit more indulgent.''

HEADLINE: 'This Week' Is Adding Online Fact Checks

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ABC's Sunday morning public affairs program, ''This Week,'' is adding an online feature that its political guests may not appreciate: fact checking.
 The program is promoting an arrangement with the Web site PolitiFact.com whereby its editors apply its ''Truth-O-Meter'' -- true, half true, false, ''pants on fire!'' -- to the administration officials and lawmakers who are interviewed. 
 The fact checking, which started Sunday, stands in stark contrast to the he-said, she-said nature of most television chatfests, even though PolitiFact's work takes place well after the facts and possible falsehoods are first uttered on TV. Both the Web site and ABC said that the checking is just an experiment, but it is already drawing attention online as a small measure of accountability for politicians and television interviewers. 
 Jake Tapper, the interim anchor of ''This Week,'' informed viewers of the fact checking at the end of the program on Sunday. ''I'm supposed to be the first line of defense,'' he said in an interview here at the Newseum, where the program is produced. ''But this is an acknowledgment that immediate fact checking is often not as easy as it sounds.'' 
 PolitiFact published its first findings about seven hours after the program was shown on Sunday. It found that the statement by Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, that President Obama once ''attempted to filibuster'' a Supreme Court nominee was fully true, and the assertion by Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates that ''the policy of the Bush administration was also not to add new nuclear capabilities'' was ''half true.''
 The fact checking was suggested by Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University. (Separately Mr. Rosen is collaborating with The New York Times on a community blog.) He wrote in a blog post last December that the format of Sunday shows like ''This Week'' -- which rise and fall depending on their A-list political bookings -- are ''broken'' in part because they allow guests to evade questions and distort facts without sufficient follow-ups from the hosts. Fact checking, he said, would be a ''simple fix.''
 ''The midweek fact check (in the spirit of PolitiFact.com, which could even be hired for the job ...) might, over time, exert some influence on the speakers on Sunday,'' he wrote. ''At the very least it would guide the producers in their decisions about whom to invite back.'' 
 Mr. Tapper said he felt that Mr. Rosen's diagnosis was ''a little strong,'' but he was intrigued by the fact check idea, which was circulated widely last winter.
 ''In a perfect world it would be like 'Pop-Up Video' on VH1,'' Mr. Tapper said. ''Senator so-and-so says the sky is red. Woop! The sky is blue. But generally speaking, the things that are worth fact checking are rarely that starkly, patently false.'' He also noted that the research takes time. So he recruited Bill Adair, the editor of PolitiFact, whom he first met in 2007 at a forum about the rise of media fact checking. A project of The St. Petersburg Times, PolitiFact won a Pulitzer Prize last year for national reporting. PolitiFact says it exists to ''help you find the truth in politics.''
 In a telephone interview on Sunday Mr. Adair said: ''The media in general has shied away from fact checking to a large extent because of fears that we'd be called biased, and also because I think it's hard journalism.
 ''It's a lot easier to give the on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand kind of journalism and leave it to readers to sort it out. But that isn't good enough these days. The information age has made things so chaotic, I think it's our obligation in the mainstream media to help people sort out what's true and what's not.''
 Critics say that kind of truth telling rarely happens on television. But David Gregory, the moderator of ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, said that accountability is ''in the DNA'' of his program. He said he had considered Mr. Rosen's idea but concluded that people can fact check the program on their own online.
 But some say that TV misstatements demand attention from the networks themselves. After Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, said on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' last month that the United States government was ''taking over ownership or control of 51 percent of the American economy,'' CBSNews.com published a report specifying that she had ''offered no facts'' to back it up.
 Another ABC program, ''Good Morning America,'' endured criticism in January when Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, said without being challenged that ''we had no domestic attacks under Bush, we've had one under Obama.'' Mr. Giuliani omitted the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The interviewer, George Stephanopoulos, admitted online later that he had made a mistake in not following up.
 The mea culpas, when they come, usually come only on the Internet, where they are apt to reach fewer people. Mr. Tapper, the White House correspondent who is the anchor of ''This Week'' until his replacement, Christiane Amanpour, takes over in August, does not currently plan a weekly television segment summarizing the previous week's half-truths. He said that ''our show is about the news today and not what was said a week ago.''
 Perhaps most important, Mr. Adair cautioned that PolitiFact's output depends on how many facts -- as opposed to opinions -- are actually mentioned on the program each week.
 ''There's definitely a sense that if there's a policeman standing on a corner, there might not be as much crime nearby,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 2010 Pulitzer Prizes

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
The Pulitzer Prizes were announced on Monday.
 Paul Harding won the fiction prize for his novel ''Tinkers,'' while the drama award went to the musical ''Next to Normal,'' with music by Tom Kitt and book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. Liaquat Ahamed won the history award for ''Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,'' the biography prize went to T. J. Stiles for ''The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt'' and the general nonfiction prize went to David E. Hoffman for ''The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy.''
 Jennifer Higdon won the music prize for her Violin Concerto while the poetry award went to Rae Armantrout for ''Versed.'' 
 The complete list of winners in Letters, Drama and Music is below.
 FICTION: ''Tinkers,'' by Paul Harding 
 ''Tinkers,'' a debut novel, is about the memories of a dying man, George Washington Crosby, who remembers being abandoned by his father, an epileptic. Mr. Harding, 42, teaches creative writing at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop and said the seed of the novel came from his grandfather's spare reminisces of his own father. ''I could never get him to elaborate on it,'' Mr. Harding said. ''So of course it became irresistible to me.''
 Finalists: ''Love in Infant Monkeys,'' by Lydia Millet; ''In Other Rooms, Other Wonders,'' by Daniyal Mueenuddin.
 DRAMA: ''Next to Normal,'' music by Tom Kitt; book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey.
 ''Next to Normal,'' about a family shattered by mental illness, is the eighth musical to win in the 92 years of the category. The Pulitzer Board commended the work for expanding ''the scope of subject matter for musicals.'' Mr. Kitt, 36, and Mr. Yorkey, 39, writing partners since 1994, said they had been inspired by the last two musicals to win the Pulitzer,''Rent''(1996) and ''Sunday in the Park With George'' (1985). ''They broke ground the way we wanted to,'' Mr. Yorkey said.
 Finalists: ''The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity,'' by Kristoffer Diaz; ''Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,'' by Rajiv Joseph; ''In the Next Room (or the vibrator play),'' by Sarah Ruhl.
 HISTORY: ''Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World,'' by Liaquat Ahamed
 Long before the banking system buckled in 2008, Mr. Ahamed, a 57-year-old economist born in Kenya, was already examining the 1930s to see what lessons could be gleaned for our own era. His book, begun in 2004 and the first he has written, is, the award citation says, ''a compelling account'' of how four powerful central bankers ''played crucial roles in triggering the Great Depression'' with mistaken policies.
 Finalists: ''Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City,'' by Greg Grandin; ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789-1815,'' by Gordon S. Wood.
 BIOGRAPHY: ''The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,'' by T.J. Stiles
 Vanderbilt is one of those names that Americans instantly recognize, but Mr. Stiles, 45, said he was drawn to the founder of the dynasty because he was ''one of the most misunderstood of the major figures in American history.'' Writing about ''the Commodore'' was a challenge, Mr. Stiles said, because he did not keep a diary or leave behind letters or documents. But scouring 19th-century public records and the papers of Vanderbilt's various railway corporations helped Mr. Stiles produce what the award citation called ''a penetrating portrait of a complex, self-made titan.''
 Finalists: ''Woodrow Wilson: A Biography,'' by John Milton Cooper Jr.; ''Cheever: A Life,'' by Blake Bailey.
 POETRY: ''Versed,'' by Rae Armantrout
 In her ninth volume of poetry, Ms. Armantrout, 62, explored themes of war and illness, driven by the war in Iraq and her own diagnosis of adrenal cortical cancer. ''You could say there are things happening in your body that you can't control and you don't want them to be happening,'' said Ms. Armantrout, ''and there are things in your society that you can't control and you don't want them to be happening.''
 Finalists: ''Tryst,'' by Angie Estes; ''Inseminating the Elephant,'' by Lucia Perillo.
 GENERAL NONFICTION: ''The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy,'' by David E. Hoffman
 Mr. Hoffman, 56, a contributing editor and former Moscow bureau chief for The Washington Post, relied heavily on never-before-seen documents from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. ''I hope to open people's eyes that secrecy, mistrust and suspicion are as dangerous as weapons of mass destruction,'' Mr. Hoffman said Monday. The Pulitzer Board called the book ''a well-documented narrative that examines the terrifying doomsday competition between two superpowers.''
 Finalists: ''How Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamities,'' by John Cassidy; ''The Evolution of God,'' by Robert Wright.
 MUSIC: ''Violin Concerto,'' by Jennifer Higdon, premiered Feb. 6, 2009, in Indianapolis
 Ms. Higdon, 47, won for the concerto she composed for the young soloist Hilary Hahn, which was first heard in a performance by Ms. Hahn and the Indianapolis Symphony on Feb. 6, 2009.
 Ms. Higdon, born in Brooklyn, took up composition when she was 21. She writes in an accessible, melodic style.

HEADLINE: 2010 Pulitzer Prizes

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
The Pulitzer Prizes were announced on Monday. Following are the winners in Journalism.
 PUBLIC SERVICE: BRISTOL (Va.) HERALD COURIER 
 The Herald Courier was honored for the work of 28-year-old Daniel Gilbert, who spent over a year investigating the ''murky mismanagement of natural-gas royalties owed to thousands of land owners in southwest Virginia,'' according to the Pulitzer citation.
 The subject had been pitched three previous times but never completed, according to the paper's editor, J. Todd Foster. Mr. Gilbert was finally given the go-ahead in 2008. ''There's been a simmering anger over the years about this issue, and it has fueled a deep, deep distrust over the energy companies here,'' Mr. Gilbert said.
 Finalists: The Asbury Park Press; Los Angeles Times and ProPublica. 
 BREAKING NEWS REPORTING: THE SEATTLE TIMES
 The staff of The Times was honored for its print and online coverage of the shooting deaths of four police officers in a coffee shop and the ensuing 40-hour hunt for the suspect. David Boardman, the paper's executive editor, said the story ''was a test of our new tools and techniques of reporting online,'' including the use of Twitter. ''Every bit of news we got, we held nothing back from the Web for the print edition.''
 Finalists: The Star-Ledger, Newark, N.J.; The Washington Post.
 INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING: SHERI FINK, PROPUBLICA/THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE; BARBARA LAKER AND WENDY RUDERMAN, THE PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS
 Dr. Fink, 41, wrote ''The Deadly Choices At Memorial'' on behalf of ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine on the decisions made by a hospital coping with Hurricane Katrina's aftermath. ''I hope the story brings awareness to the way that disasters can strain our medical system,'' said Dr. Fink, ''and leads to more investment in preparedness, commitment to medical ethics and creative ways to expand resources in difficult situations.''
 Ms. Laker, 52, and Ms. Ruderman, 40, won for their series ''Tainted Justice,'' which ''exposed a rogue police narcotics squad,'' according to the prize citation. The reporting resulted in an F.B.I. investigation and subsequent reviews of other criminal cases.
 Finalists: Michael Moss OF The New York Times; Michael Braga, Chris Davis and Matthew Doig of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune.
 EXPLANATORY REPORTING: MICHAEL MOSS, THE NEW YORK TIMES
 In the course of investigating salmonella outbreaks in peanuts, Mr. Moss, 54, began hearing rumors about tainted hamburger meat. ''I thought, how could this be if the federal regulators were so good at inspecting plants?'' Mr. Moss said.
 His meticulous exploration into contaminated ground beef, focusing on a young woman paralyzed by E. coli, helped raise the curtain on gaping holes in federal regulation, spurring improvements in policy.
 Finalists: Dan Egan of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Kirsten Grind, Jeanne Lang Jones and Alwyn Scott of The Puget Sound Business Journal; The New York Times staff and Gina Kolata.
 LOCAL REPORTING: RAQUEL RUTLEDGE, THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL 
 It started with an e-mail tip from a whistleblower. Four months later, Ms. Rutledge, 42, had the first of many ''penetrating reports on the fraud and abuse'' at Wisconsin Share, a taxpayer-financed child-care system. The series, ''Cashing in on Kids,'' provoked criminal charges and new laws.
 The prize ''is a real credit to the whistleblowers out there,'' Ms. Rutledge said. ''They're the ones who risked their livelihood for this.''
 Finalists: Ben Montgomery, Waveney Ann Moore and the photographer Edmund D. Fountain of The St. Petersburg Times; painstakingDave Philipps of The Gazette, Colorado Springs.
 NATIONAL REPORTING: MATT RICHTEL, THE NEW YORK TIMES
 The ''Driven to Distraction'' series by Mr. Richtel, 43, on the potentially life-threatening effects of driving while using cell phones and other devices upended social attitudes about the popular practice. In response, legislators proposed more than 200 bills seeking to limit distractions in the car.
 Finalists: Ken Bensinger and Ralph Vartabedian of The Los Angeles Times; Greg Gordon, Kevin G. Hall and Chris Adams of McClatchy Newspapers.
 INTERNATIONAL REPORTING: ANTHONY SHADID, THE WASHINGTON POST
 One word guided Mr. Shadid, 41, as he worked to breathe life into the flagging storyline of the Iraq War: atlal, the Arabic word for remains. Mr. Shadid, now a reporter for The New York Times, wrote a series of articles around that idea and examined the lingering effects of the American presence. ''Understanding where things end up is one of the better things we can do as journalists,'' he said.
 Finalists: Borzou Daragahi of the Los Angeles Times; David Rohde of The New York Times.
 FEATURE WRITING: GENE WEINGARTEN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
 Mr. Weingarten, 58, was awarded his second Pulitzer for ''Fatal Distraction,'' his evocative, haunting article about parents who accidentally leave their children in cars, ultimately causing their death.
 Mr. Weingarten illuminated how the tragedy has struck families from all walks of life and the complicated questions each occurrence generates.
 Finalists: Dan Barry of The New York Times; Sheri Fink of ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine.
 COMMENTARY: KATHLEEN PARKER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
 Kathleen Parker, whose column has been nationally syndicated by The Washington Post Company for nearly four years, was recognized for ''her perceptive, often witty columns on an array of political and moral issues.''
 The award, Ms. Parker said Monday afternoon, was overwhelming. ''For somebody who seems to have something to say about everything, I find myself rather speechless,'' she said.
 Finalists: David Leonhardt of The New York Times; Phillip Morris of The Plain Dealer, Cleveland.
 CRITICISM: SARAH KAUFMAN, THE WASHINGTON POST
 Ms. Kaufman, 46, the dance critic of The Washington Post, was cited for ''her refreshingly imaginative approach to dance criticism, illuminating a range of issues and topics with provocative comments and original insights.'' Ms. Kaufman said Monday that ''the artists have given me great material to work with.'' After a youth spent training in dance, Ms. Kaufman described her approach as writing ''for the reader above all,'' taking on such unusual subjects as exploring Cary Grant's movements as an actor.
 Finalists: Michael Feingold of The Village Voice; A. O. Scott of The New York Times.
 EDITORIAL WRITING: TOD ROBBERSON, COLLEEN McCAIN NELSON AND WILLIAM McKENZIE, THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS
 For three years, a series of editorials under the rubric, ''Bridging Dallas' North-South Gap,'' have drawn attention to ''the longstanding economic and quality-of-life disparities between the northern and southern halves of the city,'' according to the citation.
 Mr. Robberson said Monday that the project is about addressing inequality. ''Winning a Pulitzer is, of course, a huge ego boost, but I'm more thrilled that our project has put a national spotlight on a problem that our city's leadership has failed to address for far too long.''
 Finalists: John G. Carlton of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch; John McCormick and Marie Dillon of The Chicago Tribune.
 EDITORIAL CARTOONING: MARK FIORE, SELF-SYNDICATED, APPEARING ON SFGATE.COM
 Mark Fiore is the first self-syndicated cartoonist to win a Pulitzer. His weekly animated videos, which appear on SFGate.com, the San Francisco Chronicle's Web site, tackle political and cultural subjects.
 Finalists: Tony Auth of The Philadelphia Inquirer; Matt Wuerker of Politico.
 BREAKING NEWS PHOTOGRAPHY: MARY CHIND, THE DES MOINES REGISTER
 Ms. Chind, 42, was honored for her photograph of a man rescuing a 67-year-old woman from the turbulent waters of the Des Moines River last June. Perched on the banks of the river, Ms. Chind, a staff photographer for the paper, saw several firefighters try to pluck the struggling woman from the water, with no success. Then Jason Oglesbee, a construction worker who strapped himself to a crane, was lowered within inches of the woman. ''Her hand was outstretched, and he got ahold of her forearm,'' Ms. Chind said. ''I remember hearing applause coming from all sides of the river. Then we realized what we had seen.''
 Finalists: Staff of The Associated Press; staff of The Daily News.
 FEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY: CRAIG F. WALKER, THE DENVER POST
 Mr. Walker, 43, was cited for a series, ''Ian Fisher: American Soldier,'' which the awards committee described as an ''intimate portrait of a teenager who joins the Army at the height of insurgent violence in Iraq, poignantly searching for meaning and manhood.'' The teenager, Ian Fisher, was first photographed by Mr. Walker when he was in high school contemplating the Army. Over 27 months, Mr. Walker followed him through his high school graduation, basic training, a yearlong deployment in Iraq and return to Colorado.
 Finalists: Mary F. Calvert, freelancer for The Washington Times; Robert Cohen of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

HEADLINE: Senators End Impasse on Extending Unemployment Benefits

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Monday agreed to consider a temporary extension of unemployment benefits after four Republicans joined Democrats in voting to debate the proposal, which has become the focus of an intensifying fight over deficit spending.
 Despite objections from conservative Republicans, the Senate voted 60 to 34 to move ahead with a measure that would keep checks flowing to jobless Americans who are exhausting their benefits and maintain federal subsidies for health insurance for the unemployed. The measure must clear other procedural hurdles, but Democrats hope to win its approval this week.
 The $9 billion cost of the aid would be added to the deficit, which Democrats said was justified because of the grim national employment picture. 
 ''Let us help the families who are struggling in this difficult economic time,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, who said the infusion of federal aid would help the overall economy recover.
 Most Republicans insisted that Congress should find a way to pay for the legislation rather than add to the escalating federal debt.
 ''We refuse to do the same things that families across this country do every day, and that's make a choice about priorities,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma and a main advocate of finding a way to cover the costs of the benefits through cuts in other programs.
 Four Republican senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine -- joined Democrats to overcome the legislative standoff that had resulted from Mr. Coburn's objections last month.
 ''I have pledged to do my best to change the tone in Washington,'' Mr. Brown said, ''and my vote to continue the debate rather than obstruct it serves as a step in that direction.'' 
 Benefits have lapsed for an estimated 200,000 Americans since Congress took its two-week spring break without acting on the jobless pay. Another 200,000 people could lose their aid if the impasse is not resolved this week.
 The Democratic procedural victory does not guarantee approval of the measure. Mr. Coburn and other Republicans could force Democrats to again produce 60 votes to move to a final vote or challenge the bill through budget rules.
 The measure would extend the extra unemployment pay only through early May. Lawmakers intend to try to use that time to reach agreement on differing plans already approved by the House and Senate that would provide the jobless aid and other federal benefits through the end of the year. 
 Backers of the unemployment relief say the severity of the economic collapse has caused millions of Americans to go without work for six months or more, making the federal help essential for those struggling to hold on to their homes and feed their families while looking for work.
 ''We know what they've been through,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. ''They've lost their life savings and have nowhere to turn.''
 Mr. Durbin and other Democrats noted that many Senate Republicans last year supported the bank bailout without the costs being covered and that the response to national disasters was typically provided on an emergency basis, with the money added directly to the deficit. 
 Republicans rejected Democratic assertions that they were being heartless and said they recognized the need for unemployment aid. They said, though, that the nation could no longer afford to run up the deficit over such programs, in effect making the costs the responsibility of future generations.
 ''It's a question of whether we pay for it or we simply say, put it on the tab for our kids and grandkids to pay for it,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican. 
 Government spending has become a growing issue as the two parties position themselves for the November elections. 
 Republicans, under pressure from conservative voters to try to rein in spending, see their push against the deficit as a winning position. Democrats say Republicans are being hypocritical in light of their recent support for tax cuts that added to the deficit and are now picking the wrong issue on which to make a stand.

HEADLINE: NASA, We've Got a Problem. But It Can Be Fixed.

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- During his trip to the Kennedy Space Center this week, President Obama will be confronted with an awkward political reality: when it comes to space exploration, sometimes even Republicans can be passionate advocates for the public option. 
 They've joined with Democratic colleagues in Congress to oppose Mr. Obama's plan to reduce NASA's missions and to encourage private companies' rockets to haul cargo and astronauts into space. Mr. Obama's critics accuse him of abandoning NASA's glorious trailblazing tradition -- and maybe, if your constituents have jobs at NASA, it's possible to see something pioneering about an agency whose flagship goes a few hundred miles into space. 
 But four decades after the moon landing, why isn't NASA venturing somewhere more exotic? The glory days of the Apollo moon missions were possible only because of the race against the Soviet Union, and Mr. Obama could revive that spirit by starting a new space race. But not if he gives in to demands to keep NASA wobbling along in current fashion. 
 The main problem with NASA is not lack of money. Its current budget is about the same size, when adjusted for inflation, as the average during the 1960s and early 1970s. But space exploration has become so costly that this level of financing won't even pay for a return to the Moon anytime soon, which is what prompted the White House to cancel the Bush administration's lunar mission. 
 Normally, once a pioneer makes the first trip somewhere, the cost goes down as others follow and technology improves. That's why so many colonists could follow Columbus to the New World, and why the masses today can afford to fly in Lindbergh's path back to Europe. The real costs of shipping freight by rail and air have declined by an order of magnitude since locomotives and airplanes were invented. 
 In space transportation, though, many costs have actually risen since the days of Apollo. NASA estimates that each seven-person space shuttle mission now costs about $65 million per astronaut, and outside experts say the true cost, once you add in all shuttle-related expenses, is double or triple that figure. Even a cramped trip to the space station on the Russian government's Soyuz will cost the United States more than $50 million per astronaut.
 Elon Musk has promised to do the job for just $20 million by building his own rocket, which is being readied for a test launch next month. His company, SpaceX, is saving money through innovations like assembling the rocket horizontally inside a prefab hangar here at Cape Canaveral, thereby avoiding the costs of the customized towers and scaffolding used by NASA to assemble its rockets vertically.
 The most important innovation for the space program, Mr. Musk said, would be to get away from the old ''cost plus'' model in which NASA contractors are guaranteed a profit on top of whatever costs they incur.
 ''The cost-plus approach encourages aerospace companies to find the most expensive way to do something and drag it out as long as possible,'' said 
 Mr. Musk, the entrepreneur who co-founded PayPal. ''Future contracts should be given to meet milestones based on objective design reviews and actual hardware completion. If a company meets the milestone, they get paid. If not, they don't.''
 Under Mr. Obama's new plan, there would be further encouragement for SpaceX and other private companies. The traditional aerospace companies remain leery of the plans, as my colleague Ken Chang reported Monday, but there are other upstarts besides SpaceX working on projects to get humans into space, and they would be potential competitors. 
 While private companies would ferry humans and cargo into orbit, NASA would be redirected into basic research and development of technologies for trips far beyond Earth, according to Mr. Obama's plan. This R&D, as White House officials are quick to note in preparation for their Florida trip, would provide jobs in some of the Congressional districts affected by the closing of the shuttle and lunar programs. 
 In theory, it could make sense for NASA to be doing the high-risk advanced research that could yield breakthroughs for a trip to Mars. But how much progress would NASA actually make? 
 One way to encourage innovation would be to convert some of NASA's divisions into versions of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which has successfully sent robotic probes across the solar system. The laboratory is financed by NASA but operated by CalTech, and therefore freer to innovate outside of political and Civil Service constraints. A presidential commission in 2004 recommendedthat NASA convert some of its research centers to this academic model, but the agency's bureaucracy showed little interest in surrendering control. 
 Another way to prod NASA would be to set specific goals. Robert Zubrin, the president of the Mars Society, argues that NASA has been effective only when given a definite destination and hard timetable -- the Apollo Mode, as he calls it, which is still used successfully on robotic missions. 
 But since the moon landings, he said, the human spaceflight program has been stuck in the Shuttle Mode, in which the agency develops technologies to please bureaucratic and political constituencies. Instead of looking for the best ship to reach a goal, it looked for a goal (like the space station) to justify the ship. To Dr. Zubrin, the new Obama plan looks like more of the Shuttle Mode. 
 ''The plan proposes to spend $100 billion on human spaceflight over the next 10 years in order to accomplish nothing,'' he said. ''If we are going to have a NASA human spaceflight program, it must be given a goal.'' 
 Dr. Zubrin would like to see NASA committed to a goal like building a ship to reach an asteroid by 2016 (a year that would just happen to fall within a second Obama term) as preparation for a journey to Mars. That's not a bad goal, although I can't see how the agency could afford to make the trip itself. 
 What it could do is oversee a competition among companies like SpaceX or whatever nonprofit groups wanted to participate. It could offer a series of prizes, like the cash bonus that Lindbergh collected for crossing the Atlantic. Or there could be contracts given to the competitors that would be based strictly on their performance, not on their costs. (To debate these ideas, go to nytimes.com/tierneylab.)
 What if Mr. Obama, in Kennedyesque fashion, started a race to Mars in which NASA set milestones along the way and rewarded competitors only when they passed each one? 
 ''It'd be cool to set a Mars goal,'' Mr. Musk said. ''Personally, I think it could be done in 10 years.'' Maybe he's being overoptimistic, but what's the harm in letting him -- and everyone else -- go for it?

HEADLINE: Bill Would Allow Layoffs Of Teachers With Seniority

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
When the Bloomberg administration raised the prospect of teacher layoffs this year, administration officials complained that they would be forced to get rid of the youngest newest teachers, and called on legislators to rewrite the seniority rules. 
 That wish may be one step closer. Two Democratic state lawmakers have sponsored a bill that would give principals in New York City the power to choose who should lose their jobs if the city needs to lay off teachers because of budget cuts. 
 The bill is certain to raise the ire of teachers' unions, which remain a powerful force in Albany. It could provoke also a new round of battles between the United Federation of Teachers and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who have had an icy relationship for months and are fighting over a new teachers' contract. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has said that as many 8,500 teachers would face layoffs, as the city's Education Department faces a budget cut of $600 million to $1.2 billion. Under the current law, teachers who have been in the system for the shortest amount of time would be the first to lose their jobs -- a policy commonly known as last in, first out.
 Last month, the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, released numbers showing that the layoffs would be concentrated in the one of the wealthiest and one of the poorest districts in the city: in a worst-case situation, District 7 in the South Bronx would lose 21 percent of its teachers and District 2 on the Upper East Side would lose 19 percent, according to the city analysis. Some of those teachers would be replaced by more-senior teachers from elsewhere in the system.
 ''Experience matters, but it cannot be the sole or even principal factor considered in layoff decisions,'' Mr. Klein said in a statement. ''We must be able to take into account each individual's track record of success.''
 Jonathan Bing, a Democratic assemblyman from the Upper East Side, said lobbyists from the city had approached him about sponsoring the bill soon after the city released those numbers. 
 ''There needs to be some better way to go about doing this than to simply get rid of every teacher we have hired in the last few years,'' Mr. Bing said. ''This has to be, on some level, about merit.'' 
 Mr. Bing said he had ''great respect for teachers,'' noted that the union had donated to several of his political campaigns and acknowledged that the bill would almost certainly anger it. 
 ''We are in an educational and economic crisis like no other,'' he added. 
 Under the bill, each school would form a committee of parents, teachers and administrators to determine who should be laid off.
 Seniority protection is dear to labor unions, who say that without it, employers would use layoffs to eliminate workers who make the most money. 
 Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said that in other cities that had eliminated seniority, like Washington, the rate of teacher turnover had increased, making the system less stable. 
 ''I would like to see something more fruitful to figure out how to avoid the catastrophic cuts,'' Mr. Mulgrew said Monday. 
 The city appealed to State Senator Ruben Diaz of the Bronx to sponsor the bill in the Senate, although just last year Mr. Diaz said that Mr. Klein should be fired. 
 ''I used to be angry at the way they were treating parents,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''Now this would allow parents to have a role. If a school needs to get rid of teachers, they should be able to decide their own special needs.''

HEADLINE: Trump and Bondholders Gain Control of Casinos

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump is hoping the third time will be the charm.
 As it prepares to exit bankruptcy court for the third time, Trump Entertainment Resorts and its three Atlantic City casinos will be under the control of Mr. Trump and bondholders after a court ruling on Monday. 
 Mr. Trump joined with bondholders in a successful $225 million bid that beat out a rival offer by Carl C. Icahn, known for his aggressive corporate takeovers.
 Much of the money for the bid was put up by Avenue Capital Management, a New York hedge fund. Mr. Trump will control 10 percent of the company and will have the option to increase his stake in the future.
 Rather than cash, Mr. Trump offered the bondholders the use of his name on the three casinos.
 ''The Trump brand is worth millions of dollars to the debtors,'' the bankruptcy judge, Judith Wizmur, said in her ruling. ''The debtors' identification with the Trump Organization raises its profile in the gaming industry.''
 Mr. Trump, who was forced to give up operational control in an earlier round in bankruptcy court, predicted the company would fare better than it has in the past.
 ''We're very happy, it's a great victory,'' he said in an interview. ''Icahn wanted the name, but we made the deal with bondholders.''
 Unlike the two previous bankruptcy plans, the debt of the company will be reduced sharply, falling from nearly $2 billion to less than $500 million, according to Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump's daughter and executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization. 
 ''We're going to have a large influx of new capital and we're positioning ourselves for future growth,'' she said. ''It's a great time to be a gaming company without much debt and a very healthy capital structure. Few gaming companies are currently in that position.''
 Mr. Icahn had teamed up with Beal Bank of Texas, buying a $486 million mortgage on the company, which he had hoped to convert into a stake in the company once it emerged from bankruptcy. Mr. Icahn did not return calls seeking comment.
 The three properties -- Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, Trump Plaza Hotel and Trump Marina Hotel Casino -- face a cloudy future. Atlantic City, as well as the gambling industry, has suffered in recent years, hit hard by the recession and changing consumer tastes. More than one-third of the city's 11 casinos have been in bankruptcy, and more gamblers have been going to rival gambling centers in Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut.
 The Trump Taj Mahal is one of Atlantic City's biggest hotels, with more than 2,000 rooms. Together with the Trump Plaza and Trump Marina Hotel Casino, the three properties account for about a fifth of gambling revenue in Atlantic City.

HEADLINE: Percentage of Animals Killed In City's Shelters Reaches Low

BYLINE: By DAISUKE NAKAI

 BODY:
''There's never been a better time to be a dog in New York City,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proclaimed Monday morning. As usual, he had statistical proof. The percentage of dogs and cats put to death at the city's shelters hit an all-time low last year - 33 percent, down from 69 percent in 2003. 
 During that same period, the adoption rate for shelter pets increased to 66 percent, up from 26 percent, officials from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said at a news conference with the mayor and four adoptable dogs at City Hall.
The numbers were cited as the mayor announced a $1 million grant from the A.S.P.C.A. to the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals, a coalition of more than 160 animal rescue groups and shelters that work with Animal Care and Control, which runs the official city shelters.
 The money will be used to increase the numbers of adoptions and transfers, and to provide low- and no-cost spaying and neutering services to low-income pet owners.
 According to figures from the alliance, a total of 13,620 animals -- 4,523 dogs and 9,097 cats -- were put to death at the Animal Care and Control shelters in 2009, out of 41,712 pets taken in. At the same time, 8,192 pets were adopted out of the shelters and 17,641 were transferred to rescue organizations and other shelters.
 The economic downturn may have contributed to the rise in adoptions, said Steve Gruber, a spokesman for the alliance. ''In troubled times, people look to pets for comfort,'' he said. ''Although keeping a pet can be challenging when cash is tight, some people may have discovered that they want the unconditional love that a pet gives you more.''
 Tough economic times also may have made people more inclined to adopt a free pet from a shelter than to buy one from a breeder, Mr. Gruber added.
 The kill rate has been declining steadily for more than a decade, falling below 50 percent for the first time in 2006. Last year's low was down from 39 percent the year before.
 The alliance, which was founded in 2002, said it was on target for a ''no-kill New York'' in 2015, not meaning that there will be no animals put to death, but that euthanasia will not be used as a measure for population control.

HEADLINE: Memos Show Risky Lending at WaMu

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- New documents released by a Senate panel show how entrenched Washington Mutual was in fraudulent and risky lending, and highlighted how its top executives received rewards as their institution was hurtling toward disaster. 
 The problems at WaMu, whose collapse was the largest in American banking history, were well known to company executives, excerpts of e-mail messages and other internal documents show.
 The documents were released on Monday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which began an inquiry into the financial crisis in November 2008. The panel has summoned seven former WaMu executives to testify at a hearing on Tuesday, including the former chief executive Kerry K. Killinger.
 The panel called WaMu illustrative of problems in the origination, sale and securitization of high-risk mortgages by any number of financial institutions from 2004 to 2008.
 ''Using a toxic mix of high-risk lending, lax controls and compensation policies which rewarded quantity over quality, Washington Mutual flooded the market with shoddy loans that went bad,'' the panel's chairman, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said. 
 Mr. Killinger was paid $103.2 million from 2003 to 2008. In WaMu's final year of existence, he received $25.1 million, including a $15.3 million severance payment.
 His pay was not the only compensation under scrutiny.
 Loan officers received more money for originating higher-risk loans, and loan processors were rewarded for speed and volume, rather than quality, the Senate panel found. Loan officers and sales associates were paid even more if they overcharged borrowers through points or higher interest rates, or included stiff prepayment penalties in the loans they issued.
 The pay structure created ''temptation to advise the borrower on means and methods to game the system,'' a WaMu internal memo from April 2008 found. 
 ''They built a conveyor belt that dumped toxic mortgage assets into the markets like a polluter dumping poison into a river,'' Mr. Levin said. ''Down river, there was Wall Street, with its huge appetite for these mortgage-backed securities. They bottled that polluted water, slapped a label on it from the credit rating agencies that said it was safe drinking water, and sold it to investors.'' 
 From 2000 to 2007, WaMu and an affiliate, the Long Beach Mortgage Company, packaged and sold at least $77 billion in subprime mortgages, the panel found. It sold or securitized an even greater amount in adjustable-rate mortgages, or A.R.M.'s. 
 By 2006, WaMu's internal records show, it was one of the country's largest originators of ''option A.R.M.'' loans. 
 That all came to an end the next year, when the housing market teetered. By the middle of 2007, WaMu shut down Long Beach; by the end of the year, a Long Beach employee was charged with taking kickbacks to process fraudulent or substandard loans.
 The documents revealed an extensive pattern of lax underwriting and fraudulent lending that inevitably led to delinquency and foreclosure. 
 For example, one internal investigation found high rates of ''confirmed fraud'' in two top loan-producing offices in southern California. But the subcommittee said that ''no steps were taken to address the problems, and no investors who purchased loans originated by these offices were notified.''

HEADLINE: Germany Asserts Its Interests As Greek Debt Crisis Unfolds

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- France and Germany traditionally have been the ''motor'' of the European Union, but relations between the two countries are badly strained over the Greek debt crisis, which is just the latest example of a new German willingness to resist the demands of Europe and assert its self-interest under Chancellor Angela Merkel.
 ''There has been a tectonic shift in the way Germany acts in Europe,'' said Ulrike Guerot, a senior research fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Germans, she says, are ''talking of behaving 'normally' now, like the others, and that means nationally.'' 
 The European Union is facing a serious crisis over financing and its currency, the euro. But France and Germany also have important disagreements on policy toward Russia, China and Iran, making a coherent European foreign policy increasingly difficult to discern on an array of critical issues. 
 The French and the Germans, with different domestic constituencies and different attitudes toward economic policy, have a different view of how Europe and the euro zone, the 16 nations that have adopted the euro as their currency, should be managed. Germany, long the financier of the European Union, has made it clear that it will no longer pay for the mistakes and frauds of others.
 France has put a much stronger emphasis on European unity and pride, trying to avoid involving multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund in the future of the euro, a prominent symbol of Europe's challenge to the supremacy of the United States.
 ''Germany is no longer, as a matter of course or of principle, the motor, heart and savior of Europe,'' said Constanze Stelzenmuller, a senior fellow of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. ''This isn't the Europe we signed up for. It's much larger, much poorer, and we have to take care of our own.''
 Germany always acted in its interests, Ms. Guerot said, but those were perceived as sublimated within the European Union and NATO, the two postwar multilateral institutions that both protected the new democratic Germany and kept its ambitions in check. Now Germany is turning more obviously to Russia for energy and commercial interests, she said, making its European and American partners uneasy.
 ''We sublimated hegemony,'' said Ms. Guerot, a German who is working on a paper called ''Germany Unbound.'' ''But we're dropping the sublimation now.'' She laughed, then said: ''Of course, this doesn't sound nice to others.''
 Before a European Union summit meeting in Brussels last month on the Greek crisis, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was reportedly in a rage, unable to push Mrs. Merkel toward a more explicit promise of help for Greece.
 Mr. Sarkozy yelled at the European Union president, Herman Van Rompuy, whom he summoned to Paris, European Union officials said. He threatened to boycott the summit meeting, while muttering that the Germans ''haven't changed,'' according to French officials.
 Mrs. Merkel, for her part, remained calm as Mr. Sarkozy cooled down, but she stood by her position -- that German taxpayers should not suffer for Greek mismanagement and laxity or set a precedent for future rescues of other weaker Mediterranean countries like Portugal, Spain and even Italy. Her stand, which included a role for the International Monetary Fund, created resentment in the rest of the euro zone, accustomed to German sacrifice for larger European political and economic goals.
 With a neo-liberal coalition partner, the Free Democrats, and with important elections coming next month in North Rhine-Westphalia, which could cost her ruling coalition control of the upper house in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel stood up for German interests and was hailed afterward at home.
 She also cited constitutional restraints against Germany bailing out other countries, concerns that France took as something of a pretext.
 Criticism of German economic policy ''expresses a French malaise toward the growing gap between the two economies, and more generally toward this new Germany without which nothing is possible anymore in Europe, and which seems less and less likely to compromise if not in its national interests,'' Jacques-Pierre Gougeon, a Germany specialist at the French Institute for International and Strategic Relations, wrote in the newspaper Le Monde.
 At the heart of the dispute is the euro. The French see it as the currency of a new, united Europe; the Germans see it as the direct descendant of the mark, and the European Central Bank as retaining the DNA of the Bundesbank, whose main task was to keep inflation down. The French favor a kind of European economic government, with easier rules on deficits; the Germans have no intention of giving up economic sovereignty to anyone, let alone to the French.
 In the Greek crisis, for example, Germany has insisted that any aid to Greece come as a last resort, and in the loan package arranged on Sunday it insisted that Greece pay a significant penalty in interest rates. This was well within Mrs. Merkel's guidelines and does not represent a subsidy to Greece, said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
 ''The German taxpayer is much more likely to make money from this deal than to lose it, and the agreement is within the framework of what she agreed upon in successive Brussels summits,'' he added.
 Germany also reacted angrily and defensively to a modest French suggestion by Finance Minister Christine Lagarde that the German export model had to change in the interests of other, less competitive euro zone countries, and that Germans should spend more buying the goods of their less fortunate neighbors.
 Germans, who have already undergone a wrenching structural reform and paid a huge bill to integrate the former eastern Germany, say they feel that ''they're paying a significant personal price,'' Mr. Klau said. ''Poverty has increased considerably in Germany and is now a social reality. And it makes Germany more inward-looking than the old West Germany, and a more defensive country.''
 Part of the change is generational, with Mrs. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, representing those born after World War II, with only anecdotal knowledge of Nazi Germany. The members of Parliament are even younger, many of them teenagers or younger when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
 So the German leadership paradigm from Konrad Adenauer through Helmut Kohl -- roughly 1949 to 1989, when Germany was a crucial junior partner both for NATO and European integration -- is gone. ''When Germany steps out of the film, it changes,'' Ms. Guerot said.
 Despite symbolic efforts to bring Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel together -- unveiling joint projects at the Arc de Triomphe last February or a recent stunt of having Ms. Lagarde sit in on a German cabinet meeting -- ''With the French we have more that divides us than unites us,'' Ms. Guerot said.
 Germans feel they have paid both their reparations and their dues, ''and many times over,'' said Ms. Stelzenmuller, especially in an uncertain time of globalization and financial crisis. ''People want to be normal, in the sense that other people don't come to us first and say, 'You have to pay.' And it doesn't have much to do with political orientation. All of us are huddling with our backs against the storm.''

HEADLINE: A Wrong Way and a Right Way

 BODY:
While Congress was on spring break the past two weeks, federal unemployment benefits expired for an estimated 200,000 jobless Americans. Each day, another 30,000 join the ranks of those who are both out of work and out of benefits. It did not have to come to this. 
 The House and Senate have passed bills that would extend benefits for many months. When time ran out to reconcile the bills before the break, the House passed a one-month extension to keep benefits flowing. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican of Oklahoma, stopped that in its tracks, insisting that any additional benefits be paid for with offsetting budget cuts. 
 It was the second time this year that a Republican senator ignored the harsh realities of joblessness, holding up unemployment checks to make a point about the deficit. 
 Never mind that so many Americans need the help to hold on to their homes or keep their families fed. Never mind that the economy needs the spending to counter what would otherwise be a devastating slump in consumer demand -- and more joblessness as a result. 
 On Monday, the Senate overcame a procedural hurdle in moving the one-month extension forward, upping the chances for passage this week. Leaders in both parties must not tolerate further delays. Jobless workers can't wait. And the calendar must be cleared so that lawmakers can complete work on more comprehensive job measures -- including aid to states and small businesses and money for infrastructure spending. 
 To do that, they must counter the posturing with facts: With unemployment at 9.7 percent -- and the average jobless episode lasting a record 31 weeks -- getting help to unemployed Americans and creating more jobs is the top priority right now. 
 Emergency help -- like unemployment benefits or aid to the states -- should not be offset with budget cuts, because that would reduce the economic boost that such measures are intended to provide. Congress's sensible pay-as-you-go rules sensibly do not apply to emergency spending. 
 Those rules do apply to nonemergency spending -- like the recently passed health care reform or long-term job creation efforts. It is time for lawmakers to stop posturing on the deficit and start coming up with economically sound ways to offset the cost of new programs. 
 We have two good places to start. Congress could raise $28 billion over the next decade just by closing the loophole that allows wealthy private equity and hedge fund managers to pay a lower rate of tax than most other Americans. It could be enacted immediately without harming the economic recovery. The people to whom it would apply would not be hard pressed even if their taxes rose. 
 Another good area for savings is President Obama's proposal to bring the enforcement powers of the Labor Department and the Internal Revenue Service to bear on employers who evade taxes when they misclassify employees as independent contractors. That would raise $7 billion over 10 years. 
 Unless something is done to address the deficit, the American economy will be hobbled for generations to come. But denying benefits to the unemployed is the wrong place to start. The good news is that there are a lot of other ways to save money and raise revenues. We are waiting for members of Congress to come up with their own sensible ideas.

HEADLINE: Europe Finds Clean Fuel in Trash; U.S. Sits Back

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
HORSHOLM, Denmark -- The lawyers and engineers who dwell in an elegant enclave here are at peace with the hulking neighbor just over the back fence: a vast energy plant that burns thousands of tons of household garbage and industrial waste, round the clock.
 Far cleaner than conventional incinerators, this new type of plant converts local trash into heat and electricity. Dozens of filters catch pollutants, from mercury to dioxin, that would have emerged from its smokestack only a decade ago.
 In that time, such plants have become both the mainstay of garbage disposal and a crucial fuel source across Denmark, from wealthy exurbs like Horsholm to Copenhagen's downtown area. Their use has not only reduced the country's energy costs and reliance on oil and gas, but also benefited the environment, diminishing the use of landfills and cutting carbon dioxide emissions. The plants run so cleanly that many times more dioxin is now released from home fireplaces and backyard barbecues than from incineration.
 With all these innovations, Denmark now regards garbage as a clean alternative fuel rather than a smelly, unsightly problem. And the incinerators, known as waste-to-energy plants, have acquired considerable cachet as communities like Horsholm vie to have them built. 
 Denmark now has 29 such plants, serving 98 municipalities in a country of 5.5 million people, and 10 more are planned or under construction. Across Europe, there are about 400 plants, with Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands leading the pack in expanding them and building new ones.
 By contrast, no new waste-to-energy plants are being planned or built in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency says -- even though the federal government and 24 states now classify waste that is burned this way for energy as a renewable fuel, in many cases eligible for subsidies. There are only 87 trash-burning power plants in the United States, a country of more than 300 million people, and almost all were built at least 15 years ago. 
 Instead, distant landfills remain the end point for most of the nation's trash. New York City alone sends 10,500 tons of residential waste each day to landfills in places like Ohio and South Carolina.
 ''Europe has gotten out ahead with this newest technology,'' said Ian A. Bowles, a former Clinton administration official who is now the Massachusetts state secretary of energy. 
 Still, Mr. Bowles said that as America's current landfills topped out and pressure to reduce heat-trapping gases grew, Massachusetts and some other states were ''actively considering'' new waste-to-energy proposals; several existing plants are being expanded. He said he expected resistance all the same in a place where even a wind turbine sets off protests. 
 Why Americans Are Reluctant
 Matt Hale, director of the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, said the reasons that waste-to-energy plants had not caught on nationally were the relative abundance of cheap landfills in a large country, opposition from state officials who feared the plants could undercut recycling programs and a ''negative public perception.'' In the United States, individual states and municipalities generally decide what method to use to get rid of their waste.
 Still, a 2009 study by the E.P.A. and North Carolina State University scientists came down strongly in favor of waste-to-energy plants over landfills as the most environmentally friendly destination for urban waste that cannot be recycled. Embracing the technology would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local pollution, but also yield copious electricity, it said.
 Yet powerful environmental groups have fought the concept passionately. ''Incinerators are really the devil,'' said Laura Haight, a senior environmental associate with the New York Public Interest Research Group. 
 Investing in garbage as a green resource is simply perverse when governments should be mandating recycling, she said. ''Once you build a waste-to-energy plant, you then have to feed it. Our priority is pushing for zero waste.'' 
 The group has vigorously opposed building a plant in New York City. 
 Even Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has championed green initiatives and ranked Copenhagen's waste-fueled heating on his list of environmental ''best practices,'' has shied away from proposing to get one built.
 ''It is not currently being pursued -- not because of the technology, which has advanced, but because of the issue in selecting sites to build incinerators,'' said Jason Post, the mayor's deputy press secretary on environmental issues. ''It's a Nimby issue. It would take years of hearings and reviews.''
 Nickolas J. Themelis, a professor of engineering at Columbia University and a waste-to-energy proponent, said America's resistance to constructing the new plants was economically and environmentally ''irresponsible.''
 ''It's so irrational; I've almost given up with New York,'' he said. ''It's like you're in a village of Hottentots who look up and see an airplane -- when everybody else is using airplanes -- and they say, 'No, we won't do it, it's too scary.' ''
 Acceptance in Denmark
 Attitudes could hardly be more different in Denmark, where plants are placed in the communities they serve, no matter how affluent, so that the heat of burning garbage can be efficiently piped into homes. 
 Planners take pains to separate residential traffic from trucks delivering garbage, and some of the newest plants are encased in elaborate outer shells that resemble sculptures.
 ''New buyers are usually O.K. with the plant,'' said Hans Rast, president of the homeowners' association in Horsholm, who cut a distinguished figure in corduroy slacks and a V-neck sweater as he poured coffee in a living room of white couches and Oriental rugs.
 ''What they like is that they look out and see the forest,'' he said. (The living rooms in this enclave of town houses face fields and trees, while the plant is roughly some 400 yards over a back fence that borders the homes' carports). The lower heating costs don't hurt, either. Eighty percent of Horsholm's heat and 20 percent of its electricity come from burning trash.
 Many countries that are expanding waste-to-energy capacity, like Denmark and Germany, typically also have the highest recycling rates; only the material that cannot be recycled is burned. 
 Waste-to-energy plants do involve large upfront expenditures, and tight credit can be a big deterrent. Harrisburg, Pa., has been flirting with bankruptcy because of a $300 million loan it took to reopen and refit an old public incinerator with the new technology.
 But hauling trash is expensive, too. New York City paid $307 million last year to export more than four million tons of waste, mostly to landfills in distant states, Mr. Post said. Although the city is trying to move more of its trash by train or barge, much of it travels by truck, with heavy fuel emissions.
 In 2009, a small portion of the city's trash was processed at two 1990-vintage waste-to-energy plants in Newark and Hempstead, N.Y., owned by a private company, Covanta. The city pays $65 a ton for the service -- the cheapest available way for New York City to get rid of its trash. Sending garbage to landfills is more expensive: the city's costliest current method is to haul waste by rail to a landfill in Virginia.
 While new, state-of-the-art landfills do collect the methane that emanates from rotting garbage to make electricity, they churn out roughly twice as much climate-warming gas as waste-to-energy plants do for the units of power they produce, the 2009 E.P.A. study found. Methane, the primary warming gas emitted by landfills, is about 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, the gas released by burning garbage. 
 The study also concluded that waste-to-energy plants produced lower levels of pollutants than the best landfills did, but nine times the energy. Although new landfills are lined to prevent leaks of toxic substances and often capture methane, the process is highly inefficient, it noted. 
 Laws Spur New Technology
 In Europe, environmental laws have hastened the development of waste-to-energy programs. The European Unionseverely restricts the creation of new landfill sites, and its nations already have binding commitments to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2012 under the international pact known as the Kyoto Protocol, which was never ratified by the United States.
 Garbage cannot easily be placed out of sight, out of mind in Europe's smaller, densely populated countries, as it so often is in the United States. Many of the 87 waste-to-energy plants in the United States are in densely populated areas like Long Island and Cape Cod. 
 While these plants are generally two decades old, many have been progressively retrofitted with new pollution filters, though few produce both heat and power like the newest Danish versions.
 In Horsholm only 4 percent of waste now goes to landfills, and 1 percent (chemicals, paints and some electronic equipment) is consigned to ''special disposal'' in places like secure storage vaults in an abandoned salt mine in Germany. Sixty-one percent of the town's waste is recycled and 34 percent is incinerated at waste-to-energy plants.
 From a pollution perspective, today's energy-generating incinerators have little in common with the smoke-belching models of the past. They have arrays of newly developed filters and scrubbers to capture the offending chemicals -- hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, dioxins, furans and heavy metals -- as well as small particulates. 
 Emissions from the plants in all categories have been reduced to just 10 to 20 percent of levels allowed under the European Union's strict environmental standards for air and water discharges. 
 At the end of the incineration process, the extracted acids, heavy metals and gypsum are sold for use in manufacturing or construction. Small amounts of highly concentrated toxic substances, forming a paste, are shipped to one of two warehouses for highly hazardous materials, in the Norwegian fjords and in a used salt mine in Germany.
 ''The hazardous elements are concentrated and handled with care rather than dispersed as they would be in a landfill,'' said Ivar Green-Paulsen, general manager of the Vestforbraending plant in Copenhagen, the country's largest.
 In Denmark, local governments run trash collection as well as the incinerators and recycling centers, and laws and financial incentives ensure that recyclable materials are not burned. (In the United States most waste-to-energy plants are private ventures.) Communities may drop recyclable waste at recycling centers free of charge, but must pay to have garbage incinerated.
 At Vestforbraending, trucks stop on scales for weighing and payment before dumping their contents. The trash is randomly searched for recyclable material, with heavy fines for offenders. 
 The homeowners' association in Horsholm has raised what its president, Mr. Rast, called ''minor issues'' with the plant, like a bright light on the chimney that shone into some bedrooms, and occasional truck noise. But mostly, he said, it is a respected silent neighbor, producing no noticeable odors.
 The plant, owned by five adjacent communities, has even proved popular in a conservative region with Denmark's highest per-capita income. Morten Slotved, 40, Horsholm's mayor, is trying to expand it. ''Constituents like it because it decreases heating costs and raises home values,'' he said with a smile. ''I'd like another furnace.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 17, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about state-of-the-art incinerators in Europe that cleanly convert waste to energy referred incorrectly to the ownership status of Covanta, a New Jersey company that processes some trash from New York City at older incinerators in Newark and Hempstead, N.Y. It is a publicly traded company, not a private one.

HEADLINE: Move to Aid Greece Helps Dow Close Above 11,000

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; David Jolly and Matthew Saltmarsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
 A few little points was all it took. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average inched above 11,000 on Monday -- and, for the first time since the dark days of 2008, actually managed to stay there. 
 It was hardly a heady rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.62 points Monday, a mere 0.08 percent, to close at 11,005.97. But that modest gain, driven largely by news Sunday of a long-awaited financial rescue for the debt-ladenGreek government, was enough to help the market tick off yet another milestone in its long recovery.
 ''Nobody ever thought we'd ever get near this level this fast,'' said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. ''We've come a long way.'' 
 A long way indeed. Since March 2009, the Dow has soared 68 percent. Even so, it remains some 3,100 points below the highs reached in 2007, before the economy sank into recession. 
 The question now is whether the stock market can hold its gains and push on to even greater heights. Some on Wall Street question whether this rally can endure as the government's economic stimulus programs gradually draw to a close and interest rates begin to rise. That is especially so given that stubbornly high unemployment could hamper a broader economic recovery. 
 ''From this point forward, it becomes more of a grind and a lot of hard work,'' said Stephen P. Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investments. ''There's going to be volatility. It's not going to be a smooth ride upward.''
 Monday's momentum came as Wall Street welcomed the European Union's rescue plan for Greece. For months, investors had sought firm reassurance that Greece would avoid default. On Sunday, the European Union finally delivered: officials announced details of a $40 billion rescue package. 
 There was also renewed optimism on Monday about the strength of the American economy. Traders snapped up stocks in anticipation of what is expected to be a strong earnings season. Intel, Google, General Electric, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are scheduled to report results this week. 
 As analysts dissect financial statements, they are looking not just for signs of strong profit -- forecasts call for 22.6 percent growth overall -- but for companies to offer brighter forecasts for the rest of the year.
 ''The expectations are in the sky for this quarter and for the rest of the year,'' said Bruce A. Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company. ''The market is going to continue to rally until that optimism becomes widespread and excessive.''
 Other Wall Street indexes followed the Dow's lead. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 2.11 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,196.48. The Nasdaq composite index was up 3.82 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,457.87. It was helped by reports that the smartphone maker Palm may be up for sale. Shares of Palm surged more than 17 percent, to $6.04.
 Shares of Alcoa rose 1.25 percent, to $14.57, ahead of the firm's first-quarter results, which were released after the market closed Monday.
 In Europe, markets were mixed as investors largely shrugged off the aid package for Greece. The plan would grant Greece as much as 30 billion euros ($40 billion), in loans at about 5 percent interest. That rate is significantly lower than the 7.5 percent at which Greek debt was trading last week. The International Monetary Fund could provide up to another 15 billion euros at even lower rates.
 But analysts said many of the details had already been priced into markets.
 ''It's a short-term fix and it doesn't address the long-term problems of Greece or Europe,'' Mr. Bittles said. ''All of these countries that are strapped with debt, including the U.S., don't want to face the reality or pain of trying to fundamentally fix the problem.''
 The FTSE 100 index in London gained 0.12 percent, but the DAX in Frankfurt and the CAC 40 in Paris were flat.
 The euro strengthened 0.6 percent against the dollar, to slightly less than $1.36. The currency has fallen about 5 percent this year against the dollar amid fears that Italy, Portugal and Spain could follow Greece into market disfavor, possibly undermining the foundation of the 16-nation currency.
 As investors gained confidence in the ability of countries to pay back debt, the cost of insuring debt fell in Greece and across the Continent. The yield on the Greek government bond fell to 6.5 percent, after topping out last week above 7.5 percent.
 Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said Greece's problems were not over. ''The more sound countries in Europe just lent money to Greece,'' he said. ''But you've not paid down one penny. You're just moving around a big pile of debt.''
 Questions about Germany's enthusiasm for the rescue plan persisted, with a German government spokesman saying a full summit meeting of euro zone ministers would be needed to authorize any aid. That assertion was quickly denied by officials in Brussels, who said such a decision could be made in a conference call of leaders.
 In a critical test of market confidence in the European Union's aid package, the Greek government plans to auction 1.2 billion euros in Treasury bills Tuesday.
 The price of oil fell 58 cents, to $84.34 a barrel.
 Spot gold fell $5.80, to $1,156.20 an ounce.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 11/32, to 98 8/32. The yield fell to 3.84 percent, from 3.88 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Europe Urged to Share Power Across Continent

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Renewable energy in Europe should be generated and distributed on a continental scale to make the greatest contribution toward reducing greenhouse gases, according to a report that raises significant challenges for a fragmented region.
 The report, to be released Tuesday, was compiled by the European Climate Foundation, a group financed by philanthropic organizations, using studies carried out by McKinsey, a consulting firm.
 Among its recommendations is a gigantic power cable that would link solar farms in Spain with energy-hungry countries like Poland. Such a link could ship huge volumes of so-called clean electricity, but it could face political opposition in countries like France. 
 The report underscores how various renewable power sources, including wind from the North Sea, will need to be linked on a transcontinental grid to generate a secure and reliable supply of alternative energy to substitute for fossil fuels.
 Such a grid would probably be easier to build in countries that span continents, as in the United States and China. In Europe, power grids remain largely confined to countries, with limited cross-border connections.
 The report, to be presented in Brussels to the European Union energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, and the climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said that cross-border connections would need to change if clean power was to be distributed more widely.
 ''Transmission must develop from a minor trading and reserve-sharing role to one that enables significant energy exchanges between regions across the year,'' according to the report.
 The addition of a huge interconnector crossing France could help French utilities export more nuclear power, but it also could cut into those exports by providing customers with an alternative source of electricity.
 Countries including France would need to ''consider wider regional benefits than is currently the case,'' the report said.
 Another factor that could impede the plans is longstanding opposition to unsightly pylons and cables in border areas like the Pyrenees, the mountain range between Spain and France.
 Current capacity between Spain and France is less than a gigawatt and would have to rise to as much as 40 gigawatts to carry sufficient quantities of solar-generated electricity, the report said. Efforts were needed ''to change public attitudes regarding the construction of large-scale overhead transmission infrastructure,'' it said; otherwise, ''alternative solutions'' to overhead lines over the Pyrenees, like underground and underwater cables, ''may need to be considered.''
 The European Climate Foundation said it had invited all major European utilities to participate in the study.
 EDF, which operates nuclear power plants in France, was not involved. A spokeswoman for EDF said it was possible that its subsidiaries were involved in the report, but she had no details.
 GDF Suez, another French utility with substantial nuclear operations, was involved but did not support the conclusions. A spokeswoman for GDF Suez said she had been unable to obtain an explanation as to why the company had distanced itself from the report.
 The report also seems to have irritated Alstom, a French engineering company that has a major focus on technology to reduce emissions from electricity plants fueled by coal or natural gas. Alstom participated but did not support the conclusions because it said parts of the report underplayed the role of carbon-capture technologies.
 A company spokeswoman, Mary Varkados, said Alstom welcomed the report's main findings, but said that ''further work will be needed'' on how to reach goals for lowering emissions.
 Major energy companies that signed the final report included Shell, the English-Dutch oil and gas company, and RWE, a German electric utility that in previous years had produced the most carbon dioxide of any company based in the European Union. RWE is participating in efforts to deliver solar-generated electricity from North Africa. The power sector is currently the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in many parts of Europe.
 The report said the European Union would need to combine solar power from Spain with wind power from the North Sea if it were to meet a pledge made last summer to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050.
 That will be expensive but manageable, according to the report. The European Union already will have to invest 4.2 trillion euros, or $5.7 trillion, across the economy over the next 40 years to ensure it continues to generate sufficient power by midcentury, according to the report. To reach its goal of reducing emissions, the bloc would have to invest a total of 7 trillion euros, or about 66 percent more, it said.
 But the cost of energy to the economy should start to drop as of 2020 because of reduced fossil fuel use and efficiency savings that would help offset the cost of building a low-carbon infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Cultivating a Market in India

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
HAIDER NAGAR, India -- At first glance, the vegetable patches in this north Indian village look no different from the many small, spare farms that dot the country. 
 But up close, visitors can see some curious experiments: insect traps made with reusable plastic bags; bamboo poles helping bitter gourd grow bigger and straighter; and seedlings germinating from plastic trays under a fine net.
 These are low-tech innovations, to be sure. But they are crucial to the goals of the benefactor -- Wal-Mart -- that supplied them. 
 Two years after Wal-Mart came to India, it is trying to do to agriculture here what it has done to industries around the world: change business models by using its hyper-efficient practices to improve productivity and speed the flow of goods. 
 Not everyone is happy about the company's presence here. Many Indian activists and policy makers abhor big-box retailing, fearing that it will drive India's millions of shopkeepers out of business. Some legislators are suspicious of the company's motives. The government still does not allow Wal-Mart Stores and other foreign companies to sell directly to consumers.
 But Wal-Mart is persisting because its effort in India is critical to its global growth strategy. Confronted with saturated markets in the United States and other developed countries, the company needs to establish a bigger presence in emerging markets, like India, where modern stores make up just 5 percent of the country's retail industry.
 Establishing good relations with farmers is a centerpiece of the company's plans. Though Wal-Mart is pushing many of its traditional products in India, like clothes, electronics and home goods, perhaps none is as essential as food. Wal-Mart needs high-quality produce at low prices to draw customers in volume. 
 The challenges are significant. Buying and transporting produce are difficult tasks because India has millions of small-scale farmers and an agriculture system riddled with middlemen.
 Here in Haider Nagar, in the bread basket state of Punjab, farmers who supply vegetables to Wal-Mart say they like working with the company. It typically pays them 5 to 7 percent more than they earn from local wholesale markets, they said. And they do not have to pay to transport produce because Wal-Mart picks it up from their fields.
 Abdul Majid, who sells cucumbers to Wal-Mart, says his yields have risen about 25 percent since he started following farming advice about when to apply fertilizers and which kinds -- more zinc, less potash -- from the company and its partner, Bayer CropScience.
 Mohammad Haneef, a farmer in a nearby village, said he had sold to two other companies before Wal-Mart, but one shut down and the other cheated him and paid him late. Wal-Mart is much better, he said, but its buyers are picky, taking the best vegetables and leaving him with inferior ones that he still must truck to wholesale markets.
 ''You have to establish trust,'' he said in Hindi. ''Wal-Mart has been paying on time. We would just like them to buy more.''
 For Wal-Mart, establishing an agricultural beachhead in India will not be easy. Many Indian companies have abandoned or significantly scaled back efforts to run supermarkets. Some companies grew too quickly and flamed out. But many others were undone by the numerous Gordian knots that hold back Indian agriculture: laws limit who can buy farmers' crops, 35 percent of fruits and vegetables are wasted because of inefficient transportation and farmers earn too little to invest in their marginal farms.
 ''Anybody who says they can revolutionize retail in this country in a short period of time'' is overestimating their abilities, said R. Gopalakrishnan, executive director of the Tata Group and chairman of Rallis India, a company that makes fertilizers, seeds and pesticides.
 Wal-Mart is also limited by New Delhi's ban on foreign-owned retail chains that prevent it from selling directly to Indian consumers.
 ''Not having access to our own retail stores through our own investments is a serious impediment,'' said Raj Jain, who heads Wal-Mart's Indian operation. ''How do you pay for that big back end if you are not going to have access to the front end?''
 Right now Wal-Mart operates in India through a 50-50 joint venture with Bharti Enterprises, an Indian conglomerate that also owns the country's largest cellphone company. Their partnership, known as Bharti Wal-Mart, supplies retail stores that are fully owned by Bharti and runs a wholesale store that sells to shopkeepers, hotels and other businesses.
 Wal-Mart executives would not say how much money the company has invested in India, but its operation is at the forefront of a second big push into emerging markets. In the 1990s, Wal-Mart set up shop in China, Mexico and Brazil and now has hundreds of stores there. By comparison, Bharti Wal-Mart has just one wholesale store and will soon open two more. It employs 800 people in India, and hopes to have 5,000 in three years.
 In recent speeches, senior Indian leaders have suggested that they would like to remove restrictions on the retail industry to help reduce food prices, which were up 20 percent in January compared with a year earlier. Last month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cited the need ''to take a firm view on opening up the retail trade.''
 But even as senior leaders speak of more openness, regulators recently published a rule that would restrict wholesale companies like Bharti Wal-Mart from earning more than 25 percent of their revenue from sales to affiliated ''group companies'' -- a term that is not clearly defined in the rules. A spokeswoman from Bharti Wal-Mart, Arti Singh, said the company was trying to find out what this meant.
 Last year, a committee in the Indian parliament said the government should not allow any more wholesale stores because companies like Wal-Mart were using them as ''camouflage for doing retail through back door.'' The legislators also asserted that foreign companies would raise their initial low prices after they had driven small retailers out of business. 
 Wal-Mart has not waited for policy makers to effect changes. It has spent the last two years building relationships with farmers and suppliers, and setting up its supply system. It is building a big distribution center outside New Delhi to supply Bharti stores, which are branded Easy Day, in and around the capital. 
 Wal-Mart also has learned to adapt its operations to numerous challenges. For instance, because trucks move slowly on the country's congested roads, Wal-Mart's fruit and vegetable distribution center near Haider Nagar supplies retail stores only within 200 kilometers (124 miles) to keep produce fresh. By comparison, similar Wal-Mart facilities in China supply stores as far away as 400 kilometers. 
 But that means the company will have to set up more distribution centers with expensive power generators, making it more difficult to make money in India.
 Still, Mr. Jain, who previously worked for Whirlpool and Unilever, was optimistic. He said the company would add more farmers and stores in Punjab and neighboring Haryana State, then begin expanding further. 
 This is ''a controlled experiment,'' he said. ''It will take some time to make it sustainable and economically viable. Then once that happens, we need to take it to some other geographies and prove the model.''

HEADLINE: What We Learned From H1N1's First Year

BYLINE: By RICHARD P. WENZEL. 
Richard P. Wenzel is a professor of internal medicine and a specialist in infectious diseases at Virginia Commonwealth University.

DATELINE: Richmond, Va. 

 BODY:
 ONE year ago today, a government worker in Oaxaca, Mexico, became the first person to die of swine flu. At the bedsides of other men and women struggling to stay alive in Mexican critical care units, we clinicians noticed early on that this novel H1N1 flu virus diverged from influenza's usual pattern of activity in striking ways. It began in the Northern Hemisphere, not in Asia, and in mid-spring, not late fall or winter. It also had a worrying predilection for children and young adults, not the elderly and newborns.
 In the months after those first deaths, the virus ignited a global pandemic. While the epidemic never became as deadly as we initially feared, it was not as mild as some experts now believe. What's more, it exposed some serious shortcomings in the world's public health response. 
 Those who now describe the pandemic as mild base their conclusion primarily on what, at first, seems like a mortality rate in the United States similar to those seen after seasonal influenza. But my colleagues in developing countries would strongly object.
 Though we lack reliable death rates from country to country, certainly no one who helped care for the large number of critically ill patients in Mexico could conclude that the flu in the United States was as severe as in developing countries that lacked our resources. 
 Here, the vaccine arrived later than estimated, and only about 80 million Americans received it -- not nearly enough, but a far higher proportion of the population than in many developing countries. In fact, only 26 of 94 poor countries in need of the protective H1N1 vaccine have even received it so far.
 We also cannot count as mild any virus that was so devastating for young adults, along with pregnant women, obese patients and minorities.
 Worse yet, this virus made itself particularly hard for clinicians to identify. Whereas doctors associate fever and cough with outbreaks of influenza, one-third of patients admitted to hospitals and up to half of infected outpatients in this pandemic had no fever, yet they were infectious. 
 And because it is likely that only patients with fever were tested for the presence of the virus, we greatly underestimated the number of people infected. A telling report from Britain showed that when children were tested in cross sectional surveys after the first wave of infection, one in three had antibodies to the virus, meaning that they had been infected -- this was 10 times more people than estimated from clinical surveillance.
 H1N1 posed huge infection-control problems, especially in hospitals. This was because it was found not only on hard surfaces in the environment, which is common to all influenza strains, but in the stool of patients, a feature of avian influenza. 
 Public health groups emphasized the necessity of frequent hand-washing, which surely helped reduce transmission. But those groups also disagreed on other preventatives: for instance, the World Health Organization and Society for Health Care Epidemiologists of America recommended the relatively inexpensive surgical mask, whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention argued for the N-95 respirator mask. 
 In our own country, the virus struck at a time when Americans seemed particularly skeptical about our government and large institutions. The C.D.C. faced an uphill battle to characterize the trajectory of the pandemic, to define its impact, to offer suggestions and to convince a wary public to get vaccinated. 
 At times, health officials erred in their recommendations. C.D.C. authorities often said that ill children and adults could go back to school or work 24 hours after their fever disappeared -- even though young children are contagious for up to three weeks and adults for 5 to 7 days. 
 It is not an easy task, but our public health authorities need to become clearer about the lexicon of uncertainty -- what they know and don't know about a pandemic. They also need to be transparent about how they devise their recommendations, which often have to balance between infection control and the daily activities of offices and schools. And we need to identify which social distancing techniques truly help control pandemics -- for example, does the closing of schools and malls minimize the spread of viruses from infected children to adults?
 One year after its appearance, we continue to have many unanswered questions about the virus. Will the novel H1N1 agent become a persistent seasonal virus? Can we produce vaccine more quickly by moving to a cell-based rather than egg-based method? Can we possibly identify the Holy Grail of influenza vaccination, finding a virus target common to all influenza A strains so that we can administer a single vaccination at 10-year intervals?
 Even as we work to solve these enigmas, we can try to prepare better for future pandemics. First, we need to approach disease control not as individual nations, but as a global community. In this, Mexico has already set an excellent example. Only 10 days passed between Mexican health authorities' recognition of a possible new epidemic and their announcement of it, a sharp contrast to the many months in 2003 between the outbreak of SARS in China and its public declaration. 
 Mexico's transparency was a policy decision made with full recognition of the unfavorable economic consequences from H1N1, now estimated to have cost almost 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Thanks to that decision, we had an edge in fighting this virus. We should find ways to financially reward early reporting of novel infectious agents, while doing a better job of sharing resources and agreeing on common containment strategies.
 Second, we should rely not just on governments for reporting but on the cooperative efforts of international health organizations as well. These groups should set up better sentinel reporting systems in places where new swine or avian variants are most likely to occur -- wherever people and pigs or birds live closely together -- so that they can identify new virus progeny quickly. 
 Eventually, we'll also need to encourage farmers in developing countries to follow agricultural and safety practices that make it less likely that viruses will jump species.
 One predicts influenza at his own peril, but it is likely that H1N1 will continue to cause sporadic cases. In some highly susceptible, unvaccinated populations it may even produce local outbreaks. 
 But the struggle between people and pathogens is a part of life itself. We cannot continue to be surprised every time a new virus emerges. Instead, we must use the lessons we've learned during the year since H1N1 arrived to develop more effective public health responses.

HEADLINE: Imagine The Bailouts Are Working

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
What if, after all that panting over Washington's bailout of the financial system, we learned that it actually worked? 
 And what if, after all that vitriol over the government's risking hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue Wall Street from disaster, it turned out that taxpayers might actually lose nothing, or even make a profit?
 Could it be? Really? 
 Every couple of months the Treasury Department takes a moment to strategically leak some good news about the bailouts. It happened again on Monday, when a Treasury official told The Wall Street Journal that America's coffers would be only $89 billion lighter after all accounts were settled from the rescues, down from an earlier estimate of $250 billion. 
 It's enough to make us all feel rich, isn't it? 
 Inside the Obama administration, there are whispers of even greater optimism, with some officials suggesting that if the economic recovery continues apace, the bailout program could eventually turn from red to black.
 That may seem far-fetched to anyone who remembers the dire predictions about banks like Citigroup, but the numbers tell a different story. The government's $45 billion investment in Citigroup alone is on track to make a profit of nearly $11 billion, plus $8 billion or so in interest and other fees. 
 People inside the administration no longer refer to Citigroup as the ''Death Star''; now it is a ''profit center.'' 
 Of course, we're still expected to lose $48 billion on the government's rescue of the American International Group. But two people close to the board suggested to me that as the company recalculates the value of assets in its portfolio that were once considered ''toxic,'' the government could actually claw its way back to even on that investment, if it holds on to its stake long enough.
 A year ago, by the way, these same people told me they expected the government to take a ''$100 billion bath'' on its investment in A.I.G.
 And then there are the banks that have settled up with Uncle Sam, like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. We've gotten all our money back from them, along with several billion dollars in interest. 
 Of course, there's a small problem with all this happy Washington math: it doesn't take into account the piles of cash we're likely to lose on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the huge mortgage finance companies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that figure to be about $320 billion. That would wipe away any gains made elsewhere. 
 The overall math also doesn't account for the more than $1 trillion the Federal Reserve pumped into the system through loans to Wall Street that were virtually interest-free.
 But if you can put that aside for a moment -- and I know that's difficult to do -- do any of these numbers persuade you, the skeptical public, that we might one day declare the bailouts a victory? After all, at this point in the recovery, a fair observer could be forgiven for thinking we were, at minimum, saved from an economic nuclear winter. Newsweek declared on its cover this week that ''America's Back.''
 None of this math is likely to lead the American public to declare Mission Accomplished. Outside of Wall Street and Washington, the numbers will never look good enough, because to most people it's not about justifying the bailout but about avoiding another financial mess in the future. It's about moral hazard. It's about right and wrong. 
 You may recall that during the most perilous months of 2008 and early 2009, there was a vigorous debate about how the government should fix the financial system. Some economists, including Nouriel Roubini of New York University and The Times's own Paul Krugman, declared that we should follow the example of the Swedes by nationalizing the entire banking system. 
 They argued that Wall Street was occupied by the walking dead, and that no matter how much money we threw at the banks, they would eventually topple the system all over again and cause a domino effect worldwide.
 So were they wrong after all?
 Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist who was among the doomsayers, still isn't willing to declare victory, and he probably never will.
 ''I think this is disingenuous and a real attempt to distract people,'' Mr. Stiglitz, the author of ''Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy,'' said of the latest claims.
 Mr. Stiglitz, who has made a career of seeing every glass as half-empty, said we're looking at the numbers wrong. Even if we get our money back, he says, that doesn't tell the full story. To calculate the real cost, he insists, we need to add in the lost interest on the money spent.
 ''Did we get back anything commensurate with the risk?'' he asked almost rhetorically, before answering his own question. ''Clearly the answer is no.''
 Even at this feel-good moment, Mr. Stiglitz refuses to share in the love fest. Like many of us, he is still upset that the government didn't attach more strings to the bailouts. He also warns of the moral hazard that was created when the government made clear that it wouldn't let certain big banks fail. This, he says, will inevitably encourage more recklessness on Wall Street. 
 The next and perhaps final question is whether the government should hold on to its investments in companies like Citigroup rather than sell them off right away. 
 The Treasury has signaled that it plans to wind down its Citigroup stake. But what if Citigroup's shares continue to rise, and the government misses out on an even bigger gain? Had the government not let Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase pay their bailouts so early, taxpayers would have made out with even more money.
 But as the old Wall Street disclaimer goes, past performance is no guarantee of future results. I suspect that most taxpayers would be happy to take the advice of Kenny Rogers and quit now, while there are still chips to count.

 CORRECTION:
The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the possibility of the government's making a profit on its bailout of banks, overstated the position of the economists Paul Krugman and Nouriel Roubini, at the height of the financial crisis, on nationalizing banks. While both supported guaranteeing the liabilities of the banking industry and a temporary government takeover of certain failing institutions, they did not recommend nationalization of the entire banking system.

HEADLINE: 'A Different Creature'

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
Nancy Pelosi, at lunch, was making the point that this latest recession was not a typical cyclical downturn.
 ''This is a different creature,'' she said, ''and it demands that we see it in a different way.''
 The evidence is stark. More than 44 percent of unemployed Americans have been out of work for six months or longer, the highest rate since World War II. Perhaps more chilling is a new analysis by the Pew Economic Policy Group that found that nearly a quarter of the nation's 15 million unemployed workers have been jobless for a year or more. 
 Everything in Washington is a heavy lift. The successful struggle to pass last year's stimulus package fended off an even worse economic disaster, and the Democrats have managed to enact their health care initiative. But the biggest threat to the health of the economy -- corrosive, intractable, demoralizing unemployment -- is still with us. And the deficit zealots, growing in strength, would do nothing to counter this scourge.
 Ms. Pelosi acknowledged that ''there is always a calibration'' between concerns about deficit reduction and the spending that is necessary to substantially reduce unemployment. But she believes there are several fronts on which Congress and the Obama administration can -- in fact, must -- still move forward: on infrastructure and green energy initiatives, for example, and assistance to states hobbled with fiscal crises of their own.
 The crippling nature of the joblessness that has moved through the society like a devastating virus has gotten neither the attention nor the response that it warrants. One of the more striking findings of the Pew study was that a college education has not been much of a defense against long-term unemployment.
 ''Twenty-one percent of unemployed workers with a bachelor's degree have been without work for a year or longer,'' the report found, ''compared to 27 percent of unemployed high school graduates and 23 percent of unemployed high school dropouts.''
 Whole segments of the U.S. population are being left behind, even as economists are touting modest improvements in some categories of economic data, like the creation of 162,000 jobs in March. Jobless workers who are 55 or older are having a brutal time of it. Thirty percent have been jobless for a year or more.
 Blue-collar workers are suffering through a crisis characterized as a ''depression'' by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. Blue-collar job losses during the so-called Great Recession surpassed 5.5 million, and many of those jobs will never be seen again. This disastrous situation will not be corrected, as analysts at the center have noted, ''by a modest recovery of the U.S. economy over the next few years.''
 We need to pay less attention to the Tea Party yahoos and more attention to the very real suffering of individuals and families trapped in an employment crisis that is unprecedented in the post-Depression era. I've been in inner-city neighborhoods where residents will tell you that hardly anyone at all is working at a regular job.
 The recession only worsened an employment picture that was already bleak. In a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School last week, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. President Richard Trumka spoke movingly about Americans ''trying to hold on to a good job in a grim game of musical chairs where every time the music stopped, there were fewer good jobs and more people trying to get and keep one.''
 More than eight million jobs vanished during the recession, a period during which three million new jobs would have been needed to keep up with the growth of the population. ''That's 11 million missing jobs,'' said Mr. Trumka.
 Right now there is no plan that can even remotely be expected to result in job creation strong enough to rescue the hard-core groups being left behind. These include: long-term unemployed workers who are older; blue-collar workers of all ages; and younger people in the big cities, in the rust belt and in rural areas who are jobless and not well educated.
 It is not possible to put together a thriving, self-sustaining economy while so many are being left out. As Mr. Trumka noted, ''President Obama's economic recovery program has done a lot of good for working people -- creating or saving more than two million jobs. But the reality is that two million jobs is just 18 percent of the hole in our labor market.''
 Ms. Pelosi spoke about ''jobs creation'' with a tone of urgency and commitment and seemed undeterred by the fact that a big new jobs bill seems hardly feasible in the current political environment.
 ''You can do smaller pieces,'' she said. ''You can break the task up into segments, into discreet pieces of legislation. If size is a problem, we should not let it be an obstacle.''

HEADLINE: CHINA BACKS TALK TO PENALIZE IRAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama secured a promise from President Hu Jintao of China on Monday to join negotiations on a new package of sanctions against Iran, administration officials said, but Mr. Hu made no specific commitment to backing measures that the United States considers severe enough to force a change in direction in Iran's nuclear program.
 In a 90-minute conversation here before the opening of a summit meeting on nuclear security, Mr. Obama sought to win more cooperation from China by directly addressing one of the main issues behind Beijing's reluctance to confront Iran: its concern that Iran could retaliate by cutting off oil shipments to China. The Chinese import nearly 12 percent of their oil from Iran.
 Mr. Obama assured Mr. Hu that he was ''sensitive to China's energy needs'' and would work to make sure that Beijing had a steady supply of oil if Iran cut China off in retaliation for joining in severe sanctions. 
 American officials portrayed the Chinese response as the most encouraging sign yet that Beijing would support an international effort to ratchet up the pressure on Iran and as a sign of ''international unity'' on stopping Iran's nuclear program before the country can develop a working nuclear weapon. 
 Still, the session had distinct echoes of former President George W. Bush's three efforts to corral Chinese support for United Nations Security Council penalties intended to make it prohibitively expensive for Iranian leaders to enrich uranium and to refuse to answer the questions posed by international nuclear inspectors. 
 In those cases, former American officials said, the Chinese agreed to go along with efforts to address Iran's nuclear ambitions but then used Security Council negotiating sessions to water down the resolutions that ultimately passed.
 Mr. Obama also used his meeting with Mr. Hu, the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the world's largest economy and its biggest lender, to keep up the pressure on Beijing to let market forces push up the value of China's currency. That is a critical political task for Mr. Obama, because the fixed exchange rate has kept Chinese goods artificially cheap and, in the eyes of many experts, handicapped American exports and cost tens of thousands of American jobs.
 In anticipation of Monday's meeting, Chinese officials told Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner last week that they were about to resume a controlled loosening of their exchange rate, which would increase the relative costs of Chinese exports. 
 Mr. Obama's senior Asia adviser, Jeffrey A. Bader, told reporters after the meeting on Monday that Mr. Obama told Mr. Hu that a market oriented exchange rate would be ''an essential contribution'' to a ''sustained and balanced economic recovery.''
 The session with Mr. Hu came just before the opening of the first summit meeting devoted to the challenges of keeping nuclear weapons and material out of the hands of terrorists. At a dinner Monday evening in the cavernous Washington Convention Center, Mr. Obama led a discussion of the nature of the threat and the vulnerability of tons of nuclear material that could be fashioned into a weapon. 
 Earlier in the day, John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, offered a sampling of Mr. Obama's argument when he told reporters that the United States had continuing evidence of Al Qaeda's interest in obtaining highly enriched uranium or plutonium, the only materials from which a nuclear weapon can be made, and that it would be used ''to threaten our security and world order in an unprecedented manner.''
 But he cited no incidents beyond the now-famous campfire conversations that Osama bin Laden held in August 2001 with two Pakistanis who had deep ties to Pakistan's nuclear weapons laboratories. While Al Qaeda has tried repeated purchases, Mr. Brennan said, ''fortunately, I think they've been scammed a number of times, but we know that they continued to pursue that. We know of individuals within the organization that have been given that responsibility.''
 The main focus of Mr. Obama's meeting is to obtain commitments from each of the 47 countries attending to lock up or eliminate nuclear material. 
 One such agreement was announced Monday with Ukraine which, after the fall of the Soviet Union, was, because of its remainder stockpiles of nuclear missiles and bombs, briefly the world's third-largest nuclear power. It gave up the arsenal, but for the past 10 years had resisted surrendering its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, held at research reactors and another nuclear center. 
 The Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit group that studies proliferation, has estimated Ukraine's stockpile at 163 kilograms, or roughly enough for seven weapons. 
 According to a senior administration official, under the deal announced Monday the United States will pay to secure the highly enriched uranium, which will likely be sent to Russia for conversion into low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants. As part of the deal, the United States will also help supply Ukraine with new low-enriched fuel and a new research facility. 
 But over all, it was Iran that dominated the day, because the administration has a goal of putting sanctions in place this spring, Mr. Obama said in an interview with The New York Times last week.
 On Monday, Mr. Obama laid out the details of the sanctions package for Mr. Hu, according to a senior White House official familiar with the discussion. These are likely to include additional measures to deny Iran access to international credit, choke off foreign investment in Iran's energy sector and punish companies owned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which controls swaths of Iran's economy, as well as its nuclear program.
 The administration is betting that a large segment of Iranian society detests the Revolutionary Guards for its role in suppressing the protests that followed elections last June, and may welcome properly targeted sanctions.
 ''Until two weeks ago, the Chinese would not discuss a sanctions resolution at all,'' the official said. But the Obama administration, in hopes of winning over Beijing, has sought support from other oil producers to reassure China of its oil supply. Last year, it dispatched a senior White House adviser on Iran, Dennis B. Ross, to Saudi Arabia to seek a guarantee that it would help supply China's needs, in the event of an Iranian cutoff.
 ''We'll look for ways to make sure that if there are sanctions, they won't be negatively affected,'' said the senior official.
 There was little evidence in the meeting of the succession of spats that have soured Chinese-American relations over the last several months, American officials said. While Mr. Hu raised Chinese complaints about American weapons sales to Taiwan, an official said, he did so fleetingly. And he did not mention Mr. Obama's decision to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A headline in some copies on Tuesday about China's position on possible sanctions against Iran if it does not curb its nuclear program overstated a promise that President Hu Jintao of China made to President Obama in a meeting in Washington on Monday. As the article noted, Mr. Hu said that his country would join negotiations over the sanctions. He did not say that China supports such sanctions.

HEADLINE: O'Brien Will Move To TBS

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
EUGENE, Ore. -- In a move that has shocked much of the television world, Conan O'Brien will make his comeback on a cable -- not a network -- channel.
 The former ''Tonight Show'' host has agreed to start a late-night show on TBS, the comedy-oriented channel in the Turner network lineup. The four-night-a-week show -- no title yet -- will begin in November and fill the 11 p.m. slot, teamed with that network's other late-night show, with the comedian George Lopez as its host. That show, now at 11, will slide to midnight.
 The news, announced on Monday, was a stunning development because Mr. O'Brien had been in talks with Fox, and most predictions had him moving to that network in September or January.
 TBS was not previously mentioned as a bidder for his services. But Steve Koonin, the president of Turner Entertainment Networks, put together a pitch and approached Mr. O'Brien's representatives this month. 
 Mr. O'Brien's manager, Gavin Polone, described a whirlwind negotiation from that point.
 ''They called us only about a week and a half ago,'' Mr. Polone said in a telephone interview.
 Mr. Koonin said that when he presented the network's offer he emphasized what he called ''the transformational nature'' of the deal for both sides. ''For us it was an opportunity to get a transformational talent and the voice of a generation on our air,'' he said. For Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Koonin said, it was a chance to come back to television with creative freedom, an ample budget and ''the opportunity of ownership.'' TBS will allow Mr. O'Brien's production company to own the rights to the show.
 But Mr. Polone said the O'Brien side had an immediate reaction: ''You guys already have an 11 p.m. show.''
 He was referring to the current 11 p.m. show on TBS, ''Lopez Tonight.'' Mr. Polone said that Mr. Koonin told him that everything had been worked out and that Mr. Lopez had agreed to the later time slot to make room for Mr. O'Brien.
 But that script was awfully familiar to the O'Brien side. ''That sounded very similar to Jeff Gaspin coming to Conan and asking him to move back to midnight to make room for Jay,'' Mr. Polone said.
 In the turbulent early weeks of January, NBC's entertainment chief, Mr. Gaspin, asked Mr. O'Brien to move ''The Tonight Show'' to 12:05 a.m. to free up the preceding half-hour for Jay Leno to move back to late night (in a 30-minute show) after the quick failure of his 10 p.m. comedy hour.
 Mr. O'Brien memorably refused, issuing what has become known as the ''people of earth'' letter, which outlined his opposition to tampering with the start time of ''The Tonight Show.'' His representatives then negotiated his exit from NBC (which included a clause that prevented Mr. O'Brien from speaking to the press until after May 1).
 Mr. Polone said that when he went to Mr. O'Brien to inform him of the TBS offer, ''Conan said, 'We're not putting ourselves in the position of shoving somebody out of his show.' '' 
 But that position changed after Mr. Koonin spoke with Mr. Lopez. ''George understood and he became enthusiastic right away,'' he said. (A representative of Mr. Lopez said that the host would not comment until Tuesday, reserving his initial reaction for his own show on Monday night.) 
 Mr. Polone said that Mr. Lopez called Mr. O'Brien personally ''to sell Conan on this idea.'' He added, ''It really was George who made this happen.''
 With Mr. Lopez on board, talks became serious very quickly. TBS emphasized how young its audience was, a match with Mr. O'Brien's core viewers. ''The lead-ins would be shows like 'Family Guy' and 'The Office,' which is great for Conan,'' Mr. Polone said. Mr. Lopez has the youngest audience in late night with a median age of 33.
 Mr. Koonin also took a shot at the hosts remaining on the broadcast networks. ''CBS and NBC both have hosts in their 60s and their audiences are getting older and older,'' Mr. Koonin said, referring to Mr. Leno and David Letterman on CBS.
 The negotiations moved rapidly after that. Mr. Koonin said, ''From our first meeting on, it took about 70 hours all told.''
 TBS has also promised Mr. O'Brien what Mr. Koonin called ''the biggest marketing campaign in the history of cable.'' He said that promotional announcements would start appearing on TBS on Monday night. 
 The cable channel has the rights to the American League baseball playoffs and that accounts for why Mr. O'Brien's start was put off until November. ''It made no sense to start in September and then pre-empt him in October,'' Mr. Koonin said. ''We'll have a massive launch out of baseball.''
 Mr. O'Brien will continue to produce his show in Los Angeles, with a budget similar to what he enjoyed at NBC, so many of the elements of his previous NBC shows will come back, Mr. Polone said.
 He declined to comment on what happened with the negotiations with the Fox network, except to say that they had been continuing. But several executives who have knowledge of the process said that complications had made those negotiations difficult to conclude.
 One of the main obstacles was that Fox's affiliated stations had deals in place for syndicated programs -- mostly repeats of shows like ''The Simpsons'' and the comedies that play on TBS, ''The Office'' and ''Family Guy.'' The stations have already paid for those shows and sold advertising for them at prices based on the shows running in the 11 p.m. hour.
 The stations have also been through a financially crippling year because of the national recession and many were resistant to giving up the profits they would have with the syndicated repeats. (Fox and the affiliates were also facing contentious negotiations over retransmission rights to cable networks, a source of income the two entities will battle over in terms of who gets how much.)
 Mr. O'Brien was likely to reach only about 60 percent of the country on Fox with a first broadcast at 11 p.m. The rest of the country would be reached at later hours, diminishing his chances to hit a big rating -- at least initially. Fox was promising to expand the coverage to full clearance at 11 p.m. in about three years, several parties to the talks said.
 With TBS, Mr. O'Brien will reach almost every home in the nation immediately.
 Stepping away from a broadcast network may mean Mr. O'Brien will not get a full chance to face off with Mr. Leno and NBC, a prospect he might have liked given the circumstances of his departure.
 But what it does set up is a new kind of heavyweight match in late night. Now Mr. O'Brien will be face to face with the two big stars of late night in cable, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central. And a third late-night cable star, Chelsea Handler on E, is also on at that hour.
 All four shows are likely to be watched closely to see who emerges as the biggest late-night star -- on cable.

HEADLINE: The 3% Drag on a Nascent Recovery

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
With some indicators pointing to a slight rebound in the moribund commercial real estate market in New York City, transfer taxes have emerged as a threat to the few deals now in the works. 
 The combined New York State and city transfer taxes, levied whenever a property changes hands, are 3.025 percent, among the highest in the country. In a rising market the taxes are seen as incidental, but when profit margins contract the tax looms larger, and lenders and borrowers are grappling with who will pay it, real estate brokers and lawyers said.
 ''Any time you have a problem mortgage, the transfer tax is a central issue of the discussion,'' said Benjamin F. Needell, a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. ''Who pays it? How does it get paid? Is there a way to structure the deal so the tax doesn't get triggered? It certainly is complicating matters.'' 
 In comparison, Chicago has city and state transfer taxes that total just 1.2 percent, while in San Francisco the combined tax is 1.5 percent. One of the few cities with a higher transfer tax than New York is Philadelphia, at 4 percent. 
 The transfer tax has been a boon to city coffers, and generated about $1.726 billion in 2007, the peak of the commercial market. Revenue has taken a nose dive as the economy weakened, with the tax expected to generate only $581 million this year, according to the city's Office of Management and Budget. 
 Depending on the type of transaction, the tax is calculated differently. In a traditional building sale, the tax is a percentage of the purchase price and is paid by the seller. 
 In the case of troubled properties, if a borrower has no more funds and walks away from the building, handing over the deed to the lender in what is known as a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of the value of the mortgage. Because the borrower has no ability to pay the tax, the responsibility to cover the cost usually lies with the lender. 
 When properties are underwater, or worth less than their mortgage, said Michele Randall, a director at Deloitte Tax, ''you end up paying the transfer tax on the mortgage amount, which could be much more than the value of the real property.''
 In a foreclosure, the tax is based on the higher of either the fair market value or the value of the mortgage. In this situation a lender could be taxed twice: once when taking back the property from the borrower, and again if it then sells the property to a third party.
 Transfer taxes figure prominently in the protracted battle over the troubled Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex. Appaloosa Management, one of the lenders, is suing in Federal Court to stop a foreclosure, saying among other reasons that it would result in transfer taxes of about $200 million. Appaloosa said the company that now controlled the complex, CW Capital Management, should have sought a bankruptcy, thus avoiding the transfer taxes. 
 ''The case of Stuy Town is not unique,'' said R. Stuart Gross, an executive managing director for the real estate investment company Eastern Consolidated. ''It just involves huge numbers, which has garnered a lot of publicity.'' Mr. Gross said he was working on a similar case in which a lender was looking to foreclose on a distressed property and then resell it to a third-party buyer. 
 To avoid a double taxation, Mr. Gross is brokering a deal whereby the property would be handed directly from the borrower to the buyer, bypassing the lender. 
 ''As we move through the cycle in which financial institutions grapple with the disposition of their loan portfolios, minimizing transaction costs, including the transfer tax, is going to be critical to the process,'' Mr. Gross said. 
 The tax is also a factor in the sale of healthy buildings, said Woody Heller, an executive managing director at Studley, a real estate brokerage company. Mr. Heller said he was working with a client who was trying to sell a financially stable building in Manhattan, but because of the difficult environment its fair market value was only slightly higher than the value of the mortgage. This means that if the owner were to sell, he would pay back the mortgage and make a slim profit. But the transfer taxes on the sale would eat up a large part of those proceeds. 
 One way to mitigate the tax bite is for the owner of a building to sell a 49 percent stake in the property rather than the entire building. This is because a transfer tax is only levied if a controlling stake -- more than 50 percent -- of a property changes hands. In this case, the owner would sell the minority stake now and then sell the remaining 51 percent once the market, and his profit margin, improves. 
 But while transfer taxes are becoming more of a sticking point in this market, it is unlikely the commercial real estate market will get any relief. 
 ''I've not heard any serious discussion about curtailing the transfer taxes, and in this fiscal environment I would say the chance is slim to none,'' said George Sweeting, the deputy director of the city's Independent Budget Office. 
 Given that prospect, the industry is focusing on ways to avoid what it says has become an unwelcome stumbling block to a recovery. 
 ''When the market was stronger, transfer taxes were just considered the cost of doing business,'' said Michael E. Lefkowitz, a partner with the law firm Rosenberg & Estis. ''Today, with the market in so much turmoil, transfer taxes are something that has to be seriously considered and structured around in order to get any deals done.''

HEADLINE: One Last Place To Get Fleeced On a Mortgage

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One day last year, many people in trouble with mortgages got e-mail messages announcing that Sal Pane Jr., acclaimed expert on their exact problems, would be appearing on the ''CBS Evening News.'' 
 So acclaimed was Sal Pane Jr. -- by none other than Sal Pane Jr. and the people working to market his company -- that he had already been summoned to speak in front of the cameras of WABC and WNBC about how people could fix distressed mortgages. He gave quotes to newspapers, wire services and financial blogs. 
 Sal Pane Jr.'s expert advice on distressed mortgages: Hire a specialist to negotiate a better deal with the lenders -- someone like, well, Sal Pane Jr., the owner of two companies that provide precisely those kinds of services, the American Modification Agency and Amerimod Inc. 
 ''Oh yes,'' said Sandra Catus, a client of Mr. Pane's. ''They didn't stop selling.''
 At the time Mr. Pane appeared on CBS last March, Ms. Catus, a legal secretary who lived in St. Albans, Queens, had paid one of his companies $3,200 in return for a promise that it would get her out from under an adjustable mortgage that was sinking her. It didn't. She was one in a flock of people who, as the recent subprime mortgage era was winding down, managed to find one last place to get themselves fleeced.
 In October 2007, Mr. Pane started companies to renegotiate mortgages. He was 24 years old and had a sharp eye for the opportunities in a crisis. Ms. Catus, now 63, was on the verge of losing a well-paying job as a legal secretary. She had refinanced her home a year earlier, getting an adjustable-rate mortgage of $375,000. ''A big mistake,'' she said. ''When I was working, there was overtime and extra money, so the payments were manageable.'' The monthly payments, starting at $2,200, would leap to $3,500 and then $4,000. 
 To pay the mortgage while she was unemployed, she raided her 401(k) and savings. Eventually, she got another job, but there was little opportunity for overtime. A member of the N.A.A.C.P., she attended monthly meetings of a chapter on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. At the October 2008 gathering, a speaker from Amerimod gave a talk. His name was Efrain Roman. ''He said they had a 95 percent success rate in saving people's home from foreclosure,'' Ms. Catus said. ''I had just missed the September payment, and hadn't made October yet. I thought I had found a godsend.''
 Garish claims of success for thousands of homeowners were part of the business plan for Mr. Pane's companies, according to a complaint filed in State Supreme Court by the office of the New York State attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo. At one point, Mr. Pane proposed that the company claim 100 percent success, but a marketing consultant said that was impossible. 
 BY the time Ms. Catus heard about Amerimod, the state had passed a law regulating companies that deal as ''distressed-property consultants.'' For instance, it was against the law for Amerimod to collect fees upfront. 
 That did not stop Mr. Roman. ''I spoke to him the day after the meeting,'' she said. ''They would help me as soon as I paid them a 1 percent fee.''
 Because she could not pay it all at once, Amerimod arranged automatic deductions. ''Roman called me every Wednesday,'' Ms. Catus said. ''He told me about his family, how he got his name. I kept asking him for news about my case. They were working on it.''
 As soon as she had finished paying, the Wednesday-night calls from Mr. Roman stopped. ''In fact, he never called me again,'' she said. The next official news she got about her case was taped to her front door: a foreclosure notice. 
 Nearly everything about Amerimod was illegal, according to the attorney general's office: the upfront fees, the outlandish claims of success -- a ''negligible'' number of its 3,000 clients had loans modified -- and a contract that did not spell out free alternatives to paying a company like Amerimod. 
 On Tuesday, Justice Emily Jane Goodman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan issued a permanent injunction against the illegal operations of Mr. Pane and his companies. The evidence was overwhelming, she said, and ordered the matter referred to the Manhattan district attorney's office for a criminal investigation. The authorities in Maryland have also moved to shut down the businesses. Mr. Pane's lawyer did not return repeated calls for comment. His father said he had not heard from him in a month. 
 Nor has he appeared as an expert in any news stories recently.

HEADLINE: Negotiations Seek to Avert a Strike by Doormen Next Week

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
With a strike deadline looming, contract negotiations between the owners of apartment buildings and the union that represents doormen and other workers have been complicated by very different views on whether the city's economy has turned a corner.
 Building owners, represented by the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, say that stubbornly high unemployment rates show that the devastation has not passed, and that they must hold down costs after a five-year period in which rent collections decreased and operating costs increased by 27 percent. 
 But the union, which represents 30,000 workers in residential buildings, said that the market hit bottom six months ago, and that the recession did not strike residential buildings owners in the city very hard, with rent declines in the single digits and vacancy rates remaining low. 
 ''There's no question we've had a bad economy, but in the residential sector in New York, actually they fared much better than anyplace else in the country,'' said Mike Fishman, president of the union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. ''More importantly, this is a contract about looking forward, and the economy seems to be picking up.''
 The two sides have held preliminary negotiations during the last month. But the intense work begins on Thursday, when the leaders of each side are to convene at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers for marathon sessions in an effort to avoid a strike before the contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
 Through the years, the two sides have maintained a respectful relationship. The union has not struck since 1991, when there was a 12-day walkout. Thousands of New Yorkers found themselves figuring out ways to have packages delivered or the trash taken out as members of other unions, including garbage collectors, generally honored picket lines. 
 Both sides said they did not want a strike. But, strengthening their bargaining positions, they have made preparations for one, should negotiations break down. 
 The Realty Advisory Board advised its members to make contingency plans to deal with a potential walkout. The building workers recently approved a strike, and several thousand workers attended a rally on Tuesday night.
 The workers -- doormen, porters, superintendents, elevator operators and handymen -- now earn an average of $40,489 a year. Benefits and other costs raise the total per employee to $68,603, said Howard Rothschild, president of the Realty Advisory Board, which represents the owners of 3,200 rental buildings, co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.
 ''I don't think the real estate industry has a significant problem with the base wage,'' Mr. Rothschild said. ''It's that additional $30,000 a year that really costs for the benefits for most employees.''
 The realty board has proposed several measures to reduce those benefit costs, with an eye toward bringing the next contract in line with larger employment trends. The proposals would, for instance, require current employees to pay 10 percent of their health care premiums; they now pay nothing. New employees would pay 18 percent of the premium. The owners also want to put new employees into a 401(k) pension plan instead of the employer-funded one for current workers.
 The board is also seeking to slow the pace at which new employees reach the maximum pay and benefits level. Under the current contract, new workers receive 80 percent of full salary for the first 30 months. The building owners' proposal would add another 30 months at 90 percent before workers reached full salary.
 Mr. Fishman said the union had agreed to smaller wage increases in prior negotiations to avoid health care premium payments from employees. He said the union would not agree to lower wages and the loss of the current pension plan for future employees. ''That's a deal breaker,'' he said. ''We're not going to agree to that. There's nothing to negotiate about that.''
 Similar issues arose during the last round of negotiations, in 2006. Building owners eventually dropped the proposed pension changes and agreed to an 8.5 percent wage increase over four years. 
 But Mr. Rothschild said the economy would make the bargaining more difficult this year, adding ''this is not the time for the traditional wage and benefit increases that we've seen in the past.''

HEADLINE: Rebuilding a Town, One Piece at a Time

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
PERRY, Iowa -- Just days after the last of the winter snow melted here last month, workers descended on the corner of Second Street and Otley Avenue. In a matter of weeks, they had finished installing water, electric and sewer lines for the Perry Career Academy, a campus of Des Moines Area Community College that will train 450 adults and high school students in the vocational arts.
 The academy, a $3.1 million, 17,000-square-foot facility, will employ about 30 people in this city of 9,500 northwest of Des Moines, which like a lot of communities in the Midwest has been groping toward economic sustainability in the 21st century. 
 The project is tiny, of course, when compared with typical construction projects in Des Moines, 35 miles away, or other metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, the campus -- more than a third of its cost financed by local donations and municipal funds -- will draw students, faculty and staff members to restaurants and shops in Perry's renovated turn-of-the-20th-century bank and mercantile buildings. That has a big impact in a region where livestock outnumber people and where the local newspaper reports on a lost pocketbook returned to its owner. 
 Perry's fortunes dived in the late 1970s, when the Milwaukee Road, the last of the rail lines that sustained the town from its founding in 1869, was shut. But rather than trying to land one big project or employer, in the 1990s Perry embraced a development strategy based on adding recreation, lodging, education and clean energy to its traditional strength in livestock agriculture, and it has been steadily picking up momentum even in the face of the severe national recession. 
 ''The academy is another piece of Perry's revitalization,'' said Delbert Niebuhr, the city administrator and a Perry native. ''This piece adds to all the other pieces that have been put in place. Every time we get one thing done we try to build on that.'' 
 From the corner of Second and Otley, Perry's multipronged efforts are apparent. The Raccoon River Valley Trail, a 89-mile bike path that ties downtown Des Moines to Perry and, farther on, to Jefferson, runs down Otley Avenue. The last half-mile section in Perry will be paved this month at a cost of $100,000, financed by the state. 
 Across the square is the Hotel Pattee, an elegant 40-room, full-service hotel where rooms are modestly priced by big city standards, typically around $140. The hotel closed for two years in 2006 after a renovation in the late 1990s financed by Roberta Green Ahmanson, a wealthy native daughter, that city leaders said cost an estimated $20 million. 
 In 2008 the hotel was reopened by Steven C. Olson, the chief executive and president of Leisure Hotels, based in Leawood, Kan. Mr. Olson agreed to buy the hotel for $1.5 million as long as Perry paid his company $150,000 annually for seven years to help defray losses he anticipated in the first few years. 
 Mr. Olson said in an interview that the hotel had indeed lost $400,000 over the last two years, but that he expected to break even by the start of next year. Part of the reason is that the completion of the Raccoon bike trail should encourage more of Des Moines's athletic young professionals and couples to spend summer weekend evenings in his hotel. ''We see the trail as a marketing opportunity,'' Mr. Olson said.
 The willingness of Perry officials to work closely with private investors is not new. Earlier this year, Mr. Olson and Mr. Niebuhr negotiated a land swap behind the hotel that will give the city space to build a $300,000 downtown community courtyard with a bocce court this spring, and will give the Hotel Pattee a new parking area. 
 In many cases Perry city leaders have used public funds to leverage private investments. In the early 1980s, Perry recruited Oscar Mayer to buy and operate a hog processing plant it built in the 1960s. The plant is now owned by Tyson Foods and employs 1,200 people (100 more than in December) many of them Latino. That in turn has encouraged the development of a Latino culture in Perry that prompted St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church to hold a Spanish-language Sunday Mass and provided Gil Lepe, a local entrepreneur, the opportunity to open the new 3,500-square-foot Casa de Oro Mexican restaurant in a renovated early-20th-century three-story brick building on Second Street.
 Perry also built an industrial park that in 1998 persuaded Percival Scientific, a manufacturer of agronomic equipment, to build a 62,400-square-foot plant that now employs 60 people. Three years ago, ITC Midwest, which installs transmission lines for Iowa's extensive wind industry, spent $863,000 to build a 30,000-square-foot facility that employs 40 people. Mr. Niebuhr said a manufacturer specializing in farm equipment was preparing to spend $2.5 million for a new plant in the industrial park, though he declined to identify the company. 
 The steady accumulation of investment and jobs has helped to Perry become the second-largest city in Dallas County, population now 60,000 and the country's 28th-fastest-growing county, according to the Census Bureau. City leaders said unemployment in Perry was around 6 percent. 
 Perry's path to economic stability, now seemingly more secure, faced impediments. ''I watched them get clobbered when the railroad scaled back,'' said Chuck Offenburger, a former feature columnist for The Des Moines Register who now publishes Offenburger.com, a news and information Web site in Cooper, Iowa, 15 miles from Perry. ''They've had some wobbles with the meat packing plant, too. In the meantime they have diversified the industrial base. But the really important project was the Hotel Pattee. That really fired up a whole new wave of downtown redevelopment.''
 The 50,000-square-foot renovation halted years of deterioration in the hotel, which was built in 1913. Mrs. Ahmanson, whose father was an engineer on the Milwaukee Road, now lives in Orange County, Calif., and is married to Howard F. Ahmanson Jr., an influential conservative philanthropist. She formed a company, Pattee Enterprises, to buy the building and painstakingly create an Arts and Crafts interior, including mahogany paneling, leather furnishings, original oil paintings and detailed murals of farm culture and Perry's history. 
 Pattee Enterprises also financed the construction of Soumas Court, a public walkway that is next to the hotel and distinguished by welded arches on both ends by the metal artist Albert Paley. The arches are constructed from farm equipment, mining tools, railroad artifacts and metal pieces donated by local residents.
 Ms. Ahmanson then invested around $6 million to renovate two bank buildings that flank the hotel on Willis Avenue. One houses the Chamber of Commerce, the Perry school district, and the offices of the city administrative staff and Mayor Jay Pattee, who is not related to the family that started the hotel. The other is occupied by Town/Craft, a research group associated with Iowa State University that focuses on small-town sustainability. Ms. Ahmanson's last big downtown project was to spend $3 million to turn the 106-year-old Carnegie Library at the center of town into a museum and community center. 
 ''There was no guarantee when we bought the property that it would all work,'' said Mr. Olson, of the Hotel Pattee, which employs 23 people. ''Roberta Ahmanson gave this community something to build from, and everybody has worked together to keep it going.''

HEADLINE: Imports Rose in February, Building Hope for Recovery

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Trade data on Tuesday provided another piece of evidence that spending by consumers and businesses was picking up, bolstering hopes that the recovery was gaining momentum.
 The Commerce Department's monthly report on trade showed a 1.7 percent increase in imports. Exports barely rose, leading the trade deficit to increase 7.4 percent from January, to $39.7 billion, more than forecast. 
 The surge in imports, while reflecting a healthy pickup in spending, may be a drag on economic expansion in the short term. That is because the government subtracts imports when it calculates gross domestic product, the total value of goods and services in the economy. 
 But as stimulus programs fade later this year and domestic demand cools off, economists say exports may begin to outpace imports and contribute positively to G.D.P. 
 ''On net, what we're seeing is a positive development,'' said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. ''Consumer and business demand still has a decent amount of momentum behind it.''
 Much of the growth in imports came from consumer goods, like televisions and pharmaceutical products, as the jobs market improved slightly and Americans began to spend more.
 Businesses imported goods to restock inventories and replace aging equipment. Industrial supplies and capital goods, like machinery and tools, bolstered much of the growth.
 ''With most businesses looking to stabilize or modestly boost inventories, underlying demand for imports has picked up substantially,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a consulting firm, wrote in a research note. 
 The politically sensitive trade gap with China fell to $16.5 billion from $18.3 billion a month earlier. China reported its first monthly trade deficit in nearly six years on Saturday, with imports surging but exports growing only modestly.
 The dwindling trade deficit may take some pressure off China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate against the dollar. American policy makers have said China's currency controls give Chinese companies an unfair advantage in global trade. 
 American exports rose 0.2 percent in February, reaching the highest levels since October 2008. Analysts expect growth in exports to continue as global demand picks up, with a weak dollar helping to make United States goods cheaper abroad. American businesses are hoping to tap into turbocharged markets like India and China, where demand is soaring.
 President Obama has announced a broad effort to double exports in the next five years by easing restrictions on selling certain goods abroad and increasing credit to small and medium-size businesses seeking to enter the export market.
 Imports of crude oil fell to the lowest level since 1999, reaching 243.1 million barrels, a decline that economists attributed to a reluctance by struggling consumers and businesses to pay higher energy costs. Auto and food imports also declined. 
 Exports of cars and fuel oil rose, while food exports dropped.

HEADLINE: Trading Ends With a Modest Gain as Investors Digest Earnings Reports

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street traders took in the first batch of quarterly earnings reports on Tuesday, but nobody seemed quite sure what to make of the numbers.
 Investors initially retreated as Alcoa, the aluminum producer, reported its fifth loss in six quarters, sending stocks down sharply. 
 But as the session wore on, traders seemed to gain more confidence that certain sectors, especially technology and manufacturing, were on the verge of robust results. 
 By the end of trading, the major indexes had eked out small gains. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.45 points, or 0.12 percent, to close at 11,019.42, a day after finishing above the 11,000 threshold for the first time since September 2008. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.82, or 0.07 percent, to 1,197.30, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 8.12 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,465.99, helped by a surge in the shares of Intel ahead of its earnings results.
 A dip in the price of oil helped drive enthusiasm for consumer-oriented companies, which have rallied amid signs that shoppers might benefit from falling gasoline prices. Oil fell 29 cents, to $84.05 a barrel. Shares of Home Depot surged 2.6 percent on hopes the company would benefit from an uptick in consumer spending.
 But the drop in commodity prices hurt some energy and materials companies. Schlumberger, the oil field services company, fell 80 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $65.51 a share. Chevron and Exxon Mobil also declined.
 Wall Street found some hope in a Commerce Department report on trade, which showed a pickup in demand from American consumers and businesses. The trade deficit widened but largely because of an increase in imports. 
 The focus this week is on earnings. General Electric, which is to release first-quarter results on Friday, rose 1.3 percent, to $18.95 a share, and the 3M Company climbed 0.8 percent, to $83.94 a share. Intel, which was set to report results after the market closed, rose more than 1 percent, to $22.77 a share. Shares of Alcoa fell 23 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $14.34.
 Investors will get results from a broad slice of the corporate world this week, including Google and JPMorgan Chase. Wall Street analysts expect companies to show strong first-quarter profits and to lift forecasts for the rest of the year in light of recent economic momentum. But until that becomes evident, investors may be hesitant. 
 While a rebound for the stock market has shown no signs of letting up, recent rallies have come on light trading, raising questions about their significance. At the moment, Wall Street is expecting earnings to be strong through the end of the year, but much of that depends on when the government withdraws extraordinary stimulus measures and how quickly unemployment abates.
 ''The market is waiting out earnings season to get a sense of guidance from the bellwether stocks,'' said Quincy M. Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. ''The question is, are these valuations in fact commensurate with the earnings ability of the company?''
 The debt crisis in Greece continues to cloud the market. On Tuesday, an auction of Greek bonds attracted stronger demand than analysts had expected. 
 Even though Greece appears unlikely to default, investors note that it will still face high borrowing costs. And there is the possibility that other debt-laden governments in Europe and elsewhere may also face difficulty paying their bills.
 Interest rates were slightly lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32, to 98 18/32, and the yield slipped to 3.82 percent from 3.84 percent late Monday.

Pulling Down 
 The Debt Wall
A looming wall of debt can be a scary thing. Nearly $830 billion of risky dollar-denominated corporate debt comes due from 2012 to 2014, according to JPMorgan Chase. 
 At first sight, that casts a long shadow over credit markets. But borrowers like Cablevision are already tweaking their obligations. If this keeps up, the great wall of debt will be much smaller in two years' time. 
 Half the debt in question does not actually mature until 2014. That means companies and their lenders have some time to pull their bricks out of the wall early with the help, for the moment, of investors eager to buy new debt. 
 Cablevision took advantage this week. It refinanced debt due in 2012 with $1.25 billion of notes maturing in 2018 and 2020. Moreover, it did not have to pay higher interest rates on the new debt than the 8 percent it was already paying. A Cablevision subsidiary, CSC Holdings, extended $3 billion of its own debt by pushing maturities into 2015 and 2016. 
 A rival, Charter Communications, on March 31 said it extended $3 billion of loans to 2016 from 2014. Harrah's Entertainment plans to pay off debt that was due in 2010-11 with the cash raised by issuing new bonds that mature in eight years. 
 Such piecemeal efforts to refinance and extend debt may not be enough to dismantle the wall, but combined they should hammer it down to a much more manageable size. In fact, the hurdle is already less formidable than it was 15 months ago. Credit Suisse estimates that the volume of leveraged loans due to mature from 2012 to 2015 has fallen by $100 billion since late 2008. 
 Free-flowing credit, of course, is essential to the companies wielding their pickaxes ahead of time. This year it's been readily available in the junk bond market, where nearly all new debt sold in the first quarter will mature in 2015 or later, according to Fitch Ratings. As long as credit investors remain receptive, the 2012-14 debt wall won't by then be the worrying obstacle it now appears.
 Conspiracy Theory
 Were America's bailed-out banks ''too clubby to fail?'' Kerry Killinger, the former chief executive at Washington Mutual, thinks so and says he believes that WaMu's outsider status explains why it wasn't rescued in September 2008. The circumstances of WaMu's demise raise vexing questions. But the bank, which was headquartered far away from the East Coast banking center, looks more sacrificial lamb than outcast. 
 Mr. Killinger, who was ousted three weeks before the bank went under, pointed out that WaMu was excluded from the Treasury's initial July 2008 list of financial firms whose stock speculators were banned from selling short. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also made the unusual step of seizing the bank on a Thursday rather than a Friday. And if regulators had waited just a week longer, WaMu would have benefited from a number of government programs that shored up the banking system. 
 There's some truth to all of this. The F.D.I.C.'s decision to expand deposit insurance to $250,000 per account may well have stopped WaMu's bank run in its tracks. And the F.D.I.C.'s debt guarantee program and Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program would have shored up its balance sheet, assuming WaMu had been deemed healthy enough. These measures allowed the likes of Citigroup to survive. 
 But if there is a conspiratorial air around WaMu, it's in the timing. Henry Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary at the time, introduced his bailout idea four days before and the first Congressional vote followed three days after the seizure and sale of WaMu to JPMorgan Chase. What better way to impress upon lawmakers how dire the situation had become than to have the recent failure of one of the nation's top banks as Exhibit A? 
 A joint report from the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. due out later this week will argue that WaMu was too far gone to help, as regulators apparently decided in mid-September. In any event, Wells Fargo's experience punctures the club argument: WaMu's West Coast rival was allowed to snap Wachovia out from the clutches of Citigroup in a deal that consequently put it on a par with Wall Street's giants. For Mr. Killinger -- and other conspiracy theorists -- that's the exception to prove the rule. AGNES T. CRANE and ANTONY CURRIE

HEADLINE: O'Brien, Unbound, Hits the Road

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore. 

 BODY:
Conan O'Brien thrilled a sell-out crowd of frenzied fans here Monday night, putting on a two-hour, high-energy show that touched on his widely publicized and contentious departure from NBC, but at the same time reached back to many of his best-loved moments from his days at that network.
 These included guest appearances by fan favorites like a certain self-pleasuring bear -- slightly reconstituted as a panda for the occasion -- and a completely unreconstructed insult-comic dog, who managed to trash many specific features of this college town. The almost mind-bogglingly absurdist clips from the old CBS series ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' also turned up, complete with the familiar crank Mr. O'Brien always used to switch them on. 
 All the elements -- which at least nominally NBC has said that it owns and can prevent Mr. O'Brien from using if it wanted to press the point legally -- underscored that Mr. O'Brien was trying to stay in touch with his comedy brand. It is a brand of sophisticated, silly comedy that has built a fan base so supportive that they lined up here hours before the show in a downpour, some chanting his name at passing cars, and then crammed a souvenir stand in the Hult Center that was selling a wide range of Conan O'Brien items.
 Most of these invoked the ''Team Coco'' name that the comic adopted in his last days at NBC or the heroic ''Conan'' image, looking like a 1930s propaganda poster featuring a fearsome-looking Mr. O'Brien with a shock of flaming orange hair.
 One illustration of the adulation he inspired in the crowd: during his encore, the rockabilly number ''Forty Days,'' Mr. O'Brien bolted the stage, guitar in hand, and waded up the aisles. On his way back, he stopped by a female fan with outstretched arms and planted a kiss on her. A few steps farther down the aisle, a young man of about 25, two seats in, leaned out and ostentatiously offered his own cheek for Mr. O'Brien to kiss. He was accommodated.
 As Mr. O'Brien continued down the aisle, the young man's friend said, ''Now you can't wash that cheek.'' 
 The fan replied, ''Now I can die happy.'' 
 The show was more a raucous variety and vaudeville act than stand-up performance, though Mr. O'Brien -- in a red beard that was neatly trimmed, but not as trim as the comic himself, who looked slimmer than at any point in recent memory -- did deliver an opening monologue. But he also sang with ferocity, blasted away on three separate guitars, and danced with reckless abandon at several junctures. 
 Guests also appeared, led by Mr. O'Brien's longtime sidekick Andy Richter (who, to keep in practice, fronted a few fake commercials, among other things). The guest moments included a song from the band Spoon and a walk-on (with no lines) by the ''30 Rock'' actor Jack McBrayer. 
 Mr. O'Brien's familiar house band, once known as the Max Weinberg 7, backed the show, though minus Mr. Weinberg. The drum kit bore the name of the tour: ''Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television.''
 The title refers to the exit deal Mr. O'Brien struck with NBC, which, he noted in his monologue, keeps him from appearing on television, radio or the Internet. That prohibition ends Sept. 1, but Mr. O'Brien's new show on the cable channel TBS does not start until November. He did refer to that new deal at a couple of points, thanking TBS for allowing him a chance to go back to work.
 Before the monologue, Mr. O'Brien appeared in an elaborate taped parody of his misery during his enforced three-month absence from show business. Backed by the syrupy strains of Eric Carmen's ''All By Myself,'' a grossly fat Mr. O'Brien sporting a Rip Van Winkle beard lazed in a heap surrounded by a half-eaten pizza and beer until roused by the prospect of a 32-city national tour.
 He made a point -- one of many that were comically phrased but meaningful as well -- that in this concert he was appearing in front of an audience that had not gotten its tickets free. (All audiences for late-night television shows apply for tickets, but there is no cost.)
 ''Believe it or not,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''This is the first time anyone has ever paid to see me. Don't get me wrong: They've paid to make me to go away.''
 NBC, of course, settled his contract when he left ''The Tonight Show'' in January (handsomely, at about $32.5 million) after the network wanted to move his show later to make room for Jay Leno to return to late-night TV. 
 He referred to his recent situation, including talking about visiting an unemployment office and realizing that he had no skills other than doing his ''string dance'' (in which he imitates a spastic puppet and concludes by faking a searing touch of one finger to a nipple) and singing some song parodies. One, ''I Want a Show Again,'' was a reworking of ''On the Road Again.'' Another was a version of ''I Will Survive'' that also had some special lyrics -- and meaning.
 Perhaps the most pointed moments came in several taped segments, where Mr. O'Brien played a crazed, bald, bespectacled network executive who seemed one part NBC programmer and one part Ernst Blofeld of James Bond fame. (Lots of white cats were involved.) 
 Throughout the show, fans howled expressions of love at regular intervals, even when Mr. O'Brien seemed to be unburdening himself of some of the more painful aspects of the divorce from NBC.
 He made some half-joking references, for example, to what he had learned from talking to a psychiatrist in recent months. One lesson, he said, was that there were stages in the loss of a talk show not unlike the stages of grieving. The eight stages he cited were mostly jokes, though No. 2, ''Blaming Yourself,'' had a message attached: Mr. O'Brien said he didn't spend a lot of time on that stage because ''what the hell did I do?''
 That brought one of the biggest bursts of applause. And the waves of ovation fit into the night's undercurrent of psychological recovery. 
 After the overwhelming reception he received when he first stepped out onto the stage, Mr. O'Brien said, ''I'm not supposed to admit this, but I really missed the applause.'' 
 On Monday night, in front of about 2,800 adoring fans, Mr. O'Brien got what he needed.

HEADLINE: Apple Lets Opera Browser Use Own Software on iPhone

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
The Norwegian company that makes the Opera Internet browser said on Tuesday that its software had been approved for use on the iPhone, making it the first browser that competes with Apple's own software to gain full access to the device. 
 The software, which promotes faster browsing by compressing Internet data before displaying it on a mobile device, will be available on the iPhone and iPod Touch by Wednesday.
 In the United States, the Opera Mini browser is primarily found on the BlackBerry. Opera, which said it had 50 million users of its mobile browser before the announcement, planned to give away the Opera Mini at Apple's application store.
 The distribution through Apple would help Opera generate more revenue from the advertising and search engines that the company builds into its browser.
 ''This is certainly good news for us and this will help us expand tremendously in the United States,'' said Tor Odland, a spokesman for Opera, a company that was created in 1995 and has 800 employees. ''We are basically on every other type of device in the world and this covers a big hole for us.''
 Apple already offers several browsers, like Incognito, Aquari and Shaking Web, besides its own Safari browser at the iPhone app store. But all of those use Safari's own software rendering engine or other Apple components.
 Opera Mini is the first browser, Mr. Odland said, that has been approved to use its own software engine and components on the iPhone.
 The approval came after Opera spent several months in negotiations with Apple. It submitted a formal application to Apple a few weeks ago, Mr. Odland said.
 Although sales have been rising, Opera has been struggling to maintain profit as it seeks distribution deals with the world's big mobile phone and computer makers.
 The Norwegian company filed an antitrust complaint in December 2007 with the European Commission challenging Microsoft's practice of bundling its Internet Explorer browser into its Windows operating system.
 The commission upheld Opera's complaint, and Microsoft agreed to distribute the browsers of its rivals, including Opera, through Windows starting this year in Europe.
 But the legal victory has not compensated for the effects of the economic slowdown in Europe and Asia, which, with rising operating costs, have weighed on Opera's financial results.
 The company's net profit fell 88 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, the latest results reported by Opera, to 4 million kroner ($680,000) from 31.1 million kroner a year earlier.
 For all of 2009, Opera's profit fell 65 percent, to 30.9 million kroner, even as revenue rose 59 percent, to 184.9 million kroner. Shares of Opera, which is based in Oslo, rose 3.6 percent Tuesday.
 ''The Apple announcement is good news for Opera, but I don't think it will be a game-changer,'' said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst in London for the research firm Gartner. ''The browser experience with Safari on the iPhone is fine. That is partly why the iPhone is so popular. That will be tough competition for Opera and the other rival browsers.''

HEADLINE: Dodgers Promising Despite Distraction

BYLINE: By BILLY WITZ

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- During the winter, the Los Angeles Dodgers gave a facelift to their cramped, nearly 50-year-old clubhouse, installing brighter lights, posting quotations and photographs of famous Dodgers and putting up cubbyholes above the players' lockers that appeared to be straight out of an Ikea catalog.
 But when center fielder Matt Kemp turned on the stereo system and ramped up the volume before Tuesday's home opener, there was a crackle, a pop and finally silence. 
 ''I thought we were in the big leagues,'' Kemp said, shaking his head.
 The Dodgers, who fell just shy of reaching the World Series the last two seasons, hope for better results from the caulk-and-paint job they did on their roster over the winter.
 While the Philadelphia Phillies added Roy Halladay, the St. Louis Cardinals re-signed Matt Holliday, the Boston Red Sox landed John Lackey and the Yankees picked up Javier Vazquez, the Dodgers fortified the roster by bringing back Vicente Padilla, whom they picked up after his release by the Texas Rangers last August, to be their opening day starter.
 The Los Angeles payroll, reduced for the second consecutive season, dipped to $95 million on opening day, 12th highest in baseball. The Dodgers are one of 14 clubs whose payrolls have fallen from last season, another sign of how the recession has touched baseball. But what sets the Dodgers apart is that they are not in so-called small markets like Pittsburgh or Cleveland -- and that their owner, Frank McCourt, is in the middle of a bitter divorce from his wife, Jamie.
 When the McCourts' split became public last year during the National League Championship Series, they were at least amiable enough to sit in the same box near the Dodgers' dugout.
 Not anymore.
 The day after the Dodgers' season ended with a loss to Philadelphia, Frank McCourt fired his wife as the team's chief executive. In court filings, the McCourts have taken turns tossing grenades at each other. There have been accusations of infidelity and portraits of a lifestyle so opulent that Marie Antoinette might have blushed.
 The Los Angeles Times also reported that the McCourts, despite listing $108 million in income since they bought the team in 2004, had not paid any federal or state income tax over that period.
 On a sun-soaked spring afternoon Tuesday, Frank McCourt made his way through the dugout just before the game, wearing a dark blue suit instead of his usual shirtsleeves, and took his customary seat near Tom Lasorda, the team's former manager.
 Jamie McCourt did not attend, her lawyer telling The Los Angeles Times a day earlier that she did not want to be a distraction.
 That is the same message Manager Joe Torre gave his team. ''That's not our business,'' Torre said. ''You do what you can control, and the only thing you can control right now is trying to win ballgames.''
 The topic is already an old one to many Dodgers. Kemp, for example, bristled when it was broached. 
 First baseman James Loney said: ''It's just a story to talk about. Any time it's in the news, it's going to be brought up.''
 Kemp and Loney are members of the Dodgers' promising core, which includes catcher Russell Martin, right fielder Andre Ethier and pitchers Clayton Kershaw, Chad Billingsley and Jonathan Broxton. The lineup has been augmented by the veterans Manny Ramirez, Casey Blake and Rafael Furcal.
 The Dodgers rode those bats Tuesday, with Ethier, Ramirez, Blake and Kemp homering as the Dodgers scored a 9-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
 But where the Dodgers go this season may ultimately be decided by their starting pitching.
 Not only did the Dodgers not pursue Lackey or Halladay, the two best pitchers on the market, they also declined to offer arbitration to Randy Wolf, their most reliable starter a year ago, and allowed him to leave without receiving any draft picks as compensation. They also did not figure in the pursuit of Ben Sheets, once a top-shelf starter who is returning from arm surgery. He signed a one-year, $10 million contract with Oakland.
 Instead, the Dodgers will hope for the development of Kershaw and Billingsley and an injury-free year from Hiroki Kuroda, and cross their fingers when they hand the ball to Padilla, who has been rocked in his two starts, and the knuckleballer Charlie Haeger. The fallbacks are a pair of retread Ortizes, Ramon and Russ.
 ''If those two guys pitch the way we, as an organization, think they can pitch, we're going to be fine,'' the third-base coach Larry Bowa said of Billingsley and Kershaw. ''If they don't, then. ...
 ''Obviously the name of the game is pitching,'' Bowa continued. ''If you don't have pitching, you're not going to get very far. You need a pitcher who when you lose three in a row says the buck stops here, you give him a run and it's enough. That's the definition of a shutdown No. 1. They're very capable, but they're not there yet.''
 That was clear again Tuesday as Kershaw, a left-hander whose curveball has drawn comparisons to Sandy Koufax's, had struggles with his control the way the young Koufax had. Kershaw has walked 11 batters in two starts and needed 110 pitches to make it through five and a third innings.
 ''I'd rather they win because of me than in spite of me,'' Kershaw said.
 The season is young now, but it is a long slog to October. By the time the Dodgers reach August, they will have an idea whether Kershaw or Billingsley -- or anyone else -- can get them to the World Series. The trading deadline will have passed by then, which means that as the McCourts get ready to go to trial, it should be clear whether the Dodgers' only source of irritation about the case will come from reporters' questions.

HEADLINE: Andy Stern to Step Down as Chief of Politically Active Union

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Andy Stern, the nation's most politically influential union president, will announce plans this week to resign, several union officials said, in a move that surprised and shook organized labor and Democratic political circles.
 His many conservative detractors hailed the departure of Mr. Stern, who as president of the Service Employees International Union has been labor's most electrifying -- and polarizing -- leader. 
 But many Democratic politicians and consultants voiced confidence that the 1.9 million-member union would remain a powerful force even after Mr. Stern departs.
 His likely successor, Anna Burger, the union's secretary-treasurer and Mr. Stern's longtime No. 2, helped devise the strategies that made the service employees what many politicians say is the nation's most politically potent union, with the largest political action committee during the 2008 campaigns. The S.E.I.U. boasts that it spent $85 million in the 2008 campaigns and mobilized more than 150,000 members to do electoral work. 
 ''The S.E.I.U. is the fastest-growing union, and it will continue to be a big force,'' said Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ''That won't change because Anna was Andy's understudy for a long time. The S.E.I.U. will very likely continue to be a change agent for the country and the labor movement.'' 
 But Charles E. Cook Jr., publisher of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said Mr. Stern's departure would hurt the Democrats because of the disruption caused by any transition. 
 Citing the uphill climb that many Democrats will face in this year's midterm elections, Mr. Cook said, ''Democrats are on the defensive this year, and there's a lot of division within the labor movement, and this is just going to add to the muddle.'' 
 Mr. Stern, 59, is stepping down after his union helped elect President Obama and push through what has long been his foremost legislative goal, a health care overhaul that greatly expands coverage.
 His fingerprints on the Obama administration will remain after he steps down. The White House political director, Patrick Gaspard, was once the political director of the union's giant health care local in New York, and Craig Becker, newly appointed to the National Labor Relations Board, was associate general counsel to the union.
 And Mr. Obama appointed Mr. Stern to his commission to reduce the deficit, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.
 In one measure of Mr. Stern's proximity to power, official records show that he visited the White House more than 20 times during Mr. Obama's first six months in office.
 While some union allies praise Mr. Stern as an innovative leader who has made labor a more potent force in politics, others denounce him as divisive, impulsive and too quick to make concessions to employers. He was also criticized for reaching secret agreements with some companies that he did not disclose to the rank and file. 
 But some corporate and union leaders have praised Mr. Stern for pushing the idea that unions and union members cannot thrive unless employers also prosper.
 Mr. Stern took the helm of the service employees union in 1996 when the labor movement was losing members. Though many unions have continued to shrink, the S.E.I.U. has added 850,000 members under Mr. Stern, giving the parent union $300 million in dues each year and helping to finance ambitious political and unionization efforts. 
 In that way, Mr. Stern has developed a powerful formula that has irritated Republicans: more unionizing translates into more political might -- although the S.E.I.U.'s debts have climbed to $120 million under Mr. Stern. 
 ''The S.E.I.U. was strong before Andy,'' said Dennis Rivera, the former president of the union's giant health care local in New York City and now Mr. Stern's top lieutenant on health policy. ''With Andy it has grown into the most powerful political voice in our country. If our recent experience is any indication, it's going to keep being that.'' 
 Union officials said Mr. Stern's retirement would set off a race to succeed him, pitting Ms. Burger against a dark horse, Mary Kay Henry, an executive vice president. One of them will become the union's first female president.
 Several of Mr. Stern's friends said he was voluntarily stepping aside after 14 years at the helm because he feels it is time to move on, to make way for younger leaders and to make more time for his personal life. They noted that he has often called for term limits or mandatory retirement for union leaders, seeing a need to inject fresh blood into the movement.
 ''Unlike a lot of people in these jobs who stay long beyond their time, he has the courage -- if that's the right word -- to step down at the pinnacle of his career,'' said Steve Rosenthal, former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a consultant to the service employees and other unions. ''He always said he doesn't want to be one of the people who stay past their prime.''
 Over the last year, Mr. Stern has been involved in fierce battles with two other unions, a large breakaway local in the San Francisco Bay area and Unite Here, the union representing hotel and restaurant workers. At the same time, he has come under ferocious attack from conservatives, especially from Glenn Beck, who has repeatedly called him a power-hungry socialist. 
 Moreover, Mr. Stern still faces considerable ire from the A.F.L.-C.I.O, the nation's main labor federation, because he orchestrated the exodus of seven member unions in 2005. He said the federation was stodgy and doing too little organizing, and he promised to create a faster-growing rival federation. That federation, Change to Win, has fallen far short of expectations and done little organizing. 
 Mr. Stern succeeded John J. Sweeney as the service employees' president and took his predecessor's strategy -- make the union movement a social justice movement for low-wage workers -- to a new level.
 Under Mr. Stern, the union organized hundreds of thousands of immigrant janitors, nursing home workers and home care aides and became a magnet for college graduates who enlisted as union organizers out of eagerness to help those on the bottom of the economic ladder. 
 ''He breathed new life into the labor movement, especially for my generation,'' said Benjamin Sachs, 38, a labor law professor at Harvard. ''He gave a new generation of people reason to care about unions and to think that they're relevant.''

HEADLINE: Bill Would Require Derivatives Trading to Occur on Exchanges

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee said on Tuesday that she would propose legislation requiring nearly all users of derivative contracts to trade on centralized exchanges and possibly ordering banks to segregate their business in derivatives into separate subsidiaries. 
 The outlines of the proposal drew praise from one Republican Senator, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who early this year urged stronger regulation of derivatives. 
 While issues such as consumer protection and bank bailouts have drawn most of the attention in the financial overhaul legislation, rules on derivatives are the focus of fierce lobbying because trading of derivatives is one of Wall Street's most profitable businesses. The derivatives that contributed to the financial and housing crisis -- credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations -- were mostly unregulated, with no public reporting of prices or volumes of trades.
 When the Senate Banking Committee approved its financial overhaul bill last month, the derivatives section was generally regarded as a placeholder awaiting a more specific proposal. Because of the Agriculture Committee's oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates many derivatives, that effort was undertaken by the committee's chairwoman, Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat.
 In a letter sent Tuesday to four senators, including Ms. Snowe, who had written to Mrs. Lincoln in February, she said the legislation would include only a narrow exemption to the requirements for trading and clearing derivatives contracts through a centralized facility. She said it would not be available to speculators but only to users of an asset like jet fuel or soybeans who are hedging ''legitimate commercial risk.''
 ''Speculators will not be exempted and all trades will be reported to regulators and the public,'' Mrs. Lincoln wrote. In addition, any agency that is used for the trading of swaps contracts, including those dealing with energy commodities, will be required to register with the C.F.T.C.
 The proposals, which are more strict than those in the financial bill the House passed last year, drew support from two letter recipients, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Ms. Snowe.

HEADLINE: Spotlight Complicates China's Currency Stance

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Even though China's leaders appear to have reached a consensus that the nation's currency policy must change, the timing of any shift has been complicated by surging nationalism, a media frenzy in China over the issue and visits by top officials in recent days. 
 China has spent several trillion renminbi in the last 21 months to prevent its currency from rising against the dollar. American lawmakers have become increasingly critical of the policy, complaining that it keeps Chinese exports artificially cheap. 
 The Chinese news media, which have far more freedom to report on economic issues than political ones, have framed the currency issue mainly in terms of protecting Chinese sovereignty. That has prompted a series of assurances by Chinese officials in the last four days that China will not be pushed by foreign pressure into doing anything against its own interests. 
 President Hu Jintao told President Obama in Washington on Monday that China would set its currency policy according to its own social and economic development needs, according to Xinhua, the official China news agency. 
 Xinhua, the People's Daily newspaper and Chinese state television all gave prominent coverage to what they described as an assurance by Mr. Obama to Mr. Hu that the United States respected Chinese sovereignty regarding the currency. White House officials confirmed that the two leaders had talked about the currency, but provided few details. 
 Mr. Hu's visit to Washington followed a brief trip by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to Beijing last week, which drew considerable attention to the currency issue even though he tried to keep a low profile. Mr. Geithner flew into the airport, met with Vice Premier Wang Qishan at the airport V.I.P. lounge and quickly left without making any public statements. 
 American officials have been concerned that public opinion in China against revaluing the currency might make it harder for the government to act. Robert D. Hormats, the United States under secretary of state for economic, energy and agricultural affairs, said during a visit to China last weekend that a flurry of public discussion about the renminbi late last week had proved ''counterproductive.'' 
 Allowing the renminbi to appreciate would make Chinese-made goods more expensive overseas. But many economists, both in China and in the West, say revaluation would be in China's interest. 
 Appreciation of the currency would help control inflation, limit China's need to buy low-yielding United States Treasury securities and free China to raise interest rates to halt an emerging real estate bubble. 
 Investment bank economists are generally skeptical that China will change its currency policy before June, and possibly later. People close to Chinese policy makers say that officials would prefer to do it much sooner, but that it became impossible to act in the days before Mr. Hu's visit to Washington, as the issue suddenly drew broad public attention. 
 Mr. Hu's trip to Washington for a nuclear security summit meeting has made any immediate policy shift more difficult, added these people, who asked not to be identified by name because of the financial and diplomatic implications of the issue. 
 An official close to Chinese currency policy makers said that Mr. Geithner's visit had also made it harder to handle the issue quietly. 
 Several people close to Chinese policy makers said that the matter had been complicated by an article last week in The New York Times, which said that Chinese officials were very close to announcing a shift in currency policy and might even act before Mr. Hu's Washington visit if no problem emerged. 
 The problem for Chinese officials is that the sovereignty issue arose just as they had finally reached consensus that it was in China's interest to make the exchange rate more flexible and allow the renminbi to appreciate gradually against the dollar, people with knowledge of the Chinese policy development said. 
 Through the National People's Congress in Beijing in mid-March and in the following weeks, senior Commerce Ministry officials had led a chorus of criticism of the United States and vowed resistance to any change in the value of the renminbi. 
 On March 21, Chen Deming, the commerce minister, warned that China would post a trade deficit for the month, its first in nearly six years, and said that pressuring China to change its policy was ''irrational'' in light of the trade gap. China's vice commerce minister, Zhong Shan, visited Washington three days later and said that appreciation of the renminbi was ''not a good recipe for solving problems.'' 
 But the Commerce Ministry did an about-face at the end of last week. Shortly before the customs agency disclosed on Saturday that China had indeed run a $7.2 billion deficit in March, Mr. Chen declared that the deficit was ''only a blip on the radar and will in no way hamper the country's strong economic growth.'' He added that China would resume trade surpluses in the months ahead. 
 Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China's central bank, also seemed to lend support to the idea of a stronger currency when he said last weekend that fighting inflation was the central bank's top priority. A weak currency tends to fan inflation, by making imported goods more expensive.

HEADLINE: Pivotal Election Issue: Frugality and Afghanistan

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Has a ''penny pinching'' approach to defense spending by Prime Minister Gordon Brown kept British troops in Afghanistan disastrously short of the helicopters and other equipment their commanders have long demanded, causing unnecessarily heavy combat losses to the Taliban's most devastating weapon, roadside bombs?
 As the election campaign unfolds, the weightiest issue seems sure to be the economy. But with opinion polls pointing to the closest race in decades, other issues could tip the balance, with none more emotive than the losses in Afghanistan, and the suggestion that some soldiers have been the victims of government penury. 
 The accusation has beset Mr. Brown from the moment he succeededTony Blair nearly three years ago. That was just as Britain's commitment in Afghanistan, now at 10,000 troops, second largest among allied contingents to an American commitment now building toward 100,000, began to increase and to lead to mounting casualties that have become a political liability for the governing Labour party.
 More deaths last week brought the number of British troops who have died in Afghanistan to 281, compared with the 1,026 Americans who have died as part of the Afghan war and related operations. Proportional to the numbers of troops deployed, that makes Britain's casualty rate higher than the United States', though lower than the losses suffered by Canada, which has lost 142 troops, according to calculations by defense experts. 
 Nearly three-quarters of all British combat deaths have been caused by roadside bombs, a figure similar to that for American troops. But what has propelled the issue is the British critics' insistence that American troops are far better equipped, with hundreds of troop-carrying helicopters, compared with a British fleet that some former field commanders say has sunk at times to fewer than 20 serviceable aircraft. 
 Mr. Brown, citing security considerations, has refused to divulge the precise figure. He has rejected accusations that British commanders have been forced to turn regularly to American commanders for helicopter transport by saying that the sharing of airlift capacity is a normal part of any allied military operation.
 Gen. Charles Guthrie, Britain's top military officer until 2001, has spoken bitterly of Mr. Brown's paring of budgets for helicopters and other defense priorities. ''Gordon never cared'' about defense, he said in an interview last summer with the Times of London. ''It's no good the prime minister one moment saying success is all important, and then for the sake of a few extra helicopters and 2,000 men allowing the mission in Afghanistan to fail. 
 ''You can't go to war in a penny-pinching way,'' he said.
 Similar charges have been made by top British commanders in recent years, by high-ranking former ministers in the Brown and Blair governments, and by a succession of coroners who have conducted inquests in Britain, as required by law, into each of the combat deaths. Their findings have frequently pointed to a lack of proper equipment, including body armor, armored vehicles and explosives-detecting devices, in addition to helicopters. One recent inquest, into the 2008 deaths from a Taliban bomb of four Special Forces soldiers, made a finding of ''unlawful killing,'' directed not at the Taliban but at the Defense Ministry.
 With every death a leading item in Britain's newscasts and newspapers, accusations that the troops have been poorly equipped have become a vulnerability for Labour -- and a personal one for Mr. Brown -- as they mount an uphill campaign in the May 6 general election against the poll-leading Conservatives.
 So it was no surprise when the Conservative leader, David Cameron, seized the issue in his final pre-election clash with Mr. Brown in the House of Commons last week. In the harshest exchange in a fiery session of prime minister's questions, Mr. Cameron quoted a former British paratroop commander in Afghanistan as saying that ''repeated demands for more helicopters fell on deaf ears'' with the Brown government, and that troops ended up ''driving into combat when they should have been flying.''
 When a visibly flustered Mr. Brown rose to give his familiar defense -- that senior British officers in Afghanistan had told the government they had what they needed -- Conservative backbenchers set up a chorus traditionally used by opposition parties to mock the government at the moment of the Commons break-up for an election. ''Bye-bye,'' they cried.
 The bitterness that has enveloped the issue of equipment deficiencies for combat troops is part of an unhealed rift in Britain, and in the Labour Party that goes back to Mr. Blair's role in leading Britain into the Iraq war in 2003, the issue that eventually forced him from office in 2007. As chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Brown fought bitter battles with Mr. Blair over financing for the war, and at one point, in 2004, ordered more than $2 billion cut from the forces' budget for new helicopters.
 The Afghan war has not generated any similar controversy, at least as far as Britain's need to fight there; both Labour and Conservative have justified the war on the basis of denying Islamist terrorists a base for attacks on Britain. Mr. Brown, eager to rebut critics who have suggested that he has the hostility to the military of an old left-wing stalwart, has embraced the Afghan commitment as his own, making frequent visits to troops there and promising them whatever equipment they need.
 That has left the Conservatives to concentrate their attacks on the charge that Mr. Brown is fighting the Afghan war on the cheap. His response has been to say that the defense budget has doubled over Labour's 13 years in power, to about $60 billion, not including billions spent from a special fund for war operations. The Conservatives and retired military commanders say that claim disguises Mr. Brown's habit of misstating budget details and of distorting or denying the warnings defense chiefs repeatedly gave him on the consequences of cutting the war budgets.
 But defense critics say these clashes mask a reality that either party, forming the next government, will have to confront: that Britain, in taking on major combat commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, was ''punching above its weight'' -- and its financial resources -- and that the next few years of budget austerity forced by the trillion-dollar debt taken on by Labour to fight the recession will require a major retrenchment of the armed forces, including sharp reductions in manpower, whoever wins.

HEADLINE: President Is to Outline His Vision for NASA

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
President Obama will seek to promote his vision for the nation's human space flight program on Thursday, just two days after three storied Apollo astronauts -- including Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the Moon -- called the new plans ''devastating.''
 In an announcement to be made at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the president will personally talk for the first time about the sweeping upheaval of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's human spaceflight program outlined in his 2011 budget request: canceling the current program that is to send astronauts back to the Moon, investing in commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit and developing new space technologies. 
 A senior administration official said Mr. Obama would describe a vision ''that unlocks our ambitions and expands our frontiers in space, ultimately meaning the challenge of sending humans to Mars.'' The official spoke with administration approval, but on the condition of anonymity so that the comments would not upstage the president's remarks.
 Mr. Obama's budget request called for the cancellation of Orion crew capsule, which was to be used to carry astronauts to the International Space Station and then to the Moon, as well as other components of the current program known as Constellation.
 The president will propose that a simpler version of the Orion be used as a lifeboat for the space station. Russian Soyuz capsules currently provide that function. Because the Orion lifeboat would not carry astronauts to the space station, it could be launched on existing rockets.
 The official said Mr. Obama would also announce that he would commit to deciding in 2015 on a design of a heavy-lift rocket for NASA. ''This means major work on the heavy-lift rocket at least two years earlier than Constellation,'' the official said. Astronauts would leave Earth orbit in the early 2020s, the official said, destined for the Moon, asteroids and eventually Mars.
 Mr. Obama will also announce $40 million devoted to helping Florida adjust economically after the retirement of the space shuttles, scheduled for this year.
 The official also pointed to a study conducted by the Tauri Group, a consulting firm, and financed by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group, which estimated the president's plan would create 10,000 jobs nationally over the next five years. NASA estimates 2,500 would be in Florida along the Space Coast.
 The administration's plan has been cheered by so-called New Space advocates who believe that traditional NASA programs are too big, too expensive and too slow and that turning to entrepreneurs will spur a vibrant new space industry. But even many of those who support the new strategy say the administration has not done a convincing job of explaining it.
 ''There has not been a well-articulated plan and vision,'' said Edward F. Crawley, an engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who served on the blue-ribbon panel that reviewed NASA's human spaceflight program last year.
 Others find the essentials of the plan flawed, not just the presentation. In a letter to Mr. Obama, reported Tuesday by NBC News, Mr. Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, along with James A. Lovell Jr., the commander of Apollo 13, and Eugene A. Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17, wrote, ''For the United States, the leading space-faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second- or even third-rate stature.'' 
 In a letter released Monday, 27 NASA veterans -- including Eugene F. Kranz, the flight director who presided over the safe return of the crew aboard the crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft in 1970 -- asked Mr. Obama to reconsider the ''misguided proposal.''
 The reception from Congress has so far been mostly chilly but mostly from representatives in states that are home to the NASA centers that would be most hurt by the changes -- the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Johnson Space Center in Texas and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.
 However, some members of Congress from non-NASA states, like David Wu, Democrat of Oregon, have also criticized the plan, and only one, Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, has enthusiastically endorsed it.
 NASA's budget -- $18.7 billion this year -- consumes a 0.5 percent sliver of the federal budget. Under Mr. Obama's plans, NASA would receive slightly more next year -- $19 billion next year -- but, in canceling Constellation, much of the money would be moved away from human spaceflight to other programs like Earth science and aeronautics.
 Administration officials have noted that the budget request adds $6.1 billion to NASA's budget over next five years, which they say demonstrates the president's support to the agency.
 But that follows a $3.4 billion cut that Mr. Obama made last year in the five-year projection for the Constellation part of NASA's budget.

HEADLINE: Behind The 47% Talking Point

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Forty-seven percent.
 That's the portion of American households that owe no income tax for 2009. The number is up from 38 percent in 2007, and it has become a popular talking point on cable television and talk radio. With Tax Day coming on Thursday, 47 percent has become shorthand for the notion that the wealthy face a much higher tax burden than they once did while growing numbers of Americans are effectively on the dole.
 Neither one of those ideas is true. They rely on a cleverly selective reading of the facts. So does the 47 percent number.
 Given that taxes are likely to be one of the big political issues of the next few years -- and maybe the biggest one -- it's worth understanding who really pays what in taxes. Once you do, you can get a sense for our country's fiscal options. How, in other words, will we be able to close the huge looming gap between the taxes we are scheduled to pay and the services we are scheduled to receive? 
 The answer is that tax rates almost certainly have to rise more on the affluent than on other groups. Over the last 30 years, rates have fallen more for the wealthy, and especially the very wealthy, than for any other group. At the same time, their incomes have soared, and the incomes of most workers have grown only moderately faster than inflation.
 So a much greater share of income is now concentrated at the top of distribution, while each dollar there is taxed less than it once was. It's true that raising taxes on the rich alone can't come close to solving the long-term budget problem. The deficit is simply too big. But if taxes are not increased for the wealthy, the country will be left with two options.
 It will have to raise taxes even more than it otherwise would on everybody else. Or it will have to find deep cuts in Medicare, Social Security, military spending and the other large (generally popular) federal programs.
 All the attention being showered on ''47 percent'' is ultimately a distraction from that reality. 
 The 47 percent number is not wrong. The stimulus programs of the last two years -- the first one signed by President George W. Bush, the second and larger one by President Obama -- have increased the number of households that receive enough of a tax credit to wipe out their federal income tax liability. 
 But the modifiers here -- federal and income -- are important. Income taxes aren't the only kind of federal taxes that people pay. There are also payroll taxes and capital gains taxes, among others. And, of course, people pay state and local taxes, too. 
 Even if the discussion is restricted to federal taxes (for which the statistics are better), a vast majority of households end up paying federal taxes. Congressional Budget Officedata suggests that, at most, about 10 percent of all households pay no net federal taxes. The number 10 is obviously a lot smaller than 47.
 The reason is that poor families generally pay more in payroll taxes than they receive through benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. It's not just poor families for whom the payroll tax is a big deal, either. About three-quarters of all American households pay more in payroll taxes, which go toward Medicare and Social Security, than in income taxes.
 Focusing on the statistical middle class -- the middle 20 percent of households, as ranked by income -- underlines this point. Households in this group made $35,400 to $52,100 in 2006, the last year for which the Congressional Budget Office has released data. That would describe a household with one full-time worker earning about $17 to $25 an hour. Such hourly pay is typical for firefighters, preschool teachers, computer support specialists, farmers, members of the clergy, mail carriers, secretaries and truck drivers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Taking into account both taxes and tax credits, the average household in this group paid a total income tax rate of just 3 percent. A good number of people, in fact, paid no net income taxes. They are among the alleged free riders. 
 But the picture starts to change when you look not just at income taxes but at all taxes. This average household would have paid 0.8 percent of its income in corporate taxes (through the stocks it owned), 0.9 percent in gas and other federal excise taxes, and 9.5 percent in payroll taxes. Add these up, and the family's total federal tax rate was 14.2 percent. 
 I realize that it's possible to argue that payroll taxes should be excluded from the discussion because they pay for benefits -- Social Security and Medicare -- that people receive on the back end. But that argument doesn't seem very persuasive. 
 Why? People do not receive benefits equal to the payroll taxes they paid. Those who die at age 70 will receive much less in Social Security and Medicare than they paid in taxes. Those who die at 95 will probably get much more. 
 The different kinds of federal taxes are really just accounting categories. At the end of the day, the government has to cover the cost of all its operations with revenue from all its taxes. We can't wish our deficit away by saying that it's mostly a Medicare and Social Security deficit. 
 If anything, the government numbers I'm using here exaggerate how much of the tax burden falls on the wealthy. These numbers fail to account for the income that is hidden from tax collectors -- a practice, research shows, that is more common among affluent families. ''Because higher-income people are understating their income,'' Joel Slemrod, a tax scholar at the University of Michigan, says, ''We've been overstating their average tax rates.''
 State and local taxes, meanwhile, may actually be regressive. That is, middle-class and poor families may face higher tax rates than the wealthy. As Kim Rueben of the Tax Policy Center notes, state and local income taxes and property taxes are less progressive than federal taxes, while sales taxes end up being regressive. The typical family pays a lot of state and local taxes, too -- almost half as much as in federal taxes. 
 There is no question that the wealthy pay a higher overall tax rate than any other group. That is an American tradition. But there is also no question that their tax rates have fallen more than any other group's over the last three decades. The only reason they are paying more taxes than in the past is that their pretax incomes have risen so rapidly -- which hardly seems a great rationale for a further tax cut.
 So why are those radio and television talk show hosts spending so much time arguing that today's wealthy are unfairly burdened? Well, it's hard not to notice that the talk show hosts themselves tend to be among the very wealthy. 
 No doubt, like the rest of us, they don't particularly enjoy paying taxes. They are happy with the tax cuts they have received lately. They would prefer if other people had to pick up the bill for Medicare, Social Security and the military -- people like, say, firefighters, preschool teachers, computer support specialists, farmers, members of the clergy, mail carriers, secretaries and truck drivers.

HEADLINE: Few Find Hope On Waiting List At Top Colleges

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
DURHAM, N.C. -- Ashley Koski, ranked third in the senior class at Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Va., has wanted to attend Duke University since she was 12.
 Late last month, she learned that Duke had neither accepted nor rejected her. It had offered her a spot on the waiting list -- along with 3,382 other applicants. That is almost twice the size of the incoming freshman class.
 ''I kind of just went quiet the rest of the day,'' Ms. Koski said. ''I'd rather have a yes or no. I can't make plans and be excited like the rest of my friends.''
 Duke, which had a record 27,000 freshman applicants, has placed 856 more on its waiting list than a year ago. The reasons include the uncertain economy, which makes it hard for Duke to estimate how many of the 4,000 it has accepted will say yes. 
 If Duke's best guess holds, no more than 60 will be admitted through the narrow gate of what is essentially a giant holding pen.
 Other schools are also hedging their bets this spring. Most Ivy League colleges had sharp jumps in applications, as did similarly selective colleges like the University of Chicago, Northwestern, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Many students hedged bets of their own, and submitted more applications -- in some instances 15 or more.
 The admission process is a complicated dance of supply and demand for colleges. And this spring, many institutions have accepted fewer applicants, and placed more on waiting lists, until it becomes clear over the next few weeks how many spots remain.
 M.I.T., which had a 6 percent increase in applicants, increased its waiting list by more than half, to 722. Last year, it accepted fewer than 80 from that list. Yale, which had a slight dip in applications this year yet still admitted fewer than 8 percent of applicants, placed nearly 1,000 others on its waiting list, an increase of more than 150. Dartmouth increased its list by about 80, to 1,740.
 No selective college, though -- at least none that makes its figures public -- has placed as many applicants in a holding pattern this spring as Duke, which has seen applications surge by 30 percent over the last two years. And those applications were filed long before its men's basketball team won this year's national collegiate championship, a victory that could prompt more students to say yes to Duke's offer of admission, and thus leave fewer slots for those in waiting.
 In an interview on a recent morning on Duke's Gothic-style campus, which was mostly built in the 1930's but looks centuries older, Christoph Guttentag, the dean of undergraduate admissions, likened his task to that of a sculptor finishing a work of art -- and the waiting list to his last palette of materials.
 ''I have no idea what I'm going to need to finish sculpting the class,'' he said, his voice echoing off walls of native knotty pine. ''From an institutional perspective, it's important that I have some flexibility.''
 Like its competitors, Duke does not rank students on its waiting list. Instead, decisions about who will rise to the top are often a function of what the admissions office perceives as deficiencies in the next freshman class. There might be, for example, a surplus of aspiring engineers and not enough potential English majors, or too few students from Florida. Or there might be an unexpected shortage of oboe players.
 While Mr. Guttentag encourages students on the waiting list to send him a one-page letter -- or a video of 60 seconds or less -- letting him know how strongly they wish to attend, and why, they can do little to improve their chances.
 ''The student can't know, 'Gee, did all the violinists decide to turn us down?' '' he said. ''They can't affect this very much at this point.''
 Since waiting list offers went out in late March, Mr. Guttentag and his colleagues have been deliberating whether to end the suspense for at least several hundred who are on it -- those who probably have little hope of coming off.
 Another reason the list is so long this year, he said, is that he and his colleagues were so overwhelmed by the volume of applicants that they ran out of time. 
 ''What we could have done, had we had another week,'' he said, ''was to look at everybody on the waiting list and say, 'Do they all need to be on?' ''
 ''Of all the priorities,'' he added, ''that was not in the top two or three.''
 If there is a risk for Duke, it is that the university may decide later that it wishes to admit an applicant who in the interim has set sail for other shores.
 Ms. Koski, the only daughter of a single mother, said she was still eager to attend Duke if selected; if not, she said, she would probably say yes to an offer of acceptance from the University of Virginia.
 Daniel Wong, a senior at San Francisco University High School, said he had been offered a spot on the waiting list this spring at Duke, as well as at Pomona, Cornell, Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis. He has decided, instead, to eliminate any further suspense and go to the University of California, Los Angeles, which has offered him a $1,500 scholarship to supplement the $10,000 he will receive from the state, under the so-called Cal Grant program.
 ''It was frustrating to know I was still on the fence, and couldn't really get on either side'' he said.
 If the past is any indication, Mr. Wong will be one of perhaps 1,000 students who take themselves off the Duke waiting list before May 1. Final decisions on who will be accepted from waiting lists are not typically not made until at least mid-May.
 Some who wait for Duke will lose registration deposits at other colleges.
 While playing hard-to-get with those students, Mr. Guttentag has been simultaneously wooing others. This month, he hosted several ''Blue Devil Days,'' in which admitted applicants and their families were invited to walk among the blooming magnolia and redbud trees on the sprawling 9000-acre campus.
 Among those who attended was Rafi Pelles, a senior at the United Nations International School in Manhattan. Though he was accepted into Duke's engineering program, he said he was weighing a competing acceptance from Cornell, and still hoping for good news from the University of Pennsylvania, which placed him on its waiting list.
 ''If he gets in to Penn, I think he'll go,'' said his mother, Kathy Pelles, a superintendent in the New York City public schools. 
 Her son was more diplomatic. 
 ''It's not so black and white to me,'' he said. ''First I have to wait for another yes or no.''

HEADLINE: Study Finds Benefits in Genetically Modified Crops but Warns of Overuse

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Genetically engineered crops have provided ''substantial'' environmental and economic benefits to American farmers, but overuse of the technology is threatening to erode the gains, a national science advisory organization said Tuesday in a report.
 The report is described as the first comprehensive assessment of the impact of genetically modified crops on American farmers, who have rapidly adopted them since their introduction in 1996. The study was issued by the National Research Council, which is affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences and provides advice to the nation under a Congressional charter. 
 The report found that the crops allowed farmers to either reduce chemical spraying or to use less harmful chemicals. The crops also had lower production costs, higher output or extra convenience, benefits that generally outweighed the higher costs of the engineered seeds. 
 ''That's a long and impressive list of benefits these crops can provide, and have provided to adopting farmers,'' David E. Ervin, the chairman of the committee that wrote the report, said on Tuesday during a webcast news conference from Washington.
 But Dr. Ervin, a professor of environmental management and economics at Portland State University in Oregon, warned that farmers were jeopardizing the benefits by planting too many so-called Roundup Ready crops. These crops are genetically engineered to be impervious to the herbicide Roundup, allowing farmers to spray the chemical to kill weeds while leaving the crops unscathed. 
 Overuse of this seductively simple approach to weed control is starting to backfire. Use of Roundup, or its generic equivalent, glyphosate, has skyrocketed to the point that weeds are rapidly becoming resistant to the chemical. That is rendering the technology less useful, requiring farmers to start using additional herbicides, some of them more toxic than glyphosate. 
 ''Farmer practices may be reducing the utility of some G.E. traits as pest-management tools and increasing the likelihood of a return to more environmentally damaging practices,'' the report concluded. It said the problem required national attention.
 More than 80 percent of the corn, soybean and cotton grown in the United States is genetically engineered. The crops tolerate Roundup, are resistant to insects, or both. 
 American farmers were the first to widely adopt the technology and still account for about half of all the engineered crops grown. The crops are also being widely grown in Latin America and parts of Asia but are still largely shunned in Europe. 
 The rapid adoption of the crops is evidence that American farmers see the technology as beneficial. 
 Critics of biotechnology, who say the crops may be risky to health and the environment, have issued studies saying that use of the crops has resulted in increased reliance on pesticides and has had only a minimal effect on crop yields. 
 The National Research Council report, more than 200 pages, was prepared by a committee of mainly academic scientists, and it relied primarily on peer-reviewed papers. 
 Still, the report is not likely to win over critics of the crops. 
 One critic, Charles Benbrook, said the conclusion that the crops help farmers might not be true in the future. That is because the report relies mostly on data from the first few years, before prices of the biotech seeds rose sharply and the glyphosate-resistant weeds proliferated. 
 ''This is a very different future,'' said Dr. Benbrook, an agricultural economist who is chief scientist at the Organic Center, which promotes organic food and farming. ''The cost is going to be way higher. The environmental impacts are going to go up fairly dramatically.'' 
 As prices of the biotech seeds have risen sharply, even some farmers are now starting to question whether they are worth it. Just last week, Monsanto, the leading agricultural biotechnology company, said it would lower the prices of its newest genetically engineered soybeans and corn seeds because farmers were not buying as many as it had expected. 
 The Justice Department is investigating whether Monsanto, which has patents on the Roundup Ready system, is violating antitrust laws, unduly increasing prices or hindering innovation. 
 The National Research Council report addresses this issue briefly without mentioning Monsanto. It says that patent licensing terms have ''not adversely affected the economic welfare of farmers who adopt G.E. crops.'' But it said there was some evidence that the availability of nonengineered crops ''may be restricted for some farmers.'' 
 Monsanto, in a statement, said the report ''affirms what farmers know -- that agricultural biotechnology has delivered substantial environmental and economic benefits.'' It said it was working with farmers to help manage and monitor herbicide-resistant weeds.
 Shares of Monsanto, which have been falling since January, slipped nearly 2 percent Tuesday to $67.75.
 The report said that the use of Roundup Ready crops had led to a huge increase in the spraying of glyphosate but a nearly equal decrease in the use of other herbicides. That is a net environmental benefit, the report said, because glyphosate is less toxic to animals than many other herbicides and does not last long in the environment. 
 The report compared genetically modified crops with the conventionally grown crops they replaced, not to organic crops. 
 The use of herbicide-tolerant crops has also made it easier for farmers to forgo tilling as a way to control weeds. So-called no-till farming helps prevent soil erosion and the runoff of rainwater containing sediments and chemicals. The improvement in water quality could prove to be the largest benefit of the crops, the report said, though it added that efforts should be made to measure any such effects. 
 The other major class of genetically engineered crops consists of the so-called BT corn and BT cotton, which contain bacterial genes allowing the plants to produce an insecticide. 
 The report said that use of chemical insecticides had declined as BT crops had spread. In areas with heavy insect pressure, it said, the use of the crops has increased farmer income because of higher yields and reduced spending on insecticide. 
 The report said that when genetically engineered crops were introduced, some had lower yields than conventional varieties, a finding often cited by critics. But the report said newer studies showed either a modest increase in yield or no effect. 
 Chuck Myers, a corn and soybean farmer from Nebraska who was not involved in the report, said that even if biotechnology had not increased the intrinsic yield potential of the crops, ''If you're controlling a pest, you're preserving your yield.''

HEADLINE: High-End Demand Gives Intel a Lift

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation said on Tuesday that its net income in the first quarter nearly quadrupled over last year and reflected an overall bump in business spending on technology.
 Among other things, Intel was lifted by sales of new chips for computer servers -- the kind of purchase that many companies delayed in the recession. And Intel's chief financial officer, Stacy J. Smith, said in an interview that demand for processors for higher-end laptops was stronger than expected as corporations upgraded their workers' computers. 
 That is a change from the last few quarters, when Intel's growth was largely driven by consumer demand for netbooks, stripped-down laptops used mostly for surfing the Internet. Chips for those machines are less profitable than chips for regular laptops.
 Mr. Smith also said the company expected to hire about 1,000 people this year. Intel currently has 79,900 employees, down from 82,500 a year ago.
 Intel became the first major technology company to report earnings for the first quarter when it said after the market closed Tuesday that it earned $2.4 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the first three months of 2010.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting profit of 38 cents a share.
 In the same period last year, Intel earned $629 million, or 11 cents a share. At the time, Intel was muddling through the recession, but the chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, predicted that personal computer sales had ''bottomed out'' -- an early forecast that proved true.
 Intel's revenue in the latest period rose 44 percent, to $10.3 billion, ahead of analysts' forecast for $9.8 billion.
 The company also raised its forecast for its gross profit margin, an important performance measurement. Intel now predicts a margin of 62 to 66 percent of revenue in 2010, up from its previous forecast of 58 to 64 percent of revenue.
 Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., posted its results after the close of market trading. In after-hours trading, its stock rose 89 cents, or 4 percent, to $23.66 a share.
 Intel's numbers could be an early preview of a healthy quarter for the technology industry, because many kinds of suppliers would benefit if large companies were beginning to spend more money on computers and other equipment after freezing their budgets during the recession.
 Worldwide information technology spending is expected to rise more than 5 percent in 2010, after falling 1 percent in 2009, according to the market research firm Gartner.

HEADLINE: Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu

 BODY:
We think President Obama made the right decision -- for now -- not to pick too public of a fight with China over its currency manipulation. 
 The administration postponed a report to Congress due this week on Chinese monetary policy. After Mr. Obama met with President Hu Jintao of China in Washington on Monday, the White House made a low-key statement that Mr. Obama had pressed Mr. Hu on the need to ''move toward a more market-oriented exchange rate'' and played up China's pledge of cooperation on sanctions for Iran.
 Beijing's aggressive undervaluation of the renminbi is a serious problem for the American economy and the global economy. Going one on one is likely to backfire. The best hope for persuading China to change its ways is with sustained pressure from many countries. It will certainly make it harder for Beijing to hide behind claims of sovereignty and accusations of big power bullying. 
 That means that Mr. Obama will have to work hard to rally others to jointly press the issue. The best forum is coming in June when the leaders of the world's biggest economies gather at the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto. They need to use that occasion to tell China, in no uncertain terms, that it cannot keep building up its own economy by undercutting the rest of the world's exports. 
 They need to leave no doubt in Beijing's mind, that its global standing will suffer if it does not listen. Few countries have benefited as much as China from the open trading system. Under sufficient pressure from its trading partners, Beijing would be likely to relent. 
 It's still not clear how hard they will have to push. 
 At Monday's White House meeting, Mr. Hu reportedly told Mr. Obama that China planned to move away from its fixed currency peg to the dollar. He didn't say when. And according to remarks released by the Foreign Ministry, he also stated that the objective of changing China's currency strategy ''won't be advanced by any foreign pressure.'' Mr. Hu's next stop is Brazil. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said last week that China's exchange rate peg is hurting Brazil's manufacturing. We hope that Brazilian officials are just as direct in their meetings with the Chinese president. 
 This is a global problem. The renminbi's fixed and artificially cheap exchange rate is undercutting exporters throughout the developing world. It also is seriously complicating economic policy-making among China's neighbors. So long as the Chinese currency remains so cheap, they cannot afford to combat burgeoning inflation by allowing their own currencies to rise because it could further undercut their exports. 
 China would also benefit from shifting from exports to internal consumption as a source for growth. It would improve the living standards of its citizens. It would ease the job of its central bank in trying to keep inflation at bay. And it would establish China as a more responsible player on the global economic stage. 
 The Chinese bureaucracy is clearly split. Central bank officials have been arguing for some time that a stronger currency would help them combat rising inflation. The Commerce Ministry is adamantly opposed. Ministry officials latched on to the fact that China recorded its first monthly trade deficit in six years in March -- a one-time blip because of fast imports of raw materials for China's export industry -- to argue that their cheap currency is not the cause of global trade and financial imbalances. 
 It is. China should not be allowed to forget it. Barring a change of exchange rate policy, China's trade surpluses are going to bloat again in the months to come. 
 This is not a problem just between the United States and China. It is a problem between China and most of the world. The challenge for President Obama now is to get the rest of the world's leaders to deliver that message as clearly and urgently as they can.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. TAKES AIM AT PLANS TO CURB FINANCE INDUSTRY

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and SEWELL CHAN; Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Drawing the lines for a fierce election-year battle over regulating the nation's financial system, Senate Republicans on Tuesday insisted that legislation proposed by Democrats and the White House would only encourage future taxpayer bailouts of big banks.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, criticized the Democrats' plans to regulate Wall Street as arrogant and partisan, echoing the recent health care fight in which he accused Democrats of carrying out a government takeover. 
 ''We cannot allow endless taxpayer-funded bailouts,'' Mr. McConnell said in a floor speech. ''That's why we must not pass the financial reform bill that's about to hit the floor. The fact is this bill wouldn't solve the problems that led to the financial crisis. It would make them worse.'' 
 Both the White House and Congressional Democrats quickly fired back, accusing Republicans of trying to prevent tougher policing of Wall Street. 
 ''There's a clear choice in this debate: to stand with American families or stand on the side of the big Wall Street banks and their lobbyists,'' Jen Psaki, the deputy White House communications director, wrote in a blog post rebutting the criticism. ''The Senate bill explicitly mandates that a large financial firm that faces failure be allowed to fail.''
 Mr. McConnell's comments offered a first glimpse at a Republican strategy carefully calibrated for a highly competitive midterm election year. In many ways it is a political high-wire act, as the Republicans seek to oppose the Democrats' bill while not appearing to side with the banks at a time when popular anger at Wall Street is high. 
 At a news conference, Mr. McConnell acknowledged his own support for the $700 billion bailout in 2008 when the Bush administration warned of an imminent crisis. ''That is not to say that we think it ever ought to be done again,'' he said. 
 The Democrats' bill, sponsored by Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, would give the Federal Reserve oversight of the largest financial institutions, those with at least $50 billion in assets. And it would let the Treasury secretary -- with support from regulators and the approval of a special panel of three bankruptcy judges -- take over any giant company that posed systemic risk to financial stability, and essentially force it out of business. 
 Mr. McConnell's remarks were the opening salvo in what is expected to be a weeks-long battle, framed by Republican hopes of making sizable gains in Congress in the November elections by emphasizing what they view as a dangerous expansion of government during President Obama's first two years.
 His comments came the day before Mr. Obama was to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the financial regulatory legislation. 
 In answering the Republican criticism, some Democrats also pointed to a meeting Mr. McConnell and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, attended with hedge fund managers last week in New York City as evidence they were on the side of bankers.
 The stakes are huge. Both parties want to show that they are working aggressively to prevent the risky practices that led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. The parties also need to demonstrate that they share voters' anger over huge paydays that returned to Wall Street even as unemployment remains high and economic recovery slow in much of the country. 
 At the same time, both parties are eagerly courting campaign contributions from well-heeled donors in the financial sector. 
 And, of course, there is the underlying policy debate over how to contain risk in an increasingly complex financial system -- a challenge that is vexing policy makers around the globe. 
 Republicans said they were still open to negotiating a bipartisan bill. But the fight in the Senate seemed likely to follow a pattern set over the last year and a half, on the stimulus package, the health care legislation and many other bills in between. 
 Mr. McConnell lays out the party message in daily speeches on the Senate floor, while working to keep his conference unified in an effort to block, defeat or reshape the Democrats' legislation using a formidable arsenal of procedural tactics. 
 In this case, Democrats are hoping that the pressure from voters to get tough on Wall Street and financial firms will help break Republican ranks. 
 But Mr. McConnell asserted -- as some liberals also have -- that Fed oversight might be interpreted by the markets as an implicit guarantee of government support should those institutions be at risk of failure. 
 Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont and a self-described socialist, said he, too, was unhappy about the proposals so far. ''We have got to stand up to Wall Street,'' he said. ''We need real reform.'' 
 Political messaging aside, lawmakers in both parties have worked hard on proposals for a new regulatory framework that cleared the Senate Banking Committee last month. 
 The aspect of the regulation that Mr. McConnell most focused on -- the creation of a ''resolution authority'' to seize and dismantle a financial institution -- was the outcome of months of talks between Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, both members of the banking committee. 
 Under the bill, once the Treasury stepped in to take over a failing firm, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would be appointed as a receiver. The Federal Reserve could punish any institution that failed to submit a ''resolution plan'' -- also known as a living will or a funeral plan -- that would spell out its orderly demise. 
 A $50 billion ''orderly liquidation fund,'' created from fees charged to the largest banks, would help pay for the takeover. The House version of the bill, approved in December, would create a $150 billion fund. The Obama administration does not support such a fund, signaling at least one potential area of compromise. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said that Mr. Dodd, the chairman of the banking committee, had tried to work with Republicans for months. 
 Mr. Dodd initially introduced his bill in November, then paused committee action to give Republicans a bigger say. He tapped four pairs of senators, one Democrat and one Republican in each pair, to tackle the four toughest issues. But in the end, the committee approved the bill with no Republican support. 
 ''We couldn't get anything done,'' Mr. Reid said at a news conference. 
 While the Republicans said they were willing to deal, they began a concerted effort to paint the White House as undermining any chance of cooperation. 
 ''All signs we're getting from the White House is they're not interested in talking,'' Mr. McConnell said at a news conference. ''They're not interested in making a deal with us. They want to jam through a totally partisan bill.'' 
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said Tuesday that Mr. McConnell had mischaracterized the legislation. 
 ''If a major institution manages itself to the edge of the abyss,'' he said, speaking to a meeting of the American Society of News Editors here, ''we're able to put them out of their misery, put them through an effective bankruptcy regime, dismember them safely without taxpayers being exposed to a penny of risk of loss.'' 
 Mr. Geithner said he believed the bill would be approved. ''I'm very confident we're going to have Congress act on a strong sweeping set of reforms,'' he said. 
 But Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, predicted that the legislation would fail in its current form. 
 ''I don't know of any Republicans right now that would support it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: MATERNAL DEATHS IN SHARP DECLINE ACROSS THE GLOBE

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
For the first time in decades, researchers are reporting a significant drop worldwide in the number of women dying each year from pregnancy and childbirth, to about 342,900 in 2008 from 526,300 in 1980.
 The findings, published in the medical journal The Lancet, challenge the prevailing view of maternal mortality as an intractable problem that has defied every effort to solve it. 
 ''The overall message, for the first time in a generation, is one of persistent and welcome progress,'' the journal's editor, Dr. Richard Horton, wrote in a comment accompanying the article, published online on Monday. 
 The study cited a number of reasons for the improvement: lower pregnancy rates in some countries; higher income, which improves nutrition and access to health care; more education for women; and the increasing availability of ''skilled attendants'' -- people with some medical training -- to help women give birth. Improvements in large countries like India and China helped to drive down the overall death rates. 
 But some advocates for women's health tried to pressure The Lancet into delaying publication of the new findings, fearing that good news would detract from the urgency of their cause, Dr. Horton said in a telephone interview. 
 ''I think this is one of those instances when science and advocacy can conflict,'' he said.
 Dr. Horton said the advocates, whom he declined to name, wanted the new information held and released only after certain meetings about maternal and child health had already taken place. 
 He said the meetings included one at the United Nations this week, and another to be held in Washington in June, where advocates hope to win support for more foreign aid for maternal health from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Other meetings of concern to the advocates are the Pacific Health Summit in June, and the United Nations General Assembly meeting in December. 
 ''People who have spent many years committed to the issue of maternal health were understandably worried that these figures could divert attention from an issue that they care passionately about,'' Dr. Horton said. ''But my feeling is that they are misguided in their view that this would be damaging. My view is that actually these numbers help their cause, not hinder it.''
 He said the new study was based on more and better data, and more sophisticated statistical methods than were used in a previous analysis by a different research team that estimated more deaths, 535,900 in 2005. The authors of the earlier analysis, published in The Lancet, in 2007, included researchers from Unicef, Harvard, the World Bank, the World Health Organization and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. The World Health Organization still reports about half a million maternal deaths a year, but is expected to issue new statistics of its own this year.
 The new report comes from the University of Washington and the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, and was paid for by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
 A spokesman for Unicef said it had no comment on the new findings, and there was no response to messages that were left late Tuesday for W.H.O. officials. 
 Dr. Christopher J. L. Murray, the director of the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the University of Washington, in Seattle, and an author of the study, said, ''There has been a perception of no progress.'' 
 But, he said, ''some of the policies and programs pursued may be having an effect, as opposed to all that effort with little to show for it.'' 
 ''It really is an important positive finding for global health,'' he said.
 Dr. Murray said no one had approached him directly about delaying the release of his findings; he heard about those efforts from The Lancet, and described them as ''disappointing.'' He said, ''We believe in the process of peer-reviewed science, and it's the proper way to pursue these sorts of studies.''
 The researchers analyzed maternal mortality in 181 countries from 1980 to 2008, using whatever information they could glean from each country: death records, censuses, surveys and published studies. They ultimately gathered about three times as much data as the previous researchers had found. 
 Among poor countries with longstanding high death rates, progress varied considerably. For instance, from 1990 to 2008, the maternal death rate dropped 8.8 percent a year in the Maldives, but rose 5.5 percent in Zimbabwe. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal death rates. Brazil improved more than Mexico, Egypt more than Turkey. Six countries accounted for more than half of all the maternal deaths in 2008: India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
 But India has made steady progress, and because its population is so large, its improvements have helped considerably to decrease the worldwide rate of maternal deaths. China has also made considerable progress. In India, there were 408 to 1,080 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1980, and by 2008, there were 154 to 395, the new study found. In China, there were 144 to 187 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1980, and 35 to 46 in 2008. 
 Dr. Murray said the findings came as a surprise. What also surprised him and his colleagues, he said, was the number of pregnant women who died from AIDS: about 60,000. 
 ''Really to a large extent that's why maternal mortality is rising in eastern and southern Africa,'' Dr. Murray said. 
 ''It means, to us, that if you want to tackle maternal mortality in those regions, you need to pay attention to the management of H.I.V. in pregnant women. It's not about emergency obstetrical care, but about access to antiretrovirals.''
 Dr. Horton contended that the new data should encourage politicians to spend more on pregnancy-related health matters. The data dispelled the belief that the statistics had been stuck in one dismal place for decades, he said. So money allocated to women's health is actually accomplishing something, he said, and governments are not throwing good money after bad.
 An advocate for women's health, Dr. Flavia Bustreo, director of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, said the improvements described in the new report represented ''hope at last.'' She said her organization, affiliated with the World Health Organization, was not one of those that tried to delay release of the findings. 
 She said the report was well done and called The Lancet a ''scrupulously'' edited journal. She said the findings made sense and were consistent with other reports from large countries like India, which can drive global figures. 
 ''For 20 years, the safe motherhood movement has been conveying an impression of no progress,'' Dr. Bustreo said. ''To hear confirmation of improvements is good news. To us, the good news will maintain the interest of investors. If you don't show results, that's the worst position you can be in. The evidence and scientific truths have to be put in the open and discussed.''
 Her group issued its own report on Tuesday, noting improvements that were saving the lives of women during pregnancy and birth in various countries. For instance, India pays women to get prenatal care and skilled care for delivery. Nepal provides home visits for family planning. Malawi is training nonphysicians to perform emergency Caesarean sections. Brazil has set up a health system that provides free primary care and skilled attendance at birth for all.

HEADLINE: The Tables Turn

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
On many weeknights last year, in the depths of the recession, Tursi's Latin King restaurant in Des Moines closed one of its three dining rooms and pared its kitchen to a skeleton crew. 
 Now, all three rooms are open on most nights, and the kitchen is busy again. 
 ''These last couple of months are a lot better than they were last year,'' said Robert James Tursi, whose family owns the restaurant, an upscale establishment that specializes in steaks and Italian food. Food sales were about 10 percent higher in February and March than they were during the same months a year ago, he said. 
 Restaurants all over the country are beginning to see signs of a potential recovery after a dismal 2009. Sales at some restaurants have risen in the last few months, and the industry has hired thousands of additional workers.
 ''There's no question about this,'' said Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm that tracks sales at 47 restaurant chains with a total of 103,000 outlets. ''There's a recovery going on.'' 
 Mr. Balzer said that March sales at restaurants open for at least a year were up 1 percent compared with March of last year. While that might not seem like much, it broke a string of 10 months of negative sales. He cautioned that while the sales trends were uneven across the industry, almost half the chains he tracks -- mostly fast-food and family dining restaurants like Denny's -- had begun showing gains.
 Still, many restaurant owners and executives said they expected the rebound to be slow and halting. 
 ''Right now, we're starting to see a few more people come in,'' said Larry Reinstein, chief executive of Fresh City, a chain that sells sandwiches, salads, burritos and stir fry dishes at 18 outlets in the Northeast. But he quickly added, ''The typical consumer is still cautious of what they're spending.''
 Echoing other industry executives, Mr. Reinstein said that as long as overall unemployment remained high, restaurants would struggle.
 John S. Glass, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the uptick in restaurant sales paralleled recent gains in retail sales, which also had been hailed as a sign of returning consumer confidence. 
 ''Going out to eat is an emotional decision, not a considered purchase,'' Mr. Glass said. ''It's not like thinking about a new car or an appliance. It's, 'I feel better, let's go out and treat ourselves.' It's probably a combination of the end of a long winter and the end of a long recession.''
 And for the entire restaurant industry, the recession has been long indeed.
 Total industry sales were down 2.9 percent last year in inflation-adjusted terms, according to Hudson Riehle, senior vice president for research at the National Restaurant Association. The year before they fell 1.2 percent. The association predicts a third year of decline this year, although the projected drop is just 0.1 percent. Mr. Riehle said that the industry had never before experienced even two consecutive years of real sales declines, making the current contraction unprecedented.
 But now, restaurant owners are clearly feeling optimistic enough to do some hiring. In the first three months of 2010, the restaurant and food service industry added 42,500 jobs, adjusted for typical seasonal hiring patterns, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even so, Mr. Riehle noted that the industry still had 251,000 fewer jobs than it did in December 2007, when the recession began.
 Several major restaurant companies will report first-quarter financial results this month, offering more insight into the health of the industry. 
 On Wednesday, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, reported that sales at Pizza Hut rose 5 percent in the first three months of the year, compared with sales at the same stores a year ago, while same-store sales fell 2 percent at Taco Bell and 4 percent at KFC. 
 The increase in Pizza Hut sales was partly the result of a heavily marketed promotion offering any pizza for $10, the company said. 
 ''We're still in a challenging environment,'' said Jonathan Blum, a Yum spokesman. But he said the results were an improvement over the last quarter of 2009, when sales fell 12 percent at Pizza Hut, 8 percent at KFC and 5 percent at Taco Bell. 
 ''We're trending in the right direction,'' he said. 
 Malcolm M. Knapp, an industry analyst, said that even higher-price restaurants like steakhouses recently began showing some improvement. 
 That would be welcome news to white-tablecloth chains like Ruth's Chris Steak House. Although Ruth's Chris has not yet reported its first-quarter financial results, the company reported a sales decline of 19.5 percent last year, on the heels of a 10 percent drop in 2008. 
 Mr. Knapp said he had also seen an encouraging trend in sales at casual dining restaurants, a category that includes chains like Applebee's, Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Monthly sales are still below year-ago levels, he said, but the declines are moderating. 
 Among fast-food restaurants, Sonic was hit especially hard during the recession. The drive-in burger chain, known for its roller-skating car hops, said sales at its approximately 3,500 stores declined 13 percent from December through February, compared with the same period a year ago. The chain said the drop was partly caused by harsh winter weather, but the ailing economy also played a major role.
 Buddy McClain, who owns 71 Sonic stores in the South, said that while sales were not growing, they had finally stopped falling in March at his Mississippi and Alabama outlets. 
 But in Florida, a state hit hard by the recession and the collapse of the real estate market, year-to-year sales comparisons have been negative for 17 consecutive months. In March, he said, sales at his Florida stores were 15 percent below the already reduced levels of a year ago. 
 ''Everybody's working harder and making less money, which is not what we call the American way,'' said Mr. McClain, who has owned Sonic franchises for 32 years. ''We've been through four so-called recessions since I've been in Sonic, and nothing has been near to this.''

HEADLINE: First Lady, In Mexico City, Highlights Ties

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Antonio Betancourt and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Moved by their singing and dancing as well as their difficult lives, Michelle Obama hugged student after student at a humble Mexico City elementary school on Wednesday. ''Just to let you know -- today you did your country proud,'' she told the youngsters on the second day of her first solo foray out of the United States as first lady, a trip in which she surrounded herself with young people of all ages and backgrounds and attempted to offer them inspiration. 
 In an afternoon speech to thousands of students at the elite Iberoamericana University that notably ignored any explicit mention of Mexico's bloody drug war, Mrs. Obama urged those privileged enough to go to college to give back to the less fortunate, a huge issue in a country with a gaping divide of rich and poor. 
 ''Those of you who have a seat at the table must do your part to make room for others who don't,'' she said, holding up as an example of leaders who have risen up from humble means Benito Juarez, a celebrated 19th century Mexican president, and her own husband.
 The challenges facing Mexico's youth are towering. The struggling economy continues to prompt many of them to risk their lives migrating illegally to the United States, sometimes alone. Obesity rates among Mexican young people are among the highest in the world. Fierce drug gangs threaten their safety and, with offers of fast money, lure them to lives of crime.
 ''The main problem lies in that a great number of young people see that their expectations about the future have vanished,'' said Enrique Gonzalez Casanova, a Mexican sociologist. ''There is a great deal of insecurity about what will happen to them. There are few job opportunities and minimal possibilities for education.''
 In introducing Mrs. Obama, Jose Morales Orozco, the dean of Iberoamericana University, called the violence Mexico is enduring ''a painful situation,'' which he traced to corruption, impunity and the lack of opportunity for many young Mexicans. ''Education is key to attacking the causes of violence,'' he said.
 The drug war is largely being fought among the youth and, having claimed more than 23,000 lives over the last three years, it is difficult to ignore. The bulk of the victims killed every day, as well as those arrested for involvement in drug trafficking, are under 30, studies have shown, prompting Mexican commentators to lament a lost generation of Mexican youth.
 In an interview with a small group of reporters, Mrs. Obama said she sought to show that there were other issues besides violence that were of importance to Mexico and the United States, and she suggested that providing more opportunities to young people could help reduce the violence.
 ''If young people don't have an alternative in their lives, whatever country they are in, they are going to choose drugs, they're going to choose the drug trade,'' she said. ''That's the way they make money. That's what they know.''
 Mrs. Obama's Mexican counterpart, Margarita Zavala, the wife of President Felipe Calderon, was her guide on Wednesday. They have met on a number of previous occasions. 
 ''We have much in common,'' Mrs. Obama, 46, said of Ms. Zavala, 42, who is also a lawyer, a mother of young children and a presidential spouse who has made the welfare of young people her signature issue.
 In a morning meeting at Los Pinos, the Mexican presidential compound, Ms. Zavala raised the issue of drug addiction, which has skyrocketed in Mexico, especially among young people, and is considered by Mexican officials to be one of the many ugly aspects of the huge demand for drugs in the United States.
 But discord was largely pushed aside on this trip, which Mrs. Obama, in her university speech said was ''entre amigos,'' or among friends.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tightens Requirements For Energy Star Certification

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
After critical audits, the federal government said Wednesday that it would substantially tighten the certification process for products bearing the Energy Star label, its stamp of approval for an energy-efficient product. 
 Over the last six months, the Government Accountability Office and the Energy Department's inspector general issued reports detailing significant failings with the process. The G.A.O. found, for example, that the Energy Star program had granted the label to nonexistent products, including a ''gasoline-powered alarm clock,'' submitted by auditors posing as manufacturers. 
 The Energy Star program is jointly managed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department. Under new rules issued by both agencies and effective immediately, the approval process for appliances will no longer be automated, and a staff member will review each application.
 Manufacturers must submit complete lab test results of their products before applying for Energy Star certification. And companies will be unable to put the Energy Star logo on products that have not been specifically approved.
 In a March 26 report, the accountability office said it had discovered that once a company registered as an Energy Star partner, it could download the logo from a government Web site and attach it to products for which it had not even requested approval.
 By the end of the year, the government said, all tests submitted by manufacturers will have to be from independent certified labs. Until now, that had been the case for only some categories of products, including windows, doors and compact fluorescent lighting. 
 Neither the Energy Department nor the Environmental Protection Agency could say on Wednesday just how many of the 40,000 products already bearing the label had been tested by third parties and would have to be brought into compliance.
 Consumers rely on the labels to determine whether they are choosing appliances that use less energy and thus save them money in the long term. And tax breaks are sometimes available for Energy Star products consumers buy as part of a broader government effort to encourage Americans to consume less fuel. 
 Under President Obama's federal stimulus package, for example, rebates totaling $300 million were available to consumers who bought Energy Star appliances.
 Government officials predicted that the new requirements would bolster the Energy Star's credibility. ''The safeguards we're putting into effect are essential for the millions of consumers who rely on Energy Star products to help save energy, money and the environment,'' Gina McCarthy, the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for air and radiation, said in a news release.
 Gregory H. Friedman, the Energy Department inspector general, who oversaw the recent audit, expressed guarded approval. ''If executed as described in the press release, it looks like this is a significant change to the process, which appears to address many of the issues we've raised in the past,'' he said, adding the issue was whether they would follow through.

HEADLINE: How to Fix Your iPhone (the Unauthorized Edition)

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Brendan McElroy's living room in an apartment on the top floor of an East Village walk-up is crowded with anxious patients, each one jiggling a knee, or gnawing on a fingernail or lip. 
 Everyone is awaiting a prognosis -- not for an ailing child or pet, but for an iPhone. 
 Mr. McElroy, a lanky, clean-shaven 28-year-old who looks more likely to be playing an afternoon game of touch football than tinkering with the innards of a phone, is standing at a workstation littered with the detritus of his trade: tiny silver screws, peels of plastic and cartons overflowing with spare parts.
 Using a quick succession of tools -- suction cup, razor blade and screwdriver -- Mr. McElroy sets to work replacing a broken screen, deftly prying it off the iPhone. 
 Fifteen minutes later, he slips the back cover on and hands the phone to an eager client, who punches in the code to unlock it and sighs with relief as it leaps to life. 
 ''It's not difficult to do,'' said Mr. McElroy, who taught himself to repair iPhones by studying YouTube video tutorials that demonstrate how to disassemble and reassemble the device. ''But it's difficult to do perfectly.'' 
 With Apple having sold 50 million iPhones, it was perhaps inevitable that a cottage industry of iPhone repair shops would spring up. The one-year warranty that comes with the iPhone doesn't cover damage unless it is shown to be caused by a manufacturing defect. And using official Apple channels for repairs can get expensive quickly. Screen replacements alone can cost as much as $300, inspiring some iPhone owners to seek out alternative ways to restore their phones' health.
 Enlisting the services of Mr. McElroy -- or Dr. Brendan, if you prefer his Web moniker -- costs markedly less. Replacing the battery on a 3G or 3GS iPhone for example, will run about $50. The price tag for fixing the touch-screen on an iPhone 3G is $70; for a 3GS, it's $15 more.
 Mr. McElroy's operation is one of many offering rehabilitation services for the iPhone. A quick perusal of the business reviews site Yelp for places to take a mangled phone turned up dozens of listings in urban areas like San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
 Companies like MissionRepair, Rapid Repair and iResQ primarily offer mail-order services, which require shipping off the damaged iPhone. In addition to inviting customers to his apartment, Mr. McElroy makes house calls in and around New York City, sometimes crisscrossing boroughs several times a day. He also accepts repairs by mail and says he has a healthy international clientele from as far away as Portugal. 
 Of course, the bravest among us -- and those with the steadiest fingers -- can always try to make the repairs themselves. There's no shortage of kits and online how-tos to guide adventurous tinkerers. 
 It's worth noting that taking the D.I.Y. approach, or allowing someone other than Apple or its authorized repair centers to fix the phone, could violate Apple's warranty.
 One of those authorized businesses is TekServe, a well-known computer store in the Chelsea district of Manhattan. Although its fees are significantly higher than Mr. McElroy's -- repairing a smashed screen on a 3G iPhone costs $149 -- the company justifies them by pointing to its long track record.
 ''We've been around for 23 years,'' said Jazmin Hupp, a spokeswoman for the company. ''We're not a college kid who set up shop to do it this weekend and won't be around in 90 days after the guarantee is up.''
 Ms. Hupp said that the company offered a guarantee on its repairs and that its technicians had been trained by Apple. She would not say how many iPhones the shop had repaired, but she did say that cracked screens were the most common malady. 
 Apple recommends finding authorized repair shops on its Web site at apple.com/support. ''We can't vouch for the quality of unauthorized repairs,'' said Natalie Kerris, a company spokeswoman.
 Mr. McElroy offers customers his own warranty of sorts. He guarantees his handiwork and will replace any phone damaged in the repair process -- though he says that hasn't happened since his inaugural attempt at fixing an iPhone.
 ''The first try went less than smoothly,'' he said. ''I had just finished a bartending shift and reached for my phone. I dropped it and it smashed on the concrete floor.'' 
 Hoping to find an economical fix, he decided to try his hand at replacing the shattered screen. He purchased parts, first from eBay, then from a local repair shop, and got to work. 
 ''I'd describe it as semi-successful,'' he said.
 But after polishing his method on the phones of a few willing friends, it wasn't long before he had improved enough to charge for his services.
 Through an advertisement on Craigslist, Mr. McElroy began offering to replace shattered screens, and eventually expanded his menu to include broken SIM card trays, cracked covers, water damage and more mysterious glitches, like unresponsive buttons. 
 Before long, he said, business was booming. He took down his classifieds ads because word-of-mouth referrals and his Web site (www.drbrendan.com) were driving enough traffic. He quit his job tending bar to focus on his repair work. In the last few weeks, he's enlisted an apprentice: his younger brother, Dan, who handles the iPod Touch touch-ups.
 ''There's rarely a phone I can't fix,'' said Mr. McElroy, who estimates he's worked on a thousand iPhones since June. ''There was once a guy whose phone was thrown out of a 10-story window. The entire thing was split in half, but the motherboard was fine.''
 Despite the trauma, he said, ''I was able to get it up and running for him.''
 The worst phones aren't the ones dropped from great heights, Mr. McElroy said. They're the ones that are dropped in the toilet.
 ''I keep a pair of rubber gloves around for that,'' he said. 
 Mr. McElroy said he had recently branched out to doing repairs on MacBooks. Now he's gearing up for a fresh wave of business: the iPad. But he suspects the iPhone will remain his main source of revenue. 
 The iPad ''actually looks like it won't break as often,'' he said. ''It has a nice sturdy case that should protect it when falling.''

HEADLINE: Bull Market? Try Peacock

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
FASHION, they say, is an index of change, registering shifts in confidence and mood too subtle to glean from the rise and the fall of the Dow. No need to tell Natasha Jen, who tarried on Mott Street one weekend earlier this month taking in the parade of women showing off their latest buys: effusively colorful skirts and frocks in jungly hues and covered in pansies, cheetah markings and tribal geometrics that evoked Ivory Coast. 
 Watching the panoply unfold, Ms. Jen, a graphic designer, felt a rush. ''There's a kind of vibrancy in all of this,'' she said. ''I see it as a signal of recovery.'' 
 Wishful thinking? Maybe so. Yet Ms. Jen has a point. 
 The profusion of hothouse colors and patterns popping up on New York streets this month suggests a new buoyancy, as women shake off the constraints of a lingering recession and stock up on fashions more lively and vivid than they've seen in years. 
 ''People are sick of not shopping,'' said Beth Buccini, an owner of Kirna Zabete, a SoHo outpost of vanguard design, where splashy florals and abstract designs are providing a bracing antidote to months of self-imposed sobriety. Ms. Buccini credited the renewed appeal of color and pattern with driving up store sales in the last three months by 12 percent over the same period a year ago, as customers gravitated to animated prints from Jason Wu and Thakoon and even a $350 Proenza Schouler T-shirt with a tie-dye motif. ''After such a miserable winter, and an even more miserable economy,'' she said, ''people want a little joy in their lives.'' 
 The antithesis of recession-appropriate sackcloth and ashes, prints exert a strong emotional pull. ''They represent the mind-set of the consumer,'' said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. ''They express a budding feeling that's more optimistic and refreshed.''
 And audacious, it would seem. At Barneys New York, deep-pocketed shoppers have been drawn to the exotic African- and Asian-influenced patterns of Dries Van Noten and Duro Olowu. ''Prints make you feel alive,'' said Julie Gilhart, the store's fashion director. ''They give you a bonk.'' 
 At Neiman Marcus, ikat designs from Gucci as well as tiger and python prints are the lure. Their novelty excites women, said Ken Downing, the fashion director at Neiman. ''These are things they don't yet own.'' 
 A hunger for freshness could account for the lines that snaked along the Avenue of the Americas last month, the draw being a spacious pop-up store housing kaleidoscopic Liberty of London prints as interpreted by Target. Pouncing on girlish dresses, crisp men's shirts, toddler fashions and even bicycles and garden tools all covered in Liberty's signature florals, shoppers picked the store clean, forcing Target, which had been scheduled to keep the pop-up open for four days, to shutter in only two days. 
 The store had stocked twice as much merchandise as it typically does for a pop-up store. ''We thought we were being aggressive,'' said Michael Alexin, a Target vice president for product design and development, ''but I guess we weren't being aggressive enough.''
 Crowds have also been swarming fast-fashion chains like H & M and Topshop, each awash in pattern. At Ann Taylor Loft on 42nd Street and Broadway, Lauri Cohen, a health care worker, showed off her latest find, a fragile cotton blouse covered in pink and green buds. ''I'm buying all the prints and stripes I can,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''I've been in black long enough.'' 
 Tyler Elizabeth Lewis, a handbag designer, strolled in NoLIta the other day wrapped in a coral-and-yellow paisley topper she had accessorized with a pale striped envelope bag and crocheted gloves. ''Prints are unique,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''Their appeal is so personal that when you find one that speaks to you, you know you have to have it.''
 Such bursts of zeal have given a tentative boost to a sagging apparel industry. Retail sales figures released last week showed the strongest monthly gains in a decade, with department stores reporting an average increase of 11.8 percent. ''There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand,'' Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group said in a recent interview with The New York Times, ''and now it is being unleashed.''
 Marshal Cohen, the chief analyst for the market research firm NPD Group, even interprets the resurgence of multihued designs as an indicator of recovery. ''Among the first things to be successful coming out of a recession are lively colors and patterns,'' he said. 
 Consumption, of course, is not expected to rise to the levels of 2006, when apparel sales rose on average by 6 percent. ''There is a temperance out there,'' said Candace Corlett, a partner in WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm in New York. ''People aren't going back to spending as frivolously and compulsively as they once did.'' 
 There is a passion nonetheless, Ms. Corlett noted, ''to have more, to move beyond the deprivation stage we've been in.'' 
 Kaitrin Cooper, an interior designer, was certainly feeling the fervor. ''Oh, my gosh, I'm transported,'' she said, gazing covetously at a Dries Van Noten jacket at Barneys recently. ''I'm loving color and bold prints. Persimmon and chartreuse have replaced the seriously gray phase that I went through last year. 
 ''They make fashion feel fun again, like it's O.K. to care about it.''

HEADLINE: For a Roosevelt Memorial, a Groundbreaking 36 Years in the Making

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
On March 17, 1974, the architect Louis I. Kahn died of a heart attack in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. He was 73. In his briefcase were the final drawings, which he had just completed, for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial to be built on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island.
 A few weeks later, state officials approved Mr. Kahn's design. They said construction would begin before the end of the year. Even if Mr. Kahn had not died, he almost certainly would never have lived long enough to see any evidence of his design bearing fruit. 
 Ground was finally broken late last month for the triangular four-and-a-half acre Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, across the East River from the United Nations.
 There was no ceremony or announcement. A formal groundbreaking will be held this summer to celebrate the start of the final phase of Roosevelt Island's planned development.
 The project was conceived 40 years ago, when the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute (then known as the Four Freedoms Foundation) initiated the planning of a memorial in New York.
 In 1973, Roosevelt Island was officially renamed (from Welfare Island) and plans for a memorial were disclosed. But the project encountered what William J. vanden Heuvel, who founded the Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y., to preserve the legacy of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt and has been instrumental in raising money for the memorial, called ''a perfect storm'' of obstacles.
 New York City became mired in a fiscal crisis, and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, an advocate for the project, was named vice president and left for Washington.
 The memorial is expected to cost about $50 million. Nearly $35 million has been raised so far, including $10 million in government funds and a $10 million gift from the Alphawood Foundation of Chicago.
 Visitors to the memorial will enter past a stand of copper beech trees. They will ascend a monumental stair to allees of 150 linden trees flanking a sloped lawn and culminating in a granite-lined open-air plaza called the room, which will house a bust of the former president and will be engraved with the Four Freedoms (of speech and religion, and from want and fear) he proclaimed in a 1941 speech.
 People who donate a tree will have their names engraved on a granite parapet with relevant Roosevelt references.
 ''If we're lucky in raising these funds, we'll be finished in a little over two years,'' Mr. vanden Heuvel said. ''It's an opportunity for people to have their names attached to what is going to be a world-class monument the moment it's finished.''
 After all the delays, he said it was particularly appropriate that construction had begun as the nation emerges from the biggest financial crisis since the Depression and under a president whose oratory and goals evoke Roosevelt's New Deal.
 The available money will cover the first two phases of the project, including the plaza, installation of the sculpture, the carving of the Four Freedoms text and shoreline improvements.
 The third phase, which is expected to take 11 more months and cost about $17 million, includes the trees, lawn and staircase that constitute the public space.
 Just north of the memorial, the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation is completing Southpoint Park, 10 acres of ''green rooms'' and ''wild gardens'' surrounding an abandoned smallpox hospital. Southpoint, a partnership with the Trust for Public Land, is scheduled to open next fall.
 Now that ground has been broken for the memorial, Mr. vanden Heuvel was relatively sanguine about the long wait. He pointed out that the memorial in Washington to Abraham Lincoln, who died in 1865, was not dedicated until 1922.

HEADLINE: A Program to Certify Electronic Waste Recycling Rivals an Industry-U.S. Plan

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
The Basel Action Network, an American watchdog group that has sought to curb the export of toxic electronic waste from the United States, plans to begin a new certification and auditing program on Thursday for both recyclers and companies that generate electronic refuse. 
 In addition to outlining safe domestic handling and disposal practices for old televisions, computers and other electronic devices, the system would effectively bar participating recyclers from exporting toxic, nonfunctional electronic waste to developing nations. The program will compete directly with a less stringent standard recently developed by industry and the federal government that companies and recyclers say makes more economic sense. 
 ''The U.S. has been asleep at the switch,'' said Jim Puckett, the executive director of the Basel Action Network, which takes its name from the Basel Convention, an international agreement governing the handling and trade of hazardous waste, including discarded electronics. More than 165 countries have ratified the convention, but the United States has not. 
 Much of the debate over the handling of electronic refuse arises from the metals like lead and mercury that are used to make electronic devices. Most discarded equipment is either ported to landfills or sold into a murky global market, where it often ends up in vast and unregulated harvesting and smelting operations in poor corners of Africa and Asia. In either case, the disposal poses significant environmental and health risks.
 Some 53 million tons of electronic waste was generated worldwide in 2009, according to ABI Research, a technology market research firm. Only about 13 percent of it was recycled. Global revenues for e-waste recovery were roughly $5.7 billion last year, according to ABI, and are expected to grow to $14.6 billion by 2014. 
 The Basel network has long administered a program in which participating recyclers promised to abide by a set of rules for responsibly handling electronic waste. 
 Beginning Thursday, the group's certification, called e-Stewards, will be based on standards set out by the International Organization for Standardization, and compliance will be independently audited. 
 Recyclers will pay a fee to the auditor and a licensing fee to BAN -- roughly $15,000 for a midsize company, Mr. Puckett said -- which will earn them the right to use the e-Steward logo. 
 Electronic waste generators, including corporate buyers of technology and gadget makers, would earn an e-Steward Enterprise designation in return for a smaller licensing fee and a commitment, subject to continuing monitoring by BAN, to make a ''best effort'' to use e-Steward certified recyclers. 
 Just how many recyclers or waste producers will participate in the program remains an open question. A similar program, developed over the last three years by a coalition of manufacturers and recyclers in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency, is already in place. 
 That program, called R2, for Responsible Recycling, also certifies participating recyclers and provides guidelines for the handling and disposal of electronic waste. R2 permits the export of discarded equipment so long as it does not violate the laws of the receiving country and the facilities handling the material abroad meet basic environmental and health standards.
 Groups like BAN and the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, which had originally participated in the R2 negotiations, said the R2 program was too lax. ''It's full of loopholes,'' Mr. Puckett said. For example, the BAN program forbids the use of prison labor for electronics recycling. No such provision is in the R2 standard.
 Eric Harris, the director of governmental and international affairs for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade group, said BAN and other environmental groups simply wanted too much. 
 ''The responsible way to address irresponsible recycling is to help educate and encourage good practice, not to ban all the trade,'' Mr. Harris said. 
 ''The bottom line for I.S.R.I. is that we're about making real change, not making headlines,'' Mr. Harris added in a follow-up e-mail message. ''Our members want to recycle the right way, whether in Chicago or China.''
 Both the R2 and e-Steward programs are just getting under way. Since R2 began in January, eight facilities operated by six recycling companies have been certified. Meanwhile, BAN's e-Steward program begins with five facilities operated by three companies already approved and about a dozen others in line for certification. 
 On the manufacturing side, Samsung, which by some measures is the largest technology company in the world, has signed on to BAN's e-Steward Enterprise program, Mr. Puckett said. Three major financial institutions -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Capital One Financial -- have also joined. 
 Some companies, like Hewlett-Packard, the largest maker of personal computers, have made independent pledges not to export e-waste to developing nations. 
 Robert Houghton, the chief executive of the Ohio-based electronics recovery firm Redemtech, which is among the three e-Steward certified firms, said his customers were demanding a higher standard from recyclers. 
 ''I'd like to say that I am doing this for purely environmental and altruistic reasons,'' he said. ''But really, in my opinion, it's the corporate marketplace that is asking for more accountability and transparency.''

HEADLINE: With Oil Deals, Merger Advisers Rejoice

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and WEI GU

 BODY:
Wall Street has always loved the fees generated by deal-crazy oil companies. But the recent flurry of activity in the energy industry -- $130 billion so far this year and counting -- is once again making them the most valuable clients for the world's merger advisers.
 Oil and gas producers often jostle with financial services firms for the top sector spot in merger activity. High oil prices, above $80 a barrel on Wednesday, may be helping to give the energy sector the edge by increasing company valuations. So far this year, the industry has spawned 46 transactions worth $500 million or above, racing past the financial sector, which had just 31 deals, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 But resurgent energy prices are only part of the story. After all, natural gas -- which has been at the epicenter of much deal-making -- still languishes at less than a third of its 2005 peak. Instead, the recent flurry of activity is mainly a result of a race to lock up resources. With 87 percent of the world's oil reserves controlled by foreign governments or national champions, big private energy companies are finding it harder to replace lost production. From 2002 to 2008, Exxon Mobil, for instance, managed to replenish just 39 percent of production through new exploration. This has put the burden squarely on deal-making.
 Merger advisers also owe a debt of gratitude to China, which is trying to feed surging domestic demand for energy. Acquisitions by Chinese national oil companies made up nearly 40 percent of the value of deals outside the United States in the first quarter of the year, according to IHS Herold. Bidding pressure from deep-pocketed Chinese companies -- including Sinopec's purchase of a piece of Conoco's business in Canada's oil sands this week -- pushes up the value of deals.
 In addition, as old-style cheap oil gets harder to find, resources that were once fringe, like gas shale, oil sands and subsalt oil, are receiving more attention. The greater technical challenge of extracting these hoards helps explain the recent wave of deals in the oil services sector, including Schlumberger's pending $11 billion takeover of Smith International.
 The widening so-called contango in oil -- with near-term contracts trading at a discount to longer-dated ones -- may point to an ominous glut. But with so many broad trends driving energy deals, even a retreat in the price of oil is unlikely to end the party for M.& A. bankers.
 Asian Revaluation
 Singapore may just be a dot on the map, but it has long been viewed as a leader in economic policy by other Asian countries, including China. That's why investors took so much notice when the city-state revalued its currency by about 1.3 percent on Wednesday.
 The Monetary Authority of Singapore shifted its currency band to contain imported inflation. This approach is not open to China, where inflationary pressures are homegrown and the currency looks more significantly undervalued. Nevertheless, Beijing can learn from Singapore's model, which offers a better balance between stability and flexibility.
 China needs to make its exchange rate less rigid to counter accusations that it has been manipulating its currency, the renminbi. However, Beijing doesn't want too much currency fluctuation. That's why Singapore's ''basket, band and crawl'' model might be appealing to leaders in Beijing.
 The Singapore dollar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies, and allowed to fluctuate within a 4 percent band. However, the contents of the basket are secret, as are the upper and lower limits of the band. Singapore can also move the midpoint of the band, as it did on Wednesday.
 Of course, there are huge differences between a city-state and the world's third-largest economy. Singapore, whose foreign trade is three times its gross domestic product, has to allow enough freedom in its exchange rate to achieve domestic price stability. In China, where foreign trade accounts for 50 percent of G.D.P., that incentive is much smaller.
 Moreover, China could not adopt Singapore's approach without a significant one-time appreciation in its currency. Otherwise, it would be hard to create a two-way trade: China currently restricts the renminbi's movement against the dollar to just 0.5 percent every day.
 Nevertheless, as China considers making its exchange rate more flexible, the Singapore model is worth studying.

HEADLINE: The Wait List Is the Hardest Part

BYLINE: By SAFFA KHAN. 
Saffa Khan is a senior at Cary Academy.

DATELINE: Chapel Hill, N.C. 

 BODY:
 AFTER nearly 12 years of school, hours of SAT prep and tutoring and $70 per college application, I thought I would finally get some relief this month. I thought I'd get a straight answer from colleges at least -- a yes or no. But instead I got on the wait list. In fact, I landed on four wait lists. 
 I'm far from alone. Universities are increasingly using wait lists to cope with the growing number of applicants, and the resulting uncertainty about how many will accept their offers of admission. The number of students placed on the Yale wait list rose 21 percent this year, even though last year, the school admitted only seven applicants out of 769 on the list. I'm one of the nearly 3,400 students on Duke University's wait list, meaning that of its 27,000 applicants, about 12 percent are in suspense.
 My generation happens to excel at waiting. We've gotten used to it. Waiting for the economy and our parents to recover from the global meltdown, waiting for the Internet to get faster and Apple to unveil its next product, waiting for the wars to end, for health care reform to happen or not happen ... and now, waiting for colleges to make up their minds. 
 Of course the wait list has a purpose. It allows colleges, as Duke explains, to ''fine-tune'' the size and makeup of each class. If spaces do become available, they don't necessarily go to the most deserving applicants on the wait list, but to those who happen to be underrepresented in the acceptance pool -- for one school it might be math majors, for another, Midwesterners. 
 But the wait list also prolongs the holding pattern of teenage life. To many of us, rejection is a foreign concept, and colleges seem to think that our tender egos prefer a maybe to a flat-out no. Yes, getting wait-listed does soften the blow for some overachievers with flawless transcripts -- the ones who agonize over College Confidential and other Web sites for college-bound students. 
 The university is acknowledging, to a degree, your suitability for being part of its class of 2014, and you're able to hang on to an iota of hope. But the truth is that the chances of actually making it into that class are slim to none, and these expanding wait lists ultimately make the college application process even more unbearable.
 Do colleges really need to have 1,000 students in reserve to fill out a handful or even a hundred spaces? As a practical matter, colleges can't eradicate the wait list, but they could certainly limit it to a more reasonable size. At the same time, they could work on increasing their ability to accommodate the rising number of deserving applicants. 
 Whether we like it or not, rejection is a reality -- and we should learn to live with it before graduating into the working world. Eventually, we need a straight answer from the grownups who decide our fates.
 I, for one, am tired of waiting.

HEADLINE: Broad Group of Retailers Had Big Gains in March

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Sales rose robustly in March across a wide range of retail stores, another sign that American consumers were beginning to spend more freely even as the job market remained weak. 
 The Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales climbed 1.6 percent last month compared with February, largely because of a jump in car sales. Analysts had expected a 1.2 percent increase. 
 The report provided the latest evidence that consumers were gaining confidence, despite pervasive unemployment and large debt burdens. Pent-up demand is anchoring much of the growth, economists say, though there are signs that credit is becoming more available. 
 Increasingly, economists are saying that consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, may be more robust this year than previously thought. But they say that the recent burst of enthusiasm could fade as government stimulus spending wanes and if the labor market remains weak.
 ''Across the board, you've got robust gains,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''To maintain this momentum, we've got to see a pickup in job creation.''
 Sales were up at stores of many types: building materials climbed 1.3 percent and clothing sales increased 2.3 percent.
 Spending is ''growing more than we originally anticipated,'' Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, an investment firm, wrote in a research note. ''This is a fact that cannot be ignored.''
 Car sales were the report's bright spot, climbing 6.8 percent. Earlier this month, carmakers reported that incentives helped them post a 24 percent increase in March sales, the industry's largest year-over-year increase in eight years.
 Total retail sales in March also surged compared with their level a year earlier, rising 7.6 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
 Whether that trend will continue is unclear. While the unemployment rate has remained steady at 9.7 percent, some analysts expect that number to climb. 
 In addition, the government is likely to begin scaling back stimulus efforts, including incentives to buy homes. Interest rates, kept at record lows during the financial crisis to spur lending, may also rise. 
 The rosier outlook for sales was underscored in a report by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, which showed economic activity picking up across most of the country. 
 The Fed's ''beige book'' survey found that businesses generally reported better sales and increased production last month. Many employers, however, remained reluctant to hire permanent workers.
 ''While overall labor markets remained weak, some hiring activity was evident,'' the Fed report said.
 A separate report on Wednesday suggested that the stimulus efforts had not yet spurred inflation. Consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in March, the Labor Department said, largely because of higher prices for fruits and vegetables. The price of medical care and new and used vehicles also rose. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices were flat.
 ''Inflation as measured by the government is going nowhere but down,'' Mr. Greenhaus wrote.
 The data will probably give the Federal Reserve breathing room as it seeks to keep the benchmark federal funds rate near zero.
 Still, some economists point to increases in food and energy prices, coupled with a weak dollar, as evidence that inflation may be in the pipeline. 
 The Consumer Price Index has increased 2.3 percent in the last year -- slightly higher than the Fed's target rate -- and some costs, including energy and education, have surged. Tuition costs surged more than 6 percent last month.
 Prices have been held back by a weak real estate market, with rents continuing to decline.
 Some economists say they believe that prices are so subdued that the more pressing concern is deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Whether deflation emerges as a threat may depend largely on the strength of the recovery and whether demand can remain robust even in the absence of government efforts.
 The Labor Department said Wednesday that the average weekly salary increased 0.1 percent in March over the previous month. 
 Economists are watching that number closely as they try to gauge when the job market might begin to improve more substantially. Businesses typically begin to add hours and wages before making permanent hires.
 In its report on retail sales, the government said sales were stronger in February than originally estimated. They rose 0.5 percent rather than 0.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Archbishop Earns Praise In First Year, As Tests Await

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
At times during his first year as the 10th Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Timothy M. Dolan seemed to be everywhere at once, like a presidential candidate with momentum in the early primaries.
 The crush of demands to see, hear and get slapped on the back by him kept the new archbishop in moving vehicles much of the time, on his way to national conferences, television appearances and far-flung churches where parishioners stood in line for hours to shake his hand and say the same thing, often in the same words: that he -- a bearish, warm-blooded, tough-talking Midwesterner -- was ''a breath of fresh air.'' 
 Since his solemn inauguration ceremony one year ago Thursday, Archbishop Dolan, 60, has made no secret of his love for food and ''brew'' (his word). And he seems to have surrendered unconditionally to the gastronomic temptations of his freshman-year tour -- from the elegant banquet tables of Manhattan to the homemade spreads laid out on folding tables by the food committees of his upstate parishes. (And he has vowed to visit each of his 405 parishes in due time.) 
 When the pounds began to show, he turned them into a laugh line. Patting his midsection, he told audiences, ''New York has grown on me.'' And when the calorie-counting Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg scolded him -- bluntly advising him to lose weight because ''we'd like to keep you around for a while,'' in Archbishop Dolan's telling -- the prelate burst into laughter and hugged him.
 ''Call me Timothy,'' he said.
 But Archbishop Dolan has some less palatable duties ahead of him. The recession has worsened a chronic budget squeeze in the archdiocese, increased demand for its frayed web of social service programs and added urgency to a long-planned realignment of resources. 
 The parishes and schools of the archdiocese needed an added $30 million infusion from headquarters in fiscal 2009 to meet expenses, officials said.
 Whatever else it does, the good will he sows now among the archdiocese's 2.5 million Catholics will help stem resentments when some of those places are closed, said Msgr. Thomas J. Bergin, a former vicar of archdiocesan education. ''People have warmed to him,'' he said. ''He will need that.''
 In interviews, Catholic leaders, scholars and lay people praised the friendly, politically moderate tone that Archbishop Dolan set in his first year, while noting that he had not yet had to make the kind of tough financial and organizational choices that his predecessor, Cardinal Edward M. Egan, did. Most of Cardinal Egan's administrators remain in their jobs, some of them continuing to work on consolidation plans begun during his time. 
 Unlike his predecessor, though, Archbishop Dolan has not shied away from speaking out on politically charged topics -- against abortion and gay marriage initially, and in recent weeks against those who have raised questions about the Vatican's role in the sexual abuse scandal.
 His fierce defense of the Catholic hierarchy -- he accused The New York Times and other news organizations of participating in ''a well-oiled campaign'' against Pope Benedict XVI -- brought cheers from some church stalwarts and criticism from others. R. Scott Appleby, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame who describes himself as a fan of the archbishop's, called his remarks symptomatic of a ''fringy apocalypticism infiltrating the rhetoric'' of some bishops.
 Archbishop Dolan was in Rome this week and unavailable for an interview, said Joseph Zwilling, the archdiocesan spokesman. But among both defenders and critics of the church's Roman leadership, there is near-unanimous accord that in sending Archbishop Dolan to the media capital of the world, the Vatican did itself some good.
 ''In the context of all the crisis and controversy of recent church history, he is a point of light -- a guy who can project the kind of affability and open-mindedness that make Catholics feel good about their church,'' said John L. Allen Jr., Vatican correspondent for The National Catholic Reporter, who is at work on a book about the archbishop.
 A theologically conservative leader, Archbishop Dolan has for the most part kept his public statements well within the bounds of the nuanced positions established by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
 Yet his political talents invariably subject him to comparisons with past lights of the church, from Cardinals John J. O'Connor and Terence J. Cooke of New York to Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, the religious-broadcasting pioneer who was one of his boyhood heroes. Archbishop Dolan's intellect and navigational skills in the crosscurrents of religion and politics -- and his unquestionable loyalty to the pope -- mark him as the prelate most suited, if any are, to become the American voice of Catholic orthodoxy, some experts said. 
 ''He has a great presence and a nuanced sense of things,'' said Prof. Terrence W. Tilley, chairman of the theology department at Fordham University. ''In a lot of ways, he is on another level. And he is still learning.''
 In the past year, the archbishop has earned the affection of many priests who bristled under the sometimes peremptory style of Cardinal Egan. Archbishop Dolan has won over many parishioners by restoring the archdiocesan pastoral council, a lay advisory group that was moribund for years. 
 He has become as fluent in the vernacular of the Internet (''Baloney!'' he wrote in a recent post on his blog, at blog.archny.org) as in the scholarly jargon of the Ph.D.-holder (which he is).
 He has maneuvered between the demands of Catholic factions to his left and right. He disappointed anti-abortion activists last year with his temperate criticism of Notre Dame's president for inviting President Obama to speak at commencement ceremonies. (The university president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, said in an interview that when he met Archbishop Dolan a month later, ''the archbishop expressed his concern for how I was feeling, and let me know he understood my point of view.'')
 On the other hand, the archbishop has yet to deliver a major sermon or speech on immigration issues -- to the chagrin of advocates for Latino immigrants in New York, who make up the church's fastest-growing population.
 He has also negotiated the subtle challenge of accommodating the presence of his retired predecessor, Cardinal Egan, who often sits beside him at official functions. Cardinal Egan, who recently turned 78, urged Archbishop Dolan to appoint Msgr. Greg Mustaciuolo, the cardinal's longtime personal secretary, to the job of archdiocesan chancellor, the influential overseer of all records and correspondence within the archdiocese. It is the only significant appointment Archbishop Dolan has made to date.
 The gentle joke told about the archbishop at church headquarters in Manhattan is borrowed from one about Pope John Paul II: ''Must be wonderful to spend so much time with the guy,'' a visitor tells the office receptionist. 
 ''What guy?''
 In other words, Archbishop Dolan has not spent a lot of time at his desk.
 ''In the Catholic world, we use Latin terms to describe the two types of bishop,'' Mr. Allen said. ''There is the 'ad estera,' who is the outward-looking, evangelizing preacher. And the 'ad intera,' the inward-tending bishop who likes to move the levers of power.''
 ''Dolan is the first type -- 'ad estera,' '' he said. ''He is not someone to be consumed with the minutiae of administering.''
 That was his style of management as archbishop of Milwaukee,where he served from 2002 until his appointment in New York. He was praised there for revitalizing the morale of parishioners and priests after a sexual abuse scandal during the tenure of his predecessor, Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland. But he was criticized by some, including many victims of abuse, for having largely left Archbishop Weakland's bishop-administrators in place.
 Mr. Zwilling, the spokesman for the New York archdiocese, said Archbishop Dolan's decision to retain most of Cardinal Egan's administrators so far reflects his predecessor's ''excellent choice of staff,'' as well as the realities of being a newcomer taking charge of an ecclesiastical territory that spans Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven upstate counties.
 ''He has spent the better part of the year getting to know his way around,'' Mr. Zwilling said. ''Up until now, a lot of what he has done inside the archdiocese has not been very visible. But that will change soon.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 17, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Timothy M. Dolan's first year as archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York misstated part of the Latin terms for two types of Catholic bishops, the outward-looking and the inward-focused. The terms are ''ad extra'' and ''ad intra'' -- not ''ad estera'' and ''ad intera.'' (A reporter writing a book about Archbishop Dolan describes him as ''ad extra.'')

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of Yale, a World a Million Miles Away

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN
 Shafiq Abdussabur's creaky 1986 Mercedes rolls past the Gothic spires, the Urban Outfitters, Gourmet Heaven and the rest of the rarefied zone around Yale onto Dixwell Avenue and, bam, the world changes.
 ''That's where they shot my nephew,'' he says. He peers out at the Dixwell Mini-Market, in the heart of the Corridor, the city's high-crime area. In the past two weeks, five black men were murdered over eight days. There have been 11 homicides in the city this year, 17 since October, 14 in the Corridor. 
 Tywan Turner wasn't really the nephew of Mr. Abdussabur, a New Haven police officer who heads Ctribat Institute for Social Development, a gun violence prevention program that works with children in troubled New Haven neighborhoods, takes them camping in the summer, gives them a home beyond the streets. But Mr. Turner had been a beloved participant in the program, so his murder at age 19 felt like a death in the family. He had left a cookout at a friend's house on Saturday, walked to the store for cigarettes and was shot at least four times. It was the second homicide that day. 
 ''Awesome kid, a sweetheart, like my kids,'' says Mr. Abdussabur, 43, who grew up in the neighborhood and ran track at the University of West Georgia. ''Respectful, handsome, nice smile. Not a fighting kid, very laid back, very smart. Someone was in a dispute with his brother and retaliated against him.''
 Just down the street, there's a crowd in front of the Precision Kutz hair salon. The Rev. Eugene Brunson, pastor of Wayfaring Ministries, is preaching to perhaps 50 people. There's an electric piano and drums. The crowd makes a circle, links hands, and his daughter Tamika sings the hymn, ''He Saw the Best in Me,'' as Mr. Brunson concludes.
 ''Everyone in the sound of my voice,'' he preaches. ''Let's all stand together. It's time to bring about a change about what's going on. It's time for the killing to stop. We can't wait for God to come down and do it, because God is telling us we have to do it.''
 When it's over, he talks about the toxic cycles of life on the streets. ''There's a spirit that has overtaken our youth, claiming territory, caught up in vendettas, no jobs. They're angry; they're frustrated with life; there's no father in the house, and there's no outlet. We have to redeem their lives at any cost.''
 New Haven is no different than most cities, except that the proximity between the world of endless possibility at Yale and the world of no possibility down the street is more vivid. 
 Still, the spate of killings has thrown people into a panic. Some black community leaders have called for state troopers to begin patrolling the streets. People cite the bad economy and the lack of opportunities for young black men -- whether children just out of school or inmates freed from prison. 
 They point to the lack of recreational activities for children, what some see as the decline in the city's community policing, the continuing deterioration of black families, gang culture, too many guns, too few jobs. ''There are a thousand answers, and they're all right,'' Mr. Abdussabur says. ''And there are a thousand questions, and they're all legitimate.'' 
 He drives some more, avoiding a few streets that are considered hot spots. Some neighborhoods are strongholds for the Crips, some for the Bloods, some for subsets like the Tre Bloods or the local R2 gang.
 The car stops in front of a chicken shack. Bloods territory. Two young men are on the corner. One in a gray hoodie says he is 31, served 13 years in prison and has a job that pays $9 an hour but can barely pay his bills. The other, thin and sweet-faced under his Celtics cap, says he is 20. He could pass for 16.
 Asked about gangs, the younger one scoffs. ''It's more like personal stuff, person to person,'' he says. ''Say someone kills somebody. Well, of course, someone wants to go back and do it to them, like in retaliation. But it's for your homeboy, it's not for the gang. It's like, people who love each other, you look out for the next person.''
 The older one says he is trying to look out for younger guys. ''What jobs are there? McDonald's? Burger King? Dunkin' Donuts? If your father is a bricklayer, he teaches you how to lay bricks, you might be a bricklayer. My father died from heroin and AIDS, sharing needles. My mom was a crackhead. She had me in jail. How did you think I was supposed to turn out?''
 His tone is even, conversational, not self-pitying. Just a guy on the corner.
 ''You wake up,'' he says. ''You've got your job. You wake up thinking, 'I really ain't got no problems.' I wake up wondering if I'm going to die today. And that's the way things are right now.''

HEADLINE: Celebrating The Joys Of April 15

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service needs to get way better at marketing.
 Somehow the government tax collectors have let the country get locked into the idea that April 15 is a day of sorrow and misery, the culmination of the dreaded filing of the income tax form. 
 But, in fact, most people who file get money back. (Cue the horns and balloons.) 
 And according to one much, much-quoted study by the Tax Policy Center, 47 percent of American households didn't have to pay one cent of income tax for 2009. (Marching bands, confetti.)
 Thanks to the tax credits in President Obama's stimulus plan and other programs aimed at helping working families, couples with two kids making up to $50,000 were generally off the hook this year. 
 Naturally, anti-tax groups held rallies to thank the president for doing so much to reduce the burden on the half of the country least able to pay. Not.
 ''We need to cut taxes so that our families can keep more of what they earn and produce and our mom-and-pops then, our small businesses, can reinvest according to our own priorities,'' said Sarah Palin, at a Tea Party, anti-tax rally in Boston on Wednesday. This was the most coherent thing she had to say about taxation, although there was quite a bit of ''Drill, baby, drill!'' 
 According to the Gallup polls, 45 percent of Tea Party supporters have incomes under $50,000. According to a New York Times/CBS News poll, Tea Party activists are virtually the only segment of the population in which a majority feels its tax burden is unfair. Clearly, these are not the kind of folks who would cancel their anti-tax rallies just on account of not being taxed.
 ''We're here to take our country back,'' said a former Missouri House speaker at a Tea Party rally at the State Capitol, where nobody appeared to be grateful for the good news about the bottom 47 percent at all.
 Let us stop for a minute and consider this ''take our country back'' mantra. Some people believe it is the cry of angry white men who don't like seeing a lot of blacks, women and gay people in positions of power. I prefer a less depressing explanation, which is that all this yearning for the golden days of yore has less to do with Washington than with the fact that so many of the Tea Partyists appear to be in late middle age. I think they just want to go back to the country that existed when they were 28 and looked really good in tight-fitting jeans. Which is no longer the case. 
 But we digress. About that 47 percent figure. Even the Tax Policy Center, which came up with it, doesn't seem all that thrilled with the attention it's getting. 
 ''That viral number,'' sighed Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the center. He is worried that the country is getting the impression that the bottom 47 percent is not paying anything for government services. But there are, of course, a lot of other taxes, particularly the big whoppers that are taken out of paychecks to pay for Social Security and Medicare, the programs everybody seems to like.
 ''This is looking only at income tax,'' Williams said. ''If we toss in payroll tax, only 13 percent are exempt from both -- almost all low-income elderly.''
 Clearly, we need a THANKS, GOVERNMENT!!!! parade of low-income elderly. 
 And shouldn't there be better signage on paychecks? Nobody reads the fine print that shows how their gross pay shriveled into the take-home. Maybe the I.R.S. could stick in a big red box saying ZERO INCOME TAXES whenever appropriate. 
 While we're at it, we could celebrate the top earners, who pay the bulk of the taxes, thanks to their having the bulk of the money. We don't need to shed tears for them. The after-tax income of the top 1 percent more than tripled since 1979, while the bottom-dwellers barely moved an inch.
 Still, good job, wealthy people! You worked hard, played by the rules and the nation appreciates your support for the national defense, highways, meat inspection and national parks. 
 When President Obama gives a domestic policy speech, there's usually a cleaning woman who has no health insurance or a laid-off firefighter invited to come onstage. But on April 15, maybe he could give a hug to a corporate lawyer who pulled down $3 million and gave half of it back.
 There's no reason not to show the top taxpayers a little love. Paying a lot of taxes should be a badge of honor. It proves you made it into the league of big money-makers, not to mention the fact that you're supporting the upkeep of the Grand Canyon. If the I.R.S. had been doing its marketing properly, little kids would dream of growing up to become really big taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Must Recover Before City Can Overcome Recession, Economists Say

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The recession may be ending in the New York metropolitan area, but if history is any guide, no substantial recovery can begin until Wall Street stops shedding jobs and starts hiring again.
 That was the message delivered on Wednesday by a group of economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. With the exception of the continuing loss of jobs in the securities industry, most measures of the regional economy suggest that the sharp downturn that began in mid-2008 has run its course, the bank's economists said.
 Despite the surprisingly strong rebound of the stock market and the profits of Wall Street firms, they said that it was still too soon to declare the recession over. But if it is over, they said, it has cost significantly fewer jobs in the region than either of the previous two recessions did. 
 ''If we've seen the worst -- which is not 100 percent clear -- this has been quite a bit milder than the last two recessions,'' said Jason Bram, a senior economist at the bank. Still, he added, New York's economy has a history of taking a year longer than the rest of the country's to climb back from a recession.
 William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said the national recovery was ''likely to be muted compared with the early stages of past recoveries.'' Separately, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday that the economy in the New York district had ''strengthened noticeably,'' though hiring remained sluggish.
 Since the national recession began at the end of 2007, the number of jobs in the city has declined by about 5 percent -- or about half the loss in the recession that followed the stock market crash of 1987. About one-sixth of the current decline has come from the securities industry, compared with about one-fifth of the losses in the previous two recessions, Mr. Bram said.
 Painful as they were for the region, the job cuts on Wall Street have been smaller than most economists feared when the financial crisis hit and toppled big banks like Lehman Brothers. Those layoffs have an outsize impact, because the typical job in the securities industry pays six times as much as the typical job outside of finance in the city, said Rae Rosen, a regional economist at the New York Fed.
 The problem now, Ms. Rosen said, is that Wall Street still appears to be shrinking. The latest figures from the State Labor Department showed that the number of jobs in the city's securities industry declined by about 2,000, or 1 percent, in February, while most other sectors were adding jobs.
 ''The fact that securities industry employment is still declining is a concern because that's a leading indicator,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''In every other recession, securities employment turned up first.''
 The city's unemployment rate dipped in February to 10.2 percent, after reaching a 16-year high of 10.5 percent in December. The State Labor Department is scheduled to release its employment report for March on Thursday.
 Ms. Rosen traced the rise in the city's dependence on Wall Street, showing how financial jobs had provided about one-eighth of all wages paid in New York in 1972. By 2007, more than one-third of all wages came from the ''very volatile'' financial sector, she said. And that is without counting the pay of hedge-fund managers, whose earnings are classified as investment gains instead of income, Ms. Rosen said.
 In its monthly report on the regional economy, known as the ''beige book,'' the Fed cited several signs of an upswing in tourism in the city, including higher ticket sales for Broadway shows and rising occupancy rates at hotels. Consumer spending was also stronger in March. 
 But, the report said, ''There continues to be very little hiring activity from major legal and financial firms.'' As close as the report came to adding a bright note about Wall Street was its note that ''a contact in the securities industry notes that layoffs have largely wound down'' and some firms had begun to do some mid-level hiring.

HEADLINE: At Coachella, Strong Start To Season Of Festivals

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
This year the promoters of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., gambled that even in a bruised economy fans would not be able to resist the lure of a three-day weekend of connoisseur alt-rock, hip-hop and dance music in the desert sun.
 For the first time in its 11-year history the festival -- which runs Friday to Sunday with Jay-Z, Pavement, Faith No More, Muse and Thom Yorke's new band, Atoms for Peace, among the headliners -- sold only three-day passes (for $269), removing single-day tickets from its menu. There was no shortage of griping; a ''Single-Day Pass/Wristband Petition Group'' on Facebook has more than 6,000 members and a long chain of angry comments. But Coachella's gamble has paid off: this week it announced that it had sold out its allotment of 75,000 weekend passes. 
 In explaining the change, Paul Tollett, the promoter, said that having everybody there the entire time would help simplify attendees' hotel and camping arrangements, and that a three-day Phish festival last fall in the same site, the Empire Polo Club, had no single-day tickets and was still ''incredible.'' But most important, he said, he simply wanted to be like the big kids -- the huge, venerable music festivals in Europe during which fans commune for days in tents and muddy fields. 
 ''I want to take the training wheels off,'' Mr. Tollett said in a telephone interview. ''I want to be like the other festivals around the world that create these magical weekends.'' (As commenters on that Facebook page have noted, selling only weekend passes means there is less likelihood of low attendance on days with weaker lineups.) 
 As one of the first major music events of the year, Coachella is a bellwether for the entire concert industry, which makes most of its money in the summer. And many concert executives said they expect that this year, like the last, will be good for big tours and big festivals. But how good it will be for smaller, less star-studded affairs is unclear. 
 Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of Pollstar, a concert industry trade magazine, called Coachella's sellout ''an excellent sign'' for the overall business. ''Our numbers show that 2010 is off to a good start,'' he said, ''and coming on the heels of a surprisingly good last year, which flies in the face of what you'd expect given the economic environment. The festivals that are going forward this year all seem to be doing fine.''
 Those successful festivals include smorgasbords like Sasquatch in George, Wash.; Lollapalooza in Chicago; and Bonnaroo, in Manchester, Tenn. Sasquatch, over Memorial Day weekend, has sold out, and Lollapalooza (in August) and Bonnaroo (in June, and which only offers tickets for the full four days) are selling well, according to representatives. Some niche events are also popular draws: the dance-oriented Ultra Music Festival in Miami last month sold out with 100,000 attendees, and the indie-rock Pitchfork festival in July -- capacity 18,000 per day -- sold out of its three-day passes weeks ago. (Single-day tickets are still available.) 
 Not all festivals have been so lucky. Some, like Vegoose in Las Vegas, sprung up in hopes of emulating the success of Coachella and Bonnaroo but folded quickly. Others, like Rothbury in western Michigan and Pemberton, near Vancouver, British Columbia, have officially gone on hiatus, leaving fans wondering if they will ever return. The fate of All Points West, a two-year-old festival in Jersey City, is also uncertain; its promoter, AEG Live, has made no announcements about it, and executives there have said they are weighing whether to bring it back this summer.
 The festivals that have remained, many in the industry say, have done so by establishing a clear aesthetic and by marketing themselves as vacation destinations. Ashley Capps, one of the promoters of Bonnaroo, said that about half its attendees come from outside the southeastern United States. 
 ''The festivals that are surviving,'' said Tom Windish, an agent whose clients include Justice, Major Lazer and Hot Chip, ''are putting together strong bills that are not just dependent on top talent. People are interested in a broader variety of music now and are not necessarily interested in just going to see one band.''
 Whether the success of festivals like Coachella cannibalize nonfestival ticket sales is another question. 
 Last year, according to Pollstar, $4.6 billion worth of concert tickets were sold in North America, continuing a decade-long upward trend. But Live Nation, the world's largest concert promoter, says that 40 percent of its tickets still go unsold, and last year the company offered steep ticket discounts and other promotions, backed by aggressive marketing. Live Nation merged with Ticketmaster in January, and the concert industry as a whole is closely watching the company to see what it does this summer.
 Jason Garner, a top executive at Live Nation, said in an interview on Wednesday that the company is likely to continue marketing efforts to reduce its 40 percent unsold inventory. But he still had a positive outlook for the year, saying that concerts remain an attractive draw for fans despite the economy.
 ''We were one of the very few consumer businesses that grew last year and that tells you everything about the importance of live music in fans' lives,'' he said. ''A concert by Lady Gaga is not discretionary spending, it's a huge part of her fans' lives.''
 Lady Gaga's Monster Ball Tour, promoted by Live Nation, continues through the summer. She is also playing at Lollapalooza.

HEADLINE: St. Vincent's Files for Bankruptcy

 BODY:
St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan filed its long-expected petition for bankruptcy on Wednesday, indicating that its largest unsecured creditor was a federal pension insurance agency. 
 The petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, showed liabilities of more than $1 billion. It was not clear exactly how much more, since that amount is the highest that a debtor can check off on the form.
 In the No. 2 spot for creditors was a medical malpractice trust monitor, owed $113 million.
 The hospital said the bankruptcy filing would allow it to continue caring for patients as it closes. 
 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, an arm of the federal government, has $180 million in claims that the pension fund does not have the money for. 
 While the $180 million debt is not by itself enough to swamp the federal fund, which is running a deficit, it comes on the heels of a major recession and a string of other pension collapses.
 But Michael Fagan, a spokesman for the hospital, said the pensions were ''not at risk.'' Jeffrey Speicher, a spokesman for the federal fund, agreed, saying, ''The bottom line is the nurses are going to get their pension.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street, and the Search for Blame

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''No One Is to Blame for Anything,'' by Frank Rich (column, April 11):
 Congress is looking for people to blame, while those people claim that no one could have predicted the financial crisis. This debate ignores the obvious: the crash is part of the normal boom and bust cycle that laxly regulated free markets have always followed.
 Before the 1930s, financial busts occurred roughly every 20 years, and after regulations were in place, the cycle was not so regular or extreme. Conservatives from both political parties fought for decades to get rid of those regulations, and their success means we have the economy that the conservatives wanted. 
 The apostles of free-market gospel, like Alan Greenspan and Robert E. Rubin, preached that we can have the big booms without equally big busts, but reality has crashed their rich fantasy life.
 I predict that if we don't re-regulate financial markets, we will have a bust in about 20 years, and experts will claim that no one could have possibly foreseen it.
 John Long Torrington, Conn., April 12, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The English author G. K. Chesterton wrote: ''A stiff apology is a second insult. ... The injured party does not want to be compensated because he has been wronged; he wants to be healed because he has been hurt.''
 Looking to Alan Greenspan, Robert E. Rubin and other financial and political leaders for contrition is counterproductive. We've been hurt financially and our sense of security has been rocked, but casting blame and demanding empty apologies does little to prevent future crises. We need to take a bigger stake in our financial system and better understand what happens with our money.
 Many of us ''victims'' can't be bothered to learn even the most basic aspects of how our economy works and what our leaders are up to. Until we know enough to keep them from wronging us, we can continue to expect to be insulted.
 Kevin Caldwell Washington, April 11, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Frank Rich makes it seem as though the people in charge should have foreseen the ultimate collapse of the housing market. He derides Alan Greenspan for saying, ''I was right 70 percent of the time, but I was wrong 30 percent of the time.''
 People who actually work in the financial markets know that being right 70 percent of the time is a fantasy. In fact, one can show mathematically that having a forecasting accuracy of 70 percent would very quickly result in owning the entire wealth of the United States! I'd say that the most successful hedge fund managers are correct just over 50 percent of the time.
 It is difficult for most people to understand that profits can be made without very accurate forecasting ability, so it's understandable that even intelligent spectators like Mr. Rich would conclude that these ''experts'' should have known better.
 Charles Freifeld President AlphaMetrics Capital Management Brookline, Mass., April 11, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As Frank Rich pointed out, the people who caused the financial crisis did very well for themselves. They have no financial worries. They can pay for their medical care and their retirement, and their children are likely to inherit a bundle. Why should they feel the need to apologize?
 In the culture in which they flourished and continue to flourish, looking out for their less fortunate fellow citizens does not count for much. If it did, there would be a lot more public shaming going on.
 Jeffrey Brooks Baltimore, April 11, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Barack Obama talks a good game when he calls for ''a new era of responsibility,'' but without enforcement -- without pressing for criminal prosecution of those who knowingly created, sold and hyped what Warren Buffett called ''financial weapons of mass destruction'' -- no one will be held accountable, Wall Street will learn no lessons, obstructionist members of Congress will continue to play their game of ''rule or ruin'' and the American public will continue to be at risk.
 And no amount of health care coverage can inoculate us against the next financial meltdown.
 We on Main Street are still waiting for the new era of responsibility to begin.
 Holly Baker Rose Valley, Pa., April 12, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Alan Greenspan and Robert E. Rubin claim that they did not see the housing bubble coming. So how come I did? I'm a film editor, although I did go to a business school, and I saw the impending train wreck.
 In 2005 and 2006 I repeatedly got phone calls urging me to refinance my mortgage. When I told the callers that I had a plain vanilla 5.75 percent, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, they exuberantly proclaimed that they could offer me something much better, usually starting at 2 percent or less.
 My standard reply was, ''Great, I'll take a 2 percent, 30-year fixed; sign me up!'' That's when they would say, ''Oh no, sir, it is an adjustable rate,'' at which point I would call them thieves and liars and hang up.
 I knew that many unsuspecting people would fall for this ploy, however, and sadly my prediction was spot on. Where are my big bucks for being prescient?

HEADLINE: Britain Prepares for Its First Campaign TV Debates

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- When Prime Minister Gordon Brown was asked in a television interview last fall whether he would agree to televised debates in the 2010 general election -- breaking a taboo that has lasted in Britain since the dawn of the television age -- he vacillated.
 As the interviewer, Adam Boulton of Sky News, badgered him -- ''When is the time for it? When? Where?'' -- Mr. Brown buttoned his jacket and then, grim-faced, stormed clumsily off the set with his microphone cable still attached. 
 The scene underscored Mr. Brown's reputation among Downing Street aides for ill-tempered outbursts, usually well out of view of the TV cameras. But it also reflected a battle then raging in the prime minister's inner circle on an issue many see as a potential Waterloo for Mr. Brown, who has a penchant for leaden, statistics-laden lectures that do not make for compelling television.
 On Thursday evening, Mr. Brown and his two principal opponents -- David Cameron of the Conservatives and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats -- will meet in Manchester for the first of three televised debates on successive Thursday evenings before the May 6 vote. Both opponents are nearly a generation younger than the 59-year-old prime minister and widely judged to be more telegenic, as well as more nimble debaters.
 Political pundits, not to mention the parties and their leaders, are hoping the debates will inject pizazz into an election campaign, now a week into its 30-day run, that has so far failed to generate much public enthusiasm. One poll, published on Wednesday by Populus, showed 42 percent of the electorate ''unconvinced'' by any of the parties, 32 percent hoping for a ''hung Parliament'' in which no party gains a majority, and many voters deeply confused as to which party was advocating which policy on the economy, health, education and other matters.
 In a week when all three parties published earnest but mostly turgid election manifestos, the latest polls showed a narrowing in the Conservatives' long-held lead over Labour. 
 Because many Conservative votes are concentrated in rural or suburban seats where the party has traditionally large majorities, a lead of 5 percentage points on election day would open the possibility of Labour, with a more widely dispersed vote, gaining more seats, and holding on to power.
 For Mr. Brown, the uncertain public mood represents a change from the situation he faced when he finally agreed to the televised debates. The decision was made in the late fall, when Labour was trailing by 15 percentage points and more in many polls, and Mr. Brown's most influential political adviser, Peter Mandelson, argued that the debates provided a potential, and perhaps the only, game-changer.
 The move was characteristic of the tactical maneuvers of Mr. Mandelson, called the Prince of Darkness by the British press for helping Tony Blair win the 1997 landslide that brought Labour to power. That year, with Mr. Blair sitting on a wide poll lead, he guided Mr. Blair out of a commitment to debate the Conservative prime minister, John Major.
 The switch followed a cardinal rule in British politics dating from the televised Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960, the first face-to-face encounter of its kind in a presidential election. For decades, British politicians seeking to avoid debates have argued sniffily that Britain did not need the ''High Noon'' drama of a TV showdown.
 ''If we aren't careful, you know, we'll get a sort of 'Top of the Pops' contest,'' said Alec Douglas-Home, Conservative prime minister in 1964, dismissing a debate challenge from Labour's Harold Wilson. Mr. Wilson won that election, only to reject a challenge in 1970 from Edward Heath, who led the Conservatives to victory that year.
 And so it went. ''Personally, I believe that issues and policies decide elections, not personalities,'' Margaret Thatcher said in 1979, rejecting a debate with the Labour prime minister, James Callaghan. ''We should stick to that approach.''
 Once Mr. Brown agreed to debates for the current election, the parties spent months debating the rules with three television networks: Sky, the BBC and ITV. With the parties sensing potential disaster as much as opportunity, they drew up an entangling, 79-point set of protocols that broadcasters fear will strip the exchanges of spontaneity and possibly kill viewer enthusiasm for the whole idea of debates.
 Questions will be put in writing by a studio audience of 200, its composition carefully vetted to represent a balance of political opinions; a panel of journalists will then choose which questions are to be asked.
 Rules will prohibit clapping, cheering or booing, suggesting that the leaders' remarks may be met with an awkward silence. Each party will have a hot line to network producers to challenge, as the debates proceed, anything it thinks puts its candidate at a disadvantage, whether moderators' decisions, camera angles or questions.
 Lessons from American presidential debates have loomed large. Behind the scenes, American political consultants have played a central role in tutoring the party leaders. Anita Dunn, the communications director at the White House until last November, is advising Mr. Cameron, and Joel Benenson, who helped Mr. Obama prepare for the 2008 debates, is assisting Mr. Brown. 
 Neither of the Americans responded to e-mailed requests for interviews for this article.
 Party insiders have described the campaign teams poring over the tapes of some of the most memorable American debates, choosing passages that illustrate how makeup or the lack of it, gestures and facial expressions and, above all, the catchy articulation of a policy or opinion can carry the day. Richard Nixon's five o'clock shadow, Gerald Ford's saying there was no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, Ronald Reagan's ''There you go again'' and even the first President Bush's glancing impatiently at his watch, all have been played and replayed.
 Labour insiders say Mr. Brown's biggest problem has been curbing his loquaciousness for the 60-second limit set for answers to audience questions. Aides have said he knows he faces a tough challenge from Mr. Cameron, in particular, who has used his snappy debating skills to get the better of the prime minister in many of the weekly sessions of prime minister's questions in the House of Commons.
 ''It's by no means certain that his decision to agree to debate will turn out to have been the right one for Gordon Brown,'' Lance Price, who worked at Downing Street as a press spokesman for Mr. Blair, told the BBC. ''It may all go horribly wrong. But I think he felt he had nothing to lose.''

HEADLINE: Expiring Tax Cuts' Fate Has Parties Strategizing

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democrats for years have vowed to let the Bush administration's tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers expire as scheduled after this year, but election-year politics and the economy's fragility could complicate matters in Congress.
 One thing seems certain, both parties agree: The 2001 income tax cuts will be extended for everyone else -- that is, for the roughly 98 percent of households in which couples have less than $250,000 in annual income or individuals earn less than $200,000. 
 Even so, the White House and Democrats in Congress have given some thought to limiting an extension of the popular middle-class tax cuts to a year or two in the hope that they can overhaul the tax code in the meantime. That also would have the effect, at least on paper, of making projected big deficits look smaller over the long run than if the tax cuts for the vast middle class were continued indefinitely -- an important political consideration when the nation's debt is building to what many economists consider dangerous levels.
 For all of the talk from President Obama and his party of ending the Bush tax cuts, letting that happen could be harder for some Democratic lawmakers from Republican-leaning districts or states. Republicans already are reviving what has sometimes proven an effective, if disputed, argument in the past: that rich taxpayers include many small businesses whose owners pay income taxes as individuals.
 The news this week that an influential group of economists is split over whether the recession actually is over also provides ammunition to Republicans who say that letting the tax rates for wealthy Americans revert to their pre-2001 levels would amount to a big tax increase that could endanger the recovery. 
 In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama called for repealing the tax cuts for the rich in 2010, a year before they would otherwise expire. But once in office, he quietly set aside that promise because of the recession, proposing to let them lapse in 2011 as the original law provided. Now, administration officials say, the economy is recovering enough that by next year higher taxes for the wealthiest households will not be an economic risk.
 The revenue stakes are huge, so huge that some economists and analysts have called for letting all the tax cuts expire after this year. Ending the tax cuts for the rich would bring additional revenues to the government of more than $678 billion through 2020, the administration has projected, while keeping in place the tax cuts for everyone else would mean forgoing more than $2 trillion in revenues during that time.
 This month's income tax filing deadline has drawn politicians' attention to the issue, which probably would have gotten much more of it before now but for the preoccupation in Congress and the White House with health insurance. Both parties acknowledge they are only now beginning to strategize.
 Representative Sander M. Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Democrats would be united in extending the tax cuts but not for the top earners.
 ''It's an issue of equity,'' Mr. Levin said. ''I think the last decade has been, by and large, a very, very profitable one for high-income families in general.''
 But, he added, ''for middle-income taxpayers it has been really a period of basic stagnation.'' 
 As for the Republicans, ''we want to extend them all. That's our position,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
 Mr. Gregg, in an interview, said the tax cuts had encouraged capital formation, economic activity and job growth, at least until the recession began in late 2007. ''Raising taxes, especially coming out of a recession, is going to do nothing but dampen economic growth,'' he said.
 Democrats say the debate is not likely to begin before summer in the House. While they would like to finish before the fall campaign season begins, the issue could snag in the Senate as many issues do, given rules that empower even a few opponents to block action at least for a time. 
 Yet Mr. Levin said ''the course was essentially set'' this year when President Obama signed what is known as the ''paygo law'' -- for pay as you go -- that requires Congress to offset the cost of any tax cuts or expansions of big entitlement programs like Medicare or Social Security with tax increases or spending cuts, to avoid adding to annual deficits. 
 Under the law, an extension of the middle-class tax cuts does not require offsetting savings. But an extension of tax cuts for the rich would. ''Repeal the health care bill for starters,'' Mr. Gregg proposed.
 The paygo law also poses a problem for Mr. Obama. He has proposed a 20 percent tax rate for affluent taxpayers' income from dividends and capital gains, to encourage investment. Without such action, the rates will be the same as for ordinary income, rising to 36 percent and 39.6 percent from 33 percent and 35 percent, respectively, back to the levels of the 1990s.
 To offset the cost of keeping the dividend and capital gains rates lower for upper-income Americans, Democratic supporters will have to propose a tax increase of some sort.
 Separate budget rules in the Senate explain why President George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans put an expiration date on their tax cuts in the first place. The rules require a supermajority vote to pass measures that would add to deficits after 10 years, and Mr. Bush did not have that much support.
 Democrats express confidence that Republicans will not kill a bill that benefits most Americans. But some worry that Republicans could delay action by pressing the argument that it would increase taxes for small businesses, discomfiting Democrats with re-election troubles and requiring some Republican votes for a supermajority.
 Already Democrats are countering that most small businesses would not be affected; government data show that 97 percent of individual tax returns with business income would not be hit by the top rates. But, some Democrats acknowledge, the Republicans' argument has proven politically potent in the past. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 17, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the scheduled expiration of tax cuts for wealthier taxpayers included several imprecise or incorrect references. If Congress does not change current law, the following tax rates will be in effect after this year:
 Tax rates for ordinary income in the top two brackets will be 36 percent and 39.6 percent. The top tax rates for dividends will be the same as for ordinary income. And the top tax rate for capital gains will be 20 percent.

HEADLINE: Extension Of Unemployment Benefits Advances

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Senate Democrats on Wednesday cleared the way for final approval of additional unemployment pay for out-of-work Americans who are exhausting their standard benefits. The Senate voted 60 to 40 to exempt the legislation from budget challenges and Democrats said they hoped to finish the now $18 billion measure as early as Thursday night. Senator George Voinovich of Ohio was the sole Republican to break ranks, joining Democrats and providing the crucial 60th vote. Democrats failed in their first attempt to waive the budget rules, coming up one vote short since Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, was away at a funeral. The Senate held the vote open Wednesday night to allow Mr. Leahy time to return and cast his vote.

HEADLINE: Immigrants In Arizona May Face New Curbs

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
While pressure increases on the Obama administration for a long-anticipated and much-promised overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, Arizona is moving ahead with anti-illegal-immigrant legislation widely considered among the most stringent in the states. It would hand the police in the state broad power under state law to check the legal status of people they reasonably suspect are illegal immigrants.
 The legislation was approved by Arizona's House of Representatives on Tuesday and is heading back to the Senate, which is expected to pass it and send it to Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican facing an election challenge from conservatives. Although she has not stated her position, people on both sides of the bill expect her to sign it. 
 The police would be authorized to arrest immigrants unable to show documents allowing them to be in the country and the legislation would leave drivers open to sanctions in some cases for knowingly transporting an illegal immigrant, even a relative. It expressly forbids cities from adopting ''sanctuary'' policies that restrict the police and public workers from immigration enforcement, though it was a matter of debate if any cities had such policies.
 The bill, hotly debated by police, business and faith groups, represents a step back from an earlier proposal that would have broadened the state's trespassing law to encompass being in the state illegally. But advocates for immigrants described it as a recipe for racial and ethnic profiling that is ripe for costly constitutional challenges and par for the course in a state where debate over immigration is as heated as the desert sun.
 It is ''the most anti-immigrant legislation the country has seen in a generation,'' said Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. ''Arizona has long been a laboratory for anti-immigrant experimentation, and its demagogue leaders have become folk heroes for white supremacists throughout the United States, but this bill ushers in a new chapter of disgrace for the state,'' he said.
 Muzaffar A. Christi, a lawyer and policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said Arizona would be the first state to allow the local police to determine a person's immigration status based solely on their ''reasonable suspicion'' that they were in the country illegally. No other state, he added, makes it a state crime not to carry an alien registration card or other immigration document, though federal law requires legal immigrants to do so.
 He said the Arizona law could face legal challenges. ''How can you 'reasonably believe' someone is an undocumented immigrant if you are a local cop?'' he said. ''Federal agents have training on that, but local cops don't know that.'' Supporters of the bill, which included a handful of Republicans who doubted its effectiveness but voted for it anyway, said it reflected frustration with a federal government that they believed had fallen short on revamping immigration law and securing the border. More people and drugs cross illegally into the United States through Arizona than any other state. 
 The chief sponsor of the legislation, State Senator Russell Pearce, said in an interview that he hoped that the legislation, and other measures, would send the message to illegal immigrants that they were not welcome in Arizona. ''That absolutely is what we are doing here,'' he said.
 He brushed aside concerns that immigrants would not cooperate with police investigations or report crime, noting that the law would allow officers not to ask about immigration status if it would hinder an investigation.
 State Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican, noted that the flow of illegal immigration might have slowed during the recession. But the problem remained a top concern of his constituents, he said, and the bill would give the police additional tools to root out people without authorization to be in the country. ''So when the new tsunami of illegal immigration comes, we will be ready for them,'' he added.
 The bill also serves as a reminder that, for all the back and forth in Washington, the states continue sewing a patchwork of legislation intended to answer local demands to confront illegal immigration.
 Since an effort to overhaul federal immigration law collapsed in 2007, immigration-related bills in the states have surged, with more immigration bills than ever posted last year, including efforts to restrict public services and encouraging more local police cooperation with federal authorities, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 If the bill was a rebuke to the Obama administration, it was also a tweak to Janet Napolitano, the former Arizona governor who is now secretary of homeland security and a key adviser to the administration on immigration. Ms. Napolitano, a Democrat, had a contentious relationship with the Republican sponsors of the bill and had vetoed similar legislation as governor.
 Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for Ms. Napolitano, declined to comment directly on the merits of the bill but defended federal enforcement of immigration law and border security. He said that the government concentrated on ''smart, effective immigration enforcement'' focused on removing illegal immigrants who committed crimes, and that it had bolstered border security.
 ''D.H.S. has replaced old policies that merely looked tough with new policies that remove convicted criminals and make our streets safer,'' he said.
 Immigration remains a potent issue in Arizona; during debate over the bill on Tuesday, a few legislators invoked the killing of a rancher at the border that the police theorized was related to smuggling. Governor Brewer's campaign Web site features pictures of razor wire on a border fence, and she has sought to play up her toughness on immigration as she prepares for a challenge to a full term from candidates considered to be to the right of her.
 A spokesman for Ms. Brewer said she would not take a position until the bill arrived on her desk.
 Some Republicans called the bill flawed and promised to fix it later, but they supported it as a step forward. ''This is not a comprehensive solution,'' Kirk Adams, a Republican and the speaker of the House, said before casting his vote for it. ''That's not going to occur until the federal government takes up its responsibility to protect Arizona. But that doesn't mean we should wait until then.''

HEADLINE: Discontent's Demography: Who Backs the Tea Party

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Marjorie Connelly, Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Tea Party supporters are wealthier and more well-educated than the general public, and are no more or less afraid of falling into a lower socioeconomic class, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 The 18 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Tea Party supporters tend to be Republican, white, male, married and older than 45.
 They hold more conservative views on a range of issues than Republicans generally. They are also more likely to describe themselves as ''very conservative'' and President Obama as ''very liberal.'' 
 And while most Republicans say they are ''dissatisfied'' with Washington, Tea Party supporters are more likely to classify themselves as ''angry.'' 
 The Tea Party movement burst onto the scene a year ago in protest of the economic stimulus package, and its supporters have vowed to purge the Republican Party of officials they consider not sufficiently conservative and to block the Democratic agenda on the economy, the environment and health care. But the demographics and attitudes of those in the movement have been known largely anecdotally. The Times/CBS poll offers a detailed look at the profile and attitudes of those supporters. 
 Their responses are like the general public's in many ways. Most describe the amount they paid in taxes this year as ''fair.'' Most send their children to public schools. A plurality do not think Sarah Palin is qualified to be president, and, despite their push for smaller government, they think that Social Security and Medicare are worth the cost to taxpayers. They actually are just as likely as Americans as a whole to have returned their census forms, though some conservative leaders have urged a boycott.
 Tea Party supporters' fierce animosity toward Washington, and the president in particular, is rooted in deep pessimism about the direction of the country and the conviction that the policies of the Obama administration are disproportionately directed at helping the poor rather than the middle class or the rich.
 The overwhelming majority of supporters say Mr. Obama does not share the values most Americans live by and that he does not understand the problems of people like themselves. More than half say the policies of the administration favor the poor, and 25 percent think that the administration favors blacks over whites -- compared with 11 percent of the general public. 
 They are more likely than the general public, and Republicans, to say that too much has been made of the problems facing black people. 
 Asked what they are angry about, Tea Party supporters offered three main concerns: the recent health care overhaul, government spending and a feeling that their opinions are not represented in Washington.
 ''The only way they will stop the spending is to have a revolt on their hands,'' Elwin Thrasher, a 66-year-old semiretired lawyer in Florida, said in an interview after the poll. ''I'm sick and tired of them wasting money and doing what our founders never intended to be done with the federal government.''
 They are far more pessimistic than Americans in general about the economy. More than 90 percent of Tea Party supporters think the country is headed in the wrong direction, compared with about 60 percent of the general public. About 6 in 10 say ''America's best years are behind us'' when it comes to the availability of good jobs for American workers. 
 Nearly 9 in 10 disapprove of the job Mr. Obama is doing over all, and about the same percentage fault his handling of major issues: health care, the economy and the federal budget deficit. Ninety-two percent believe Mr. Obama is moving the country toward socialism, an opinion shared by more than half of the general public. 
 ''I just feel he's getting away from what America is,'' said Kathy Mayhugh, 67, a retired medical transcriber in Jacksonville. ''He's a socialist. And to tell you the truth, I think he's a Muslim and trying to head us in that direction, I don't care what he says. He's been in office over a year and can't find a church to go to. That doesn't say much for him.''
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted April 5 through April 12 with 1,580 adults. For the purposes of analysis, Tea Party supporters were oversampled, for a total of 881, and then weighted to their proper proportion in the poll. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults and for Tea Party supporters.
 Of the 18 percent of Americans who identified themselves as supporters, 20 percent, or 4 percent of the general public, said they had given money or attended a Tea Party event, or both. These activists were more likely than supporters generally to describe themselves as very conservative and had more negative views about the economy and Mr. Obama. They were more angry with Washington and intense in their desires for a smaller federal government and deficit. 
 Tea Party supporters over all are more likely than the general public to say their personal financial situation is fairly good or very good. But 55 percent are concerned that someone in their household will be out of a job in the next year. And more than two-thirds say the recession has been difficult or caused hardship and major life changes. Like most Americans, they think the most pressing problems facing the country today are the economy and jobs. 
 But while most Americans blame the Bush administration or Wall Street for the current state of the American economy, the greatest number of Tea Party supporters blame Congress. 
 They do not want a third party and say they usually or almost always vote Republican. The percentage holding a favorable opinion of former President George W. Bush, at 57 percent, almost exactly matches the percentage in the general public that holds an unfavorable view of him.
 Dee Close, a 47-year-old homemaker in Memphis, said she was worried about a ''drift'' in the country. ''Over the last three or four years, I've realized how immense that drift has been away from what made this country great,'' Ms. Close said. 
 Yet while the Tea Party supporters are more conservative than Republicans on some social issues, they do not want to focus on those issues: about 8 in 10 say that they are more concerned with economic issues, as is the general public.
 When talking about the Tea Party movement, the largest number of respondents said that the movement's goal should be reducing the size of government, more than cutting the budget deficit or lowering taxes.
 And nearly three-quarters of those who favor smaller government said they would prefer it even if it meant spending on domestic programs would be cut. 
 But in follow-up interviews, Tea Party supporters said they did not want to cut Medicare or Social Security -- the biggest domestic programs, suggesting instead a focus on ''waste.'' 
 Some defended being on Social Security while fighting big government by saying that since they had paid into the system, they deserved the benefits. 
 Others could not explain the contradiction.
 ''That's a conundrum, isn't it?'' asked Jodine White, 62, of Rocklin, Calif. ''I don't know what to say. Maybe I don't want smaller government. I guess I want smaller government and my Social Security.'' She added, ''I didn't look at it from the perspective of losing things I need. I think I've changed my mind.''

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says a Plan to Address the U.S. Deficit Could Keep Rates Down

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman said Wednesday that the government had to make ''difficult choices'' to address its gaping deficits and warned that ''postponing them will only make them more difficult.'' 
 The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that a credible plan for reining in federal deficits could help lower long-term interest rates. ''Although sizable deficits are unavoidable in the near term, maintaining the confidence of the public and financial markets requires that policy makers move decisively to set the federal budget on a trajectory toward sustainable fiscal balance,'' he said. 
 In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Bernanke said that a moderate recovery had begun, but that it would take ''a significant amount of time'' to restore the 8.5 million jobs lost in the last two years. Of particular concern, he said, was that 44 percent of the unemployed in March had been jobless for at least six months.
 Inflation, the other side of Mr. Bernanke's mandate as Fed chairman, remains low. Personal consumption spending, the index of inflation the Fed uses the most, has been rising at an annual rate of 1.25 percent. Excluding the more volatile prices of food and energy, core inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent. 
 Mr. Bernanke did not provide new details on the Fed's policy stance that short-term interest rates would remain near zero for ''an extended period.'' He said that time frame was contingent on high unemployment, subdued inflation and stable inflation expectations. 
 ''If those conditions cease to hold, and we anticipate changes in the outlook, then of course we will respond to that,'' he told the committee's chairwoman, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York.
 Mr. Bernanke's fiscal admonitions came a week after he gave a speech in Dallas warning that the country must prepare for the aging of the population. They could give momentum to the bipartisan fiscal commission created by President Obama. He did not specify whether he believed the government should raise taxes, make cuts to Social Security and other benefits programs, or do something else. 
 He did warn the nation's debts and deficits could at some point alarm investors and raise the government's borrowing costs. 
 ''At some point, the markets will make a judgment about, really, not our economic capacity but our political ability, our political will, to achieve longer-term sustainability,'' Mr. Bernanke told Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. ''At that point interest rates could go up and that would be, of course, a negative for economic growth and recovery.'' 
 Could it happen now? Mr. Bernanke replied, ''It's absolutely possible, certainly.'' 
 Later, he told Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, that ''right now the markets are essentially signaling a lot of confidence that our political system will deliver a sustainable trajectory of fiscal policy'' over the next few decades.
 ''If we don't do it, or we give a strong indication that we're not going to be able to do it,'' he warned, ''then it would not be something that we have to worry about in 2040; it could be something we have to worry about on Wednesday.''
 The deficit will start to ''recede somewhat'' over the next two years as the stimulus winds down and the recovery brings in more revenue, but is projected to remain around 4 to 5 percent of gross domestic product through 2020, Mr. Bernanke said. 
 Under a more gloomy situation -- one that assumes 60,000 American troops in overseas operations by 2015, discretionary spending growing at the rate of nominal gross domestic product, the extension of expiring tax cuts and an inflation-indexed alternative minimum tax -- the deficit could reach 9 percent of G.D.P. by 2020, he said. 
 Mr. Bernanke also addressed the politically heated issue of China's currency. He told Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, that ''most economists agree the Chinese currency is undervalued and has been used to promote a more export-oriented economy. I think it would be good for the Chinese to allow more flexibility in their exchange rate.'' 
 Letting its currency, the renminbi, appreciate would give China's central bank more flexibility in monetary policy and help stimulate domestic demand and consumption, Mr. Bernanke said.
 He also told Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, that the Fed would not try to monetize debts by increasing the money and credit supply and stimulating inflation. 
 ''Given that so many of our obligations are either short-term or indexed or are real obligations, such as medical obligations or Social Security obligations, which are indexed, it wouldn't have a substantial effect, even if there were a willingness to do that, which, of course, there is not,'' he said. ''Inflation is just not an answer, either for economic reasons and just because it wouldn't affect the balance very much.''
 Mr. Bernanke said the economy had begun to recover in the second half of 2009, as companies worked down excess inventories and expanded production. 
 Since the middle of last year, consumer spending has been rising at a rate of about 2.5 percent a year, and car sales picked up in March. Manufacturing in the eight months ending in February grew at an annual rate of 8 percent, in part because of stronger demand from foreign markets.
 But Mr. Bernanke also described ''significant restraints on the pace of the recovery.'' Sales of new and existing homes fell in January and February, the pace of housing starts is sluggish, and the commercial real estate market is still shrinking, he said. State and local governments, he added, have cut back on jobs and construction spending.
 Mr. Bernanke said that banks and financial markets had recovered since the 2008 crisis, in part because of the Fed's extraordinary lending programs and ''stress tests'' that bolstered investor confidence. 
 However, lending to households and businesses has continued to fall, a result of a sluggish demand and a fall in creditworthy borrowers, he said.

HEADLINE: White House and Democrats Join To Press Case on Financial Controls

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jackie Calmes, Sewell Chan and Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The White House and Democratic Congressional leaders said Wednesday that they would press forward with legislation to tighten regulation of the nation's financial system. Rebuffing Republican criticism, the Democrats effectively dared the minority party to side with Wall Street by opposing the measure. 
 After a contentious meeting at the White House between President Obama and Congressional leaders from both parties, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, accused Republicans of once again obstructing every effort by Democrats to govern. He expressed confidence that he could win the 60 votes needed to advance the bill. 
 ''This is the same stall we got on health care,'' Mr. Reid said after the meeting, standing on the driveway outside the West Wing. 
 Senior Democrats said the bill could reach the floor as soon as next week. And while Senate Republicans, if they remain united, could filibuster, Democrats said they were calculating that a number of Republicans -- especially those up for re-election -- would not cast a vote appearing to favor hedge funds and banks over average Americans. 
 It would take just one Republican to give Mr. Reid the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster and open debate. And Democrats were looking at numerous potential defectors, given public outrage over the return of huge Wall Street paydays. 
 They include the centrist Maine senators, Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe; two senators who are retiring after this year, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire; and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who helped draft the bill and voiced optimism on Wednesday that a deal could be reached. In addition, a number of Republicans facing re-election could find it hard to oppose the bill, including Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and John McCain of Arizona. 
 At the White House meeting, Mr. Obama urged Congressional leaders to reach a bipartisan deal. But Mr. Obama also pushed back forcefully against Republican criticism, as did other Democrats in floor speeches and news conferences at the Capitol. The White House also made clear that the president's interest in a bipartisan bill had its limits. 
 ''I am absolutely confident that the bill that emerges is going to be a bill that prevents bailouts. That's the goal,'' Mr. Obama said before the start of the meeting, directly answering assertions by the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that the bill would encourage, rather than prevent, future taxpayer bailouts of financial companies. As Mr. Obama spoke, Mr. McConnell sat impassively nearby in the Cabinet Room. 
 Later, in a particularly pointed statement, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said Mr. Obama would not let the bill be thrown off course. 
 ''The president reiterated his belief that we are open to ideas and eager to work with anyone who is willing to work with us regardless of party,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''He also made clear that bipartisanship should not be equated with an openness to lobbyists, loopholes and special interest carve outs and that he would be unwilling to negotiate on some key issues, and that he could not accept bad policy in pursuit of bipartisanship.'' 
 The legislation seeks to contain the risky practices that led to the financial collapse in 2008 and the worst recession since the Great Depression. It would give the Federal Reserve oversight of the largest and most interconnected financial institutions, those with at least $50 billion in assets. 
 And it would let the Treasury secretary -- with support from regulators and the approval of a panel of three bankruptcy judges -- take over any company that posed systemic risk to financial stability, and essentially force the company out of business.
 At a lengthy briefing at the White House, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said he was confident a bill would be approved. ''This is going to be the most sweeping set of reforms we have contemplated, as a country, since those put in place after the Great Depression,'' he said. ''We do not want to have the American taxpayer ever be in the position again where they're forced to choose between putting billions of dollars of taxpayers' money at risk or facing catastrophic collapse of the financial system.''
 Facing reporters outside the White House, Mr. McConnell repeated his assertion that the Senate bill would encourage bailouts by creating a $50 billion fund essentially to dismantle companies that are so big their failure would endanger the economy. 
 He demanded further negotiations. ''My message to the president, quite simply, was, 'Let's get back to the table,' '' he said. 
 But Mr. McConnell also struggled to answer accusations that Republicans were doing the bidding of big banks. Pressed by reporters to explain why major Wall Street companies were so strongly opposed to the legislation if it would guarantee future bailouts for them, Mr. McConnell did not answer directly but said that community banks in his home state of Kentucky also opposed the bill. 
 Asked directly if Republicans were acting on behalf of big banks, Mr. McConnell replied, ''I'd say that's inaccurate.'' 
 The Obama administration has not supported the creation of the $50 billion fund. Some administration officials and Republican lawmakers suggested they could easily agree on that issue, perhaps leading to a wider accord. 
 While the focus has been on how the bill will deal with failing companies, some officials said there were more serious disagreements over other complex issues in the legislation, including how to regulate complex financial instruments, particularly derivatives tied to commodities. 
 At his briefing, Mr. Geithner urged reporters to draw attention to the derivatives issue to help expose efforts ''to weaken, to exempt, to carve people out of those basic protections.'' 
 Senator Corker said Mr. McConnell was right to complain about ''some loopholes in this bill.'' But he also warned of overheated rhetoric. 
 ''Like what happened during the health care debate,'' Mr. Corker said on the Senate floor, ''some of it is sort of being blown out of proportion.'' Of the loopholes, he added, ''I think we could fix those in about five minutes.'' 
 Mr. Corker also urged that the $50 billion fund be eliminated. ''If people think this prefund is something that looks like a bailout, let's drop it,'' he said. ''Let's get rid of it. Let's end it.'' 
 Some Democrats said the Republicans were simply misrepresenting the legislation. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the lead sponsor of the bill, denounced Mr. McConnell's criticism in an angry floor speech. 
 ''It's a naked political strategy,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''The bill as drafted ends bailouts. Nothing could be more clear.''

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Profit Rises; Shares Soar

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
For big banks, the good news just keeps coming.
 After the banking industry's remarkable recovery in 2009, JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday kicked off what expected to be another season of robust results for the giants of American finance. 
 JPMorgan's latest results -- a first-quarter profit of $3.3 billion, even greater than analysts had expected -- not only underscored the industry's rapid revival after its worst crisis since the Depression but also hinted at the incipient recovery under way in the broader economy. The stock market jumped in response, with financial shares leading the way. 
 After two and a half years of sobering news, Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said business was picking up and there were strong signs that the world economy was stabilizing. Fewer borrowers, he noted, were starting to fall behind on their loans. 
 ''There is clear and broad-based improvement in the economic factors in the United States and around the world,'' Mr. Dimon said. ''This could be the makings of a good recovery.''
 Mr. Dimon's upbeat remarks came after hefty trading profits at JPMorgan's investment bank again helped offset a weaker performance at its Chase retail banking and credit card units. But, in a significant shift from recent quarters, JPMorgan set aside less money to cover future losses, suggesting its executives were growing more confident about the prospects for the economy. That move also helped fatten the bank's bottom line. 
 JPMorgan said its first-quarter income rose 55 percent from the comparable quarter a year earlier. Its earnings worked out to 74 cents a share, up from 40 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue on basis commonly used in banking was $28.2 billion, also exceeding forecasts. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast income of 64 cents a share on revenue of $26.5 billion. Stock in the company rose $1.86, or 4 percent, to $47.73 a share. 
 As one of the first banks to report this quarter, JPMorgan could set a benchmark for the rest of the industry. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup all report in the coming week. 
 Investors will be looking for signs that the banks' underlying businesses are improving. In JPMorgan's results, they saw trends showing that fewer consumers were falling behind on mortgage and credit card payments, and that more big corporations were seeking loans. 
 Large corporate America is in good shape, Mr. Dimon said. ''They have lots of money and access to capital markets.'' More qualified small-business customers are filing applications for new loans, as well, he said. 
 Still, Mr. Dimon said he would not consider restoring the dividend until he saw sustained improvement in the job market and fewer borrowers in trouble. He also said regulators must provide more clarity on how much capital banks would be required to hold. 
 Even as the country emerges from a deep recession, the job market has not yet rebounded. There are only tentative signs that home prices are near a bottom. And JPMorgan's problems are not yet over. 
 The bank set aside about $7 billion to cover future losses in its consumer businesses -- a large sum but about one-third less than in previous quarters. It has now stockpiled a total of $39 billion, or roughly 5.6 percent of loans. The bank set aside another $2.3 billion in litigation reserves as it deals with fierce legal fights over faulty mortgages and a pitched battle with Washington Mutual bondholders over that company's remnants. The company also booked about $1 billion in trading and securities-related gains. 
 JPMorgan has emerged from the crisis in better shape than most of its peers, which suffered bruising losses or a devastating blow to their reputation or, in many cases, both. No bank -- and no bank leader -- is showing more confidence on Wall Street or in Washington, where JPMorgan is aggressively fighting moves to create a separate consumer protection agency and seeking exemptions from derivatives rules. Even on Wednesday, Mr. Dimon grew agitated when asked about the ''bank fee'' proposed by the Obama administration. ''Let's not call it a bank fee, and call it what it is -- a punitive bank tax,'' he said bluntly. 
 The investment bank unit posted strong trading revenue after a first-quarter rally in the fixed-income markets. Profit of $2.47 billion was up 54 percent from a year ago, when the bank suffered big losses on loan write-offs. The investment bank set aside about 35 percent of first-quarter revenue to pay employees, perhaps setting a new lower threshold for the industry. 
 Chase's consumer businesses, however, are still losing money. And taking a page from the Citigroup playbook, Mr. Dimon divided his Chase retail banking business into two segments for reporting purposes: its existing operations, which will continue to grow; and a holding tank to run off its most troubled loans.
 Chase Retail Services, the mortgage and consumer banking unit, lost $131 million in the first quarter in contrast to a $474 million profit a year earlier, a troubling figure given the fat lending margins from low government borrowing costs. 
 Chase Card Services, the credit card unit, lost $303 million, a 45 percent improvement from the previous year. Mr. Dimon said the biggest improvement in delinquencies occurred in the credit card business and said the bank might begin taking down some of its reserves in the coming months. ''We hope to be profitable by the end of the year,'' he said, offering a somewhat more upbeat forecast than before. 
 Chase's corporate bank, meanwhile, booked a $390 million profit as it set aside fewer reserves for future losses. JPMorgan's asset management business and treasury services units also recorded small profits.

HEADLINE: A Revised Contract for America, Minus 'With' and Newt

BYLINE: By BERNIE BECKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Sixteen years after the Contract With America, say hello to the Contract From America.
 On Wednesday, some members of the Tea Party movement released a legislative agenda they want elected officials to follow. The 10 planks of the Contract From America -- heavy on fiscal restraint and limited government, light on social issues -- were chosen through an online ballot and unveiled the day before a round of Tea Party protests scheduled to be held across the country on April 15, Tax Day. 
 The contract, to use its own language, asks candidates to agree to: 1) protect the Constitution; 2) reject cap-and-trade regulation of climate-warming gases; 3) demand a balanced budget; 4) enact fundamental tax reform; 5) restore fiscal responsibility and constitutionally limited government in Washington; 6) end runaway government spending; 7) defund, repeal and replace government-run health care; 8) pass an ''all-of-the-above'' energy policy (referring, in part, to the exploration of domestic energy reserves); 9) stop the pork; and 10) stop the tax hikes. 
 The announcement of the list came after a seven-week contest that organizers said attracted more than 450,000 votes.
 The document clearly takes inspiration from the Contract With America, which Representative Newt Gingrich and fellow Republicans released on their way to an overwhelming victory in the 1994 midterm elections. But the writers of the Contract From America offered a distinction: they said their agenda had the imprint of everyday citizens every step of the way.
 Ryan Hecker, who organized the Contract From America, said the Republicans' 1994 proposals represented the nation's last intellectual economic conservative movement. The new list, he said, was ''created from the bottom up.''
 ''It was not crafted in Washington with the help of pollsters,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Epics and Erotica From a Grandfather of Anime

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Today's comic book artists and graphic novelists owe a huge debt of gratitude to Hokusai, Hiroshige and other Japanese artists who, with wonderful formal and technical ingenuity, illustrated tales of martial conflict, high seas adventure, travel and erotica, and sold them cheap in vast quantities to the pre-20th-century equivalents of manga and anime fans.
 At the Japan Society ''Graphic Heroes, Magic Monsters: Japanese Prints by Utagawa Kuniyoshi From the Arthur R. Miller Collection,'' an exhibition of richly colorful scenes by one of the most popular 19th-century masters of woodblock printing, shows us what the fuss was about. 
 As elegantly sumptuous as they are imaginatively extravagant, Kuniyoshi's greatest prints represent turbulent, epic visions of human protagonists battling supernatural beings on three-page spreads two and a half feet across, a format he invented. He also made portraits of attractive women in fashionable clothes, kabuki actors, comical montages of anthropomorphized cats and octopuses and antic, pornographic cartoons. Along with Hokusai and Hiroshige, he worked in a style known as ukiyo-e, or pictures of the floating world of leisure and luxury, which a rising population of middle-class hedonists avidly consumed. For sheer visual pleasure, this is an eminently gratifying show. 
 The exhibition was organized by Timothy Clark, head of the Japanese section of the British Museum, for the Royal Academy of Arts in London, where it appeared in 2009. The 130-plus prints in it are mostly from a collection of nearly 2,000 Kuniyoshi prints amassed by Arthur R. Miller, a lawyer and legal scholar who teaches at the New York University School of Law. A winner of two Emmy awards for hosting law-related television programs, Mr. Miller plans to donate his collection to the British Museum, where it is now on loan. 
 Devotees of Japanese pop culture may find Mr. Clark's catalog essay a little dry. Readers willing to plow through it will learn about a fascinating historical background. The essay focuses on censorship imposed in Japan on artists and entertainers in the 1840s, a time when laws were passed prohibiting conspicuous displays of wealth, irreverence or negativity toward authority and anything sexually provocative, from portraits of famous courtesans to pornography. With the United States and other nations pressing for open trade with Japan, it was a time of political anxiety and economic flux, which prompted conservative efforts to control perceived excesses of popular culture. 
 It also happened to be a time when Kuniyoshi was producing some of his most important work. Mr. Clark argues that the repressive strictures in place productively challenged Kuniyoshi's creative resourcefulness, forcing him to find ways to veil criticism of the shogunate allegorically. 
 An 1843 triptych measuring more than 30 inches across and called ''The Earth Spider Conjures Up Demons at the Mansion of Minamoto no Raiko'' depicts a visionary battle between two hordes of ghostly, comically misshapen devils looming in the immediate background as the ailing warrior Raiko lies in his sick bed, and his four bodyguards lounge in sumptuous robes in the foreground. 
 This strange and beautiful print became a cause celebre, as many interpreted it as a satire on the puritanical reforms of the day. The demons were thought to represent various sorts of decadence that the rules sought to limit, and the sick warrior was identified with the shogun who was chiefly responsible for the laws. Whether that was Kuniyoshi's intended meaning there's no telling, but when the print started to be acclaimed as a political critique, his frightened publisher withdrew it from circulation and planed down the blocks it was made from. The authorities evidently thought the image was a political critique; they jailed and fined an artist and a publisher who issued their own pirated version of Kuniyoshi's print.
 The curious thing about all this is that the image itself is so inexplicit. That the print might have meant something different than what was widely believed, however, was not so much at issue. Referring to controversy over another popular Kuniyoshi print not in the show, Mr. Clark writes, ''As with the Earth Spider triptych, the authorities were alarmed not only by the question of who was 'really' represented, but also by the generally unsettling effect of the 'false rumors' (fuhyo) the image generated.'' In other words, the authorities and the artists were at odds about an issue as old as Plato: From the ruler's perspective, the problem with art is that it incites irrational passions. Artistic imagination per se -- regardless of the politics it favors -- stirs people up and causes trouble. Imagine how horrified the authorities would be by today's almost completely unregulated visual culture in Japan and the rest of the modern capitalistic world.
 The puritanical laws didn't stop Kuniyoshi from producing some 10,000 prints by the time he died in his mid-60s in 1861, many of them technically virtuosic and flat-out gorgeous. The 1837 image of a naked, red-skinned boy wrestling a carp bigger than himself under a waterfall with a seemingly translucent curtain of liquid falling over the big fish, and a blizzard of little white bubbles dotting the whole is as exciting for its technical merit as for its mythic vision. A triptych from 1845-46, in which a giant, spectral skeleton conjured by an evil princess looms over a pair of battling, resplendently dressed warriors, and another from the same year showing the muscular hero Benkei dragging a giant bell up the slopes of Mount Hiei, are marvels of draftsmanship and fantastic visual storytelling.
 Considering the terrific imagination animating these and many other works in the exhibition, we may ask ourselves: What might Kuniyoshi have wrought had he been free to do whatever he wanted? 
 ''Graphic Heroes, Magic Monsters: Japanese Prints by Utagawa Kuniyoshi From the Arthur R. Miller Collection'' continues through June 13 at the Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan; (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org.

HEADLINE: Central Bank In Europe Sees a Crisis Returning

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
The European Central Bank warned Thursday that a resurgence of enormous trade imbalances and growing government debt were creating a volatile mix that could ignite new economic turmoil.
 ''We may already have entered into the next phase of the crisis: a sovereign debt crisis following on the financial and economic crisis,'' Jurgen Stark, a member of the central bank's executive board, said Thursday in remarks prepared for delivery in Washington.
 Mr. Stark's comments echoed warnings in the central bank's monthly bulletin, released Thursday, that said China and other developing countries were likely to again generate huge trade surpluses while the United States and other wealthy countries piled up trade deficits. 
 ''The stakes are high to prevent a disorderly adjustment in the future that would be costly to all economies,'' the central bank said.
 Separately, a group representing global banks has expressed concern that the Group of 20 industrialized and developing countries was not following through on promises to create a more robust world financial system.
 ''The spirit of unity in addressing global challenges may be waning,'' Charles Dallara, managing director of the banking group, the Institute of International Finance, said in a letter addressed to G-20 leaders before they meet next week in Washington. 
 The institute is an association of financial institutions, with more than 390 members in more than 70 countries. It called on G-20 officials to renew their commitment to make the regulatory changes outlined at their summit meeting in Pittsburgh in September 2009.
 In bond markets, investors demanded higher premiums for Greek government debt as they came to believe a European rescue plan for the country was likely to provide only temporary relief.
 The Greek bailout and the central bank's decision to ease rules on the collateral it will accept for loans ''set a bad precedent for other euro area member states and make it more likely that the euro area degenerates into a zone of fiscal profligacy, currency weakness and higher inflationary pressures over time,'' Joachim Fels, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note.
 Mr. Fels went so far as to say there was an increased risk that Germany and other countries would eventually decide to secede from the euro zone and form their own, more stable currency union.
 The European Central Bank based its warning on indications that trade imbalances, which receded during the financial crisis, were returning as oil prices rose and trade regained momentum.
 The current account deficit in the United States, which had shrunk to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product last year from a 50-year high of 6 percent, is likely to rise again, the bank said.
 China's surplus, which had fallen to 6 percent of gross domestic product last year from 10 percent in 2006, is likely to increase.
 G-20 members have promised to address the imbalances, with exporting countries saying they will try to increase domestic demand and importing countries pledging to reduce government borrowing and increase private saving.
 William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of the Institute of International Finance's board and former senior vice chairman of Citigroup, emphasized the delicate balance between withdrawing economic stimulus too early and allowing budget deficits to expand for too long.
 ''Premature action on withdrawing stimulus, as we saw in the 1930s, can prolong the hardship of high unemployment, but delays in formulating strategies to address the large fiscal deficits can undermine confidence, generate market uncertainties and endanger growth prospects,'' Mr. Rhodes wrote. ''The markets have been clear already in expressing their concerns about fiscal sustainability.''
 Mr. Rhodes said that high unemployment was feeding pressures for trade and financial protectionism. ''It is important that the G-20 both move to roll back protectionist measures and complete outstanding free trade agreements,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: With a Lift From U.P.S., Shares Rise for a 6th Session

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
An encouraging earnings forecast from U.P.S. and stronger manufacturing figures gave the stock market its sixth straight session of gains. The rise was modest, and analysts said a slowdown in the market's upward push was overdue. 
 The Nasdaq composite index posted the biggest rise of major indexes ahead of an earnings report from Google. The Internet search company reported after the closing bell that its first-quarter profit rose 37 percent but its shares fell in electronic trading on concerns the company was not holding down costs. Google rose $6.30, or 1.1 percent, to $595.30, before the earnings news. In after-hours trading, the stock fell almost 5 percent. 
 The Dow rose 21.46, or 0.2 percent, to 11,144.57, its highest close since Sept. 19, 2008. The Dow has risen three out of every four days in the last two months but it has not gone up six straight days since mid-March. 
 The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 1.02, or 0.1 percent, to 1,211.67, while the Nasdaq rose 10.83, or 0.4 percent, to 2,515.69.
 Falling stocks narrowly outnumbered those that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.2 billion shares, compared with 1.1 billion Wednesday.
 The forecast from U.P.S. raised hopes that the economy was strengthening. The company increased its full-year earnings goal because of stronger international deliveries. As the world's largest shipping company, U.P.S.'s results are seen as an early indicator of overall business activity. U.P.S. rose $3.44, or 5.3 percent, to $68.89.
 The U.P.S. numbers and improved manufacturing reports from the Federal Reserve helped to offset some of the concern about the still weak job market.
 The Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly for a second straight week. First-time claims for jobless benefits rose by 24,000 to 484,000 last week, the highest level since late February. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast a drop. 
 The stock market has been churning steadily higher after major indexes hit 12-year lows in March 2009. Growing expectations for a recovery have been driving the climb. The increases in the last two months have been more subdued.
 Charles A. Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital in Pittsburgh, said the market's more consistent advance since February was welcome because it meant that investors were not becoming overly optimistic.
 ''There is a tremendous amount of skepticism about the market, and that's a good thing,'' he said.
 Bond prices rose, pushing their yields lower. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 7/32, to 98 10/32, while its yield fell to 3.83 percent from 3.86 percent late Wednesday.
 David A. Chalupnik, head of equities at First American Funds in Minneapolis, said investors continued to put money in stocks of companies poised to benefit from a sharp rebound in the economy, like technology and industrial businesses. Defensive stocks like health care providers and phone companies are lagging.
 He said the companies most tied to the winds of the economy that had cut costs more than others during the recession could rebound substantially. 
 ''As you go through earnings season here, it's going to be these companies that are going to put up the biggest surprises,'' he said.
 Citigroup fell 12 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $4.81 after trading as high as $5.07. It has not topped the $5 barrier since October.
 Yum Brands, the parent company of the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurant chains, rose to a new high after the company's first-quarter earnings topped expectations. Yum shares closed up $1.10, or 2.6 percent, to $42.78. 
 Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.5 percent, while Germany's DAX index and France's CAC-40 each rose 0.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock average gained 0.6 percent.

HEADLINE: 12 Days, 132 Films, 38 Countries

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Don't imagine that because its subject is 9/11, Alex Gibney's documentary ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' is merely the latest in a long list of depressing films about the aftermath of that catastrophe. ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' which exemplifies the loftiest ambitions of the Tribeca Film Festival, beginning its ninth year on Wednesday, is an utterly compelling (dare I say entertaining?) personal history lesson, filled with insights that come as little jolts. 
 Adapted from Lawrence Wright's 2007 one-man play and based on his book ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' the film offers what may be the definitive cinematic investigation of the cultural and historical roots on 9/11. 
 Because the festival, which runs through May 2, was born in the ashes of the World Trade Center as a community development project to revive the devastated economy of Lower Manhattan, you might say ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda'' is woven into Tribeca's DNA. 
 It is one of 85 features (about the same as last year) being shown in a festival whose programming runs from Hollywood razzle-dazzle to the most adventurous, marginally commercial world cinema. The big-time fireworks begin with the opening-night screening of ''Shrek Forever After,'' the fourth and final edition of that blockbuster franchise, shown in 3-D. For the closing-night film, ''Freakonomics'' (adapted from the best seller by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, who contribute to a blog at nytimes.com), to be released this year, Mr. Gibney is one of six contributing directors. His film, still untitled, about Eliot Spitzer is also being shown in Tribeca as a work in progress. 
 If this is the year of Alex Gibney, whose documentary about torture, ''Taxi to the Dark Side,'' won an Academy Award (and had its premiere at Tribeca in 2007), he is but one of many reputable filmmakers to be showing new work at the festival. ''Micmacs,'' a surreal exercise in high slapstick from Jean-Pierre Jeunet (''Amelie,'' ''Delicatessen''), follows a ragtag bunch of junkyard dealers as they engage in a comic David-and-Goliath battle with a weapons manufacturer. This whiz-bang comedy is a live-action ''Toy Story'' for grown-ups that channels the spirit of Buster Keaton. Filled with elaborate sight gags and contraptions worthy of Rube Goldberg, the film further establishes Mr. Jeunet as a genre unto himself, a sort of Gallic Tim Burton. Fatih Akin's frantic comedy ''Soul Kitchen'' is an engaging out-and-out farce about restaurants and real estate in Hamburg, made by the German-Turkish Mr. Akin, who achieved international recognition with the more dramatic ''Head On'' and ''The Edge of Heaven.'' Other artistic name brands include Neil Jordan (''Ondine''), Michael Winterbottom (''The Killer Inside Me'') and Nicole Holofcener (''Please Give''). All told, 38 countries are represented, including Britain (seven films), France (six), Ireland (four) and South Korea (three). 
 Overall the quality of films this year is the same as last: hit or miss. There is much that is interesting, little that is great. The Cannes Film Festival still draws the cream of world cinema; the Sundance and Toronto festivals attract the best American independent films.
 Two incisive documentary portraits -- ''Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work,'' directed by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, and Craig Teper's ''Vidal Sassoon The Movie'' -- upset conventional notions about the businesses of comedy and hairdressing. In ''A Piece of Work'' Ms. Rivers celebrates her 75th birthday and talks bluntly about aging, the rigors of her brutal profession and her compulsive drive to stay at the top of the comedy game and bankroll her extravagant lifestyle.
 The Sassoon film makes a credible case for the artistic importance of hairdressing, which Mr. Sassoon reinvented as a form of architectural design. Both the Rivers and Sassoon films illustrate that their subjects' sustained success is no accident: both are driven by a relentless, controlling perfectionism and workaholic personalities.
 But among the two dozen Tribeca films I've sampled, none is as revelatory as ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' a cinematically illustrated Spalding Gray-style monologue by Mr. Wright, which begins with his description of his personal connection to 9/11. 
 He was a screenwriter for the 1998 movie ''The Siege,'' which imagined a wave of terrorist bombings in New York after the secret abduction by the United States military of a suspected Islamic terrorist. As Mr. Wright points out, the spectacle of 9/11 made the attacks a horrifying real-life Hollywood blockbuster, and in the month after 9/11, he adds ruefully, '' 'The Siege' was the most rented movie in America, making me the first profiteer in the war on terror.'' 
 If there is a trend in this year's festival, it is that so many of its films blur the lines between fiction and documentary, some literally, others stylistically. The high resolution of movies shot on digital video is a major factor in the dissolving of forms into one another, as the changing and rapidly proliferating technology nudges filmmakers and actors alike toward a clinical ultrarealism.
 As big-ticket Hollywood movies increasingly embrace a cartoon aesthetic and draw back from dramatic realism with frankly phony computer-generated effects, smaller independent films are moving in to fill the gap. The more ambitious ones increasingly evoke elevated offshoots of reality television, which paradoxically is itself a form of fiction. 
 This confusion is evident in Tribeca's two major competitions for best world narrative film and best world documentary. In some cases, if you didn't know in advance, you couldn't tell which was which. 
 Following are capsule descriptions of some of the more intriguing films in both contests.
 World Narrative Film
 DOG POUND Directed by Kim Chapiron, the film examines the institutionalized brutality at a youth correctional center in Montana through the experiences of three teenage inmates. The film, cast with actual boys in detention, shows why it is almost impossible to avoid brutalization in an insular, punitive culture with a vicious pecking order that fosters rage. The horrors culminate with a rape, an accidental killing of an inmate by a guard and a full-scale riot. 
 PAJU The rewarding but complicated South Korean film directed by Park Chan-ok, jumps back and forth in time over eight years as it follows a guilt-ridden young man on the lam. Hiding out in the bleak title city near the North Korean border, he becomes involved in radical protests against forced gentrification and has complicated relationships with two sisters, one of whom disappears. 
 SNAP This Irish film directed by Carmel Winters, has a ferocious performance by Aisling O'Sullivan as the mother of a 15-year-old son who abducts a toddler and holds him captive. The movie unfolds as a mystery that begins with the mother, who has become a social pariah, telling her story to a documentary film crew. 
 WHEN WE LEAVE Written and directed Feo Aladag, the German film tells the harrowing story of an abused Turkish wife (Sibel Kekilli), who flees Istanbul with her 5-year-old son to stay with her family in Berlin. But in her father's house the same patriarchal rules apply. When she refuses to return to Turkey, her family rejects her, and she is forced to find refuge in a safe house. There is worse to come. 
 THE WHITE MEADOWS Filmed on the salt formations of Lake Urmia in Iran, the mystical, allegorical movie filmed in shades of white, follows an itinerant mariner who rows from island to island as he listens to people's secret sorrows and collects their tears in glass jars. Their woes metaphorically (but obliquely) parallel oppressive conditions in Iran. Written and directed by Mohammad Rasoulof, ''The White Meadows'' is the competition's most poetic film. 
 WILLIAM VINCENT Set in New York, the film tracks an solitary pickpocket (James Franco) who takes a job as courier for a drug dealer (Josh Lucas) and has an enigmatic flirtation with his girlfriend (Julianne Nicholson). Written and directed by Jay Anania, this nearly plotless poetic noir compares its characters to glowingly photographed exotic creatures in the natural world.
 World Documentary
 THE ARBOR Clio Barnard examines the unhappy life of the British playwright Andrea Dunbar, who died at 29 in 1990, and her relationship with her troubled daughter Lorraine. ''The Arbor'' is the nickname for the blighted housing complex in northern England where Ms. Dunbar grew up and where her plays were set. Audio interviews with Dunbar's family and neighbors are re-enacted by an array of excellent character actors.
 SONS OF PERDITION The sad documentary by Tyler Measom and Jennilyn Merten is a nightmarish real-life answer to the HBO series ''Big Love.'' Looking at the struggle to fit into society by teenagers who fled a fundamentalist Mormon sect, the FLDS Church in Colorado City, Ariz., led by the notorious Warren S. Jeffs, a polygamous self-appointed prophet now in prison for rape, the film shows young men trying to recover from their indoctrination into an insular subculture of forced marriages, mind control and ritual humiliation. 
 THE WOODMANS The parents and friends of Francesca Woodman, the posthumously famous photographer who committed suicide in 1981 when she was 22, remember her in C. Scott Willis's documentary. Because the parents, Betty and George Woodman, are also nationally known artists, the film touches on unhealed family wounds: most important, professional jealousy. 
 The above films are just a sampling of selections taken from an international film culture that is increasingly congested with serious, worthwhile movies shot on digital video. The more they are produced, the more crucial the role of adventurous festivals like Tribeca to serve as a clearinghouse for work that deserves an audience. The density of traffic on the digital highway is only likely to increase.

HEADLINE: Factories Roar Back to Life, Restocking Shelves as Demand Picks Up

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
An energetic rebound for manufacturers continued in March, a report showed on Thursday, bolstering hopes that the nation's factories could help lead the American economy out of its deep downturn. 
 Manufacturing increased 0.9 percent in March from the previous month, the Federal Reserve said. Over all, industrial production increased 0.1 percent.
 Robust demand in the United States and abroad for products like tractors and airplanes has energized factory production. In addition, businesses are rebuilding depleted inventories, helping strengthen output, and exports are increasing, particularly to Asia.
 Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance-MAPI, said the data showed that manufacturing was ''in the throes of an impressive recovery.''
 He cautioned, however, that ''a stable and steady manufacturing rebound will require a broader global rebound beyond the strength that is emanating from Asia.''
 As inventory restocking slows, the future of manufacturing will largely depend on demand from consumers. While consumer spending has improved, households face significant hurdles, including a stubbornly weak labor market and increased debt loads for many.
 Indeed, filings for first-time jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, resurrecting worries that businesses were still relying on layoffs to cut costs. Claims increased 24,000 last week, hitting 484,000; analysts had expected a 20,000 drop.
 Labor Department officials attributed the jump largely to administrative reasons, as states re-evaluated whether workers were qualified for extended benefits. 
 They noted that the longer-term trend of dwindling claims appeared to be intact and said the figures might be revised next week.
 But the spike revived worries that a turnaround for the labor market would be elusive. The unemployment rate is expected to remain near 10 percent through the end of the year, rising slightly as discouraged workers re-enter the labor force. And jobs are not being created fast enough to make a significant dent in the unemployment rate.
 ''Even after recent declines, the level of claims is higher than one would expect it to be if private nonfarm payrolls were really poised to begin sustained gains,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a consulting firm, wrote in a research note.
 Still, sectors like manufacturing have added jobs at a rapid clip, offering hope that the economy is on the cusp of sustained job creation.
 While manufacturing was strong in March, industrial production as a whole was tepid, largely because of a 6.4 percent drop in utilities output.
 Economists attributed that decline to unusual weather patterns. The winter months were unusually cold and March was unusually warm, leading utility output to soar and then drop significantly. 
 Mining output was robust, showing 2.3 percent growth. 
 The Fed's survey of New York State manufacturers showed strong growth in early April, with activity hovering near its highest levels in six years. Employment rose to its highest level in two years and new orders and shipments surged.

HEADLINE: Happily Settling for a More Modest Country Getaway

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
BUYERS looking for a country house in the Hudson Valley or the Catskills in New York State have settled on a more modest ideal: between $200,000 and $250,000 for a home on a few acres, with a picturesque town not too far away. 
 ''That's what I think of as the 'little black dress' of the second-home market,'' said David Knudsen, an agent with Catskills Buyers Agency in Sullivan County. ''During the peak of the market the price expectation for that house was probably around $300,000, plus or minus $25,000.''
 Although sellers have not all lowered their list prices to meet buyers' expectations, brokers estimate that the price for the typical weekend retreat has dropped at least 20 percent since its peak in 2007. That has lured some city dwellers to take the plunge on a getaway home, even as economic worries, snowstorms and tighter lending standards provided a chilling backdrop for the real estate market this winter. 
 Some common themes emerge among people who have recently bought houses west of the Hudson River for less than $250,000. These shoppers are paying close attention to property taxes and heating costs, are not particularly interested in renovating and want a second home that is a manageable size. The ease of researching homes and price trends on the Internet has also given shoppers a clear idea about what they expect to pay. 
 ''Buyers from the city are out in the market, but they want a great deal,'' Mr. Knudsen said of his clients from the New York City area. ''I think one of the big challenges we have right now is a wide gap between buyer expectations and seller expectations, unless there is some distress element on the seller side.''
 That distress element is often divorce, death or debt, but two years into a grim economy the motivating factor for a price reduction can also be time. 
 Kristine Petrik and Jodie Dawson, who live with their two children in Montclair, N.J., are negotiating on a four-bedroom farmhouse in Bethel, N.Y., that has been on the market for a year and a half. It was last listed for nearly 25 percent below the original asking price.
 Although buying a second home was more of a long-term plan, their financial adviser suggested they accelerate their timetable to take advantage of low prices and interest rates, so they started looking last fall and made an offer in February.
 ''We've been very pleasantly surprised,'' Ms. Dawson said. ''We didn't think we'd be able to afford anything that came with such amazing landscape and culture. It seemed like you could buy a piece of the country at any price point in all different areas.''
 Antonio Maciel and Marco Campello also had time on their side when they began thinking about buying a place to escape their crowded Manhattan apartment in 2007. But living with two young boys and Mr. Campello's mother, they had trouble finding a house that would satisfy everyone's priorities and tastes.
 ''I wanted a log cabin in the middle of the woods; Marco's mom wanted something that was newer construction,'' Mr. Maciel said. ''We needed a place that would feel like a country retreat but wasn't too isolated.''
 After a long search they closed in December on a four-bedroom house in Roscoe, N.Y., that had been on the market for more than two years. Although it is new construction, fewer houses were built nearby than the developer originally planned, preserving the country feel, and the price had been reduced nearly 25 percent.
 ''The more we looked, the more flexible we were in our price range, but also the more we saw prices coming down,'' Mr. Maciel said. ''We had expected prices to fall much more than they did, and maybe that's why it took us longer to buy.''
 Sullivan County, where both couples found their homes, tends to attract people who value acreage and affordability over the amenities offered in neighboring Ulster County's better-known towns, like Woodstock, Stone Ridge and Saugerties. Because Sullivan County is farther from New York City, its prices tend to be lower, though the county has more lakes than its neighbors, and waterfront properties can cost double or triple that $200,000 ideal.
 Delaware County, northwest of Sullivan and Ulster, is also on the more affordable end of the spectrum. Margaretville, Andes and Roxbury have become big second-home destinations in recent years, attracting people who want more land than they can afford closer to the city. Now weekenders willing to drive farther north and west to save money can find even better deals.
 ''Our average price is somewhere around $200,000,'' said Eric Wedemeyer, president of Coldwell Banker Timberland Properties, which has several offices in Delaware County. ''Three or four years ago it was probably closer to $250,000.''
 Kate Vasko and her husband, Lorenzo Radulescu, who live in Queens, bought a log home in Bovina Center, just north of Andes, last fall. The 900-square-foot house had been on the market for more than a year, so their offer -- less than $200,000 -- was accepted the day they submitted it. 
 ''For the same price we probably could've gotten more square footage, but this was brand new, and we just fell in love with the property,'' Ms. Vasko said. ''It's less developed than other areas.''
 Even in Ulster County prices have fallen roughly 20 percent from their peak. However, in all of these counties, the official data mixes more modest primary homes with the types of country getaways city dwellers buy, which are generally more expensive. Those vacation homes have also been slower to sell.
 Harris Safier, owner of Westwood Metes & Bounds Realty, said that although nearly the same number of homes sold in Ulster County in 2009 as in 2008, last year's numbers were shored up mostly by sales of primary homes.
 ''The $300,000 to $500,000 price range, which is the bulk of our dual-residence market, is very, very quiet,'' Mr. Safier said, adding that buyers are looking more in the $250,000 to $300,000 range now. 
 Deborah Ramos of Brooklyn managed to find a two-bedroom log home near Woodstock for less than that. After watching her investments shrink, she decided to cash out and began looking for a weekend retreat in Ulster County in October, finally signing a contract in February. Although she is paying close to the seller's asking price, she saw dozens of homes and said she considered her choice a good deal.
 ''In February I started to see properties in my price range that weren't in my price range a few months earlier,'' she said. ''I was trying to stay as close to $200,000 as I could, but if you went under that, the houses needed a lot of renovation.''
 Unlike many buyers Zohar and Jenifer Swaine, who live in Teaneck, N.J., were not deterred by the prospect of doing some work. In December, after searching for two years and finding prices near Woodstock higher than their budget allowed, the couple bought a four-bedroom fixer-upper close to town for $240,000.
 Although the house needs updating, its rustic charm includes a barn, a guest cabin and a three-seat outhouse, and Mr. Swaine has a gradual plan of attack in mind.
 ''Step 1 is to make the home livable,'' he said. ''Step 2 is to make a playground for our children. Step 3 is to build a little place to fish on the stream.'' 
 The way he and other buyers describe their new country retreats, it sounds as if the soft market, and some patience while searching, has offered the chance to fulfill a dream.
 ''We're glad that we held out for the house we really wanted,'' Mr. Swaine said. ''When you walk in, you just know.''

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Again Warns the Generic Maker Apotex About the Conditions at Its Plants

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Federal regulators have raised another red flag about the quality of generic drugs, sending a warning letter to a leading maker about manufacturing violations. 
 In the letter, posted on the Food and Drug Administration's Web site late Wednesday, the agency cited lapses at Apotex, Canada's biggest drug company, that included charred particles in a diabetes drug; contamination of an antihistamine, and drug cross-contamination that resulted from inadequate cleaning of manufacturing equipment. 
 The letter also said the company had failed to notify regulators in a timely fashion about such problems. 
 Apotex, with headquarters in Toronto, was the eighth-largest provider of generics in this country last year, with $879 million in American sales, according to IMS Health, an industry research firm that tracks drug sales. In 2009, American pharmacies filled 94 million prescriptions with Apotex medicines, IMS said.
 Apotex did not respond to a phone message or e-mail request on Thursday seeking comment about the letter.
 The F.D.A. action comes as another well-known generic maker, Ranbaxy, has also come under the agency's spotlight for manufacturing and quality control problems at two of its factories in India and one in Gloversville, N.Y.
 Those regulatory actions focus attention on generic quality at a time when Americans are increasingly turning to the medicines to save money on their prescription drugs. Generic drugs now account for 75 percent of the prescriptions filled in this country, according to the latest data from IMS.
 Concerns about the quality and effectiveness of generics have become prevalent enough among doctors and patients that the F.D.A. held a public advisory meeting this week to discuss the issue and explore whether additional regulation of the drugs would increase public confidence in the products. 
 But in an interview last month, Gary J. Buehler, an F.D.A. official and former director of the agency's office of generic drugs, said that the F.D.A. ensured that generic makers adhere to proper manufacturing standards and produce high-quality products. 
 ''Generic quality is good,'' Mr. Buehler said.
 He added that people should not judge the entire generic industry by a few isolated incidents.
 Indeed, the F.D.A. has periodically accused brand-name drug makers and generic makers of violating manufacturing or quality control standards. Typically, the companies have put the matters to rest by quickly correcting the problems to the agency's satisfaction.
 The new F.D.A. letter is unusual because it is the second warning to Apotex in less than a year. The current letter, dated March 29, cites problems found at an Apotex factory in Toronto during an inspection last summer. 
 Last June, the agency warned Apotex about similar issues arising from an earlier F.D.A. inspection of another facility in Etobicoke, Ontario, in late 2008.
 Taken together, the violations ''demonstrated a lack of adequate process controls and raised serious questions regarding your corporation's quality and production systems,'' agency officials wrote to Jack M. Kay, the president and chief operating officer of Apotex, in the March 29 letter. 
 ''This warning letter is being issued because of serious and repeat violations from the 2008 and 2009 inspections and because your response,'' the agency wrote, ''is inadequate and lacks sufficient corrective actions.'' 
 Since last August, the agency has prohibited drugs from the Etobicoke and Toronto sites from entering the United States, although Apotex has other plants it can ship from.
 From July 2007 to August 2009, Apotex voluntarily recalled all products associated with manufacturing concerns -- about 659 batches of various drugs -- in the United States, the F.D.A. said.
 Many Americans first heard the name Apotex in 2006 when the company briefly flooded the United States market with a generic substitute for the blood thinner Plavix before the name-brand drug's main patent had officially expired. 
 A federal judge later blocked Apotex from selling the generic until a court could rule on the patent's validity. The patent holders, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis, eventually won on appeal. 
 Apotex produces more than 300 kinds of generic drugs in about 4, 000 dosages and formats, according to the company's Web site. Apotex, which is privately held, has annual revenue of more than $1 billion Canadian, the Web site said.
 In a statement last September, Apotex said that the F.D.A.'s import ban applied to only two of the company's many factories and that the company was working with agency officials to resolve their concerns.
 ''We pride ourselves on being a leading maker of top-quality generic pharmaceuticals,'' Mr. Kay, the Apotex executive, said in the September statement. 
 But the F.D.A.'s recent letter said officials remained concerned about continuing manufacturing issues at Apotex.
 Until Apotex corrects the problems to the agency's satisfaction, regulators will recommend that the F.D.A. withhold approval for any new products listing Apotex as the manufacturer, the letter said.

HEADLINE: Waiving Oil Royalties

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Contrary to your April 12 editorial ''Royalty Rip-Off,'' Congress achieved its intended outcome when it passed the 1995 Deepwater Royalty Relief Act. 
 The goal: encourage oil and natural gas production in risky and prohibitively expensive Gulf of Mexico deepwater areas by providing temporary relief from royalties, thereby enhancing our energy security while creating jobs and spurring economic activity.
 The result: companies paid the government more than $3 billion for the leases, spent $37 billion to develop them, paid billions in production-related taxes, created thousands of jobs and pumped billions into the economy. This should be seen as a clear success.
 Some in Congress now wish to penalize companies that took the risks by changing the rules in the middle of the game, locking them out of future leases unless they agree to pay royalties that were legally waived in the 1995 law. This sends a counterproductive message to an industry that can and will play a critical role in the recovery of our economy.

HEADLINE: River Surfing, Rugby Bonding and Bicycle Soaring

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
The connection between the Tribeca Film Festival and the sports cable network ESPN, now four years old, has brought the premieres of movies like David Mamet's ''Redbelt'' and Spike Lee's ''Kobe Doin' Work'' to New York. This year the partnership is more noticeable than ever, as ESPN's ''30 for 30'' series of original documentaries has raised sports films to a new prominence.
 Of the seven films in the Tribeca/ESPN sports-film series, which begins on Thursday with ''The Two Escobars,'' three are part of the ''30 by 30'' schedule and will appear on television in the next few months (''The Two Escobars,'' ''Straight Outta L.A.'' and ''The Birth of Big Air''). But any fears that being in business with the home of ''Sports Center'' and ''Monday Night Football'' might compromise the festival's downtown bona fides would be misplaced. 
 Only one of the films, ''Straight Outta L.A.,'' about the connections between the Raiders football franchise and the emergence of gangster rap, deals directly with corporate, major-league American sports. Otherwise the subject matter is international, D.I.Y., hipster-friendly: river surfing in Germany, amateur rugby in Finland (northern Finland, no less), a walk to the North Pole, a flight off a big-air bike ramp.
 And ''Straight Outta L.A.,'' which was not screened for critics, has its own outsider credentials. In addition to being about the nexus of hip-hop and professional sports, it's the film-directing debut of the onetime gangster rapper Ice Cube, who as a member of N.W.A. had firsthand experience of the Raiders' Los Angeles heyday.
 It shares another trait with this year's festival selections: it uses the sports documentary as a vehicle to portray a culture in which athletics is the expression of a shared heritage or worldview. ''The Two Escobars,'' the most complex and ambitious of the films available for review, does this on the widest canvas. An examination of the lives and deaths of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar and the Colombian soccer player Andres Escobar, it's a portrait of Colombian society over the last three decades as seen through the lens of soccer.
 Most American sports fans probably know the story of Andres Escobar, a defender on the Colombian national team in 1994, who scored a goal into his own net during a crucial World Cup match with the United States and was later shot dead on the streets of Medellin. The film, directed by Jeff and Michael Zimbalist, tells a larger story: that Colombia's presence in the World Cup that year was a direct result of drug lords funneling some of their profits into that country's professional soccer system, which fueled a resurgence during the '80s and early '90s. Since the country began cracking down on traffickers after Andres Escobar's death, its team has not qualified for the World Cup. 
 The film posits that had Pablo not been killed in 1993, Andres (no relation) might not have died a year later. Pablo Escobar, a true soccer nut and a devoted patron of the game, this theory goes, would not have allowed the killing to take place. 
 On a much lighter note Bjorn Richie Lob's ''Keep Surfing'' is a look at a sports subculture -- one that's fascinating, frivolous or both -- that should be an audience favorite. Mr. Lob hangs out with the river surfers of Munich, a politely bohemian bunch who drop in on the standing waves created when streams pass over rapids or through obstructed channels. It's an oddly stately endeavor: the practitioners more or less surf in place, facing upstream and doing 360s and cutbacks across the face of the oncoming but stationary wave. 
 The complicated nature of modern male friendship is a theme latent in many of the films, and it comes to the forefront in Mika Ronkainen's ''Freetime Machos.'' The story of a mediocre rugby club in Oulu, the largest city in northern Finland, the film is really a merciless portrait of the fragility of Finnish manhood, under assault by independent women, economic recession (layoffs at Nokia!) and the mainstreaming of gay culture. The weekend warriors of the Oulu rugby club are reminiscent of the black-metal musicians in the recent Norwegian documentary ''Until the Light Takes Us'': both are responding to the erosion of their traditional Nordic cultures, one by burning down churches, the other by pulling down their pants on the team bus.
 One caveat: Mr. Ronkainen's film, described in press notes as a ''documentary-comedy-drama,'' feels a bit too good to be true. The camera always happens to capture the scenes he needs to make his points. If Christopher Guest (''Best in Show,'' ''Waiting for Guffman'') decided to make his next mock documentary about repressed Finnish rugby players, it might look a lot like ''Freetime Machos.'' 
 Two other films in the series examine the realm of extreme sport. Jeff Tremaine's ''Birth of Big Air'' is a biography of the pioneering freestyle BMX rider Mat Hoffman, with his impressive medical history (2 comas, 21 broken bones, 23 surgeries, 100-plus concussions), and with many hyperbolic quotations -- a constant of the extreme-sport genre -- that include this one from Mr. Hoffman's doctor: ''He has stretched the limits of what we've been able to do medically for him.''
 In ''Into the Cold'' the photographer Sebastian Copeland documents his own walk across the shrinking ice cap to the North Pole, noting signs of global warming along the way.
 Not screened for critics was the film that may be of most interest to New Yorkers: Paul Crowder and Jon Small's ''Last Play at Shea,'' which combines a history of the New York Mets with a history of one of their fans, Billy Joel, set to a soundtrack from Mr. Joel's final performances at Shea Stadium.

HEADLINE: A Newspaper Leaves Behind Its City Roots

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Robbie Brown contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- When The Atlanta Journal-Constitution moves into its new home next week, its employees will have access to free parking, more natural light and a wide variety of ''retail, service and dining options'' at Perimeter Mall, according to a memorandum from the newspaper's publisher, Michael Joseph.
 What The Atlanta Journal-Constitution will not have is a home in Atlanta. 
 The Journal-Constitution, the result of a 2001 merger of two newspapers that were each more than 100 years old, is moving to a former Macy's distribution center in Dunwoody, Ga. It will leave its downtown home near the courthouses, City Hall and the statue of Henry W. Grady (''Journalist, Orator, Patriot''), who was the managing editor of The Atlanta Constitution during Reconstruction and popularized the idea of an industrial ''new South.''
 Dunwoody is not only outside city limits, it is what Atlantans call O.T.P., or ''outside the perimeter,'' the freeway loop that, at least in psycho-geographical terms, delineates the transition from city to endless suburbia. 
 ''By leaving 72 Marietta Street,'' said Maria Saporta, who worked at the newspaper for 27 years before taking a buyout that was part of a major downsizing, ''The Atlanta Journal and Constitution is leaving Henry Grady behind in more ways than one.''
 Despite the sunny tone of the publisher's memorandum, the newspaper seems none too proud of the move. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Morrow, said that no employees would be made available for interviews and no access to the new building would be granted. 
 The newspaper has said that the move will save money without affecting news coverage. The 1972 downtown building, a bunkerish affair that looks like it was built to repel rioters, has been largely empty since several rounds of cuts decreased the newsroom staff by more than 50 percent and the printing operations were consolidated in Gwinnett County last year. 
 The building was once a hub of activity, a de rigueur stop for candidates on election nights and, in its nearby earlier incarnations, a place where civil rights leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went to exhort editorial boards. 
 The move is part of a desperate bid by Cox Newspapers, the owner, to salvage the newspaper's bottom line, which has been battered by the recession and the declining fortunes of the industry. In six months in 2009, the circulation fell 13.6 percent, more than any other American newspaper, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. 
 As part of the downsizing, the Journal-Constitution cut its delivery area from 145 counties to 20 and stopped publishing a stand-alone business section except on Sundays. In an article in Georgia Trend magazine, the managing editor, Bert Roughton, compared it to the Black Knight in the Monty Python movie who has all of his limbs cut off but insists that it is only a scratch.
 Critics feared that the newspaper was also abandoning one of its signature strengths, opinion writing, out of fear of offending conservative readers. The paper has won several Pulitzer Prizes for its columnists, most famously Ralph McGill, whose first-person essays broached the issue of segregation and helped mold Atlanta's reputation as a moderate, relatively peaceful city during the civil rights movement. 
 But last year the paper replaced another Pulitzer Prize-winner, Cynthia Tucker, then the editorial-page editor, with another editor who critics said was less liberal. (Ms. Tucker is still a columnist.) In October, during a close mayoral election, the newspaper announced that it would no longer endorse candidates, writing, ''We have heard from readers -- and we agree -- that you don't need us to tell you how to vote.''
 But the newspaper has continued to do large investigative projects, on subjects as varied as cheating on standardized tests, property tax assessments and public corruption. 
 ''It's gotten better, believe it or not,'' said Capt. Tim Norton of the Atlanta fire department, who reads the paper at the station house every day. ''There's a little more depth to the stories.''
 Jim Auchmutey, another veteran journalist who took a buyout, said the move was probably not traumatic for his former colleagues in comparison to losing more than half the staff. But he himself found it difficult. 
 ''It meant something to me that I was walking right past Henry Grady's statue,'' Mr. Auchmutey said. ''It meant something to me that we had been down there since the Civil War. I could feel all those ghosts. I know there's history in Dunwoody, too, but it's not the history of this newspaper.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 19, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The Atlanta Journal article on Friday, about The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's relocating outside the city, misstated the newspaper's decline in weekday circulation during a six-month period in 2009 and overstated the significance of that drop. Circulation was down 20 percent -- not 13.6 percent, which was the decline during a similar period in 2007-2008. And the six-month decline in 2009 was the largest circulation drop among major newspapers, not all newspapers. (The Journal-Constitution's weekday circulation is about 211,000.)

HEADLINE: A.M.D. Posts Profit as Sales Rise by 34%

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Advanced Micro Devices, the microprocessor maker, reported first-quarter sales on Thursday that beat analysts' predictions, adding to evidence that personal computer demand was increasing.
 Revenue rose 34 percent, to $1.57 billion. Analysts estimated $1.54 billion on average, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Net income was $257 million, in contrast to a loss of $416 million a year earlier. 
 A.M.D. and its larger rival, the Intel Corporation, are benefiting as PC sales pick up after slumping during the recession. Intel this week predicted second-quarter sales and profit that topped analysts' estimates, helped by demand for laptops and servers. Global PC shipments exceeded projections in the first quarter, rising 27 percent, the research firm Gartner said.
 ''They are benefiting from the good demand out there, but Intel benefited more with their new products and better average selling prices,'' said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities in San Francisco. 
 A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., reported its results after the close of market trading. In after-hours trading, its shares fell 51 cents, to $9.65.
 The company, which does not give specific forecasts, said it expected ''revenue to be down seasonally'' in the current period.
 The net income of 35 cents a share was in contrast to a loss of 66 cents a share a year earlier. The company booked a one-time $325 million gain related to an accounting change.
 Profit, excluding certain items, was $63 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter that ended March 27. Gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining after production costs are deducted, widened to 43 percent, from 35 percent a year earlier.
 ''The server market has come back, the mobile market has also come back,'' said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Raymond James and Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''We're at the early stages of an enterprise upgrade cycle.''
 A.M.D. is trying to turn around its finances after its 2006 acquisition of ATI Technologies increased debt. To lessen its spending requirements in an industry where new factories can cost more than $4 billion, A.M.D. spun off its plants into a joint venture with the government of Abu Dhabi.

HEADLINE: City Unemployment Rate Dropped to 10% in March

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate declined again in March, falling to 10 percent and lending support to the view that the recession caused by the financial crisis is winding down.
 The rate, which was 10.2 percent in February and as high as 10.5 percent late last year, is dropping as employers of many sorts have increased hiring, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
 All told, the city's private sector added almost 25,000 jobs in March, significantly more than the normal gain in the month, said James Brown, an economist with the department. 
 Hiring was especially strong in professional and business services, like advertising and management of computer systems, a large part of the city's economy that usually expands early in a recovery, Mr. Brown said. Employment agencies in the city now have more workers than they did a year ago, he added.
 ''We're definitely seeing a lift from an improving national economy,'' Mr. Brown said. But he was cautious about the future. ''One really strong month is a little early to be hanging out the sign that everything is onward and upward from here on in,'' he said.
 One continuing cause for worry is the persistent loss of jobs in the city's most lucrative fields, investment banking and securities trading. Companies in those businesses shed a few thousand more jobs in March, according to the state's numbers. The potential effects are much bigger, though, because the typical job on Wall Street pays about six times as much as the average job in the city outside of finance, said Rae D. Rosen, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 The number of unemployed people living in the city dipped below 400,000 for the first time in several months but remained near the record high. Another cause for hope was that the city's labor force -- the number of people either working or trying to find work -- grew last month. A growing labor force is a signal of optimism that the search for work will pay off, economists say.
 After adjusting for seasonal fluctuations in hiring and firing, Barbara Byrne Denham, a private economist, calculated that the city added almost 37,000 jobs in the first three months of the year. That gain has reduced the total loss of jobs since employment peaked in August 2008 to 147,600, said Ms. Denham, chief economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate investment services firm in Manhattan. 
 One surprise, according to Ms. Denham's numbers, was that the city's construction industry, which had been struggling, added more jobs than any other in March. The continued losses in the securities industry may be a result of consolidation, like Bank of America's takeover of Merrill Lynch, and the expiration of severance packages that kept laid-off Wall Street workers off the unemployment rolls, she said. 
 ''I think the warm weather in March induced some of the hiring, which may or may not be permanent,'' Ms. Denham said. 
 Statewide, the unemployment rate declined to 8.6 percent, from 8.8 percent, in February, remaining well below the national rate, as it has since the recession began at the end of 2007. The national unemployment rate held at 9.7 percent in March. 
 The number of unemployed residents of the state declined slightly, to 831,800 in March from 844,500 in February. But the number of New Yorkers collecting unemployment benefits remained high: more than 665,000 were collecting weekly benefits, with most of them having collected for more than half a year.

HEADLINE: Met Ponders Dearth of Blacks In Baseball

BYLINE: By DAVID WALDSTEIN

 BODY:
DENVER - When Gary Matthews Jr. was growing up at his father's side in ballparks around the National League, he saw role models everywhere. There was his father, of course, and teammates and opponents such as Bobby Bonds, Joe Morgan, Dusty Baker and Willie McCovey.
 But in the current Mets clubhouse, Matthews is the only player who can fill that role for young African-American Mets fans. That's because he is the only black player on the team, a vivid example of the diminishing participation of African-Americans in baseball. 
 Thursday was Jackie Robinson Day in Major League Baseball and Matthews and all his teammates wore No. 42 to honor the man who broke baseball's color line on April 15, 1947. Before he put the uniform on, Matthews reflected on the fact that significantly fewer African-Americans are playing baseball today than when his father played in the 1970s and '80s.
 ''It makes me sad,'' he said. ''I think about my experience growing up in a clubhouse and how many players there were in the clubhouse that looked like me. Aside from my father, these were my role models.''
 Matthews said he in no way feels the Mets deliberately limit the number of African-American players on their roster. Many teams have only one or two African-American players and the last two Mets managers - Willie Randolph and the incumbent Jerry Manuel - are both African-Americans.
 The issue, he said, is that in a sport that once provided the platform for Robinson's breakthrough, fewer African-American athletes are choosing to follow in his path.
 The reasons for the decline, Matthews said, are various and complicated.
 ''We could go on for days,'' he said. ''There's the economics, the cost of playing baseball, the equipment, paying for travel teams and personal coaches. A lot of families in the inner cities can't afford to spend that type of money.''
 Matthews also cited the fact that basketball and football have become more popular among African-American youngsters than baseball. He said that as a result, baseball is missing some of the flair, or ''spice,'' as he put it, that African-American players have brought to the game over the years, citing Willie Mays's basket catches as an example.
 ''All cultures bring something different to the game of baseball,'' he said. ''It could be Japan with the little hitches in the pitchers' windup, things like that. The African-American player, there is a charisma that he brings from his culture. That ingredient adds a little spice to the game. That little spice is missing in our game when we're not participating.''
 Matthews likes the tradition baseball has developed in recent years of giving all the players, and other people in uniform, the option to wear Robinson's number for one day a year. At the very least, he said, it provokes thought.
 ''There is going to be a kid sitting in the stands today who has no idea who Jackie Robinson is and he's going to ask his mother or father, 'Why is everybody wearing No. 42?''' Matthews said. ''And that father, that mother, is going to tell their son or daughter who Jackie Robinson was and why we are wearing 42 today. That, to me, is what this is about.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Portrait of the Tea Party Supporters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Discontent's Demography: Who Backs the Tea Party'' (front page, April 15) sheds some welcome light on the racially tinged and hypocritical tenets of this political movement. What we see here is a group of free lunchers who want less government spending as long as their own federal entitlements (Social Security and Medicare) are unaffected. 
 These antigovernment zealots fail to see how the last three decades of greedy excess and laissez-faire deregulation worsened the income inequality in our society and led directly to the recent financial debacle. Without the strong actions of the federal government in the last 18 months, we would now be mired in a second Great Depression.
 The Tea Party movement should be openly challenged and exposed as the obstacle to progress that it represents.
 Lloyd Binen Bayside, Queens, April 15, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I am happy to learn that only 18 percent of Americans support the Tea Party movement. I see no reason the Obama administration should ignore the wishes of 82 percent of the people and listen to the 18 percent who are Tea Party backers.
 Prakash Navare Succasunna, N.J., April 15, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I'd be curious to know why Tea Party activists showed no anger when President George W. Bush started two wars, passed tax cuts that went primarily to the wealthiest and then closed out his term by bailing out financial giants like American International Group and leading investment banks.
 For eight long years, Republican policies converted a federal surplus into a record deficit and sent America's economy into a tailspin. Democratic policies to transform health care and stimulate the economy, while adding to the deficit in the short term, are at least showing signs of improving the economy.
 Why show anger now?
 Mark Cassell Shaker Heights, Ohio, April 15, 2010
 To the Editor:
 President Obama got a favorable rating from only 7 percent of the mostly white Tea Party members polled. How much of the opposition is at least partly due to Mr. Obama's being black?
 No poll can tell us that; people won't admit to a pollster that they're biased. They may not even realize it when they are. But the question is relevant.
 The president and his policies can change over time, but Mr. Obama will always be black.
 Ernest F. Imhoff Baltimore, April 15, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Revised Contract for America, Minus 'With' and Newt'' (news article, April 15):
 The Tea Party's Contract From America includes ''defund, repeal and replace government-run health care.''
 Medicare, the veterans' health system and medical care for our military and their dependents make up a large part of the taxpayer-supported system.
 Do these flag-waving Americans really not know that most government-run health care benefits people like them, or are they assuming that their favorite programs will be protected?

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING MIDDLE EAST; Gaza: Hamas Executes 2 Palestinians for Collaboration

BYLINE: By FARES AKRAM

 BODY:
GAZA -- Hamas authorities on Thursday executed two Palestinians who were convicted in a Hamas military court of collaborating with Israel. The executions, carried out by a firing squad at dawn, were the first since the Islamic group Hamas seized control of Gaza after routing forces loyal to the president of the authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in 2007.
 The executions bypassed a requirement in Palestinian law that death sentences must be ratified by the Palestinian Authority president before being carried out. Hamas does not recognize Mr. Abbas's presidency and says that its government can take on the role of the president under the current circumstances. 
 Hamas officials refused to detail the circumstances of the executions, which were carried out without advance notice. Journalists were prevented from entering Al-Shifa hospital where the two bodies were sent.
 Ahmed Attallah, the chief of the military judiciary, said in a statement that Mohammed Ismail, 37, a civilian, and Nasser Abu Frih, 34, a policeman loyal to Mr. Abbas, had cooperated with Israel ''and aided it in killing several resistance fighters'' over the past decade.
 Last month, Fathi Hamad, the Hamas interior minister, said his government would soon begin executing people convicted of spying for Israel, regardless of the objections of human rights groups.
 Earlier this month the New York-based Human Rights Watchurged Hamas not to resort to executions, saying such killings were not only cruel, but also that Hamas military courts violated fair trial standards.
 Human Rights Watch cited the case of Mr. Ismail, saying that a lawyer who represented him said he had been sentenced to death partly on the basis of a confession despite evidence that it had been obtained under torture.
 In addition, the lawyer told Human Rights Watch that the high military court had exceeded its authority in Mr. Ismail's case by changing the sentence of life in prison that a lower court had given him. The high military court, which hears appeals, is supposed to only confirm or reject the lower court's sentences , the lawyer told Human Rights Watch.
 Human Rights Watch said the lawyer asked that his name not be published.
 The last executions in Gaza were carried out in 2005 when the Palestinian Authority was still in control of the coastal enclave. 
 Rights groups have also accused Hamas of the extrajudicial killing of dozens of rivals and suspected informers during Israel's three-week military campaign in Gaza that ended in early 2009.
 Also Thursday, Israel allowed some wood and aluminum into Gaza for the first time since it blockaded the area in 2007, a Palestinian official said. Israel has been under intense international pressure to ease the blockade, and while the shipments suggested at least a slight change, Israeli authorities were still not allowing more vital construction supplies like cement to cross the border. 
 Three trucks carrying aluminum and three with wood were allowed to enter Gaza, according to Ra'ed Fatouh, a coordinator for the Palestinian Authority's ministry of economy.
 He added that Israel had notified the Palestinian side that more truckloads of those construction materials would be allowed to enter Gaza in the coming days.
 Israel and Egypt have maintained a strict economic embargo on Gaza. Israel also refuses any direct contact with Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union. 
 Israel allows in limited supplies of basic goods like fuel, food and medicine, and recently lifted the ban on shoes, clothes and bottled water. It has kept out materials it says could be used for military purposes, like manufacturing rockets or building fortifications. 
 Mr. Fatouh said cement and steel were desperately needed for rebuilding houses and infrastructure destroyed during the Gaza war..

HEADLINE: In Call to Alter NASA, Obama Vows Renewed Space Program

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. -- Pointing to Mars and asteroids as destinations, President Obama on Thursday forcefully countered criticisms that he was trying to end the nation's human spaceflight program.
 This was the first time that the president had lent his personal political capital in an increasingly testy fight over the future of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
 ''The bottom line is, nobody is more committed to manned spaceflight, to human exploration of space than I am,'' he said in a speech to about 200 attendees of a White House-sponsored space conference here. 
 But he was unwavering in insisting that NASA must change in sending people into space. ''We've got to do it in a smart way,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and we can't just keep on doing the same old things we've been doing and thinking that's going to get us where we want to go.''
 Instead of earlier vague assurances by Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, and other administration officials that NASA would eventually venture beyond Earth orbit, Mr. Obama gave dates and destinations for astronauts. But the goals would be achieved long after he leaves office: a visit to an asteroid after 2025, reaching Mars by the mid-2030s.
 ''Step by step, we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do,'' Mr. Obama said. ''In short, 50 years after the creation of NASA, our goal is no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time.''
 Mr. Obama noted that President John F. Kennedy challenged Americans to land on the Moon in 1961 -- the year the current president was born. But the plan Mr. Obama laid out for now through the 2030s was unlike the Kennedy vision: It was a call for private industry to innovate its way to Mars, rather than a call for a national effort to demonstrate American predominance.
 Mr. Obama's budget request to Congress in February proposed a major shift for NASA: canceling the Constellation program, started five years ago to send astronauts back to the Moon, and turning to private companies for carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.
 Strikingly, Mr. Obama used the speech to blame his predecessors for lacking leadership on space policy and the critics of his own plan for failing to recognize that times have changed. NASA's budgets, he noted, have ''risen and fallen with the political winds.'' That appeared to be a shot at President George W. Bush, who announced a new plan for NASA after the Columbia disaster and barely mentioned space policy again for the rest of his presidency. And he argued that turning to private entrepreneurs would result in more space flights and more astronauts in orbit than the space plan he inherited.
 Some members of Congress, particularly those in states that are home to NASA centers working on Constellation, have objected to the change, and the speech did not sway those who have been most vociferously opposed.
 ''There's no concrete plan, no deadlines to make it happen,'' said Representative Pete Olson, Republican of Texas, whose district includes the Johnson Space Center. ''It didn't change my opinion at all.''
 Mr. Obama's speech contained few surprises as White House officials previewed it to reporters two days ago. 
 Among the small concessions to critics, Mr. Obama is now proposing to revive the Constellation's Orion crew capsule as a stripped-down version to use as a lifeboat for the space station.
 ''This Orion effort will be part of the technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Obama promised $40 million to help retrain workers in and around the Kennedy Space Center who will lose their jobs when the space shuttles are retired. He also stated that NASA would start developing a heavy-lift rocket by 2015, a promise that presumes the president's re-election in 2012.
 The tweaks appear to reflect political calculations. Florida and its 27 electoral votes are a likely key battleground in the next presidential election. On board Air Force One with the president on the flight to the Kennedy Space Center were two Democratic members of Congress from Florida: Senator Bill Nelson and Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, whose district includes the Kennedy Space Center.
 Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represents parts of Houston close to the Johnson Space Center, was one of the attendees. Mr. Olson, a Republican, did not receive an invitation to the conference.
 Whether appeals for loyalty from Democrats would succeed in gaining Congressional support is unclear. NASA has traditionally received strong support from both political parties, and the opposition to Mr. Obama's plans has also been bipartisan. 
 Ms. Kosmas, for example, is a co-sponsor of a bill to extend operations of the space shuttles, and Mr. Nelson has pushed for continued work on Constellation rockets as precursors to a heavy-lift rocket.
 ''I'm encouraged,'' Mr. Nelson said, although he said he would continue pushing to continue development of the Constellation rockets.
 Reviving Orion could mollify Lockheed Martin executives upset over the proposed cancellation. The Orion work is done largely at the Johnson Space Center and at Lockheed Martin facilities in Boulder, Colo.
 While using Orion as a space station lifeboat may be politically savvy, some space experts, particularly those associated with the Constellation program, said the economic and technical rationale for the decision eluded them. It would take about $8 billion to finish the development of the current incarnation of Orion; a simpler version would most likely still cost several billion dollars.
 ''In the end, this seems like an expensive proposition that makes simply continuing to use the Russians for crew rescue look like a bargain,'' Michael D. Griffin, the former NASA administrator who oversaw the creation of Constellation, wrote in an e-mail message. 
 Elon Musk, the chief executive of the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, cheered the president's speech and policy. He said the Dragon capsule that his company is developing could also serve as a lifeboat, and its design would also allow six-month stays at the station.

HEADLINE: President Signs Bill To Extend Jobless Aid

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress on Thursday approved legislation that would keep unemployment checks flowing to jobless Americans, and President Obama immediately signed it.
 After the Senate resolved a stubborn impasse, deciding the $18 billion cost of the measure could be added to the deficit, the House quickly followed with approval of the measure on a bipartisan vote of 289 to 112. 
 The measure, which would continue added unemployment benefits and other expired federal programs through May, will restore aid to thousands of Americans who had exhausted their benefits or whose eligibility was expiring. The legislation means that those out of work can receive up to 99 weeks of unemployment pay in some states. It will restore benefits to anyone who may have lost pay during a two-week interruption in the program.
 In the Senate, three Republicans joined Democrats in shutting off debate on the legislation that also continues health insurance subsidies for those out of work. In the House, 49 Republicans joined 240 Democrats in backing the measure. Joining Democrats in the vote of 59 to 38 in support of the bill were Republican Senators George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine. 
 Congressional Republicans argued that the spending cuts should be made in other federal programs to cover the costs of the measure, which Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, characterized as up to 17 months of unemployment ''courtesy of the federal taxpayer.''
 ''What unemployed workers really want are jobs and paychecks, not almost two years of unemployment checks and more debt for our country,'' he said.
 Democrats said that many out of work Americans were unable to find jobs and that delaying what for some is their sole income in a political fight over spending was unconscionable. They say the money should be treated as an emergency expense.
 ''Holding unemployed Americans, hundreds of thousands of them, hostage to score what some think may be political points I think is reprehensible,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan. 
 Democrats hope to use the next few weeks to negotiate legislation to provide the added unemployment aid and other benefits through the end of the year so that they can avoid what has become a recurring fight over the handling of the costs of the program. The legislation also provided temporary extension of the federal flood insurance program and averted a 21 percent cut in doctor fees paid by Medicare.

HEADLINE: Another Chance For Buyout Artists

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB, RICHARD BEALES and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
 The next $10 billion leveraged buyout may be just around the corner. Private equity barons have spent almost three years twiddling their thumbs with pint-size deals. The industry's last announced 11-figure buyout was Blackstone's $27 billion purchase of Hilton in July 2007. And the acquisition of IMS Health in November is the only leveraged buyout to exceed $5 billion since the crisis hit. Yet there appears to be scope to double that in the not-so-distant future.
 The money certainly has become available. In addition to dry powder held by the biggest private equity firms, banks are eager to lend again -- even without demand from collateralized loan obligations to stoke the buyouts. Bubble accoutrements, including prearranged financing packages and loans with fewer restrictions, have re-emerged to make deals easier and more tempting for buyout firms. Interest rates also remain near record lows, and fixed-income investors have rediscovered an appetite for risk. 
 Debt multiples are also swiftly on the rise. After surpassing 10 times Ebitda in the heady days of 2006, banks beat a hasty retreat. But they're again offering more than six times Ebitda. In return, they're requiring buyout firms to provide 40 percent of a leveraged buyout price as equity, more than during the earlier exuberance.
 Consider a hypothetical $10 billion deal using rough-and-ready figures. A private equity firm could borrow about $6 billion for a company with $1 billion of annual Ebitda and well under $1 billion of existing debt. To write the accompanying $4 billion equity check, buyout firms could team up -- in another replay from yesteryear -- or bring co-investors in. Then, of course, the buyout price would have to deliver a premium to the target company's market value.
 It's not hard to find a few plausible candidates. The online educator Apollo Group, the engineering group Fluor, the navigation technology maker Garmin, the discount retailer Ross Stores and the hard-drive manufacturer Western Digital are among firms that fit the bill, at least on paper. The $10 billion buyout may not become a regular occurrence again anytime soon. But what was recently unthinkable now looks in the realm of the possible again.
 U.S. Wary of Greece
 Greek debt suppliants are playing to thin houses in the United States. The target for a dollar-denominated bond sale by the euro zone's problem child was once $5 billion to $10 billion. That now looks like wishful thinking. A Greek official speaking to Dow Jones Newswires said $1 billion to $4 billion is more likely. Wariness by investors reflects the unsentimental reality of Greece's predicament.
 One blow to a bigger bond sale came from Pacific Investment Management, the bond fund firm run by Bill Gross. Pimco, as it is known, told Reuters this week that it would sit out the bond sale. With roughly $1 trillion of assets under management, the firm's vote carries serious weight.
 It is not surprising if American investors are unenthusiastic. A $45 billion euro zone and International Monetary Fund aid package is on the table for Greece -- but it hasn't been decided if or when to pull the trigger, and money hasn't yet changed hands. More talks are set for next week. So there's a sense of limbo, at least until Greece and its neighbors agree on what to do.
 American players may also be taking a cold view of Greece's finances, even allowing for the rescue package. Greece is carrying too much debt and running shortfalls it can't afford. The government has promised to reduce its deficit to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product this year. Hitting that target would be a start. Restoring trust in its numbers would be another step in the right direction. But both will take time.
 Of course, the air is heavy with political posturing, too. Some Greek officials might not mind if it appeared the country was struggling to raise debt commercially. That might accelerate or increase the help it gets from Europe and the I.M.F. And getting more details of the bailout would probably reduce the cost of borrowing. After all, two-year Greek euro-denominated bond spreads narrowed about 0.5 percentage points on Thursday amid optimism about the aid package.
 Yet while greater clarity might make American investors somewhat more receptive to a Greek offering, it won't solve the country's underlying problems. Overcoming those will be another marathon Greece needs to win.

 But the debate on Thursday night between the men contending to be prime minister after the May 6 general election -- the first televised election debate between party leaders in Britain -- offered few parallels to the moments that have swung American elections: no obvious gaffes, no memorable one-liners, little by way of humor, scarcely anything likely to be remembered as a decisive game-changer, at least in the closely balanced race between the two main parties, Labour and the Conservatives. 
 Instead, the line likely to be seen as the hallmark of an occasion mostly notable for its earnest though rather dull exchanges on issues from Britain's battered economy to popular unease over rising crime and immigration was the anodyne ''I agree with Nick,'' offered insistently, in differing words, by the two men who have the most realistic prospect of governing after voters cast their ballots -- Gordon Brown, the sitting prime minister and Labour Party leader, and David Cameron, leader of the opposition Conservatives.
 The reference was to Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, a left-of-center group stuck for years as a distant also-ran in British elections. Before the debate, Mr. Clegg was seen as the event's most likely beneficiary, barring a clunking or stellar performance by his two opponents, if only because equal billing in the debate represented a breakthrough for his party.
 Mr. Clegg, 43, seized the opportunity with a performance that matched his telegenic looks with astute attacks on Labour and the Conservatives. He was helped, too, by the eagerness of Mr. Brown and Mr. Cameron, each aware he may need the Liberal Democrats' support if his party fails to win a majority, to match each other in saying how much they identified with many of Mr. Clegg's remarks.
 The Liberal Democrats' leader marked his ground with the debate's opening words, when he referred to Mr. Brown and Mr. Cameron sardonically as ''those two,'' and went on to say Britain needed a ''new politics'' of honesty and transparency to break the stranglehold of Labour and the Conservatives. ''We can rise to the challenges if we say no to the two old parties, which have been playing pass-the-parcel for 65 years,'' he said.
 The debate in Manchester was a historic innovation for British politics, where sitting prime ministers and their opponents have avoided face-to-face debates. The debate, the first of three among the party leaders on successive Thursday nights, was seen as an opportunity for Mr. Brown or Mr. Cameron to break through the impasse and apathy that has settled on the election since Mr. Brown set the date last week. Polls have shown as much as a third of the electorate to be undecided, and many voters unenthusiastic about any of the three major parties.
 But the immediate reaction to the debate among political commentators and focus groups gathered by Britain's main broadcast networks was that neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Cameron posted a performance so strong or so weak that it was likely to shift polls that have shown a narrowing Conservative lead over Labour. 
 Instead, the plaudits went to Mr. Clegg, a virtual unknown in Britain until he was elected to Parliament in 2005. Commentators for the main TV networks said they saw him as the clear winner, and groups of undecided voters gathered by BBC and ITV, the commercial broadcaster that hosted the debate, agreed. 
 Even spin doctors fielded by Labour and the Conservatives after the debate, in one of the evening's many adaptations of American presidential practice, agreed Mr. Clegg had scored well. ''Clegg on style, Brown on substance,'' said Alan Johnson, the home secretary in Mr. Brown's cabinet. 
 While a Liberal Democrat victory is seen as farfetched, the debate could enhance Mr. Clegg's prospects of emerging as kingmaker. 
 Some commentators saw Mr. Brown as a sort of winner, too, simply by not clearly losing in exchanges with Mr. Cameron. Labour's fear had been that his grumpy, wonkish image might sink him in the debates. 
 In the event, he abided by his advisers' counsel to avoid pugnacity, coming across as almost congenial, though not always with Mr. Cameron, whom he interrupted often, notably on Conservative plans for budget cuts that Mr. Brown said would undermine Britain's ''front-line services'' in police services, health and education, as well as halting Labour's debt-driven economic recovery program. 
 ''Once again, the Conservatives are showing that they are a risk to the economy in this country,'' he said. 
 Mr. Cameron, too, had ghosts to confront in meeting Labour's portrayal of him and his party as elitist. He cited the fact that one of his two young children had enrolled in a state school, and he emphasized his support for Britain's government-financed health service, which cared for his 6-year-old son, Ivan, before he died from cerebral palsy last year. 
 He was candid, too, about the Conservatives' role in the Parliamentary expenses scandal that shook public confidence in the political process last year. ''Frankly, your politicians, all of us, let you down,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Recalling '95 Bombing, Clinton Sees Parallels

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Kate Zernike contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing approaching, former President Bill Clinton on Thursday drew parallels between the antigovernment tone that preceded that devastating attack and the political tumult of today, saying government critics must be mindful that angry words can stir violent actions.
 In advance of a symposium on Friday about the attack on the Oklahoma City federal building and its current relevance, Mr. Clinton, who was in his first term at the time of the bombing, warned that attempts to incite opposition by demonizing the government can provoke responses beyond what political figures intend. 
 ''There can be real consequences when what you say animates people who do things you would never do,'' Mr. Clinton said in an interview, saying that Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the Oklahoma City bombing, and those who assisted him, ''were profoundly alienated, disconnected people who bought into this militant antigovernment line.''
 The former president said the potential for stirring a violent response might be even greater now with the reach of the Internet and other common ways of communication that did not exist on April 19, 1995, when the building was struck.
 ''Because of the Internet, there is this vast echo chamber and our advocacy reaches into corners that never would have been possible before,'' said Mr. Clinton, who said political messages are now able to reach those who are both ''serious and seriously disturbed.'' He will be delivering the keynote address Friday at an event about the Oklahoma City attack being sponsored by the Center for American Progress Action Fund and the Democratic Leadership Council.
 Mr. Clinton pointed to remarks like those made Thursday by Representative Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota Republican, who when speaking at a Tea Party rally in Washington characterized the Obama administration and Democratic Congress as ''the gangster government.''
 ''They are not gangsters,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''They were elected. They are not doing anything they were not elected to do.''
 The pitched attacks by some Republicans and conservatives during the health care fight have drawn criticism as incendiary as have the use of terms and imagery like the placing of target cross hairs over the districts of vulnerable Democrats who backed health care. 
 Over the weekend of the health care vote, Congressional Democrats reported being subjected to racial and sexual slurs as they walked to the Capitol to vote. Recently, at least three people have been arrested on charges of making threats of violence against members of Congress of both parties, and Congressional offices have been vandalized.
 In response to the criticism, several conservative leaders say reports of threats, intimidation and violence are being overblown or were not true and were instead part of an effort to vilify and silence critics of the Democratic Congress and Obama administration. 
 In her remarks Thursday, Ms. Bachmann made light of the suggestion that antigovernment activists were angry.
 ''You look happy to me, you don't look angry,'' she told the crowd. ''That's because you get it. You are smart enough to get off your couch and do something.'' 
 Mr. Clinton said his intent was not to stifle debate or muzzle critics of the government but to encourage them to consider what repercussions could follow. He acknowledged that drawing the line between acceptable discourse and that which goes too far is difficult but that lawmakers and other officials should try.
 ''Have at it,'' he said. ''You can attack the politics. Criticize their policies. Don't demonize them, and don't say things that will encourage violent opposition.''
 In the period before the Oklahoma City bombing, there was a growing antigovernment sentiment being expressed through a militia movement and anger at government officials, some of it in the wake of the assault on the Branch Davidian Compound in Waco, Tex., on April 19, 1993. Mr. Clinton recalls that he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were characterized by Newt Gingrich, then the Republican Congressional leader, as the enemies of ordinary Americans.
 In a May 1995 commencement speech at Michigan State University, Mr. Clinton talked about the bombing and the role he believed efforts to portray the government and its workers as a threat played in the attack.
 ''It is one thing to believe we are over-regulated and to work to lessen the burden of regulation,'' he said at the time. ''It is quite another to slander our dedicated public servants, our brave police officers, even our rescue workers, who have been called a hostile army of occupation.''
 After the bombing, Mr. Clinton said he chose to no longer even use the term federal bureaucrat because he believed it had become a term used to demean and dehumanize federal workers.
 Mr. Clinton said the impact of political attacks could be dangerously amplified at the moment because of the economic upheaval that had left many Americans frightened and suffering. ''A lot of people are just raw,'' he said.
 He called America a nation born out of protests, and said that he had no interest in reducing productive civic dialogue.
 ''This is about holding our country together and having these debates,'' he said. ''The Republicans will have their chance in November.''
