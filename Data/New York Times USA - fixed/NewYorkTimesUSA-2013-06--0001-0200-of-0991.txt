HEADLINE: An Elizabethan Cyberwar

BYLINE: By JORDAN CHANDLER HIRSCH and SAM ADELSBERG. 
Jordan Chandler Hirsch, a former staff editor at Foreign Affairs, and Sam Adelsberg, a fellow at the Yale Information Society Project, are students at Yale Law School.

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- AS Barack Obama and China's president, Xi Jinping, prepare to meet in California next week, America's relations with China are feeling increasingly like the cold war -- especially when it comes to cybersecurity.
With the two countries accusing each other of breaking the old rules of the game, a new breed of ''cyberhawks'' on both sides are arguing for cold-war-like escalation that could turn low-level cyberconflict into total war. 
But treating today's Beijing like Brezhnev's Moscow distorts the nature of the threat and how Washington should respond to it.
In confronting today's cyberbattles, the United States should think less about Soviets and more about pirates. Indeed, today's cybercompetition is less like the cold war than the battle for the New World.
In the era after the discovery of the Americas, European states fought for mastery over the Atlantic. Much like the Internet today, the ocean then was a primary avenue for trade and communication that no country could cordon off.
At that time, the Spanish empire boasted a fearsome navy, but it could not dominate the seas. Poorer and weaker England tested Spain's might by encouraging and equipping would-be pirates to act on its behalf without official sanction. These semi-state-sponsored privateers robbed Spain of gold and pride as they raided ships off the coasts of the New World and Spain itself, enriching the English crown while augmenting its naval power. Spain's inability to attribute the attacks directly to England allowed Queen Elizabeth I to level the playing field in an arena lacking laws or customs.
Today's cyberbattles aren't so different.
Next week's summit takes place amid reports of increasingly sophisticated Chinese cyberespionage. Earlier this week, evidence surfaced that Chinese hackers had gained access to several top-secret Pentagon programs. That followed news that cyberunits believed to be linked to the Chinese Army have resumed attacks on American businesses and government agencies.
As tensions deepen, hawkish Chinese military leaders are paving the way for offensive war. A study by a RAND Corporation expert cited Chinese sources calling for pre-emptive cyberstrikes ''under the rubric of the rising Chinese strategy of xianfa zhiren, or 'gaining mastery before the enemy has struck.' '' And a recent paper found that Chinese military officials have contemplated using cyberweapons like Stuxnet, which the United States and Israel deployed against Iran's nuclear program, to target critical infrastructure.
American policy makers are beginning to view their cyberstruggle with China through a cold war lens. One Pentagon official recently said that while during the cold war America focused ''on the nuclear command centers around Moscow,'' today American leaders ''worry as much about the computer servers in Shanghai.''
Another senior official declared that ''the Cold War enforced norms, and the Soviets and the United States didn't go outside a set of boundaries.'' But, he argued, ''China is going outside those boundaries now.''
Among those who view these hostilities as the cold war redux, some are proposing a more strident response. Earlier this year, the United States military announced the formation of 13 units dedicated to offensive cyberstrikes and endorsed pre-emptive cyberattacks. And late last month, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former ambassador to China, and Dennis C. Blair, the former director of national intelligence, suggested allowing American companies to retaliate against Chinese hackers on their own.
This emergence of cyberhawks in both nations raises the odds of a hack's becoming a cyberwar. These voices could pressure both nations to treat any escalating cyberconflict as a latter-day Cuban missile crisis.
But the cold war model of a struggle with calibrated boundaries, clear rules, and the threat of mutual assured destruction simply doesn't fit cyberspace.
The first major difference is terrain. The United States and the Soviet Union fought for global influence, manning divisions here and infiltrating covert operatives there. The Internet is more fluid. Neither the United States nor China can slice cyberspace into the reassuring structure of spheres of influence. With no obvious borders for states to violate or defend, power in cyberspace is at once easier to exercise and harder to maintain, a battle of subtleties rather than hard-nosed deterrence.
There are also more players today. The United States and the Soviet Union were the world's unmatched nuclear powers. But in the cyberrealm, the United States and China stand only just ahead of other nations, hacker groups and individuals in their ability to inflict damage. And all of these actors can hide behind layers of networks and third parties, making it difficult to discover not only who attacked but also how and when. There will, in most cases, be plausible deniability. Even if American and Chinese policy makers wanted to manage the Web as carefully as their predecessors did the cold war, no working group could tame this instability.
With nations still navigating how to interact on the Web and arguments persisting about whether international law applies to the Internet, there are few established customs of cyberbehavior, legal or implicit. The United States should not expect China to follow the rules of a previous era. The norms of American-Soviet conflict, which themselves emerged out of years of gunpoint diplomacy, can't be grafted onto cyberspace.
If American policy makers continue to define the cyberstruggle between Washington and Beijing as a new cold war, they will not meet the challenge. Viewing China's actions through an obsolete lens will give them a distorted sense of its intentions. And it will limit American retaliation to the outmoded rules of a bygone battle.
If they must look to the past, they should heed the lessons of the 16th century, not the 20th. In 1588, the Spanish crown, in no small part due to its frustration with English piracy, resorted to massive retaliation, sending its armada to overthrow Queen Elizabeth. That move ended in disaster and an overwhelming English victory.
Instead of trying to beat back the New World instability of the Internet with an old playbook, American officials should embrace it. With the conflict placed in its proper perspective, policy makers could ratchet down the rhetoric and experiment with a new range of responses that go beyond condemnation but stop short of all-out cyberwar -- giving them the room to maneuver without approaching cyberconflict as a path to Defcon 1.
In these legally uncharted waters, only Elizabethan guile, not cold war brinkmanship, will steer Washington through the storm.

HEADLINE: To Compete, G.M. Alters A Sedan

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors introduced its revamped Chevrolet Malibu sedan on Friday -- just a year after it put out the latest version of the car.
It is unusual for a carmaker to make major changes to a new model so soon. But with the Malibu still lagging behind its competitors in the important midsize car category, G.M. is moving uncharacteristically fast to improve it.
G.M. has a lot riding on its success. The revamped Malibu, along with new pickup trucks coming this summer, is part of its effort to emerge from years of retrenching after its financial collapse and become a growth company again. 
''In the past, we would have defended it and justified it and waited for it to sell,'' Mark Reuss, head of G.M.'s North American operations, said of the Malibu at a news conference here on Friday to show off the new model. ''But we're not going to sit around and wait. We're going to react to the marketplace.''
That marketplace has been decidedly cool to the car, even after last year's revamping. Its sales have dropped nearly 12 percent from a year ago, even as G.M.'s overall sales in the United States are up about 10 percent.
G.M. has made some incremental gains this year in market share in the United States. In the first four months, it reported an 18.1 percent share, compared with 17.7 percent for the same period in 2012.
Better sales of the Malibu are considered essential to further bolstering share. To attract customers, a honeycomb-style grill was added to the front end, and the rear seats were redesigned for better comfort and more leg room. G.M. will also offer a more fuel-efficient engine that shuts down and saves gas when the car is stopped at a traffic light.
Analysts reserved judgment about the changes. ''We'll see how it does,'' said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at the auto research site Edmunds.com.
She said that despite improvements in other areas of the business, G.M. still had a lot to prove in the midsize car category, which accounts for about one out of every six vehicles sold in the country.
''G.M. needs to be much more competitive in this segment,'' Ms. Krebs said. ''It's still the biggest segment in the market, and they need to play stronger in it.''
Malibu sales have slipped considerably in recent years, particularly after work on a new version was suspended during G.M.'s bankruptcy. A fresh Malibu finally arrived in showrooms last year, powered by a new engine and sporting a better interior and more technology.
But consumers were not impressed. Despite the changes, sales fell further behind the Toyota Camry, which leads the midsize sedan segment, and the Honda Accord. And the Malibu fared poorly in a head-to-head comparison with the Ford Fusion, which has had a 25 percent increase in sales this year.
''We knew there were competitive pressures,'' Mr. Reuss said. ''And we knew we needed to get a better car out there.''
The new version goes on sale this fall. Until then, G.M. will try to generate interest in the current model with hefty rebates. The average Malibu incentive in April was the biggest in the midsize segment, at $3,793, compared with $592 for the Honda Accord and $1,946 for the Fusion, according to Edmunds.com.
Pre-bankruptcy, G.M. often relied on rebates to move unpopular cars. But Mr. Reuss said the company was committed to improving its products, so big incentives are unnecessary.
''We're trying to address the concerns of the customer,'' he said. ''We have got to hit home runs with everything we put out there.''
The rush to fix the Malibu reflects G.M.'s overall struggle to remake itself after its bankruptcy and $49.5 billion government bailout.
While the company contends it has made great strides with most of its new products, its financial performance has been spotty. Its net income in the first quarter declined 14 percent from a year earlier, and its North American profits significantly trail those of the Ford Motor Company, its smaller hometown rival.
But investors appear to see a brighter future ahead. G.M.'s stock recently hit $33 a share, the first time the company achieved the share price of its initial public offering in 2010.
The government, meanwhile, is in the process of selling off its remaining shares in G.M., which should help the company shed its nickname of ''Government Motors.''
Mr. Reuss said that in the past, G.M. would not have bothered to poll consumers about why they did not like the current Malibu.
But the days when G.M. would let a new model languish are over, he said.
''We are a company that lost the will to win during the bankruptcy,'' he said. ''We need to know that feeling of winning again.''
Industry analysts expect G.M. to report another slight gain in market share for the month of May, when the industry reports sales figures on Monday.
G.M.'s sales in the United States during May are expected to improve about 8 percent from last year, which would be a bit more than the overall market, according to the investment firm Sterne Agee.

HEADLINE: Brazilian Cement Producer Plans $4.8. Billion I.P.O.

BYLINE: By DAN HORCH

 BODY:
SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Brazil's largest cement producer, Votorantim Cimentos, is planning to raise as much as $4.8 billion in what would be one of the largest initial public offerings worldwide this year. 
The move is a positive sign for Brazil as the country's government and private sector have been trying to encourage more financing through the public markets.
The company filed a preliminary prospectus on Friday, saying it would offer up to 540 million units, priced at 16 to 19 reais a share. If all the units were sold at the maximum price, the company would raise 10.26 billion reais, or $4.8 billion.
After a weak 2012, in which only three Brazilian companies held I.P.O.'s, the country's capital markets are recovering. Six public offerings have been held in Brazil in 2013. According to Thomson Reuters, the largest global I.P.O. was also in Brazil, when the insurance giant BB Seguridade raised $5.74 billion at the end of April. If successful, Votorantim Cimentos's public offering would rank as the second-largest globally so far this year.
Votorantim Cimentos's units will be offered on both the BM&F Bovespa stock exchange in São Paulo and on the New York Stock Exchange, with each unit representing one common share and two preferred shares. The pricing will be announced June 19 and trading should begin June 20.
Itaú BBA, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Securities, Credit Suisse, BTG Pactual, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Banco Bradesco BBI, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Banco do Brasil and Banco Votorantim are underwriting the offering.
According to the prospectus filed with the S.E.C., the company will use 45 percent of the money raised to finance its growth and potential acquisitions, in Brazil and abroad.
Votorantim Cimentos has operations in 20 countries, including the United States, but the vast majority of its business is in Brazil, whose booming real estate and construction sectors have benefited the company.
This success has come despite economic weakness in Brazil, where inflation is forecast at nearly 6 percent and the economy only grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the first quarter.
But after the drought of public offerings in 2012, investor appetite appears strong for Brazilian companies, especially ones that have dominant positions in relatively strong sectors of the economy.
Votorantim Cimentos will be the only Brazilian cement producer traded on the stock market, so its shares may prove attractive to investors eager to participate in the sector. The company is a subsidiary of Votorantim Industrial, one of Brazil's largest conglomerates, which had $11.5 billion in revenue last year.
Votorantim Industrial's other operations include steel and other metals, cellulose, agriculture, energy, and even finance, but Votorantim Cimentos is one of the crown jewels, responsible for $4.7 billion in revenue.
Like many Latin American companies, Votorantim Industrial is controlled by its founding family. Its chairman, Antônio Ermírio de Moraes, is worth an estimated $12.7 billion. (That makes him the 74th richest person in the world and the third richest in Brazil, according to Forbes magazine.)
Even after this I.P.O., Votorantim Industrial and Mr. Ermírio de Moraes should continue to own enough shares to maintain control of Votorantim Cimentos.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Only Pattern That Matters

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at The BAM Alliance. His book, ''The Behavior Gap,'' was published this year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog.
A few weeks ago, I stumbled on some research by David J. Leinweber at Caltech. Apparently, he's figured out how to predict the stock market using just three variables: 
1) Butter production in the United States and Bangladesh2) Sheep populations in the United States and Bangladesh3) Cheese production in the United States
Statistically speaking, those three variables predicted 99 percent of the stock market's movement. Imagine what you'll be able to do with that information.
There's only one problem. The joke is on us.
In our very human pursuit of looking for patterns, we start seeing things that aren't really there. And as Dr. Leinweber highlighted in his study, we will mine the data until we see what we think is a pattern. We think if something happened a certain way in the past, then surely it will continue into the future. We start to believe, we want to believe, that this pattern will have predictive value.
Consider what's going on in the stock market. The bubble watchers are convinced that they've identified a pattern from the past that tells us something about the future. And they even have charts and numbers to back up their pattern.
One of my current favorites compares the Nasdaq in 1999 and 2000 to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in 2013. When you overlay the charts, they match perfectly. Imagine that. So, of course, we must be headed to an 80 percent decline. If you look a little closer, however, you'll see the scales aren't quite right. But it makes a fantastic visual if you're looking for a pattern.
Then there's the S.&P. 500 itself. It is up 16.9 percent year-to-date. That's the fastest start for the S.&P. 500 since 1987, when it rose 18.7 percent during the same time period. But later that year, we had Black Monday, when the Dow dropped more than 22 percent in one day. So we should be looking for the same thing to happen in 2013, right?
In fact the S.&P. 500 is full of patterns if you're looking for them. Pick your poison: sheep, the S.&P. 500, gross domestic product, or the latest unemployment numbers. If you look for some sort of theme to emerge, it's highly likely you will see something. But the past is not prologue.
While some of these silly data mining tricks might be interesting to talk about, they won't help you. Every time someone approaches me with research -- and it's always called research -- that shows a pattern in the data, the pattern eventually goes away. These things always work perfectly, until they don't.
Oddly enough, the only pattern that will influence your investing success is your behavior. Can you break the pattern of buying high and selling low? Can you break the pattern of chasing after the next ''big'' investment? And perhaps most importantly, can you buy low-cost investments in a diversified portfolio, and then ignore it?
Now that's a pattern I can endorse.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shades of 2007 Borrowing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AMERICAN investors have taken out more margin loans than ever before. That indicates that speculative investing has grown among retail investors, reaching levels that in the past indicated the market was getting to unsustainable levels and might be in for a fall.
The amount owed on loans secured by investments rose to $384 billion at the end of April, according to data compiled by Finra, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. It was the first time the total had surpassed the 2007 peak of $381 billion, a peak that was followed by the Great Recession and credit crisis. 
The accompanying charts show the level of outstanding margin debt since 1960, both in dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product. The latest total of borrowing amounts to about 2.4 percent of G.D.P., a level that in the past was a danger signal.
Rising margin debt was once seen as a primary indicator of financial speculation, and the Federal Reserve controlled the amount that could be borrowed by each investor as a way to damp excess enthusiasm when markets grew frothy. But the last time the Fed adjusted the margin rules was in 1974, when it reduced the down payment required for stocks to 50 percent of the purchase price, from 65 percent. That came during a severe bear market.
Since then, the Fed has been on the sidelines. The view there, and among professional investors, has been that far greater leverage was available through options and futures, not to mention more exotic derivatives, so changing the rule would have little effect on levels of speculation.
Nonetheless, margin loans have remained popular among many individual investors, who tend to raise their borrowings during times of market optimism and to reduce them when markets are falling. Thus the margin debt levels now may provide an indication of popular enthusiasm for investments.
The first time in recent decades that total margin debt exceeded 2.25 percent of G.D.P. came at the end of 1999, amid the technology stock bubble. Margin debt fell after that bubble burst, but began to rise again during the housing boom -- when anecdotal evidence said some investors were using their investments to secure loans that went for down payments on homes. That boom in margin loans also ended badly.
The charts show the changes in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks during the 12 months before the margin debt level reached 2.25 percent of G.D.P., while it stayed at that level, and during the 12 months after the debt level fell below that figure. The figures are indexed to zero at the end of the first month that margin debt reached 2.25 percent of G.D.P.
In each case, there were double-digit increases in share prices during the year before margin debt got to that level. In the first two, the stock market decline began while margin debt was at the high level, and accelerated as debt levels fell -- presumably because investors were liquidating securities that were losing money.
If that pattern repeats, it could indicate that the stock market rally, which carried the S.& P. 500 to record levels in May, will not last much longer.
Perhaps offering some hope that pattern will not repeat is the fact share prices are lower now -- at least relative to the size of the economy -- than they were at the prior peaks. As it happens, the S.& P. 500 was a little below 1,500 in 1999, and again in 2007, and again this past January, when margin debt rose to 2.25 percent of G.D.P. But corporate profits now are more than double what they were in 1999, according to government estimates.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Sign of Excess? Margin debt in the United States -- money borrowed against securities in brokerage accounts -- has risen to its highest level ever, at $384 billion, surpassing the previous peak of $381 billion set in July 2007. Historically, rising levels of margin debt have been seen as a sign of speculation. Relative to the size of the economy, margin debt is far from setting a record, but it has climbed to levels seen only twice before during the past half century. In each previous case the increase came during bull markets that ended with rapid falls in share prices.(Source: Bloomberg)

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Slipped 0.2 Percent in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Americans cut back on spending in April after their income failed to grow, a sign that economic growth may be slowing.
Consumer spending dropped a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in April, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was the first decline since May 2012. It followed a 0.1 percent increase in March and a 0.8 percent jump in February. 
A drop in gasoline prices most likely lowered overall spending. Adjusted for inflation, spending ticked up 0.1 percent in April. Still, that was the smallest gain since October.
Consumers also seemed to spend less to heat their homes in April, which may have reduced spending on utilities. April's weather was mild after an unusually cold March.
Income was unchanged in April, after a 0.3 percent rise in March and 1.2 percent gain in February. Wages and salaries barely grew, while government benefit payments fell.
In the euro zone, unemployment continued its relentless march higher in April, according to official data published Friday, hitting yet another record.
The jobless rate for the 17 countries that use the common currency rose to 12.2 percent, from 12.1 percent a month earlier, with 19.4 million people out of work, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. Some analysts said the number of people without jobs could hit 20 million by the end of the year.
Separate data from Eurostat showed that inflation in the euro zone rose to 1.4 percent from 1.2 percent.
Most analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates or take other action to stimulate growth when its policy-making council meets in the coming week, but the inflation rate could prompt the central bank to wait for clearer signs that there is no risk of higher prices.
In the United States, the retrenchment in spending indicates consumers may be starting to feel the effect of higher taxes.
But a separate report Friday showed that consumer confidence rose to a six-year high in May, suggesting the decline in spending may be temporary.
Americans are taking home less pay this year because of a two-percentage-point increase in Social Security taxes. A person earning $50,000 a year has about $1,000 less to spend this year. Income taxes on the wealthiest Americans also increased.
Consumer spending drives 70 percent of economic activity. It grew at the fastest pace in more than two years from January through March, helping the economy expand at a 2.4 annual rate during that quarter.
Economists said the latest spending figures suggested that growth might be slowing in the April-June quarter, to around a 2 percent rate. But most still expect growth to improve slightly after that as the effect of tax increases and government spending cuts fades.
Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics, called it ''a sobering report'' for people expecting stronger growth. ''There will be some modest pickup in the second half of the year, as the fiscal drag starts to ease, but we expect the improvement to be very gradual rather than dramatic.''

HEADLINE: Court Revives Financier's Fraud Suit Against Citigroup Over the Sale of EMI

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The British financier Guy Hands will have another chance to try to prove his claim that he was defrauded by his longtime bankers at Citigroup.
A federal appeals court on Friday ordered a new trial in the legal fight between Mr. Hands and Citigroup over the buyout of the music company EMI.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan vacated a 2011 jury verdict that cleared Citigroup of any wrongdoing in its role in EMI's sale to Mr. Hands's private equity firm, Terra Firma Capital Partners. It ruled that improper jury instructions from the trial court judge required a reversal. 
Mr. Hands had accused the bank of defrauding him during its handling of an auction of EMI. He said that a Citigroup investment banker lied to him about another bidder, which tricked him into paying $6.8 billion for EMI at the market peak in August 2007. After the financial crisis struck and the music industry slumped, Mr. Hands lost billions of dollars on the investment.
He sued Citigroup in federal court, seeking $8.3 billion in damages. The bank said it had done nothing wrong and accused Mr. Hands of having a bad case of buyer's remorse.
After a three-week trial in 2010, the jury awarded nothing to Mr. Hands. Citigroup, which had also provided Mr. Hands with billions of dollars of loans to pay for EMI, ultimately took ownership of the company and sold it off in pieces. The Universal Music Group, a division of Vivendi, bought EMI's recorded-music business, and a Sony-led group acquired EMI's publishing assets.
With EMI seized from Terra Firma and now with new owners, the revived dispute becomes a fight over money. Should Citigroup and Mr. Hands fail to reach a financial settlement, the case will again go to trial before Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who presided over the case. A spokeswoman for Citigroup, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, suggested that was where they were heading.
''We are confident we will again prevail at trial as Citi's conduct in the EMI transaction was entirely proper,'' Ms. Romero-Apsilos said. ''The original verdict made clear that Terra Firma's baseless accusations of fraud were simply an attempt to gain leverage in debt restructuring negotiations.''
The reversal of a jury's verdict in a civil dispute is rare, and the federal appeals court said it was loath to overturn the case.
''We are particularly reluctant to overturn a jury verdict when, as here, it appears that both parties have had a fair bite at the proverbial apple,'' wrote Judge John M. Walker Jr., who wrote the opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel. ''The principal actors on both sides provided their version of events, exceptional trial lawyers marshaled and clarified the evidence, and a gifted judge presented the issue to the jury for its evaluation.''
Despite the praise for Judge Rakoff, the court said that he erred in his description of English law related to fraudulent misrepresentation, which applied to the case. Judge Rakoff incorrectly told the jury that Terra Firma had the burden of proof in showing that it relied on Citigroup's supposed misrepresentations, when according to English law, the burden fell upon Citigroup to prove that it did not lie.
''The district court's jury instructions were based on an inaccurate understanding of the relevant English law,'' Judge Walker wrote.Terra Firma, through its spokesman, Jonathan Doorley, said, ''We continue to believe that we have a strong claim, and with the jury instructions now resolved in our favor, we expect to prevail in any subsequent trial.''
The decision is a victory for Mr. Hands's star lawyer, David Boies of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, who represented him at trial and argued the appeal. If the case is tried again, Mr. Boies will most likely find himself in a rematch against Citigroup's lawyer, Theodore V. Wells Jr. of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Hits Record High in Euro Zone

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
LONDON -- Unemployment in the euro zone continued its relentless march higher in April, according to official data published Friday, hitting yet another record, amid a prolonged recession and the absence of a coordinated response by policy makers. 
The jobless rate for the 17 countries that use the common currency rose to 12.2 percent, from 12.1 percent a month earlier, with 19.4 million people out of work, according to Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency. Some analysts said the number of people without jobs could hit 20 million by the end of the year.
Despite the rise, most analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates or take other action to stimulate growth when its policy-making council meets in the coming week. Separate data from Eurostat showed that inflation in the euro zone rose to 1.4 percent from 1.2 percent, which could prompt the central bank to wait for clearer signs that there is no risk of higher prices.
Analysts said the continued rise in youth unemployment was particularly alarming. Nearly a quarter of job-seekers under age 25 were unemployed across the zone. Youth joblessness reached 62.5 percent in Greece and 56.4 percent in Spain in April, Eurostat said, threatening to become a long-term drag on growth as young people are unable to start their careers.
''Youth joblessness at these levels risks permanently entrenched unemployment, lowering the rate of sustainable growth in the future,'' Tom Rogers, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in an e-mail message.
A decision this week by European Union leaders to allow distressed countries more time to cut their government budgets will help, he said, as will a cut in the benchmark interest rate by the central bank last month. But Mr. Rogers added, ''Much more remains to be done to stimulate a recovery.''
For the moment, though, there is little prospect of major additional stimulus. The central bank remains reluctant to undertake more radical measures like those used by the Federal Reserve in the United States or the Bank of England. The E.C.B. benchmark interest rate is already at a record low of 0.5 percent, and it is unlikely that a further cut would do much to relieve a credit squeeze in countries like Italy.
The European Central Bank aims for inflation of about 2 percent, and still has room for additional measures without violating its mandate to maintain price stability. But the uptick in inflation reported Friday, caused primarily by a rise in prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, could quiet those who have argued that the euro zone is in danger of sinking into deflation, a sustained decline in prices that can be even more destructive than inflation because it is so hard to reverse.
In one bit of good news, unemployment in Ireland fell to 13.5 percent, down from 13.7 percent in March and from 14.9 percent a year earlier. The improvement is a sign that Ireland is slowly recovering from the banking and debt crisis that began in 2008.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Better Outlook For Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The financial outlook for Medicare has improved because of a stronger economy and slower growth in health spending, and the financial condition of Social Security has not worsened but is still unsustainable, the Obama administration said Friday.
''The projections in this year's report for Social Security are essentially unchanged from last year, and those for Medicare have improved modestly,'' the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, said. 
The Medicare trustees -- four federal officials and two public representatives -- said in their annual report that the ''modest improvement'' in the outlook for Medicare's long-term finances reflected lower projected spending for skilled nursing homes and private Medicare Advantage plans.
The administration said the outlook for the Medicare trust fund was brighter because of the 2010 health care law. The law squeezed nearly $500 billion out of Medicare over 10 years, in part by trimming payments to many health care providers, including nursing homes and private health plans.
But the number of Medicare beneficiaries will grow rapidly, to 73 million in 2025 from 52 million today, so paying for the program remains a huge challenge, administration officials said.
Older Americans stand to benefit from the slower growth in health spending. The standard Medicare premium paid by most beneficiaries will probably stay at the current level, $104.90 a month, next year, the trustees said in their report.
Under current law, the administration said, Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted in 2026, and the Social Security Trust Fund will be depleted in 2033. The administration said in its 2012 report that the Medicare trust fund would run out of money in 2024, and the Social Security fund in 2033.
The trustees urged Congress to shore up the finances of both programs, but few lawmakers are clamoring for immediate action.
Social Security provides benefits to more than 57 million people, and an average of about 10,000 baby boomers become eligible each day. Payroll taxes and other revenue dedicated to Social Security would be sufficient to pay about three-fourths of promised benefits when its trust fund runs out, administration officials said.
The condition of the economy has improved in the past year, the government is collecting more revenue and the growth of health spending has slowed. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said that Medicare spending per beneficiary had risen at a rate of just 1.7 percent a year from 2010 to 2012. In the prior two decades, it rose more than 6 percent a year, on average.
One of the public trustees, Robert D. Reischauer, said ''there is reason to be quite optimistic'' that the slowdown in health spending will continue. One-third to half of the slowdown may be attributable to the recession and its aftermath, when people cut back on medical spending. But much of the remainder reflects efforts by insurers and health care providers to rein in costs, said Mr. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
The trustees' reports are regarded as authoritative because they are produced with a minimum of political interference and incorporate the work of civil servants, including actuaries and economists who have been studying the programs for decades.
In an appendix to the report, Paul Spitalnic, the acting chief actuary of Medicare, said that future costs could well be higher than indicated in the report. For example, current law would require a reduction of nearly 25 percent in Medicare payments to doctors next Jan. 1, ''an implausible expectation,'' Mr. Spitalnic said, and he noted that Congress had usually stepped in to prevent such cuts.
For many years, the growth of Medicare and of total national health spending has outstripped the growth of the economy.
The latest report indicates that Medicare spending per beneficiary will grow more slowly than the economy -- the per capita gross domestic product -- through 2017. After that, the trustees expect Medicare to grow faster -- about four-tenths of a percentage point more than the per capita G.D.P. in 2037, for example.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress say that Medicare and Social Security are financially unsustainable in their current forms. But they are far from agreement on changes that may be needed.
The two programs accounted for 37 percent of all federal spending last year, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, under current law, their share will grow to 42 percent by 2023.
Affluent Medicare beneficiaries already pay higher premiums -- as much as $335.70 a month this year -- and the trustees see this figure rising above $500 a month by 2022. As part of his budget, President Obama has proposed steeper increases for the most affluent.
More than one in four Medicare beneficiaries -- 14.8 million people -- are in private health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans offered by companies like UnitedHealth and Humana. Enrollment in such private plans has doubled in the last seven years. The trustees' report forecasts slower growth, with enrollment reaching 20 million in 2030.
The Congressional Budget Office, by contrast, predicts more rapid growth, with enrollment in private plans reaching 21 million in 2023.
The trustees expressed concern about the condition of Social Security's disability insurance program and the disability trust fund, which they said would be exhausted in 2016, the same year projected in the 2012 report.
In the past, Congress has reallocated tax revenue from the retirement program to the disability trust fund. But Charles P. Blahous III, a public trustee, said that was not an ideal solution because the retirement program had financial problems of its own.

HEADLINE: Struggling at the U.S. Crossroads

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
It is the literary equivalent of an MRI, and the patient is the wealthiest country in the world, half a decade into an economic and social crisis. The diagnosis is grim, and the prognosis not much better.
George Packer's new book, ''The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America,'' is a summer blockbuster of a work, giving the country a searching, sweeping treatment more commonly found when authors write about societies other than their own.
It does more than perhaps any book in recent memory to explain where the United States has landed in 2013: a bizarre country in which the most valuable companies around continue to be born, even as millions struggle to feed themselves; in which a deft military uses unmanned drones to target foreign enemies, even as the country fails to find basic work for returning veterans of that military; in which some of the best schools on earth stand alongside others that can no longer afford chalk. 
Mr. Packer's subject is the unraveling of the American dream, and of the mid-20th-century social contract that, for many though hardly all, provided a clearer, more reliable link between effort and reward. To trace this unraveling, the book takes your arm and whisks you from Washington lobbying firms to North Carolina tobacco auctions, from Wall Street boardrooms to gang wars in abandoned houses in Youngstown, Ohio.
Through sketches of a panoply of American characters -- hustlers and power grabbers, lobbyists and public servants, zany serial entrepreneurs and Wall Street occupiers, masters of the universe and socially awkward technology wizards -- Mr. Packer depicts a country losing itself under the pressure of two distinct but related forces.
The first is the coming of a more fluid, mobile, globalized world in which things start being made overseas; money drains away from communities, and capital flies in and out at lightning speed, turning today's middle-class, school-teaching house flipper into tomorrow's homeless store clerk.
The second is the weakening of American institutions and the norms they once upheld -- Congress, banks, schools, grocers. This erosion, in Mr. Packer's telling, allowed ''the default force in American life, organized money,'' to rig the system to its own benefit.
The result, the book argues, is a return to a spruced-up version of the pre-New Deal America in which people were pretty much on their own.
The focus of ''The Unwinding'' is on big, sometimes predatory institutions failing ordinary people. What Mr. Packer seems less eager to explore, though his subjects' lives sometimes leave him no choice, are defects in the broader culture: problems with the choices that ordinary people have become used to making -- choices that make hard lives and going it alone that much harder. Two such issues stand out.
The first is a weakening commercial spirit. Although Mr. Packer frames the new go-it-alone economy as a kind of return, there is, in an important sense, no going back. Once people get used to a certain level of protection, expectations are not easily lowered. And so Mr. Packer depicts Americans who, left stranded, wait for someone to pave them a road rather than cutting their own.
Entrepreneurs beg for government grants; Wall Street banks press to rewrite laws to suit their interests; laid-off workers wait for politicians and business to ''create jobs'' instead of inventing new jobs of their own; the desperately poor play video games for hours a day, waiting for their earned-income tax credit check to arrive.
Mr. Packer also writes about striving. But the striving he portrays is so often a striving within the framework of dependence -- a striving disconnected from the American heritage of being out on the prairie, with no one to rely on, and somehow making it work.
The second problem is social breakdown. If the go-it-alone economics of the early 20th century is returning, it lands in a country whose family and community bonds are now also of the go-it-alone kind. This makes the economics harder to bear. In the lives Mr. Packer chronicles, the chaos at work (or of seeking work) is rarely soothed, and very often made worse, by chaos at home.
Mr. Packer depicts this chaos but does not emphasize it, choosing to focus on failing institutions. But in the lives of many of his subjects, the norm is now multiple divorces and out-of-wedlock births, divided childhoods, absent fathers, accruing alimony. A tiny minority of his subjects have been married once and remain so.
An economy of every-man-for-himself, undergirded by a social structure with the same ethos, is less a return to the past than a new predicament. Solitude is among the things that make poverty in the United States so different from that of many poorer countries.
''The Unwinding'' is a book likely to be read and argued about for a long time. The question it leaves you with is whether decline is inevitable, or whether the seeds of the new lurk unseen amid the widening decay. I found myself wondering whether it would be read a century from now as a prescient elegy for what was -- or rather a quaint declinist story that portrayed a moment with great force but failed to see that rebirth was coming, as it has so many times before.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Lawmakers to Lock Student Loan Rates Before They Double

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- College students, freshly relieved of pressure from term papers and final exams, served as a backdrop for President Obama on Friday as he warned of another impending fiscal deadline: student loan interest rates are set to double in 30 days under current law.
''That means that the average student with those loans will rack up an additional $1,000 in debt,'' Mr. Obama said at an event in the White House Rose Garden. ''That's like a $1,000 tax hike.'' 
Both Democrats and Republicans say they want to head off an increase in the interest rate for federally subsidized student loans to 6.8 percent as scheduled on July 1, but they disagree about how best to manage the rates' trajectory.
Senate Democrats plan to vote to extend the government-subsidized rate -- 3.4 percent for the 7.4 million students with Stafford loans -- for another two years, while House Republicans approved a measure last week that would make the rate variable, tied to prevailing market trends.
''I'm glad the House is paying attention to it, but they didn't do it in the right way,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It fails to lock in low rates for students next year. That's not smart. It eliminates safeguards for lower-income families. That's not fair.''
Republicans, eager to avoid liability for burdening the nation's youngest voters with a big increase in debt, accused the president of ''petty partisanship'' and blamed the Democratic-controlled Senate for inaction.
''The differences between the House plan and the president's are small, and there's no reason they cannot be overcome quickly,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement. ''But today, rather than working to resolve the issue, the president resorted to a campaign stunt to try to score political points.''
The House measure would allow the Stafford rate for undergraduates to reset each year based on the cost of a 10-year Treasury note, plus 2.5 percent, but it would ultimately cap the rate at 8.5 percent. For graduate student loans, known as PLUS loans, the rate would be the Treasury note plus 4.5 percent, capped at 10.5 percent.
Mr. Obama said the Republican proposal ''could actually cost a freshman starting school this fall more over the next four years than if we did nothing at all and let the interest rates double on July 1.''
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Republican plan would put the Stafford rate at 5 percent in 2014 and 7.7 percent in 2018.
Like the Republican measure, the plan Mr. Obama proposed in his budget would tie the rate to Treasury notes. But rather than changing each year, an individual student's rate would be fixed for the life of the loan.
The Senate will vote on a more straightforward, two-year extension of the current 3.4 percent rate next week, according to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader. In a statement, he called the House bill a ''nonstarter.''
The Senate bill is ''something we would support,'' said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, during a briefing on Friday afternoon. In his own remarks, Mr. Obama essentially called for a repeat of what happened last year when Congress, facing a similar deadline, passed a one-year extension of the current rate with bipartisan support.
''So this year, if it looks like your representatives have changed their minds, you're going to have to call them up again or e-mail them again or tweet them again and ask them: 'What happened? What changed?' '' Mr. Obama said.
Democrats set the rate at 3.4 percent for four years in 2007, when they controlled the House of Representatives. Republicans said they agreed to the one-year extension last year only to make time for a more permanent, budget-friendly solution.
Mr. Obama called it ''déjà vu all over again.''

HEADLINE: OPEC Maintains Its Target For Daily Oil Production

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED; Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.

 BODY:
LONDON -- With the price of oil relatively strong, OPEC decided on Friday to maintain its current target for oil production at 30 million barrels a day, a move the markets had expected.
The price of Brent crude oil, the European benchmark, has recently hovered around $100 a barrel, a level that met with the approval of most members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in Vienna.
''There is no compelling reason to rock the boat,'' Bhushan Bahree, an analyst at market research firm IHS Cera, wrote in a research note. 
At a news conference after the meeting, the OPEC secretary general, Abdalla S. el-Badri, waved off a suggestion that the $100-a-barrel level was acting as a drag on the world economy, arguing that much of the eventual price at the pump was because of taxes, not the crude oil itself.
''If the government wants to do something for their economy, they should reduce taxes so people can buy more gasoline,'' he said.
Prices fell after the announcement. By midday in New York, Brent crude was down $1.11 to $101.08 a barrel, and benchmark light sweet crude fell 84 cents to $92.77.
Despite today's prices, OPEC is losing market share to countries outside the cartel, especially the United States and Canada.
The United States is still importing substantial amounts of oil from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations that produce heavy and medium grades of crude that Gulf of Mexico refineries are designed to process. But the boom in United States oil shale fields that produce lighter grades are quickly replacing imports from Algeria, Nigeria and other African producers.
For American drivers, the increased drilling in the United States and sluggish demand in Europe that is putting pressure on global oil prices have brought a modest amount of relief. The price for an average gallon of regular gasoline in the United States on Friday was $3.61, a drop of 4 cents from a week ago, according to AAA. Drivers spent a penny more on average for a gallon of regular gas last year.
Saudi Arabia, by far the largest producer, has cut production by about 600,000 barrels a day from a year ago, to 9.3 million, according to IHS Cera. In the same period, Iranian production dropped by 400,000 barrels a day as American sanctions took a toll on the country's industry.
For years, oil prices rose with equity prices, but recently oil has ''fallen even as the S.& P. has made record highs,'' wrote Seth M. Kleinman, an analyst at Citi, in a research note, referring to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Mr. Kleinman also noted that there had been ''significant liquidation'' by speculators in the futures markets over the last three months.
From an OPEC perspective, the outlook for the next year is not rosy. Many analysts forecast that global demand will increase modestly this year and that most or all of the increase will be supplied by non-OPEC producers, led by the United States. If so, that would leave little room for OPEC output to grow and may force the organization to either make further cuts or allow global inventories to build.
''The second half of the year could see a further easing in fundamentals,'' OPEC said Friday in a statement.
OPEC's current quotas have been in place since 2011.

HEADLINE: Surpluses Help, But Fiscal Woes For States Go On

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Monica Davey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
While the fiscal picture is brightening around the country, with many states expecting surpluses this year after years of deficits and wrenching budget crises, mounting Medicaid costs and underfunded retirement promises are continuing to cloud their long-term outlook.
And some of the surpluses that are materializing, as welcome as they are, are not as robust as they appear at first glance -- especially as bills come due for some of the costs that states put off during the long economic downturn.
When Texas lawmakers went into session in January, they were met with some good news: the state was projecting an $8.8 billion surplus when its two-year budget cycle ends in August. But it turned out that much of that extra money was already spoken for: more than half of it had to be used to pay Medicaid costs the state had delayed paying earlier.
And Texas, like many states, has not been fully funding its pensions. Last year the state contributed just 49.2 percent of what actuaries said was needed by the state workers' pension fund. Eventually the remaining money, around $358 million, will still have to be put into the fund, along with the 8 percent investment return the fund is supposed to earn each year. 
In Hawaii, Gov. Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, recently opened his re-election campaign by noting that the $200 million deficit he inherited upon taking office has been transformed into a positive balance of $300 million. But Hawaii faces enormous looming bills: its pension system currently has less than 60 cents of every dollar it has promised retirees, and it is more than $13 billion short of what it will need to pay for the health coverage it has promised its retired workers.
And California, which faced a $26 billion deficit two years ago, expects a surplus of between $1.2 billion and $4.4 billion this year, thanks to a combination of tax increases, budget cuts and an improving economy. But it could be erased if the state were to adequately finance its teachers' pension fund, which says it will need an additional $4.5 billion a year, much of it from the state, to pay the benefits it promised.
''The problems are still there,'' said Richard Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor of New York who formed a State Budget Crisis Task Force last year to focus attention on the long-term problems facing states. ''It's retirement expenses, generally, and health care expenses -- and they're crowding out other things.''
Of course, surpluses are better than deficits. When the fiscal crisis hit states full force in 2009, 41 states were forced to make disruptive midyear budget cuts, according to a survey by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers. This year, only a handful did -- and most states are expected to end the year with surpluses, or with money to replenish their depleted rainy-day funds.
But many challenges loom, as they have since before the recession. A 2007 study by the Government Accountability Office was titled ''State and Local Governments: Persistent Fiscal Challenges Will Likely Emerge Within the Next Decade.'' This spring the office warned that the continuing near-term and long-term state and local government challenges ''add to the nation's overall challenges,'' noting that the problem was largely driven by rising health care costs.
And some states are still in considerable fiscal distress. Illinois, which still faces large backlogs of unpaid bills, the weakest pension system of any state and the lowest credit rating of any state, failed to approve an overhaul of its pension system this week. As time was running out in its state legislative session, some leaders in the Democrat-controlled Capitol were pleading for a last-ditch plan to address the state's pension crisis. The system was in bad shape even before the financial crisis of 2008 struck, and now it requires an ever-bigger slice of the state budget every year to meet its promises.
Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, in Albany, said states still face enormous costs to pay for the obligations they have made. ''I know a lot of people are pinning their hopes and mantras on the idea that an improved stock market will bail pension funds out, but it will take so much more than we have seen -- and the risk to governments, if it goes wrong, is frightening,'' he said.
In some states the surpluses may reflect an improving economy, but in many they are the result of the tough steps taken during the downturn, which included making deep cuts to services; furloughing, laying off and reducing the benefits of workers; delaying repairs to roads and bridges; and raising taxes.
To some extent, said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the budget officers' group, the current surpluses are a reflection of the way that the states' annual revenue forecasts grew more conservative during the downturn and slow recovery. ''It's more a function of there being more money than they thought there would be,'' he said, ''and not a signal that their financial challenges are over.''
Now the surpluses have spurred debate in statehouses around the county, with some officials seeking to restore services and rehire workers, and others pushing new tax cuts. Governors from both parties, though, find themselves urging restraint as their states climb back from the recession.
Barry Anderson, the deputy director of the National Governors Association, used a homespun analogy for the situation that many states find themselves in. ''I can see Mom and Dad at the kitchen table,'' he said, ''saying: 'Wow, we did a little better than we anticipated here -- but let's not go out and blow it all, let's set it aside. Because we know, not only do we need a new car, or to take care of the leaks in the basement, but Johnny and Joanie are going to need insurance coverage.' ''
Rising health care costs continue to pose one of the biggest challenges to states, and the trend has many governors concerned.
Although the rate of Medicaid cost increases has slowed, Mr. Anderson said, those costs have continued to rise -- and enrollments have risen as well, driving up expenses for many states. Medicaid was the biggest single component of total state spending this year, the most recent survey of states found: states were planning to spend 23.9 percent of their money on Medicaid -- more than the 19.8 percent they were planning to spend on primary and secondary education, and more than what they planned to spend on higher education and transportation combined. Many states put off needed road maintenance during the downturn.
There are other threats on the horizon as well. Both Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pattison cautioned that some of the better-than-expected tax collections that many states experienced this year could be a one-time fluke: a higher-than-usual number of taxpayers apparently sold investments at the end of 2012 as Congress debated what to do about the so-called fiscal cliff, fearing the prospect of higher tax rates.
''We're advising states to consider identifying money that is the result of one-time-only activity,'' Mr. Pattison said, ''and then try to avoid putting that into ongoing operating expenses.''

HEADLINE: Why Canadian Teams Can't Seem to Win the Stanley Cup

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
The N.H.L.'s conference finals will begin on Saturday, and fans in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh can still dream of a Stanley Cup championship. But this year is an unhappy anniversary for America's northerly neighbor. It is 20 years since the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings to win the 1993 Stanley Cup; no Canadian team has won the championship since.
Just how unlikely has Canada's Stanley Cup drought been? And is there anything in the league's economics that might help to explain it?
The answer isn't simple, so let me give you the executive summary before we parse the details. 
First, bad luck is a major component. Even after accounting for the fact that Canadian teams have rarely been among the league's best in recent years, you would still have expected Canada to pick up at least a couple of Stanley Cups at some point.
Second, the N.H.L.'s economic structure changed at an unfavorable time for Canada. During the first half of the 20-year drought, the league allowed teams to spend freely, but Canadian teams were hampered by the weak Canadian dollar. Since 2005, the Canadian dollar has recovered substantially, and Canadian teams are now turning large profits. But they are limited in their capacity to invest those profits in superior players because the league has instituted a hard salary cap.
Third, there is almost certainly a shortage of N.H.L. teams in Canada relative to the demand for hockey there and the revenues that Canada contributes to the league. Teams in nontraditional hockey markets like Raleigh, N.C., Tampa, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif., have won Stanley Cups since 1993, but without doing especially well financially. So have the Colorado Avalanche, who relocated from Quebec City in 1995-96. Had the distribution of N.H.L. teams more closely matched fan interest in the sport across the United States and Canada, Canada would have more teams in the league and -- very probably -- at least one Stanley Cup championship.
Finally, and related to the excess demand for hockey in Canada, Canadian teams routinely sell out their arenas at high ticket prices -- whether or not they are any good. This may reduce their incentive to compete.
The simplest way to conceive of the situation is to assume that each N.H.L. team begins with an equal chance of winning the championship and to estimate the odds of a Canadian team winning the Stanley Cup as a function of the number of Canadian teams in the league.
Eight of the 26 N.H.L. teams, or 31 percent, were from Canada in the 1993-94 season. The percentage fell to 20 (6 of 30 teams) by 2000-1, before increasing to 23 percent after the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg in 2011.
If a champion were randomly chosen from all N.H.L. teams active each season, the odds that a Canadian team would have won at least one Stanley Cup since 1993-94 are 99.2 percent. (This period comprises 19 seasons, excluding 2004-5 when the N.H.L. canceled its season because of a labor dispute.) That means the chance of Canada failing to have won a Stanley Cup is just 0.8 percent, yielding odds of about 125-to-1 against.
But it is naïve, of course, to assume that the Stanley Cup champion is chosen randomly. Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals, for example, aren't merely unlucky to have failed to reach the playoffs in 28 years: they have usually stunk. Perhaps the Canadian N.H.L. teams just haven't been very good either.
At first glance, the difference in competitiveness seems minor. Canadian teams have averaged 35.3 wins and 81.5 points per regular season over this period, compared with 36.7 wins and 84.4 points for the American teams. Canadian teams made the playoffs 54 percent of the time, compared with 56 percent for the United States-based clubs.
However, the Stanley Cup is not normally won by an average team that just sneaks into the playoffs -- instead, it usually goes to one of the best teams in the league. Eleven of the 18 Stanley Cup champions since 1993-94 have been seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in their conference. And there has been a lack of elite Canadian teams; only 14 percent of the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds since 1993-94 have been from Canada.
A more exacting way to evaluate the odds is by estimating each team's chance of winning the Stanley Cup as a function of its playoff seed and its regular-season power rating. (Power ratings, in this case, are taken from hockey-reference.com's Simple Ratings System, which accounts for each team's goal differential and strength of schedule during the regular season.) We can accomplish this by means of a logistic regression analysis. The probabilities for each season are recalibrated such that the 16 teams that make the playoffs have exactly a 100 percent chance of winning the Stanley Cup, in total.
In the 1996-97 season, for instance, I estimate that the Canadian teams had just a 2.1 percent chance of winning the Stanley Cup on the basis of their regular-season performance. Three of the six Canadian teams made the playoffs that year -- but all as No. 7 or No. 8 seeds, and none of them were much good.
In 15 of the past 19 N.H.L. seasons, in fact, the probability of a Canadian team winning the Stanley Cup, as calculated by this method, was lower than you would get if you drew from among all N.H.L. teams at random. Only twice -- the Ottawa Senators in 2005-6, and the Vancouver Canucks in 2010-11 -- did a Canadian team enter the playoffs as the best bet to win the Stanley Cup on the basis of regular-season performance.
You would still have expected a Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup sooner or later. The chance that at least one would do so was 97.5 percent, according to this method. Nonetheless, the lack of dominant Canadian teams has helped to make the 0-for-19 drought merely unlikely rather than almost impossible -- raising the chance of the Canadian shutout to 2.5 percent from 0.8 percent. So it is worth asking why Canadian teams have rarely been among the N.H.L.'s elite.
Perhaps Canadian teams are competing on an unlevel playing field? Among the seven current Canadian N.H.L. teams, the median television market is 1.7 million people. By contrast, the median American team competes in a television market with 5.4 million people.
Professional hockey, however, has an extremely regional following: it is extraordinarily popular in almost all of Canada, reasonably popular in parts of the northeastern and midwestern United States, and quite obscure elsewhere in the United States. These differences more than make up for the smaller size of Canadian markets. In fact, the typical Canadian team has considerably more N.H.L. fans in its market than the typical United States team does.
In 2011, I estimated the number of fans for each N.C.A.A. football team by comparing Google search traffic for the term ''college football'' in different media markets. We can do the same thing for hockey by evaluating the number of people who searched for the term ''N.H.L.''
On a per-capita basis, searches for the term ''N.H.L.'' were more than seven times as common in Canada as in the United States. Although the United States population is about nine times larger than Canada's, this makes up for a lot of the difference.
How many N.H.L. fans are there in each country? A 2010 YouGov poll estimated that 11 percent of American adults were serious N.H.L. fans; a 2007 Scarborough Research study, using a stricter definition that was limited to the most avid fans, put the total at just 4 percent. Using the midpoint of those two surveys yields an estimate that 7.5 percent of Americans are N.H.L. fanatics, or about 23.5 million Americans among a population of 314 million.
The frequency of Google searches in Canada for ''N.H.L.'' implies that about 54 percent of Canadians are serious N.H.L. fans, or about 18.5 million people in a country of 34.5 million.
In other words, the two countries are reasonably close in their number of N.H.L. fans, despite the United States' vastly larger population. I estimate that Canada accounts for something like 45 percent of the N.H.L. interest between the two countries. (The N.H.L., incidentally, makes about 40 percent of its national television licensing fees from Canadian networks -- and the percentage is likely to increase after the league negotiates new Canadian TV contracts.)
If N.H.L. teams were distributed between the countries in proportion to fan interest, Canada would have something like 12 to 14 teams out of a 30-team N.H.L. Instead, Canada has seven teams. This undersupply means that the Canadian N.H.L. teams have larger numbers of fans, on average.
In the chart below, I have used the Google search data to estimate the proportion of people in various United States and Canadian media markets who are serious N.H.L. fans. (The method uses Google search data at the metro-area level for the United States and at the provincial level for Canada as metro-level data is unavailable for Canada.)
The results demonstrate how much difference hockey avidity can make. Compare the cities of Los Angeles, Boston and Calgary. There are about 17 million people in the Los Angeles media market, 6.2 million in Boston's and 1.6 million in Calgary's. Based on their Google search traffic, however, I estimate that only 6 percent of the population in Los Angeles are serious N.H.L. fans, compared with 17 percent in Boston (high by United States standards) and 67 percent in Calgary (high even by Canadian standards). As a result, the three markets are roughly equivalent on hockey terms: each has about 1.1 million serious N.H.L. fans.
Another astonishing result can be obtained by comparing Houston and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan -- two markets that are occasionally mentioned as possible sites for N.H.L. expansion teams. Houston's media market has about six million people, compared with not quite 340,000 for Saskatoon. However, I estimate that only 2 percent of Houston residents are serious N.H.L. fans, versus 46 percent of the population in Saskatoon. Thus, they are roughly equal at about 150,000 N.H.L. fans each.
Accounting for the far greater propensity of Canadians to follow hockey, the median Canadian team plays in a market with about 1.1 million N.H.L. fans, while the median United States team plays in a market with about 530,000 fans.
The American cities that have had their hockey teams for a long time generally place well above the United States median, however. Of the United States-based markets that had an N.H.L. team continually since 1990, all but St. Louis have at least 500,000 fans.
So a couple of decades ago, there was a nice balance in the N.H.L. between American cities with large populations but moderate hockey interest, and Canadian cities with moderate populations but intense hockey interest. There were a few outlying cases -- Los Angeles has very low hockey interest but a very large population, while Buffalo has a modest population but levels of hockey affinity that approach Canadian levels. These teams functioned well enough, and no team was dragging down the average that much. The American markets that the N.H.L. has ventured into since 1990 have only about 250,000 hockey fans on average, however.
These differences in hockey interest have a profound effect on each team's bottom line. In the chart below, I have compared the number of hockey fans in each market against their estimated operating profit or loss in 2011-12, according to Forbes magazine. (For the markets with multiple hockey teams, I have divided the fans as follows: in New York, 55 percent of the market to the Rangers, 25 percent to the New Jersey Devils and 20 percent to the Islanders; and in Los Angeles, two-thirds to the Kings and one-third to the Anaheim Ducks. These estimates are derived by evaluating the number of Google searches for the team names among the residents in each metropolitan area.)
This measure of hockey fans does a very good job of predicting each team's profitability. The 13 teams with 700,000 or more N.H.L. fans in their markets all made money and totaled $357 million in operating profits. The six teams in markets with fewer than 300,000 fans all lost money, totaling $77 million in operating losses. The teams between 300,000 and 700,000 fans had varied results but roughly broke even, on average. (This is the range in which a quality of a team's management matters, along with other factors like per-capita income in the region and a team's appeal outside its immediate metropolitan area.)
Six of the seven Canadian teams are above the 700,000-fan threshold (and therefore made money). So did Winnipeg, with roughly 560,000 fans. In total, Canadian teams brought in $219 million in operating profits in 2011-12 -- whereas the American teams made a net of just $31 million. (Outside of the highly profitable Rangers, in fact, the United States-based teams lost money that year.)
So why have the Canadian teams struggled to win Stanley Cups?
Part of it stems from the same reason that operating profits are so closely tied to the number of N.H.L. fans in each team's media market. N.H.L. teams vary greatly in how many fans they have available to them. But under the league's current collective bargaining agreement, there is relatively little revenue sharing. There is a hard salary cap, however, along with a high salary floor, so each team's player expenditures are about the same.
The good news for the Canadian teams is that, with nothing else to spend them on, those extra revenues flow through straight through to the bottom line. The bad news is that they could not spend them by investing in better player talent, even if they wanted to.
Before the lost season of 2004-5, the N.H.L.'s economics were different: there was no salary cap. But something else was different as well: the Canadian dollar had been historically weak against the American dollar. Thus, the Canadian teams could not take full advantage of the excess demand for hockey in the country.
In the next chart, I have estimated per-game ticket revenues for American and Canadian N.H.L. teams since 1995. Ticket revenues are calculated as per-game attendance during the regular season, multiplied by average ticket prices as reported by Team Marketing Report. (Since 2003, Team Marketing Report has designated a portion of tickets in each arena as premium seats; I assume that 20 percent of ticket sales are priced at premium levels.) All figures are denominated in current (inflation-adjusted) United States dollars. The chart also shows how much revenue the Canadian teams would have brought in had the American and Canadian dollars been trading roughly at parity throughout the period, as they have been recently.
Per-game ticket revenues for the Canadian teams lagged somewhat behind the United States teams from 1995 through 1999. This was mostly because of the weak Canadian dollar; the Canadian teams would have run even with or slightly ahead of the American teams otherwise. From 2000 through 2003, the American and Canadian teams made about the same amount of money from a typical game despite a still fairly weak Canadian dollar. Since then, the Canadian dollar has strengthened, and Canadian teams have moved considerably ahead of the American teams: the average Canadian team now makes about 50 percent more than the average American team on a per-game basis. However, it is during this period that the N.H.L.'s salary cap has been in place.
But even if the Canadian teams cannot spend their extra revenues on better player talent, this does not fully explain why they have been underachieving in the Stanley Cup and not at least winning their fair share of championships.
Much of the reason, I must emphasize again, boils down to bad luck. Canadian teams have reached the Stanley Cup finals five times in the 19 seasons since 1992-93 but have come up short on each occasion, including in four cases where the series went to the seven-game maximum.
One other factor, however, may be that there is so much excess demand for hockey in Canada that the Canadian franchises do not have to field especially strong teams to sell out their stadiums or to make a considerable profit. In the next chart, I have compared the per-game ticket revenues for each team in the 2012-13 season against the number of points they tallied between this season and the last one.
For the United States teams, there is an imperfect but reasonably clear and statistically significant relationship between on-ice success and ticket revenues. There are lots of fair-weather American hockey fans, and they may not turn out unless their team is pretty good. In Canada, there is less competition from other sports, and there are many die-hard hockey fans who attend games almost no matter what. Consider, for instance, that the Toronto Maple Leafs increased their average ticket prices from about $75 (in inflation-adjusted United States dollars) in 2005-6 to $140 this season (or from about $85 to $140 in inflation-adjusted Canadian dollars) -- despite never qualifying for the playoffs in the interim. They have almost always sold out their stadium anyway.
These results can be generalized across other seasons. I ran a regression analysis that estimates per-game ticket revenues as a function of the number of hockey fans in a given media market, the number of points that a team averaged between the current season and the previous one, and a time trend. (Point totals are adjusted relative to the league-average number of points to correct for seasons shortened by labor disputes and changes to N.H.L. rules; the number of fans is expressed as a natural logarithm.)
For American teams, an additional regular-season win (worth 2 points in the standings) yields about $10,600 in extra ticket revenues per game, or roughly $430,000 over a full regular season. For Canadian teams, the marginal value of an additional regular-season win is about $1,400 per game (or $60,000 per season), which is not statistically or practically significant.
So the Canadian N.H.L. teams may suffer from a version of the problem that the Chicago Cubs faced during the ''bleacher bum'' years. Their fans are so loyal -- happy enough to turn out for the spectacle and the beer even if the team stinks -- that the franchises don't have all that much incentive to put out a competitive product.
Whether this has actually translated into complacency or mismanagement is harder to demonstrate. Even if N.H.L. teams are constrained in how much they can spend directly on player salaries, they could make other expenditures that should eventually translate into on-ice success -- for example, by investing more in scouting and development. The Toronto Maple Leafs, the Montreal Canadiens and the Vancouver Canucks each employ 20 or more scouts, according to their Web sites -- well above the N.H.L. average of about 15. So there is some evidence that they are making a good-faith effort to produce a quality team. (I wouldn't want to slander any professional sports franchise by comparing it with the Chicago Cubs.)
Nevertheless, a strong case can be made that these teams could stand some additional competition from N.H.L. franchises in their media markets and elsewhere in Canada.
I estimate, for instance, that there are five million N.H.L. fans in the greater Toronto region (which I define fairly liberally to include the outskirts of the Golden Horseshoe): about twice as many as in the New York metropolitan area, which has three N.H.L. teams. And Montreal and Vancouver are not far from New York in their number of N.H.L. fans.
Even acknowledging that additional N.H.L. teams in Toronto would not expect to draw as well as the Maple Leafs -- just as the Islanders and the Devils do not have nearly as many fans as the Rangers -- adding a second team in the Toronto area seems all but certain to produce another profitable N.H.L. franchise in a league where many teams are unable to break even. The new team would need to capture only about 14 percent of the Toronto market to reach the 700,000-fan threshold that seems to guarantee profitability in the N.H.L. A good case could also be made for a third Toronto-area team, along with second teams in Montreal and Vancouver.
At the other end of the fan-interest scale, it seems very difficult for N.H.L. teams with fewer than about 300,000 hockey fans in their media markets to turn a long-run profit under the league's current economic system. One might hold out hope that the newer hockey markets in the United States will grow to provide more revenue for their teams, but the evidence has not supported this conjecture so far. Per-game ticket revenues for United States teams in nontraditional media markets have grown at a rate of just 1.4 percent per year (inflation-adjusted) over the past 18 seasons, compared with 2.6 percent annually for traditional United States hockey markets and 4.2 percent annually for Canadian teams. These struggling United States teams hurt the Canadian teams both directly by diluting the share of Canadian teams in the league, and indirectly by compelling a salary cap structure that is meant to protect the struggling American teams (but which has yet to make most of them profitable).
My best guess is that the economically optimal distribution of N.H.L. franchises would look something like the schema in the chart below. This would include two new teams in the greater Toronto area, one new team in Montreal and one new team in Quebec City. In lieu of a second team in Vancouver, Seattle -- a marginal hockey market but probably better than several United States cities that already have N.H.L. teams -- would get a franchise in the hope that support might spill over into British Columbia and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. New York would retain its three N.H.L. teams as the Islanders sought to find success in Brooklyn, while Los Angeles (which has no more N.H.L. fans than Philadelphia or Boston and fewer than Vancouver or Montreal) would be shaved to one. The six United States markets with fewer than 300,000 N.H.L. fans would lose their teams.
This would yield a league with 11 Canadian franchises out of 28 -- just shy of 40 percent -- a level that comes much closer to the share of N.H.L. interest and revenues between among the two countries. And it would all but ensure that Canada's Stanley Cup drought ends sooner rather than later.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Frills Are Few. The Fees Are Not.

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
There is a joke in the airline business that you could make money giving out free beer and charging a fee for the bathroom.
No one has tried that -- at least not yet -- but one small airline has led the way in the United States when it comes to passenger fees: Spirit Airlines, the no-frills carrier that prides itself for offering the lowest fares, then charging passengers for everything else.
Need an agent to print out a boarding pass at the airport? That's $10. Want some water? That's $3. Rolling a bag on board? The tag costs $35 from home and $50 at the airport. In all, there are about 70 fees enumerated in dizzying detail on Spirit's Web site for customers to navigate.
To the millions of travelers flying on vacation this summer, the fees can be infuriating, but Spirit makes no apologies. In an age of consolidation in the airline industry, Spirit, with about 1 percent of the nation's passenger traffic, has managed to succeed by going it alone, scraping for every dollar and scrimping on every cost. 
''Spirit does everything it can to make or save a buck,'' said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Hudson Crossing. ''To its credit, Spirit doesn't promise passengers that they'll be coddled. Its customer service standards are terrible, and the airline's actions have shown it doesn't care about being liked or respected.''
The driving force behind that strategy is Spirit's chief executive, Ben Baldanza, 51, an industry veteran who arrived at Spirit eight years ago with no experience at a no-frills airline. Along with an obsessive attention to keeping costs low, Mr. Baldanza argues that the cornucopia of fees allows the airline to keep its fares lower than rivals. The airline, known for its tasteless ads (during the presidential election, one ad talked of Spirit having ''binders full of sales. Women will love them!'') is modeled after Ryanair, which charges low fares for flights throughout Europe with a minimalist approach to customer service.
''I cringe a little when people say I don't care about customers,'' said Mr. Baldanza, who brims with missionary zeal. ''We care about the thing that customers tell us they care the most about, and that's offering the lowest possible fares. The customers who fly Spirit absolutely understand the trade-off.''
On a recent day at La Guardia Airport, passengers seemed to be taking the fees in stride. Two students forgot about the fee that Spirit charges for carry-on bags. That did little to reduce their enthusiasm to fly to Las Vegas despite the early loss. Kevin Reed, a photographer flying to Myrtle Beach, S.C., paid an extra $10 on top of a $35 checked-bag fee because he failed to do so when he bought his ticket.
''They got me there,'' he said, shrugging. ''But I'm still saving $400 over flying with Delta.''
Not every customer has the same reaction, though. Spirit is routinely rated as the nation's worst airline because some travelers deem the fees unfair. The Transportation Department receives far more complaints about Spirit than other carriers, with 6 to 8 complaints per 100,000 passengers compared with the industry average of 1.4. And Spirit's on-time record is similarly abysmal, at 68.8 percent compared with 80 percent for the industry average. The best airlines are in the mid-90s.
Critics point out that the inflation of air travel fees makes it increasingly difficult to compare the cost of travel between airlines.
''The fee-for-everything technique allows airfares to be advertised as much lower than the overall cost,'' said Paul Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, a consumer group.
Mr. Baldanza acknowledged that the process can be tricky. ''You can't sleepwalk through the process,'' he said.
But the model has allowed Spirit to offer cheap tickets. Since 2008, Spirit's airfare has dropped by 20 percent, averaging $75 in 2012 compared with $94 in 2008. The difference often jumps out at a customer searching for flights. On Friday, Spirit was offering a nonstop flight from Oakland, Calif., to Portland, Ore., in mid-July for $156; the same trip was $296 on Delta.
Because of its growing list of fees, however, nonticket revenues grew to $51.39 in 2012, from $18.61 in 2008. As a result, while fares fell, Spirit's total revenue per passenger grew by 12 percent from 2008 to 2012, reaching $126.50. Fees now account for 41 percent of Spirit's revenues, an industry record.
The trade-offs are obvious. Spirit has no business class, offers no movies and no Wi-Fi, and its seats don't recline, legroom is the tightest in the business. But a nonstop flight from Dallas to Orlando costs $366 on Spirit and $499 on American Airlines.
Still, Spirit is not about to take over the domestic industry. The carrier, which caters to leisure travelers and not the business flier, has only 49 planes, compared with more than 600 for Southwest. But it is growing about 20 percent a year when most of the industry is contracting or staying flat. It plans to add four more planes this year and another 17 over the next two years.
The airline, based in Miramar, Fla., flies about 50 routes, mostly on the East Coast, Florida, Central America and the Caribbean. It started flying as a charter airline in 1980, but adopted a low-cost model in 2007, when new investors charted a different course for the unprofitable airline.
Last year, Spirit had its fourth consecutive year of profitability, and generated some of the best returns in the industry, along with a record return on invested capital of 26.5 percent.
Investors have responded. Since the company's initial public offering two years ago, shares have more than doubled. They traded at $30.43 on Friday, valuing Spirit at $2.21 billion.
Mr. Baldanza said he is not done and wants to grow the fleet to 150 planes within five years and account for about 3 percent or 4 percent of traffic. He likens his airline to Southwest in the mid-1980s, when the low-cost airline was the industry's maverick.
Like Southwest before it, Spirit achieves significant savings from its bare-bones operations. This explains why the airline charges for water on board, since carrying bottles has a cost that Mr. Baldanza refuses to pay. ''If you can do it yourself, it's free,'' he said. ''If we have to do it, you'll pay for it.''
Another way Spirit cuts costs is by packing more passengers on its plane, which all have 178 seats, while similar models on US Airways and JetBlue have 150. This allows Spirit to spread its costs. Its planes also fly longer each day -- nearly 13 hours, allowing for more flights. Southwest, by contrast, flies its planes about 10.4 hours a day.
At La Guardia, Spirit operates 12 flights every day out of a single gate. Passengers are not given many scheduling options either.
''We schedule our flights when the gate is available as opposed to when the customers want to fly,'' Mr. Baldanza said. ''It doesn't matter that no one wants to fly at 9 a.m. or 2 p.m. or in the middle of the night. The reality is that they want to fly when they get the low fare.''
Spirit also makes sure its flights are always full and sets its prices accordingly. (There's a joke inside the airline that empty seats don't check bags, Mr. Baldanza said.) As a result, it costs Spirit just 10.15 cents to fly one passenger for one mile, compared with United's 18.25 cents and Southwest's 11.08 cents.
Spirit was the first airline to charge for checked bags, in 2007, a move others eventually followed.
Last year, airlines collected $6 billion just from checked bag fees and reservation changes, up from $1.4 billion in 2007, according to the Department of Transportation.
Spirit was also the first airline to charge passengers for their carry-on bags, but that's still a red line few have dared to cross except for Allegiant Airlines and Frontier.
The big question is whether travelers will eventually push back on fees.
''People don't like the extra fees, they don't read the fine print and they get mad,'' said Ann Sheaffer, an accountant checking in for a Spirit flight to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. ''But it's all there in black and white. You just have to read it and understand it.''

HEADLINE: SAC Case Is Testing A Classic Dilemma

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Imagine the pressure on Mathew Martoma, the 38-year-old former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors charged with insider trading who may -- or may not -- be in a position to implicate Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund's billionaire founder and owner.
So far, Mr. Martoma has defiantly asserted his innocence and refused to cooperate with prosecutors. He could change his mind, but the clock is ticking. The government faces a mid-July deadline when it must decide whether to seek criminal charges against Mr. Cohen relating to the trades at the center of Mr. Martoma's case.
For all concerned, the stakes are huge. The government has already convicted 73 people in the last three years in an insider trading crackdown that in its sweep and impact has been without precedent on Wall Street. But none of them has had the iconic status of an Ivan Boesky, the 1980s arbitrageur who wore a wire to record secretly the junk bond titan Michael Milken. With a net worth estimated by Forbes at $9.3 billion, Mr. Cohen could be the marquee name that would lend the investigation a new level of public awareness and potential deterrence. 
Mr. Martoma could face decades in prison if convicted. His potential prison term is especially severe because the federal sentencing guidelines are based on the amount of the illegal profit, which in Mr. Martoma's case are said to be huge. Prosecutors have called the case the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever.
Mr. Martoma is married to a medical doctor and they have three children. A long prison term could be devastating for his family. With his wife and children inside his house in Florida, Mr. Martoma fainted on his front lawn in late 2011 when F.B.I. agents arrived to warn him that he might face charges.
But Mr. Martoma may also be in a uniquely advantageous position to make a deal with prosecutors. He's the only former SAC trader who, the government has said, had direct dealings with Mr. Cohen concerning suspicious trades. The government said the two had a 20-minute telephone conversation the night before SAC started trading shares of two pharmaceutical companies based on confidential information Mr. Martoma gained from a doctor involved in clinical trials of an important Alzheimer's drug. So far as is known, Mr. Martoma hasn't told prosecutors the substance of that conversation.
This is about as close as possible to what in game theory is known as the ''prisoner's dilemma,'' Randal Picker, University of Chicago law professor and a co-author of ''Game Theory and the Law,'' pointed out. The game was developed by RAND Corporation scientists and formalized in 1950 by a Princeton mathematician, Albert W. Tucker, who gave the game its name.
In the now-classic version, the police have arrested two suspects and are interrogating them in separate rooms. Each can either confess and implicate the other, or remain silent. If only one confesses, he goes free and the other gets a harsh sentence. If both confess, each gets a reduced sentence, but still goes to jail. If neither confesses, the government lacks the evidence needed to convict and both go free.
Game theorists have demonstrated that the rational choice, or dominant strategy, is always to confess and implicate the other, even though the optimal outcome for both occurs if neither cooperates. That's because, as Professor Picker explained, if one prisoner has confessed, the best the other can hope for is also to confess and get the moderate sentence rather than the harsher sentence reserved for those who don't cooperate. If one prisoner doesn't confess, the other can go free by implicating him. Although they collectively are better off if neither cooperates, their individual self-interest dictates cooperation.
That may be one reason that, when it comes to white-collar crime, ''the overwhelming majority of people tend to cooperate, in my experience,'' said John F. Savarese, a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and chairman of the New York City Bar Association's White Collar Criminal Law Committee.
That has certainly been the case in the current insider trading scandal. Of the 73 defendants who pleaded guilty or were convicted since 2009, 37 cooperated and only 10 have taken their cases to trial. (All were found guilty.)
So what explains the behavior of Mr. Martoma? ''The problem with games like the prisoners' dilemma is that they may not represent the real world where sophisticated parties are making the decisions,'' Professor Picker said. ''This isn't an episode of 'Law and Order.' ''
Mr. Martoma has already lost one round. Dr. Sidney Gilman, a once-distinguished neurologist at the University of Michigan Medical School who, the government says, was Mr. Martoma's source and co-conspirator in the scheme, agreed to cooperate with the government and implicated Mr. Martoma. That became a basis for the charges against him. In a close parallel to the outcome in the prisoner's dilemma game, Dr. Gilman won't be charged with any crime.
Government prosecutors, along with the judges who sentence those convicted, have created powerful inducements to cooperate. Wesley Wang, a former SAC analyst, admitted his role in an insider trading ring but cooperated and even worked undercover to record secretly his co-conspirators. Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court, Southern District of New York, sentenced Mr. Wang to two years of probation and praised his cooperation. The judge noted that prosecutors ''could not achieve the marvelous successes they've had in sophisticated crimes, like insider trading, without asking judges to give a very substantial benefit to cooperators.''
Compare Mr. Wang's outcome with that of Anthony Chiasson, a former hedge fund manager and SAC trader. Mr. Chiasson refused to cooperate, went to trial and was convicted. Judge Richard J. Sullivan sentenced Mr. Chiasson to six and a half years in prison and fined him $5 million. ''This kind of conduct can't go unpunished,'' Judge Sullivan said at the sentencing on May 13. ''I'm so sorry for your family and I'm so sorry for your wife.''
In this real world setting, ''judges in white collar cases give very tangible credit for cooperation,'' said Gary Naftalis, co-chairman of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel, who has represented many defendants who cooperated as well as those who didn't. One of those who didn't was Rajat Gupta, the retired head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company and former Goldman Sachs director, who was convicted of leaking inside information to Raj Rajaratnam, a billionaire hedge fund manager. ''A fair number of people have gotten probation as opposed to years in prison. No one in their right mind wants to spend years in jail.''
But as Professor Picker pointed out, other participants may try to change the rules, and the outcome of the game. ''A central premise of the game is that the prisoners can't communicate,'' he noted. ''But in the real world, they communicate all the time, both directly and through their lawyers.'' Given that Mr. Cohen is a billionaire, ''he has all sorts of ways to make you very comfortable if you don't cooperate. You change the payoff so that people see the situation differently.''
Financial incentives may also complicate the game. Cooperating and telling the truth might require forfeiting gains that would otherwise be beyond the government's reach. ''Let's say that the individual has $150 million personal exposure on another scheme or another aspect of the scheme under investigation that the government is either not aware of, not focusing on or otherwise unlikely to be able to prove without the client's cooperation, and coming clean means they have to sacrifice that,'' said Andrew Levander, a white-collar defense specialist at Dechert L.L.P. ''Even if they get convicted, they might decide that four to six years is worth it if they and their families have something to live on when they get out.''
Nor are real world participants equally important to prosecutors, as they are in the game. Situated as he is at the top of SAC, Mr. Cohen has no one above him to implicate. In theory, he could betray Mr. Martoma, but probably at the cost of implicating himself. Given Mr. Cohen's importance to prosecutors and Mr. Martoma's low-level status, Mr. Cohen's reward for cooperation would probably be minimal, if anything at all.
Lawyers may also influence the outcome, especially when their fees are being paid by another participant, as they routinely are in white-collar cases. Mr. Martoma's fees are being paid by SAC. SAC surprised many defense lawyers recently when it said it would no longer cooperate itself. (Most businesses at least pay lip service to cooperation, even when they hope the government will fail to make a case.)
Mr. Martoma has already switched counsel, from Charles A. Stillman to Richard M. Strassberg. Both are prominent white-collar defense lawyers with reputations for opposing the government rather than cooperating, although their strategies naturally vary depending on the interests of their clients. Mr. Savarese said he couldn't comment on the Martoma case, but in general, refusing to cooperate is ''bolder, riskier and takes intestinal fortitude.'' Still, he added, ''that can be a smart strategy.''
It's especially smart when a defendant is innocent and can't implicate anyone else, which may turn out to be the case with Mr. Martoma. Mr. Cohen, too, may be innocent of any wrongdoing with nothing of value to offer prosecutors. The prisoner's dilemma game assumes that both prisoners are guilty and in a position to incriminate the other prisoner.
Mr. Strassberg didn't respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for SAC and Mr. Cohen declined to comment.
On the other hand, if potential defendants are in a position to incriminate someone else, it can be risky to rely solely on someone else's failure to cooperate. Mr. Strassberg represented Martha Stewart's broker, Peter E. Bacanovic, in what is often cited as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Both Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic told the same innocent but false story about Ms. Stewart's well-timed sale of ImClone Systems stock. Both refused to cooperate and went to trial, accused of making false statements. But this turned out to be more than a two-prisoner game. A third participant, Mr. Bacanovic's assistant, cooperated and testified against them. Both were convicted and went to jail.
Other pressures may weigh on the decision: a sense of honor and loyalty; of not wanting to betray a colleague or someone who has made them wealthy; a fear of retribution. Several white-collar defense lawyers told me that it's an anguishing decision, but ultimately most defendants act in their own best interests, not that of someone else they're trying to protect.
All of which would seem to point to Mr. Martoma's deciding to cooperate. The problem is that ''game theory can offer important insights, but it doesn't dictate the results,'' Professor Picker said. ''Game theorists will say that if you don't like an outcome, you change the rules of the game. You change the payoffs so people see the situation differently. Then, all bets are off.''

HEADLINE: Loans From a Bank Supported by the Family Tree

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
MANY 20-somethings with a business idea -- or a gap between their income and their living expenses -- turn to the bank of mom and dad for help. This is hardly new, even if the numbers are increasing.
But a subset of parents, many quite wealthy, is responding not with handouts but with loans that children apply for and that require approval by parents, relatives, or even people outside the family, as they would at a bank.
These families are working to support their children's interests without robbing them of motivation, causing rifts among their siblings or even running afoul of the Internal Revenue Service, which may wonder whether these loans are really gifts.
''My advice is to start early and small and allow it to grow,'' said Warner King Babcock, chairman and chief executive of AM Private Enterprises, a registered investment adviser in New Canaan, Conn. 
Mr. Babcock, a chemist by training, knows whereof he speaks. When he was in his early 20s and working for his father's engineering and construction materials company in Greenwich, Conn., he got an idea for a type of waterproofing that would work in extreme conditions. His father backed the idea financially, and Mr. Babcock patented and began selling the coating.
The company sold its high-performance coatings to clients like zoos and nuclear power plants. But seven years into the venture, Mr. Babcock told his father that he was leaving, even though the company was doing well.
Today, he chooses his words carefully so as not to offend his siblings.
''I felt early on that I had a lot of freedom and I was empowered to grow the firm,'' he said. ''As time went on, I felt that there was more involvement in the key decisions, and it got to a point where that caused friction. If there was an outside board that could have acted as a buffer, that would have helped.''
That experience informed his later work as an investment adviser to large, wealthy families.
Mr. Babcock is trying to share the benefits and perils of what is often called the family bank with a wider audience. In this, he is part of a small group of advisers that sees formal lending in a family as a way to invest in ideas from younger generations, provide financing when real banks may be hesitant and teach lessons about stewardship and responsibility.
Here's some of what families of more modest means can learn.
HOW TO DO IT RIGHT Parents hardly need to be told that their children are having trouble supporting themselves after finishing school. But a recent report from Junior Achievement and the Allstate Foundation said that the number of high school students expecting to be financially dependent on their parents into their late 20s had more than doubled in the last two years, to 25 percent from 12 percent.
According to the report, parents have also resigned themselves to offering some level of financial assistance through those years. The parents cited the poor job market and economy, and changing societal norms.
This is where loans in a family may be a way of supporting a child's idea without making it seem like a handout.
Whether a family is making a $10,000 or a $1 million loan, the most successful lay out criteria for lending. They could say that loans will be made for business ventures, investments or a mortgage on a house, but not for living expenses or travel. They could require everyone to submit a business plan.
''If you have a family bank set up where there is a system or a process for asking the family for loans, it cuts out all the issues of people asking for money and saying you like my sister better,'' said Mindy Rosenthal, president of the Institute for Private Investors, an organization that recently hosted a seminar on the Web about family banks. ''All the processes and procedures cut out all this family dynamics.''
From there, the loan should include language explaining that it must be repaid and what will happen if the endeavor fails.
Mr. Babcock said he knows of one family that requires collateral before making a loan. Others, he said, require periodic updates on the business and reserve the right to offer advice or renegotiate loan terms if the business is struggling. If the loan can't be repaid, Mr. Babcock said a family that had documented it could write it off the way a bank would.
HOW IT GOES WRONG As with anything in a family, there are many ways that lending money to relatives can end badly.
Mr. Babcock said he would never advise a highly dysfunctional family to create a family bank. If family members could not communicate civilly, then lending money would just add to the conflict.
There are also legal requirements. The I.R.S. has guidelines on how much interest needs to be charged, depending on the length of a loan. Known as the applicable federal rate, or A.F.R., the interest is low -- about 1 percent for loans from three to nine years -- but the I.R.S. expects parents to collect it.
These guidelines cover documentation, too. If there was not a real loan agreement or interest charged, the I.R.S. could say that the loan was really a gift and levy gift taxes, interest and penalties on it, or it could say that a loan that was forgiven when a business failed was actually income for the recipient.
''The I.R.S. assumes intrafamily loans are disguised gifts,'' said Thorne Perkin, managing director at Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. ''You need to document these things. You need to set up a payment schedule. You need to use something above that A.F.R. rate.''
Mr. Perkin said parents often use their annual gift exclusion, now $14,000, to forgive interest, and many loans are structured to be interest-only with the principal due at the end. Still, it is important to have documents in place.
Another risk is that such low rates for intrafamily loans push parents to make loans without thinking about the consequences.
''We generally make sure that the client can afford to lose the liquidity of the assets, and that they're working with their accountant and attorney and understand the tax consequences of doing so,'' said Ann D. Bjerke, senior wealth strategist at UBS Financial Services.
The interest on the loan, for example, needs to be claimed as income by the lender.
LESSONS BEYOND THE LOAN Helping children is at the heart of these loans. But if done right, they can do a lot more than provide low-interest financing that a bank might not approve.
One is increasing children's understanding of finance and lowering their sense of entitlement, said Richard Orlando, president and chief executive of Legacy Capitals, a family consultancy.
''Raising their financial I.Q. helps the next generation apply for loans, put together business plans and pay back loans,'' he said. ''It also teaches them about being responsible, doing their homework, and collaborating with other members to get loans.''
Just as important, a family bank with set lending criteria can help parents step out of the process so that their children have to present their plans to a board that might consist of family attorneys and advisers. The board could challenge the children without stirring up family resentments.
Mr. Babcock said parents can also decide to create a soft bank with an intent to educate their children. Whereas a hard bank would manage the loans for profit, almost as alternative investments in a family's portfolio, a soft bank would look at the loans as a way to develop the human capital of their children. One way might to be invest in a child's floral shop, with an understanding that it could fail but would teach business lessons along the way.
''Money can do a lot of things,'' he said. ''But the last thing parents want it to do is create bad behavior patterns from a young age.''

HEADLINE: Decline Late in Session Caps a Volatile Week

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks sold off in late trading on Wall Street to close sharply lower on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrials shedding more than 200 points.
For the first time since November, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posted a loss in consecutive weeks. Investors seemed willing to take money off the table after several months of gains.
The S.& P. 500 ended May up 2.1 percent, its seventh straight month of gains -- the longest streak since 2009. The index is up 14.3 percent in 2013, scoring its best five-month start to a year since 1997. Over the last seven months, it has climbed 15.5 percent. 
Trading has been volatile for most of the week on concerns that the Federal Reserve will retreat from its monetary policy, the main engine behind the strong rally in equities this year.
Data on Friday pointed to a soft American economy but failed to quell speculation about possible action by the Fed. Consumer spending fell in April for the first time in almost a year, and inflation pressures were subdued.
But a separate report showed manufacturing rose more than expected in May, reflecting an expansion of business activity after a contraction in April.
''The economic data we have seen over the last week or so has been quite positive,'' said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Knight Capital in Jersey City. He added: ''It also speaks to the fact that tapering or a shift in monetary policy is more likely -- the more positive it is. As a result, people are more than happy to ring the register -- you never go broke ringing the register on a winning trade.''
Selling accelerated near the market's close with the rebalancing of the MSCI indexes at the end of the day. Credit Suisse forecast $19 billion in total trading as a result of the rebalancing, with $15 billion related to developed markets.
''What's happened in the last hour here, there's some index and month-end rebalancing that accelerated the downturn,'' said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president of BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Ala.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 208.96 points, or 1.36 percent, to close at 15,115.57. The S.& P. 500 lost 23.67 points, or 1.43 percent, to finish at 1,630.74. The Nasdaq composite fell 35.39 points, or 1.01 percent, to end at 3,455.91.
For the week, the Dow fell 1.2 percent, the S.& P. 500 lost 1.1 percent, and the Nasdaq dipped 0.1 percent. For May, the Dow rose 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq gained 3.8 percent.
The stock market's advance this year has come largely on supportive monetary policies from central banks around the world, which helped the markets ignore the Wall Street adage of ''sell in May, go away'' -- a historical trend of seasonal weakness. In May 2012, the S.& P. 500 fell 6.3 percent.
Energy and health care stocks were among the session's worst performers, with Pfizer and Exxon Mobil the two biggest drags on the S.& P. 500. Pfizer lost 3.6 percent to $27.23, while the S.& P. health care sector index dropped 2.2 percent. Exxon Mobil slid 1.8 percent to $90.47. The S.& P. energy sector index lost 2 percent.
Palo Alto Networks shares lost 10.8 percent to $48.52 after the company gave an outlook that was below expectations.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32 on Friday, to 96 19/32, as its yield rose to 2.13 percent, from 2.12 percent late Thursday evening.

HEADLINE: U.S. Targets Iran's Petrochemical Industry

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The Obama administration on Friday escalated efforts to isolate Iran economically, blacklisting Iranian companies in the petrochemical industry for the first time and punishing five businesses in four other countries for conspiring to evade American sanctions aimed at restricting Iranian oil sales and air transportation.
The new steps came a day after the administration issued sanctions against a top aide of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and more than 50 other Iranian officials for what it called their efforts to repress dissent and free speech in Iran, where presidential elections are scheduled in two weeks. 
Under the increasingly strict sanctions on Iran, the United States freezes any American assets of blacklisted companies and individuals and bans them from doing business with any American companies or citizens. In addition, companies and individuals in other countries who help Iran evade sanctions can be cut off from the American financial system and face other restrictions.
''We are committed to intensifying the pressure against Iran, not only by adopting new sanctions, but also by actively enforcing our sanctions and preventing sanctions evasion,'' David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary whose office oversees the sanctions effort, said in a statement. ''Today's actions take aim at revenues from Iran's petrochemical sector, as well as deceptive schemes Iran has employed in an effort to evade sanctions on its oil sales and its airlines.''
The United States has never before aimed direct sanctions at Iran's petrochemicals industry, which Treasury officials said had become an important source of revenue to the Iranian government as sales of oil -- its most important export -- have fallen sharply in the past few years because of the effects of other sanctions, including a European Union embargo.
''The administration is taking action today to target this revenue stream by both designating companies involved in transactions with the sector and identifying several petrochemical companies as subject to sanctions because they are controlled by the Iranian government,'' the Treasury statement said.
The blacklist announced Friday covers eight companies scattered throughout Iran, five of them in special economic zones designed in part to encourage foreign investment.
American and European Union sanctions on Iran are aimed largely at pressing the country to halt its uranium enrichment activities, which the Iranians say are peaceful but which Western governments suspect are a cover for achieving the ability to make nuclear weapons.
Negotiations over the uranium enrichment have stalled with little expectation of progress anytime soon, particularly with Iran's approaching elections. A leading presidential candidate, Saeed Jalili, the country's unyielding nuclear negotiator and a protégé of Ayatollah Khamenei, has vowed that Iran will never bend to Western economic pressure on the nuclear issue.
The non-Iranian companies targeted by the American sanctions include Ferland Company, which is based in Cyprus and Ukraine and is accused of helping Iran disguise an oil shipment to evade sanctions; and Kyrgyz Trans Avia of Kyrgyzstan, Ukrainian-Mediterranean Airlines and Bukovyna Airlines of Ukraine, and Sirjanco Trading L.L.C. of the United Arab Emirates, all accused of helping Iran procure aircraft used to move illicit cargo to the Syrian government in its war against a two-year-old insurgency. Iran is Syria's major regional ally in that conflict.
Despite rising inflation and a weakening currency caused in part by the sanctions, the Iranian government has said it is weathering the economic deprivations. On Friday, the deputy economic minister, Behrouz Alishiri, was quoted by the semiofficial Fars News Agency as saying said Iran enjoyed ''remarkable growth'' in foreign investment this past year.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and a look at the president&#8217;s weekly address, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
Navy investigators are examining a female student's claim that she was raped by several midshipmen at the Naval Academy who were not punished after the assault even as she faced discipline, Jim Risen reports. The investigation at the elite academy, which has sputtered along for about a year, has come to light as the military faces intense pressure to reverse a rising tide of sexual assaults within its ranks. 
Robert Pear dissects a report issued Friday that predicted a brighter future for Medicare and a stable but unsustainable position for Social Security as the economy improves and health care spending falls. The report, from the trustees of Medicare, urges Congress to strengthen financing for both programs.
President Obama is urging Congress to take action to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling next month, when a temporary extension of the current rates expires. But, as Sarah Wheaton explains, the president and Democrats disagree with Republicans over what would make a good permanent solution. The Senate is expected to vote next week to extend the current rates for two more years.
John M. Broder explains a high-stakes fight between environmental groups and a forestry panel over how timbers are labeled that aims to test new federal rules laying out the circumstances under which a company can claim that a product or process is environmentally sound.
 The Weekly Address: 
Pointing to improvements in the economy, President Obama prodded Congress to encourage further growth by taking steps to aid homeowners, create infrastructure jobs and overhaul the nation's immigration laws. "We've got to keep this progress going until middle-class families start regaining that sense of security," he said. "And we can't let partisan politics get in the way."
 Happening in Washington: 
Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, and Bill Russell, the Hall of Fame basketball player and coach, will receive the Lincoln Medal on Sunday at the Ford's Theater gala. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is expected to attend the ceremony.
President Obama's week ahead includes hosting a mental health conference, meeting with the president of Chile, congratulating the Baltimore Ravens on winning the Super Bowl, and a stop in Charlotte, N.C., on the way to Los Angeles, where he will meet with the president of China.

HEADLINE: The Myth of Gatsby's Suffering Middle Class

BYLINE: AMITY SHLAES


HIGHLIGHT: In the &#8217;20s, the pleasures of the rich did not inflict suffering on the rest. 

 BODY:
Another decade, another Gatsby. The actors change but the message put forward in the adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 book stays the same. The 1920s were as ephemeral as a Champagne bubble. A fake stock market, an illicit liquor business and other falsehoods made Jay Gatsby and others like him into correspondingly false millionaires. The pleasure of the rich, "careless people," as a character calls them, came at a cost to the rest, especially the middle class, the small people, mere ants in black tie to be trampled by giants like Gatsby at their parties.
The inaccuracy here starts with the cinematic detail. The new Gatsby is set in the early 1920s.
The narrator, Nick Carraway, informs us that the stock market is hitting extraordinary levels. But in the early 1920s stocks did not roar ahead like Gatsby's car. In the summer of 1922, around the time when the heroine Daisy visits Gatsby in West Egg, the Dow Jones industrial average actually stood lower than it had in the summer of 1919. Even the car prop in this film yields anachronism: the Duesenberg model Gatsby drives in the film is a copy of a 1929 version, not an early 1920s vehicle. 
And the view of the middle class? The central premise of the Gatsby films, that the rich got rich faster than the others, is true. Decades ago, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets pointed out the increase in disparities in a much-admired paper, "Shares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings." Other scholars, seeking precision, suggested a key ratio: the top 7 percent of the nonfarm population gained at a cost to the rest, the bottom 93 percent.
But whether the new gains of the rich did come at a cost to the rest is not clear. The scholar Gene Smiley of Marquette University spent much of his career looking at what the nonrich, the ants in Gatsby, that bottom 93 percent, actually got, relative to the rich and more important relative to themselves.
The great broadening between rich and nonrich in 1920 that Mr. Kuznets had seen, Mr. Smiley found, was perhaps exaggerated by early experts. In addition, Mr. Smiley posited, reasonably enough, that what matters to people is not how they are doing relative to the rich but how they are doing relative to their own past and their own expectations. His data found that real per capita income of the bottom 93 percent of nonfarm households actually increased in the 1920s.
The 1920s began with disruption and trouble. Joblessness plagued cities. Low commodity prices hurt farmers, who struggled to hold on to their farms. Blacks suffered in the angry South and Midwest, where, especially in the early years, the Ku Klux Klan oppressed them and lynchings occurred. Women had voted in their first presidential election in 1920, and many more were college graduates than in previous times. But many believed that all they could do with their education was more cogently assess the drudgeries of mothering.
In an essay called "A Middle-Class Wife" published in The New Republic in 1917, a young math major recounted her shock at the amount of work it took to keep house for a husband and two children. "I shall not tell over the tale of the things there are to do, cooking and mending and washing and baby-tending," the author, Alice Austin White, wrote.
But then, like a yacht on Long Island Sound, improvements appeared on the horizon. Virtually everyone can agree that the single most important economic factor in the life of workers, middle- or lower-class, is a job. And here the 1920s delivered enviably: after the early recession, unemployment dropped below 5 percent and stayed below that marker much of the time. Wages rose, especially for skilled workers.
The quality of work life improved as well. Historically, Americans had worked on Saturday. But now, because of productivity gains from machines, weeks of 50 or even 45 hours were possible. In 1920, scholars surveyed companies and found that only 32 had cut back to five-day workweeks. By 1927, 262 large companies instituted five-day workweeks. Henry Ford solidified the trend when the automaker moved to five days in 1926. The 1920s are the decade that signaled the arrival of a gift that still means a lot to us: Saturday.
What did people do with their free Saturday? They drove their new toy, the automobile. In 1920, a quarter of families had cars. By 1930, more than half did. What mattered to these drivers was not that a Gatsby had a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, but that they had a Ford.
Material changes also took place right in the home that The New Republic's author described. In 1920, 35 percent of households had electricity. By 1930, that share was 68 percent. Electricity brought appliances into homes, including electric irons and washing machines. The old drudgery was reduced; women began to enjoy free time. They could even fool around with another great innovation, the typewriter. In short, being stuck in the middle class became more enjoyable in the 1920s.
To see America's 1920s middle-class experience in context, it helps to consider how we think of the rest of the world today. Specifically, it is important to ask what material benefit symbolizes arrival in the middle class elsewhere in the world. Indians have chosen their definition, one that makes sense to the rest of us: indoor plumbing. If a family has an indoor toilet, it is, or is becoming, middle class. The 1920s were the decade when America enjoyed the transformation that India has just enjoyed. At the decade's start, 2 in 10 American homes could boast indoor flush toilets. By 1930, more than 5 in 10 did.
But that is not all. As the decade progressed, there were other gains. Farmers languished, but those who moved to town did find jobs. Blacks still suffered, but the Ku Klux Klan faltered in the last third of the decade. Lynching did not disappear, but the Historical Statistics of the United States show that the rate of such murders dropped.
What made all this improvement possible? New ideas, and an environment that fostered them. Patents hit record rates. More important, companies began to use the new patented ideas to develop machines in factories that in turn made production much cheaper. The classic case of such improvement was the automobile tire. From 1910 to 1930, the cost per tire of driving 1,000 miles dropped from about $10 to about $1.
It hadn't always been true in the United States that good ideas found the capital needed to finance them. But in the 1920s, they did. The general sense was that if the rich prospered, the rest might do better than before. This attitude was validated by tax data. The Wilson, Harding and Coolidge administrations all cut tax rates. Following these cuts, more revenue than the authorities had expected flowed in. But, crucially, the wealthy also paid a greater share of the taxes.
This happy, middle-class decade did not please all, especially those in the progressive movement. Progressives had anticipated that the 1920s would be a decade of radical reform, involving nationalization of key industries like hydropower.
A special shock to radicals was the 1924 presidential election, in which the very middle-class and middle-brow Calvin Coolidge won, beating the Progressive Party's Robert La Follette and the Democratic candidate John W. Davis.
The Progressives rightly began to perceive this healthy middle class and its conservative voting habits as an existential threat. Around the time Fitzgerald was writing "Gatsby," another author, Sinclair Lewis, was dedicating a whole book to creating the Babbitt character, an indictment of the middle class. Lewis wrote of his antihero, George Babbitt: "He had enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding of all mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty." Yet later, Lewis attacked Coolidge directly, in a book about the banality of the bourgeoisie. Lewis titled the book, a rant against the average American, "The Man Who Knew Coolidge."
That book sold poorly. Then, as now, Americans preferred Gatsby, seeing in the figure not just falsehood, but also the possibility that they, too, might become rich. Fitzgerald's book itself, as opposed to the film, also offers such a possibility. Carraway, the narrator, does not hate Jay Gatsby, but comes to see him as the only hero of the story.
Given all this knowledge, one has to ask: whither the durability of the myth that the 1920s were bad? Again, the explanation is probably more emotional than logical. The evidence that the Crash of 1929 forced the 10-year Depression that followed is scant. Markets had crashed many times before without decades of joblessness. Nearly all economists, including those who express concern over income disparities of the 1920s, count multiple factors at work preventing recovery in the 1930s. They do not blame stock prices, or even President Coolidge. Yet it is human nature to believe that when an event follows an event, the first event causes the second. The misery of the '30s was of such magnitude, or so the narrative suggests, that most people want to believe it must have been preceded a force of similar magnitude. Post hoc, ergo Gatsby.
That doesn't mean that we all have to believe the 1920s fallacy, however, or promote it. Indeed, it might be useful to take some of the policies of the 1920s as models for today. Replicating the 1920s results, in any case, both Democrats and Republicans would consider progress. "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past," Fitzgerald wrote at his book's conclusion. Even those who share Fitzgerald's fatalism vis-à-vis the 1920s can certainly take pleasure in a simple reality. The past is not always bad.

HEADLINE: Whither the Hatchet Job?

BYLINE: CLIVE JAMES


HIGHLIGHT: In Britain, blasting someone&#8217;s reputation is recognized blood sport. 

 BODY:
Watching "High Noon" again the other day, I wondered how postwar British culture ever found the strength to continue breathing. America's global economic clout can be belittled only if you believe that no American cultural product is any good. Since it is undeniable that the occasional American cultural product is marvelous, I was left looking for cultural things that the Americans couldn't do. The only one I can think of is hostile literary criticism.
America does polite literary criticism well enough. And how: there is a new Lionel Trilling on every campus. But America can't do the bitchery of British book reviewing and literary commentary.
In Britain, the realm of book reviewing is still known as Grub Street though the actual Grub Street vanished long ago. But its occasionally vicious spirit lives on; one of the marks of Grub Street is that the spleen gets a voice. Ripping somebody's reputation is recognized blood sport. Shredding a new book is a kind of fox hunting that is still legal today. 
Such critical violence is far less frequent in America. Any even remotely derogatory article in an American journal is called "negative," and hardly any American publication wants to be negative.
In America, consensus is considered normal and controversy is confusing. Zoë Heller's recent attempt, in The New York Review of Books, to prove that Salman Rushdie's book "Joseph Anton: A Memoir" was less than magnificent is a very rare example of a critical review in an American publication.
Immediately, as if a switch had been thrown, the review became more famous than the book. Onlookers hailed the review as a sure candidate for Hatchet Job of the Year, a prize that actually exists, out there in the boiling blogosphere.
In my reading of Ms. Heller's review, she didn't seem to question Mr. Rushdie's importance but rather seemed merely to find piquancy in the fact that he never questioned it either. She carefully conceded that if hundreds of thousands of people are offered a reward for your head, then you can be excused for regarding yourself as the natural subject of current historical conversation. She might have added that you can also be excused for collecting lifetime female partners the way Jay Leno collects sports cars. But on the whole Ms. Heller said nothing that might not have shown up, in Britain, in a feature on the same subject carried by almost any serious literary publication.
In The New York Review of Books, however, the piece was remarkable, generating many an argument at highbrow dinner parties. Its alien quality was underlined, perhaps, by the fact that Ms. Heller is actually a British import: like the late Christopher Hitchens, she voiced her British acerbity in a polite context, and found, as he did, that the locals were wonderfully easy to stir up. (The British expression is "wind up": rather more cruel, when you think about it, because it treats people as tin toys.)
At one stage in my life, I was asked to review a prominent book that I thought needed putting down, and found myself in a position similar to Ms. Heller's. It was in the late '70s when John le Carré was in the full power of his later phase of production and The New York Review of Books asked me to write a review of his latest book. I was scarcely a chapter into it before I felt the glue closing over my head.
I wrote that Mr. le Carré's style had become verbose and implausible by his own standard, which had been set by his early books, especially by "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold," which I called a masterpiece. But no writer wants to hear that he has lapsed from greatness. He wants to hear, at the very least, that his greatness has acquired an extra layer of subtlety, even if it looks like incompetence.
IN my role as Mr. le Carré's nemesis, I had already experienced what it felt like to be stomped on in print. Years before, John Carey, one of the cleverest of the Oxbridge dons moonlighting in Grub Street, brought all his wit and knowledge to the task of shriveling my first collection of essays, "The Metropolitan Critic." I slept badly for months.
Then, several years later, he extolled my book "Unreliable Memoirs," and I felt all the better for having once felt miserable. It was part of the give and take of the British literary world.
Mr. le Carré, however, had never had a really bad review in his life until I ambushed him in America. He just wasn't used to it. My review was undoubtedly a hatchet job and Mr. le Carré was right to be annoyed. For one thing, a "negative" review in such an influential publication could hardly be good for the book's chances in America, although in fact it became a best seller anyway. Mr. le Carré, nonetheless, let it be known that he thought I had set out to damage him.
I hadn't. But I can see how it might have seemed like that to him. Having far too much fun as I picked out the book's absurdities and pomposities, I had written a British-style killer book review but I had published it in an American context. In that fact lay the insult and the injury.
British writers know that they are in a cockpit at home but when their books come out in America they expect to be safe. Usually they are; and anyone deputed to take them down usually has to be brought in from outside, like Ms. Heller or, dare I say it, myself. American culture is a polite culture and probably the better for it.
Sometimes I wonder, though. There was a time when the American literary world grew its own hatchet persons, and could rejoice in the thoroughness with which Mary McCarthy dismembered the reputation of Lillian Hellman.
But among young writers, there seems a shortage of critics unhampered by excessive good manners. Why this should be so is a bit of a mystery. It could be that the typical established publication has become too impressed with its own self-imposed status as a journal of record, which must confine itself to the facts; and that a complex, nuanced statement sounds not enough like a fact, and hence must be confined to the blogs, where nobody has any manners anyway.
When I read the brilliant young Alice Gregory, in Slate, struggling to express how she simultaneously approves and disapproves of the journalism of Janet Malcolm, I want to lean through her study window (Alice Gregory's, not Janet Malcolm's) and explain that the whole secret of literary journalism is to express both sides of a question at once, and that only in America could that imperative seem abnormal. Alice, you can't eliminate the negative. It accentuates the positive.

HEADLINE: Defying Nature With Exuberant Design

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN. 
Celestine Bohlen is a former New York Times Rome bureau chief now based in Paris.

 BODY:
It happened each time we drove into one of southeastern Sicily's hill towns. It could be a village or a big town, run-down or fixed-up, but as we drove uphill toward the historic center, the vision ahead was always roughly the same: a stunning Baroque church, honey-colored or pale white, decorated with columns or curves, angels or Cupids, shells or leaves, urns or shields, sometimes all of the above. A bell tower might be missing or there might be grass growing between the paving stones, but each of those churches exemplified what unfolds all across this corner of Sicily: an exuberant style that played itself out on facades of churches and palazzi in the wake of a devastating earthquake in 1693.
Late Sicilian Baroque was a defiant answer to nature's wrath, an ambitious affirmation of wealth and faith, delivered by an all-powerful local aristocracy. ''In Rome, the Baroque was all about the power of the church,'' said Nuccio Iacono, a local historian, whom I met for a drink on a February evening in Ragusa Ibla, the old center of Ragusa, near one of the region's masterpieces, the sumptuous three-tiered Cathedral of St. George, whose construction began in 1738 according to a design by the noted architect Rosario Gagliardi. ''Here it is about rebirth.'' 
This was my fourth visit to the region. I first discovered the town of Noto, 31 miles from Ragusa Ibla, in the 1980s, when its gorgeous tawny churches and palazzi were crumbling, mostly from neglect. I came back a decade later as a reporter to write an article about the partial collapse in 1996 of Noto's Cathedral of St. Nicholas, a man-made disaster blamed on the knuckle-headed idea of constructing a concrete roof over the nave.
By the time I returned for a third visit, in 2011, another rebirth was under way: the Noto cathedral, and much of the town's central district, had been restored. The same was true of many of the churches and palazzi in Ragusa Ibla, and on the narrow streets and seafront facades on Syracuse's Ortygia Peninsula, two other jewels of Sicilian Baroque.
Once the domain of old men and cats, squalor and low-level crime, these towns are now bursting with hotels and restaurants. Between visiting architectural gems you can sample the delicious gelato and granita, the Sicilian water-based ice specialty, of which arguably the best can be found at Gelati DiVini in Ragusa Ibla and at Caffè Sicilia in Noto.
During my 2011 visit to Palazzolo Acreide, a small town with a population of about 9,000, I wandered away from the main piazza, past the ethnographic Museum of Antonino Ucelli, which concentrates on Sicilian peasant traditions, and happened upon an intriguing sign for another museum: the brand-new Museum of Noble Traditions.
The sign said the museum was open but it was not, a familiar Italian paradox. So I went around the corner, where I found Titti Zabert Colombo, busying herself in the gift shop. It turned out she was the person single-handedly responsible for restoring the ruins of the former Palazzo Rizzarelli Spadaro, which once belonged to the illustrious Ruffo di Calabria family, and turning it into the completely restored, bright-blue museum.
Signora Zabert, at 71 years old, is a diminutive dynamo, a transplant from northern Italy who has dedicated her life to turning Palazzolo Acreide into a living laboratory of cultural tourism. Her goal is not just the restoration of old buildings -- which, besides the Palazzo Rizzarelli Spadaro, include several private houses on a main piazza -- but the encouragement of cultural activities and the attraction of foreign investment. ''Sicily doesn't have natural resources, it has culture,'' she said to me more than once.
On that first meeting, we walked through the town, where she pointed out the 18th-century Palazzo di Politi, which she wants to turn into a retreat for Nobel Prize winners, and a cluster of medieval houses, nestled on the site of a long-gone castle, with stunning views of the valley, which she hopes to sell to cultured Italians and foreigners. ''There are so many possibilities,'' she kept telling me. ''È giusto? Is it true?''
Intrigued by Signora Zabert -- or Titti, as she insisted I call her -- I returned the next winter, after persuading her to give me a tour of what she calls ''Sicilia minore,'' or the region's lesser-known towns. So on a windy night, there I was, back in Palazzolo, where Titti introduced me to a group of friends over a delicious dinner at Lo Scrigno dei Sapori, one of her favorite restaurants. Among the guests were Carlo Scibetta, the mayor of Palazzolo; a father-son team of architects; an English couple who had bought a house in town; and a rare-book expert from the nearby city of Syracuse and his professor wife.
We started with a feast of local specialties -- from baked ricotta with wild fennel and thistle to marmalades made from onions, wild pears and Sicilian blood oranges; arancini (rice balls coated with bread crumbs); a selection of fish antipasti; various pasta dishes and -- the pièce de résistance -- a local sausage that was the culinary star of the town's carnival festivities, just then winding down in the main piazza.
Mayor Scibetta is justly proud of Palazzolo's festivals: the highlight is the feast of San Paolo in late June, when the town is festooned with confetti, known as nzaredde, which are shot into the air like fireworks. Mayor Scibetta said the work that goes into creating and carrying the floats keeps the young people of Palazzolo busy at a time when youth unemployment is around 50 percent.
''We need projects that make the most of what we have,'' Mayor Scibetta said. ''But it should be done with the involvement of the community. Otherwise, the people won't have a stake.''
Like so much of Sicily, Palazzolo has benefited from a cultural pile-on. The Greeks left behind a magnificent theater on the top of one hill, known as Akrai; the Normans bequeathed a medieval castle, now in ruins; the late 19th century put a touch of Art Nouveau (known as Liberty in Italy) to the monuments in the cemetery. Outside of town, along the Anapo River, are tombs left behind by an ancient people known as the Siculi; clusters of more than 5,000 tombs can be visited at the nearby Pantalica Necropolis.
The next day, Titti and I set off on a daylong exploration of the region. As we drove, the landscape seemed to change with every curve in the road (in one place, a piece of the road had actually disappeared, washed away by heavy rains the week before).
We dipped down into stark rock-faced valleys that looked like Afghanistan, and then climbed back up toward rolling countryside that looked like England, with fields divided by low stone walls. It wasn't yet spring, but in places it was already green, spotted with the faint pink of early almond flowers, and gray-green of the olive trees.
Buscemi, a tiny town of 1,100 people, was our first stop and, sure enough, we quickly came across a Baroque church -- San Antonio di Padua, which, as Baroque churches go, was relatively discreet, with a three-bell belfry on top that looks like a hat. But there were more ahead, including the imposing Mother Church, or Chiesa Madre. We stopped at the church of San Giacomo. There Titti bounded up a side staircase to take in the view of the Anapo Valley below.
''The spectacle is best from up here,'' she proclaimed, and she was right: the view was gorgeous.
Mr. Iacono, the historian, later picked up on the same theatrical theme. ''Sicilian Baroque is really a set design,'' he said. ''It's all on the outside -- the light and the shadows, the beautiful and the ugly.''
Another town on our route was Ferla, with not one but four magnificent churches posted along the main street, like sentinels. One was San Antonio Abate, with its unusual concave exterior, a missing belfry and raggedy courtyard.
In the countryside, we stopped by various agriturismos, essentially rural B & Bs. They are usually inexpensive, and offer dinner, with locally made wine, olive oils and cheeses. My favorite was Anapama, a small, elegant B & B at the bottom of a steep road in the valley below Palazzolo, with three bedrooms decorated in Indian textiles and rugs from the Caucasus, a swimming pool and breakfast tables beneath persimmon trees.
The next day, I met up with a friend from Rome, Elisabetta Povoledo, the International Herald Tribune's Italy correspondent, and headed to Caltagirone, a town of 39,000, perhaps best known not for its 28 churches, but for its yellow and blue ceramics, sold in dozens of stores and on display on the 142 steps of the Scalinata di Santa Maria. It is one of eight Baroque towns in the region -- together with Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa and Scicli -- added to the Unesco list of World Heritage sites in 2002.
We then turned south, to Scicli (pronounced as cheeklee), described by the British art historian Anthony Blunt as ''Baroque preserved in aspic.'' A prime example is the Palazzo Beneventano, festooned with grotesque faces, some scowling, some howling.
It was Sunday, which meant that the great church of Sant' Ignazio was open, and we could catch a glimpse of the extraordinary Madonna of the Militia, whose miraculous appearance in 1091 is said to have saved local Normans from an attack by invading Moors.
A life-size statue of this warrior virgin, decked in armor, with locks of black hair, sits high upon a rearing horse, brandishing a sword. Under the horse's feet are the figures of two writhing Moors, undoubtedly an uncomfortable sight for visiting North Africans.
For our last stop, we took a detour away from the Baroque, to Donnafugata, an eclectic, overwhelmingly 19th-century castle, with a view of the Mediterranean from its mock-Venetian terrace. This was once the domain of Baron Corrado Arezzo, heir of an old Ragusa family, who was so powerful that he redirected the local railroad so that the trains stopped at the gates of his estate.
Here, for 8 euros, about $10, you can get a glimpse of the faded glory of the once mighty Sicilian aristocracy. Now the property of the local government, Donnafugata, with its peeling wallpaper and frayed rugs, is a nostalgic reminder of a society that once valued power and beauty in equal measure.

HEADLINE: Whither the Hatchet Job?

BYLINE: By CLIVE JAMES

 BODY:
Watching ''High Noon'' again the other day, I wondered how postwar British culture ever found the strength to continue breathing. America's global economic clout can be belittled only if you believe that no American cultural product is any good. Since it is undeniable that the occasional American cultural product is marvelous, I was left looking for cultural things that the Americans couldn't do. The only one I can think of is hostile literary criticism.
America does polite literary criticism well enough. And how: there is a new Lionel Trilling on every campus. But America can't do the bitchery of British book reviewing and literary commentary.
In Britain, the realm of book reviewing is still known as Grub Street though the actual Grub Street vanished long ago. But its occasionally vicious spirit lives on; one of the marks of Grub Street is that the spleen gets a voice. Ripping somebody's reputation is recognized blood sport. Shredding a new book is a kind of fox hunting that is still legal today. 
Such critical violence is far less frequent in America. Any even remotely derogatory article in an American journal is called ''negative,'' and hardly any American publication wants to be negative.
In America, consensus is considered normal and controversy is confusing. Zoë Heller's recent attempt, in The New York Review of Books, to prove that Salman Rushdie's book ''Joseph Anton: A Memoir'' was less than magnificent is a very rare example of a critical review in an American publication.
Immediately, as if a switch had been thrown, the review became more famous than the book. Onlookers hailed the review as a sure candidate for Hatchet Job of the Year, a prize that actually exists, out there in the boiling blogosphere.
In my reading of Ms. Heller's review, she didn't seem to question Mr. Rushdie's importance but rather seemed merely to find piquancy in the fact that he never questioned it either. She carefully conceded that if hundreds of thousands of people are offered a reward for your head, then you can be excused for regarding yourself as the natural subject of current historical conversation. She might have added that you can also be excused for collecting lifetime female partners the way Jay Leno collects sports cars. But on the whole Ms. Heller said nothing that might not have shown up, in Britain, in a feature on the same subject carried by almost any serious literary publication.
In The New York Review of Books, however, the piece was remarkable, generating many an argument at highbrow dinner parties. Its alien quality was underlined, perhaps, by the fact that Ms. Heller is actually a British import: like the late Christopher Hitchens, she voiced her British acerbity in a polite context, and found, as he did, that the locals were wonderfully easy to stir up. (The British expression is ''wind up'': rather more cruel, when you think about it, because it treats people as tin toys.)
At one stage in my life, I was asked to review a prominent book that I thought needed putting down, and found myself in a position similar to Ms. Heller's. It was in the late '70s when John le Carré was in the full power of his later phase of production and The New York Review of Books asked me to write a review of his latest book. I was scarcely a chapter into it before I felt the glue closing over my head.
I wrote that Mr. le Carré's style had become verbose and implausible by his own standard, which had been set by his early books, especially by ''The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' which I called a masterpiece. But no writer wants to hear that he has lapsed from greatness. He wants to hear, at the very least, that his greatness has acquired an extra layer of subtlety, even if it looks like incompetence.
IN my role as Mr. le Carré's nemesis, I had already experienced what it felt like to be stomped on in print. Years before, John Carey, one of the cleverest of the Oxbridge dons moonlighting in Grub Street, brought all his wit and knowledge to the task of shriveling my first collection of essays, ''The Metropolitan Critic.'' I slept badly for months.
Then, several years later, he extolled my book ''Unreliable Memoirs,'' and I felt all the better for having once felt miserable. It was part of the give and take of the British literary world.
Mr. le Carré, however, had never had a really bad review in his life until I ambushed him in America. He just wasn't used to it. My review was undoubtedly a hatchet job and Mr. le Carré was right to be annoyed. For one thing, a ''negative'' review in such an influential publication could hardly be good for the book's chances in America, although in fact it became a best seller anyway. Mr. le Carré, nonetheless, let it be known that he thought I had set out to damage him.
I hadn't. But I can see how it might have seemed like that to him. Having far too much fun as I picked out the book's absurdities and pomposities, I had written a British-style killer book review but I had published it in an American context. In that fact lay the insult and the injury.
British writers know that they are in a cockpit at home but when their books come out in America they expect to be safe. Usually they are; and anyone deputed to take them down usually has to be brought in from outside, like Ms. Heller or, dare I say it, myself. American culture is a polite culture and probably the better for it.
Sometimes I wonder, though. There was a time when the American literary world grew its own hatchet persons, and could rejoice in the thoroughness with which Mary McCarthy dismembered the reputation of Lillian Hellman.
But among young writers, there seems a shortage of critics unhampered by excessive good manners. Why this should be so is a bit of a mystery. It could be that the typical established publication has become too impressed with its own self-imposed status as a journal of record, which must confine itself to the facts; and that a complex, nuanced statement sounds not enough like a fact, and hence must be confined to the blogs, where nobody has any manners anyway.
When I read the brilliant young Alice Gregory, in Slate, struggling to express how she simultaneously approves and disapproves of the journalism of Janet Malcolm, I want to lean through her study window (Alice Gregory's, not Janet Malcolm's) and explain that the whole secret of literary journalism is to express both sides of a question at once, and that only in America could that imperative seem abnormal. Alice, you can't eliminate the negative. It accentuates the positive.
Clive James is an Australian poet and critic whose most recent book is a verse translation of Dante's ''Divine Comedy.''
This is an essay from Draft, a series on writing, at nytimes.com/opinionator.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Eyes on the Prize, Gadgets at the Ready

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
Psst, buddy: Can I interest you in a $50,000 or $60,000 Acura?
For years, that come-on has sent shoppers running from Acura's discount alley to more illustrious brands like Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lexus.
Honda's luxury brand does many things well, but prestige sedans have not necessarily been one of them. Acura's wheelhouse is the $30,000 to $45,000 range, and after a recession-era plunge, the brand is smartly ramping up sales. The new RDX crossover may be the best pocketbook-friendly alternative to an Audi Q5 or BMW X3. A refashioned MDX, Acura's popular midsize crossover, is busting out of the gate. And the TL is an underrated entry-luxury sedan, especially with Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive, or SH-AWD, which despite its supersilly name actually improves handling.
But Acura seems to run out of air, and inspiration, above the $50,000 heights. The new RLX shows Acura, Sisyphus-like, trying to roll a midsize sedan up the mountain to where the German gods live. We've seen this tragedy before, most recently with the Acura RL. That RL was as D.O.A. as any luxury car can be; a spreadsheet on wheels that, by 2011, became the worst-selling mainstream car in America, finding barely 1,000 customers. 
The RLX fares better, but it doesn't confront Acura's high-end sedan issues head on, preferring to dodge them by adding more space and enough gadgets to fill a Best Buy. Acura's flagship still seems designed for an illusory luxury world, one in which low-key virtue trumps high design and ego-inflating performance.
Wedded to Honda's less-is-more philosophy, Acura has publicly rejected the development of a rear-wheel-drive sedan (or an optional V-8 engine) despite all the evidence that big-money buyers prefer a rear-drive platform: the Mercedes E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS, Infiniti M and Jaguar XF all send power to the rear, with all-wheel drive available across the board. The formidable Audi A6 is all-wheel-drive only. Eight-cylinder engines are options in all but the Lexus and Audi.
The RLX wades into this shark tank, for now, in exclusively front-drive form. Power is amply supplied by a new direct-injection 3.5-liter V-6 with 310 horsepower, a gain of 10 over the RL's 3.7-liter V-6.
This silky, strengthened version of the Honda Accord's V-6 shuts down half of its cylinders in steady cruising, helping to lift the fuel economy rating to 20/31 m.p.g., up from just 17/24 for the RL. So far, so good, though even my most frugal-minded efforts failed to squeeze out more than 27 m.p.g.
But as your eye sails over the Acura, it finds no safe perch in a sea of bland. On two occasions, I strolled past the Acura, blending in at the curb, and had to backtrack to find it. There's nothing unpleasant about the RLX, but the go-along-to-get-along styling doesn't bode well for what's already an underdog in its class.
One distinctive feature, the gleaming Jewel Eye LED headlamps, did a great job of cutting through nighttime murk.
Big, airy and relaxing, the RLX's interior benefits from a two-inch wheelbase stretch and 1.8 inches more width. Acura says there is more rear knee and shoulder room than in any competitor, and the extra space is apparent. Acura might have pressed that real-estate edge with genuine room for three in the rear, but the center perch is typically high and hard.
Here's an appreciative nod to the manual rear window shades: Lift the main section, and a smaller shade pivots out to cover the remaining triangle of glass.
The new rotary-knob control system is blessedly simplified, though screen menus remain cumbersome in the anal-retentive Honda fashion.
The RLX looks to stare down any competitors' technology: ''I'll see your cellular-linked assistant, integrated phone apps and adaptive cruise control, and raise you a four-wheel-steering system.''
That Precision All-Wheel Steer system -- or PAWS, in one of the more apt industry acronyms -- can turn the rear wheels in tandem with the fronts for greater high-speed stability, or in the opposite direction for low-speed agility and a slightly reduced turning circle. It's an often-tried technology that's never caught on, probably because the effect, as ever, is largely imperceptible.
The same goes for the optional lane-keeping assist, which spies lane markers and lightly nudges the steering wheel to keep the car centered. But here, Acura seems too timid, or worried about liability, to go all-out: The system stops operating if a driver's hands stray from the wheel. And since its digital hand still lets the car drift wide without human input, it's hard to see the gain over basic lane-departure buzzer warnings.
The RLX literally doubles down on video displays, stacking a sharp eight-inch navigation screen atop a seven-inch touchscreen. There's some redundancy between screens, but the Acura can display navigation, audio and climate controls simultaneously with no crowding. (Don't try that in your Mercedes.) The optional Krell audio system is a knockout for spacious sound and tonal clarity -- on par with some big-name Bang & Olufsen units -- especially when I popped in an audiophile-level CD.
The Honda-Acura navigation system and mapping are among the industry's best. But voice functions are a literal waste of breath, requiring more rounds of call-and-response than a square dance. Acura's latest real-time traffic alerts now include conditions on surface streets, though its accuracy will surely be superior in major cities than in obscure small towns.
And for a car that aims for easy connectivity, Acura may want a word with its liability lawyers: You can't manually input addresses, access your stored phonebook or even reset the trip computer without pulling over.
Over the road, the RLX's watchword is ''soft.'' Laminated acoustic glass hushes the interior. The steering is feather-light, creating some high-speed trepidation, and the suspension is in comfort's camp as well.
The automatic transmission has merely 6 speeds. It is capable in everyday driving, but lazy when prodded with the available paddle shifters, even when Sport mode is selected. Like the basic TL, the RLX is a great cruiser and a good handler -- for a front-drive car. But no amount of steering trickery can hide the cars' nose-heavy weight bias.
Nor can the RLX fully hide its birthright. From the safe-as-milk exterior to the Vulcan logic of its cabin, the RLX comes off as the sweetest Honda you've ever imagined. And since there's no need to imagine a $30,000 V-6 Accord or a $40,000 Acura TL, even fans of the Acura brand may ask why they should pay from $49,345 to $61,345 for the RLX. Four-wheel steering, anyone?
Acura is talking up value, but consider the rear-drive Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan. The Genesis' top R-Spec model -- with 429 horsepower from a 5-liter V-8 -- actually costs less than the base-model RLX. As if Audi, BMW and Mercedes weren't scary enough.
Underdogs often get one at-bat to garner early critical and consumer attention, but Acura has left its slugger on the bench: This fall, an RLX Hybrid will squeeze 370 horsepower from the V-6 and an intriguing all-wheel-drive system with three electric motors: One electric motor up front, and two independent motors to power and boost handling at the rear wheels. Acura expects roughly 30 m.p.g. in combined city and highway travel.
A shot at that RLX Hybrid -- with better mileage, four driven wheels and more might than any V-6 rival -- might have changed my modest impressions for the better.
Who knows, I might even have liked it better than a loaded Accord.

HEADLINE: Capturing the Green

BYLINE: By DANIEL KRIEGER

 BODY:
In the 1970s, when the East Village was overrun with drugs, crime and squalor, a group of locals banded together and started building community gardens in vacant lots to brighten up and take back their neighborhood. 
George Hirose, a Japanese-American photographer who grew up in the Bronx, moved there as this was happening. ''I remember when this place was just rubble,'' Mr. Hirose, 56, said in one of his favorite garden haunts on Sixth Street and Avenue B, sitting beneath a gazebo on a recent Sunday.
In 2011, Mr. Hirose, who teaches photography at the Pratt Institute, set out to document all 39 East Village gardens, realizing that with developers' hunger for real estate, their days could be numbered.
''Economically, they're not feasible,'' he said, ''but psychologically and sociologically, you can't put a price on these little green spaces.''
So far, he has shot 30 of them, and his photographs will be exhibited this month at Bloom Projects at 95 East Seventh Street. ''This is a permanent work in progress,'' he said of the series, which he calls ''Magic Gardens.'' He plans to keep going back to capture the gardens as they evolve, from season to season and year to year.
Constraining himself to shooting only after dark, when he finds them most enchanting, he mostly uses ambient light and exposures ranging from 4 to 20 minutes. Sometimes he shines a flashlight or a bicycle light on an area within the frame -- what he calls ''painting with light'' -- and then digitally saturates the colors and, to a lesser extent, plays with the contrast and color temperature.
''What I'm interested in is what the camera can do that my eyes can't do,'' said Mr. Hirose, explaining that in low light the eyes do not pick up color or depth well. But with the camera's long exposure, what's invisible to the naked eye can be stunningly rendered. ''It's like another sense that I've developed,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Blueprints for Dymaxion Found in Massachusetts

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN PRESTON

 BODY:
Every once in a while, a car so brilliant and forward thinking comes along, it just can't be ignored. Only it can. Some have a few moments of glory -- the Tucker Torpedo, the General Motors EV1, and perhaps even the Fisker Karma, for example -- and others don't. The three-wheel Dymaxion car is one of those; the teardrop-shaped, 1930s-vintage car of the future that never made it into production.
But there was a lot to like about the Buckminster Fuller-designed Dymaxion. Part of his Dymaxion brand -- Dymaxion being an amalgamation of dynamic, maximum and tension -- the 1933 car filled out a design lineup that included a house, a world map and Mr. Fuller's own, oddly constructed sleep schedule (which consisted of 30-minute naps throughout the day). 
Although it was unlikely that the Dymaxion car would ever find its way onto an automotive assembly line, such a thing was not even a possibility until recently. The plans had been lost. But they have resurfaced in a Dudley, Mass., house that was once a boarding house where Fuller stayed during his days working with the automobile coachbuilder, Waterhouse Company, in nearby Webster, Mass.
In its day, and even now, the Dymaxion was pretty far afield of other automotive designs. It could seat 11 people, had a recorded top speed of 90 miles per hour, and with its rear-mounted, 85-horsepower Ford flathead V-8 engine, which sat near a single rear wheel and powered the car's two front wheels, the car could get up to 30 miles per gallon.
Think about how rare that has been until fairly recently. Except for that brief flash of gutless, albeit lightweight, late-'80s and early-'90s econoboxes, not many cars capable of carrying more than four people could boast fuel economy numbers that high. Even the truly advanced vehicles that have made it into production recently haven't really done much to blow conventional modes of personal transport out of the water.
Recently, though, Volkswagen announced that it would build only 250 of its XL1 models, a super efficient, aerodynamic little car whose '90s-vintage futuristic looks and 261-mile-per-gallon fuel economy ought to have thrifty buyers clamoring for more. But it is unlikely to be sold in America. Despite that it's a hybrid diesel -- people can't still be afraid of hybrids or diesels, right? -- hybrids have been around long enough that it should be normal by now, and we're far enough removed from the horrors of that G.M. catastrophe known as the Oldsmobile diesel V-8 to have gotten over that phobia.
But I digress. Despite their wind-cheating weirdness, Dymaxion cars relied upon conventional powertrains. It was the wheel layout and steering that defied established normality. And people, somewhat predictably, did not bite.
Fuller built only three Dymaxion cars. After car No. 1 crashed in an accident at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, no one with enough money to make it a production reality would touch the car. Steered by its rear wheel, directional control wasn't as straightforward as cars steered by their front wheels, and the difference factored into speculation about the crash. Right or wrong, the rumors jelled mistrust of the car's design.
According to Noel Murphy, the author of a not-yet-finished documentary about the Dymaxion car -- ''The Last Dymaxion'' -- car No. 1, which had been damaged in the World's Fair crash, finally met its end in 1941, when it caught fire in North Carolina. He said that No. 3 ended up being unceremoniously scrapped in a Wichita, Kan., junkyard at some point. Car No. 2 is the last surviving original, having made its way through the hands of several less-than-illustrious owners before being acquired by William Harrah, the Las Vegas casino executive.
When Harrah died in 1978, most of his cars were sent to the auction block. But a handful, including the Dymaxion, ended up in the then new National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nev., where it remains today.
The owner of the house where the plans were found in the living room is keeping his identity and address quiet. But that did not stop the lucky finder from researching what the plans were for, which eventually led to a connection with Mr. Murphy. Now, the two are in agreement that the plans should be sold at auction to raise money for Mr. Murphy to complete his documentary.
Maybe the plans' new owners will take the design and create something new with it. Even though Crossthwaite & Gardiner spent two and a half years building a more or less perfect reproduction, blueprints can tell so much more about the hows and whys of a car's build. With modern guts, a three-wheel modern day Dymaxion car -- one with a stronger, lighter body (that won't lead to the death of its occupants, preferably) could someday become a reality. Think about it; a real space age Dymaxion ...
Or not, but one can always hope that something weird like that will actually be produced, curing us, at least temporarily, of our fear of the different.
The auction will be held on June 6, at the Wright Auction House in Chicago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Building Companies to Last

BYLINE: By ADAM ARONSON. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY parents divorced when I was 5. When I was 9, my mother and my future stepfather decided to start organic farming in South Washington, Vt. We cleared land and built a house with a post-and-beam style of construction. I'd help skin bark off trees and chisel mortises in the timber we used. The experience has served me well in starting companies. I understand the effort to build something that lasts.
As a teenager, I worked in a fruit and vegetable store. My job was to make orange juice in the basement. Whenever the longtime employees walked down, I'd pepper them with questions about how everything worked. It was my introduction to business. 
In sixth grade, I moved to Boston to live with my father, a physician, then returned to Vermont for college. I graduated from the University of Vermont in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in economics and history.
During college, I developed a relationship with a financial adviser who worked at what was then Dean Witter Reynolds and was involved in technical trading analysis. He introduced me to a Japanese trading method called candlestick charting. I took the charts along with me on a summer vacation in Greece and continued to study with him for a few months after I graduated.
In 1991, I got a job on Wall Street at what was then CS First Boston as a currency trader, and in 1993 I moved to Paine Webber for a year. I had about 10 bosses in that time, so it didn't seem like a stable industry. I hoped to start my own trading company. From 1994 to 1999, I was a co-founder of two money management firms that traded currency. When the euro was adopted in 1999, I thought that currency trading would become less profitable, so it was time for another career change.
Around 1997, my wife, Alison, and I watched a television program that included a day care center with a worker who possibly abused drugs. Putting cameras in these centers, enabling parents to see their children in real time by logging into a Web site, seemed like a good idea, and in 1999 I started ParentWatch, the precursor of Arrowsight. ParentWatch is now a division of Arrowsight.
I felt that the beef production industry, with its need for safety, offered greater potential for using video cameras. I thought of how sports teams use game films to improve, and I wondered why businesses weren't doing something similar.
For three years while running ParentWatch, I studied the beef industry and raised capital for my idea, starting Arrowsight in 2002. My finance background helped me find start-up funding, and I met a senior executive in the meat industry who gave me a fast-track education in the field. I spent hours in meat processing plants.
Using cameras, sensors and remote video software, we started out checking food safety and animal welfare in meat processing plants. In 2004, a beef industry consultant introduced me to Temple Grandin, an expert in the humane treatment of animals. Temple endorsed our operations, which use auditing methods she developed, and she became one of our advisers.
Our customers include Cargill and the OSI Group, and, since we expanded our monitoring services into the health care industry, the North Shore-LIJ Health System and the medical center of the University of California, San Francisco.
When I started Arrowsight, I underestimated how difficult it is to convince potential customers to buy a system that doesn't currently exist in their budget. I'd advise other entrepreneurs to look for investors who have a long-term view, and to forget their ego and choose colleagues who are smarter than they are.

HEADLINE: China's Economic Empire

BYLINE: By HERIBERTO ARAÚJO and JUAN PABLO CARDENAL. 
Heriberto Araújo and Juan Pablo Cardenal are the authors of ''China's Silent Army: The Pioneers, Traders, Fixers and Workers Who Are Remaking The World in Beijing's Image.''

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- THE combination of a strong, rising China and economic stagnation in Europe and America is making the West increasingly uncomfortable. While China is not taking over the world militarily, it seems to be steadily taking it over commercially. In just the past week, Chinese companies and investors have sought to buy two iconic Western companies, Smithfield Foods, the American pork producer, and Club Med, the French resort company.
Europeans and Americans tend to fret over Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, its territorial disputes with Japan, and cyberattacks on Western firms, but all of this is much less important than a phenomenon that is less visible but more disturbing: the aggressive worldwide push of Chinese state capitalism.
By buying companies, exploiting natural resources, building infrastructure and giving loans all over the world, China is pursuing a soft but unstoppable form of economic domination. Beijing's essentially unlimited financial resources allow the country to be a game-changing force in both the developed and developing world, one that threatens to obliterate the competitive edge of Western firms, kill jobs in Europe and America and blunt criticism of human rights abuses in China. 
Ultimately, thanks to the deposits of over a billion Chinese savers, China Inc. has been able to acquire strategic assets worldwide. This is possible because those deposits are financially repressed -- savers receive negative returns because of interest rates below the inflation rate and strict capital controls that prevent savers from investing their money in more profitable investments abroad. Consequently, the Chinese government now controls oil and gas pipelines from Turkmenistan to China and from South Sudan to the Red Sea.
Another pipeline, from the Indian Ocean to the Chinese city of Kunming, running through Myanmar, is scheduled to be completed soon, and yet another, from Siberia to northern China, has already been built. China has also invested heavily in building infrastructure, undertaking huge hydroelectric projects like the Merowe Dam on the Nile in Sudan -- the biggest Chinese engineering project in Africa -- and Ecuador's $2.3 billion Coca Codo Sinclair Dam. And China is currently involved in the building of more than 200 other dams across the planet, according to International Rivers, a nonprofit environmental organization.
China has become the world's leading exporter; it also surpassed the United States as the world's biggest trading nation in 2012. In the span of just a few years, China has become the leading trading partner of countries like Australia, Brazil and Chile as it seeks resources like iron ore, soybeans and copper. Lower tariffs and China's booming economy explain this exponential growth. By buying mainly natural resources and food, China is ensuring that two of the country's economic engines -- urbanization and the export sector -- are securely supplied with the needed resources.
In Europe and North America, China's arrival on the scene has been more recent but the figures clearly show a growing trend: annual investment from China to the European Union grew from less than $1 billion annually before 2008 to more than $10 billion in the past two years. And in the United States, investment surged from less than $1 billion in 2008 to a record high of $6.7 billion in 2012, according to the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm. Last year, Europe was the destination for 33 percent of China's foreign direct investment.
Government support, through hidden subsidies and cheap financing, gives Chinese state-owned firms a major advantage over competitors. Since 2008, the West's economic downturn has allowed them to gain broad access to Western markets to hunt for technology, know-how and deals that weren't previously available to them. Western assets that weren't on sale in the past now are, and Chinese investments have provided desperately needed liquidity.
This trend will only increase in the future, as China's foreign direct investment skyrockets in the coming years. It is projected to reach as much as $1 trillion to $2 trillion by 2020, according to the Rhodium Group. This means that Chinese state-owned companies that enjoy a monopolistic position at home can now pursue ambitious international expansions and compete with global corporate giants. The unfairness of this situation is clearest in the steel and solar- panel industries, where China has gone from a net importer to the world's largest producer and exporter in only a few years. It has been able to flood the market with products well below market price -- and consequently destroy industries and employment in the West and elsewhere.
THIS is the real threat to the United States and other countries. However, most Western governments don't seem to be addressing China's state-driven expansionism as an immediate priority.
On the contrary, European governments dealing with their own economic crises see China as a country that can help, either by buying sovereign debt or going ahead with investments in their countries that will create jobs.
The Chinese state-owned company Cosco currently manages the main cargo terminal in the biggest Greek port, Piraeus, near Athens -- a 35-year concession deal. And China's sovereign wealth fund, C.I.C., took a 10 percent stake in London's Heathrow Airport in 2012, as well as a nearly 9 percent stake in the British utility company Thames Water. The state-owned firms Three Gorges Corporation and State Grid are the main foreign investors in Portugal's power-generation sector, and C.I.C. also bought a 7 percent stake in France's Eutelsat Communications.
In the Greek port the Chinese have been able to triple capacity, amid local unions' criticism of worsening labor conditions. It's too early to measure China's impact in the other investments, but the fact that Chinese companies are able to invest in sectors that are closed or restricted for European firms in China says a lot about how minimal Europe's leverage with China is.
Take Germany, which accounts for nearly half of the European Union's exports to China. It's highly unlikely that Berlin would make unfair competition the cornerstone of its China policy. Moreover, the lack of leverage and leadership in Brussels means that the union is unable to take firm action to force China into adopting measures that would level the playing field or guarantee reciprocity in its domestic market.
The only exception is the United States, which seems to be addressing the issue by pushing forward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade association that is seen by critics in Beijing and elsewhere as an American-led policy to contain China. The club is thought to be restricted to countries that meet high American standards on issues like free competition, labor and environmental standards and intellectual property rights. As China doesn't meet those standards, it will have to reform or risk regional isolation. Moreover, the United States has made life difficult for the Chinese telecom giant Huawei by refusing to grant it contracts from leading American telecom companies. This is not just about national security concerns but also about sending Beijing a clear message that the United States government is willing to block one of China's most visible and successful companies.
While Western companies complain about barriers to public procurement and bidding and struggles to compete in restricted sectors in China, Chinese companies enjoy red carpet treatment in Europe, buying up strategic assets and major companies like Volvo and the German equipment manufacturer Putzmeister.
The perception is that China is now unavoidable and, consequently, the only option is to be accommodating -- offering everything from a generous investment environment to essentially dropping human rights from the agenda. ''We don't have any stick. We can just offer carrots and hope for the best,'' a senior European official told us.
Greenland, a massive resource-rich territory largely controlled by Denmark, is a case in point. Last year, it passed legislation to allow foreign workers into the country who earned salaries below the local legal minimum wage (the minimum wage there is one of the highest in the world). Chinese representatives had made it clear that Chinese state-owned banks and companies would invest in the high-risk, costly exploitation of Greenland's vast mining resources only if the modification of local regulations would allow the arrival of thousands of low-wage Chinese workers.
The Arctic territory didn't have too many alternatives. No other country is in a position to become Greenland's strategic partner for its future development, given the business risks involved in the Arctic region and the scale of the investment needed in a territory bigger than Mexico but without a single highway. An American oil company couldn't have handled the task alone. The Chinese state capitalist system, by contrast, allows multiple state-owned companies to work together, making it possible for the China National Petroleum Corporation, for instance, to extract oil while China Railway builds basic infrastructure.
Greenland's leaders accepted China's terms because they likely believed these costly projects might never go ahead if the Chinese didn't get involved; only China has the money, the demand, the experience and the political will to proceed. Moreover, there are not enough skilled workers in Greenland for such projects, so the Greenlandic government made an exception to the law, allowing Chinese laborers to earn less than minimum wage figuring that local residents would benefit from new infrastructure and royalties.
China's deep pockets, as well as its extensive labor force and unlimited demand for natural resources, made all the difference, and accordingly Greenland was prepared to pass tailor-made legislation to meet Chinese needs. Even Denmark, which holds authority in Greenland in areas like migration and foreign policy, decided not to interfere.
IT is even happening in progressive bastions like Canada. President Obama's refusal thus far to approve the Keystone pipeline project has made Prime Minister Stephen Harper's conservative government turn to China to secure an export market for Canadian crude oil reserves. The Calgary-based oil industry has lobbied Mr. Harper to adopt a new diversification strategy that includes the construction of a controversial pipeline to western British Columbia, despite strong opposition from environmental groups, the First Nations aboriginal communities and the public. In the meantime, Canada also signed a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with China, which gives remarkably generous investment protection to the Chinese.
With China in the center of debates over FIPA and the west coast pipeline, Canada's government then approved the takeover of the Canadian energy giant Nexen by the Chinese state-owned oil firm Cnooc. The $15.1 billion transaction was China's largest foreign takeover.
Closer economic ties have had political side effects; the Harper administration now seems much more cautious in criticizing China's human rights record. Given that Canada was until very recently one of the fiercest voices on China's handling of dissidents, this is not only a remarkable 180-degree turn, but also a clear indication of how China's economic influence can push the political agenda to the sidelines, even in the West.
In Australia, Chinese accumulated investment inflows at the end of 2012 surpassed $50 billion. The trend is striking: Chinese direct investment in Australia in 2012 increased 21 percent from 2011 levels to reach $11.4 billion, making it an important player in Australia's mining industry. Australia's trade portfolio remains highly diversified, but the Chinese share is growing rapidly.
China has also become the biggest investor in Germany (in terms of the number of deals), surpassing the United States. Chinese companies are looking for companies that, like Putzmeister, have a technological edge and have become world leaders in niche markets. Those takeovers also allow them to absorb Western know-how on branding, marketing, distribution and customer relations. Others are more opportunistic. Faced with recession, struggling European firms like Volvo quickly welcomed Chinese partners who were ready to inject capital and take full control.
The loans that Beijing is giving worldwide are even more significant, in dollar terms, than direct foreign investment. These loans include $40 billion to Venezuela and more than $8 billion to Turkmenistan in recent years. China's policy banks (China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China) are the key institutions supporting China's ''Go global'' strategy, as they provide billions of dollars in loans to foreign countries to acquire Chinese goods; finance Chinese-built infrastructure; and start projects in the extractive and other industries.
This is clearest in countries where the West claims to link its aid to human rights and good business practices. Chinese loans have been crucial in countries like Angola that have faced threats of a cutoff in financing from Western creditors, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Ecuador, Venezuela, Turkmenistan, Sudan and Iran have all faced such difficulties, and China has stepped in without political or ethical strings attached. Chinese statistics reveal little about these loans, but a study by The Financial Times showed that, between 2009 and 2010, China was the world's largest lender, doling out $110 billion, more than the World Bank.
It is important to remember what is really behind China's global economic expansion: the state. China may be moving in the right direction on a number of issues, but when Chinese state-owned companies go abroad and seek to play by rules that emanate from an authoritarian regime, there is grave danger that Western countries will, out of economic need, end up playing by Beijing's rules.
As China becomes a global player and a fierce competitor in American and European markets, its political system and state capitalist ideology pose a threat. It is therefore essential that Western governments stick to what has been the core of Western prosperity: the rule of law, political freedom and fair competition.
They must not think shortsightedly. Giving up on our commitment to human rights, or being compliant in the face of rapacious state capitalism, will hurt Western countries in the long term. It is China that needs to adapt to the world, not the other way around.

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Will Hold Talks About Hacking

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States and China have agreed to hold regular, high-level talks on how to set standards of behavior for cybersecurity and commercial espionage, the first diplomatic effort to defuse the tensions over what the United States says is a daily barrage of computer break-ins and theft of corporate and government secrets.
The talks will begin in July. Next Friday, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, who took office this spring, are scheduled to hold an unusual, informal summit meeting in Rancho Mirage, Calif., that could set the tone for their relationship and help them confront chronic tensions like the nuclear threat from North Korea.
American officials say they do not expect the process to immediately yield a significant reduction in the daily intrusions from China. The head of the United States Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, has said the attacks have resulted in the ''greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' Hackers have stolen a variety of secrets, including negotiating strategies and schematics for next-generation fighter jets and gas pipeline control systems. 
Nonetheless, a senior American official involved in the negotiations to hold regular meetings said in an interview on Friday that ''we need to get some norms and rules.''
''It is a serious issue that cannot simply be swatted away with talking points,'' said the official, who noted that the meetings would focus primarily on the theft of intellectual property from American companies. ''Our concerns are not limited to that, but that's what needs urgent attention,'' he added.
The Chinese government has insisted it is a victim of cyberattacks, not a perpetrator, and Chinese officials have vigorously denied the extensive evidence gathered by the Pentagon and private security experts that a unit of the People's Liberation Army, Unit 61398 outside Shanghai, is behind many of the most sophisticated attacks on the United States.
On Saturday, after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke of a ''growing threat of cyberintrusions'' at a conference in Singapore, in comments directed at China, a Chinese general gave a tart response saying she doubted the United States' assurances that its growing military presence in Asia was not directed at China.
While cyberattacks will be a major subject of the talks in Rancho Mirage, at an estate that belonged to Walter Annenberg, the main effort will be to forge a rapport between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi. American officials hope the estate, known as Sunnylands, which has played host to American presidents and foreign dignitaries dating to Richard M. Nixon, will put both men at ease.
American officials said they have been surprised by the pace at which Mr. Xi, a longtime party functionary who consolidated his grip on power in March, has installed new faces in the Chinese leadership and moved to take greater control over the military, something his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never mastered.
Another main issue at the meeting will be North Korea. American officials, emerging from talks with Mr. Xi and his team, believe that the new Chinese leader has less patience for North Korea and little of the sentimental attachment to its leaders that his predecessors had.
''What's interesting here is the dog that isn't barking,'' the American official said. The Chinese, he noted, are not urging all sides to resume talks until the North Koreans agree that the objective is removing all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. ''We're not hearing the soothing mantra of restraint,'' he said.
The Chinese have also taken public steps to confront North Korea, like ordering the Bank of China to stop dealing with North Korea's largest foreign-exchange bank.
''They're much more open to causing pain to North Korea,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, a top China adviser to Mr. Obama until 2011.
Still, during the latest round of the Korea crisis this spring, Kim Jong-un, the young and largely untested new North Korean leader, made it clear that he had no intention of ever giving up his small arsenal.
Cybersecurity issues loom large between the United States and China because they go to the heart of the economic relationship between the two countries, even more so now that previous sources of friction, like China's foreign exchange policies, have eased in the last year.
Chinese academics and industrialists say that if China is to maintain its annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8 percent, it needs a steady inflow of new technology. That could make the Chinese reluctant to cut back on the systematic theft of intellectual property.
In return, the Chinese will press the Americans on their use of cyberweapons: while there is no evidence that they have been used against Chinese targets, the sophisticated cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program by the United States and Israel are often cited by the Chinese news media and military journals as evidence that Washington, too, uses cyberspace for strategic advantage.
The talks over computer hacking will start as part of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, an annual meeting of Chinese and American officials on a broad range of issues. But a new working group is being organized on the subject that will meet more frequently, officials say.
Where the talks will lead, however, is unclear: after considerable debate within the Obama administration, officials have concluded that online conflict does not lend itself to the kind of arms control treaties that the United States and the Soviet Union began negotiating 50 years ago. Today, cyberweapons are held by private individuals as well as states, and figuring out where an attack began can be maddeningly difficult.
Another problem, China experts said, is that neither the Americans nor the Chinese are well prepared for a candid discussion of cyberissues. The growth of hacking, and its use in both military and corporate espionage, is a new enough phenomenon that it is not clear how seriously Mr. Xi and other senior Chinese leaders view it.
Tung Chee-hwa, a former chief executive of Hong Kong who has close ties to China's leaders, said recently that when he raises the American concerns about hacking with senior officials in Beijing, they express puzzlement.
And neither side, experts said, is ready to discuss military espionage, which means the conversation will necessarily focus on the theft of corporate secrets by China-based hackers. On that subject, they said, Mr. Obama needs to be unyielding.
''Obama has got to say, 'You've got a major hacking operation under way in Beijing, you've got a major hacking operation under way in Shanghai. This is going to have repercussions if we don't see changes very quickly,' '' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China adviser in the Clinton administration who is now at the Brookings Institution.
China and the United States, experts say, could find common ground on the need to stop cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, like the electrical grid, since it poses such a danger to both countries. ''I personally think a bilateral 'no sabotage' pledge would be a very good idea,'' Mr. Bader said.

HEADLINE: The Myth of Gatsby's Suffering Middle Class

BYLINE: By AMITY SHLAES

 BODY:
Another decade, another Gatsby. The actors change but the message put forward in the adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 book stays the same. The 1920s were as ephemeral as a Champagne bubble. A fake stock market, an illicit liquor business and other falsehoods made Jay Gatsby and others like him into correspondingly false millionaires. The pleasure of the rich, ''careless people,'' as a character calls them, came at a cost to the rest, especially the middle class, the small people, mere ants in black tie to be trampled by giants like Gatsby at their parties.
The inaccuracy here starts with the cinematic detail. The new Gatsby is set in the early 1920s.
The narrator, Nick Carraway, informs us that the stock market is hitting extraordinary levels. But in the early 1920s stocks did not roar ahead like Gatsby's car. In the summer of 1922, around the time when the heroine Daisy visits Gatsby in West Egg, the Dow Jones industrial average actually stood lower than it had in the summer of 1919. Even the car prop in this film yields anachronism: the Duesenberg model Gatsby drives in the film is a copy of a 1929 version, not an early 1920s vehicle. 
And the view of the middle class? The central premise of the Gatsby films, that the rich got rich faster than the others, is true. Decades ago, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets pointed out the increase in disparities in a much-admired paper, ''Shares of Upper Income Groups in Income and Savings.'' Other scholars, seeking precision, suggested a key ratio: the top 7 percent of the nonfarm population gained at a cost to the rest, the bottom 93 percent.
But whether the new gains of the rich did come at a cost to the rest is not clear. The scholar Gene Smiley of Marquette University spent much of his career looking at what the nonrich, the ants in Gatsby, that bottom 93 percent, actually got, relative to the rich and more important relative to themselves.
The great broadening between rich and nonrich in 1920 that Mr. Kuznets had seen, Mr. Smiley found, was perhaps exaggerated by early experts. In addition, Mr. Smiley posited, reasonably enough, that what matters to people is not how they are doing relative to the rich but how they are doing relative to their own past and their own expectations. His data found that real per capita income of the bottom 93 percent of nonfarm households actually increased in the 1920s.
The 1920s began with disruption and trouble. Joblessness plagued cities. Low commodity prices hurt farmers, who struggled to hold on to their farms. Blacks suffered in the angry South and Midwest, where, especially in the early years, the Ku Klux Klan oppressed them and lynchings occurred. Women had voted in their first presidential election in 1920, and many more were college graduates than in previous times. But many believed that all they could do with their education was more cogently assess the drudgeries of mothering.
In an essay called ''A Middle-Class Wife'' published in The New Republic in 1917, a young math major recounted her shock at the amount of work it took to keep house for a husband and two children. ''I shall not tell over the tale of the things there are to do, cooking and mending and washing and baby-tending,'' the author, Alice Austin White, wrote.
But then, like a yacht on Long Island Sound, improvements appeared on the horizon. Virtually everyone can agree that the single most important economic factor in the life of workers, middle- or lower-class, is a job. And here the 1920s delivered enviably: after the early recession, unemployment dropped below 5 percent and stayed below that marker much of the time. Wages rose, especially for skilled workers.
The quality of work life improved as well. Historically, Americans had worked on Saturday. But now, because of productivity gains from machines, weeks of 50 or even 45 hours were possible. In 1920, scholars surveyed companies and found that only 32 had cut back to five-day workweeks. By 1927, 262 large companies instituted five-day workweeks. Henry Ford solidified the trend when the automaker moved to five days in 1926. The 1920s are the decade that signaled the arrival of a gift that still means a lot to us: Saturday.
What did people do with their free Saturday? They drove their new toy, the automobile. In 1920, a quarter of families had cars. By 1930, more than half did. What mattered to these drivers was not that a Gatsby had a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, but that they had a Ford.
Material changes also took place right in the home that The New Republic's author described. In 1920, 35 percent of households had electricity. By 1930, that share was 68 percent. Electricity brought appliances into homes, including electric irons and washing machines. The old drudgery was reduced; women began to enjoy free time. They could even fool around with another great innovation, the typewriter. In short, being stuck in the middle class became more enjoyable in the 1920s.
To see America's 1920s middle-class experience in context, it helps to consider how we think of the rest of the world today. Specifically, it is important to ask what material benefit symbolizes arrival in the middle class elsewhere in the world. Indians have chosen their definition, one that makes sense to the rest of us: indoor plumbing. If a family has an indoor toilet, it is, or is becoming, middle class. The 1920s were the decade when America enjoyed the transformation that India has just enjoyed. At the decade's start, 2 in 10 American homes could boast indoor flush toilets. By 1930, more than 5 in 10 did.
But that is not all. As the decade progressed, there were other gains. Farmers languished, but those who moved to town did find jobs. Blacks still suffered, but the Ku Klux Klan faltered in the last third of the decade. Lynching did not disappear, but the Historical Statistics of the United States show that the rate of such murders dropped.
What made all this improvement possible? New ideas, and an environment that fostered them. Patents hit record rates. More important, companies began to use the new patented ideas to develop machines in factories that in turn made production much cheaper. The classic case of such improvement was the automobile tire. From 1910 to 1930, the cost per tire of driving 1,000 miles dropped from about $10 to about $1.
It hadn't always been true in the United States that good ideas found the capital needed to finance them. But in the 1920s, they did. The general sense was that if the rich prospered, the rest might do better than before. This attitude was validated by tax data. The Wilson, Harding and Coolidge administrations all cut tax rates. Following these cuts, more revenue than the authorities had expected flowed in. But, crucially, the wealthy also paid a greater share of the taxes.
This happy, middle-class decade did not please all, especially those in the progressive movement. Progressives had anticipated that the 1920s would be a decade of radical reform, involving nationalization of key industries like hydropower.
A special shock to radicals was the 1924 presidential election, in which the very middle-class and middle-brow Calvin Coolidge won, beating the Progressive Party's Robert La Follette and the Democratic candidate John W. Davis.
The Progressives rightly began to perceive this healthy middle class and its conservative voting habits as an existential threat. Around the time Fitzgerald was writing ''Gatsby,'' another author, Sinclair Lewis, was dedicating a whole book to creating the Babbitt character, an indictment of the middle class. Lewis wrote of his antihero, George Babbitt: ''He had enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding of all mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty.'' Yet later, Lewis attacked Coolidge directly, in a book about the banality of the bourgeoisie. Lewis titled the book, a rant against the average American, ''The Man Who Knew Coolidge.''
That book sold poorly. Then, as now, Americans preferred Gatsby, seeing in the figure not just falsehood, but also the possibility that they, too, might become rich. Fitzgerald's book itself, as opposed to the film, also offers such a possibility. Carraway, the narrator, does not hate Jay Gatsby, but comes to see him as the only hero of the story.
Given all this knowledge, one has to ask: whither the durability of the myth that the 1920s were bad? Again, the explanation is probably more emotional than logical. The evidence that the Crash of 1929 forced the 10-year Depression that followed is scant. Markets had crashed many times before without decades of joblessness. Nearly all economists, including those who express concern over income disparities of the 1920s, count multiple factors at work preventing recovery in the 1930s. They do not blame stock prices, or even President Coolidge. Yet it is human nature to believe that when an event follows an event, the first event causes the second. The misery of the '30s was of such magnitude, or so the narrative suggests, that most people want to believe it must have been preceded a force of similar magnitude. Post hoc, ergo Gatsby.
That doesn't mean that we all have to believe the 1920s fallacy, however, or promote it. Indeed, it might be useful to take some of the policies of the 1920s as models for today. Replicating the 1920s results, in any case, both Democrats and Republicans would consider progress. ''So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past,'' Fitzgerald wrote at his book's conclusion. Even those who share Fitzgerald's fatalism vis-à-vis the 1920s can certainly take pleasure in a simple reality. The past is not always bad.

HEADLINE: The Pugnacious Builder Of the Business Lobby

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
THOMAS J. DONOHUE is not one for sweet talk. No sooner had he been named president of the United States Chamber of Commerce in 1997 than he promised to for Bill Archer, a powerful member of Congress. In the next breath, he suggested that John Sweeney, the union leader, needed to be punched in the mouth.
Nor does Mr. Donohue show much deference to the current president of the United States. The chamber's headquarters sit across Lafayette Square from the White House, and in May 2010, with unemployment near 10 percent, Mr. Donohue festooned the building's grand, Corinthian-columned facade with four banners spelling J-O-B-S in red, white and blue block letters, each 23 feet, 4 inches high.
Three years later, the banners are still up. During a recent interview in his office, an expansive suite with black walnut paneling, Mr. Donohue offered a blunt explanation for why he hung the sign facing President Obama's home. ''So he'd have to look at it every day,'' he said, lowering his voice to a theatrical growl. 
That the head of the chamber would openly relish needling the president of the United States speaks to the wholesale transformation that this 101-year-old trade association has undergone on Mr. Donohue's very aggressive watch.
Over the last 16 years, Mr. Donohue has used his considerable talent for fund-raising to build the once-struggling chamber into a free-enterprise research outfit, Supreme Court advocacy group and lobbying powerhouse. The chamber's lobbying operation alone spent $136 million last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics; the next-biggest spender, the National Association of Realtors, spent less than a third of that.
At 74, with his Kennedyesque mop of white hair and a Brooklyn accent, Mr. Donohue comes off as part street fighter, part showman and part head of state. He zips around town in a chauffeured Lincoln and flies around the globe in leased private jets. His salary, $4.9 million in 2011, makes him the second-highest-paid trade association chief in Washington, after the head of the Edison Electric Institute, according to CEO Update, a trade magazine.
''He's got a little theater in him,'' Billy Tauzin, the former Louisiana congressman and a onetime amateur actor, says of Mr. Donohue.
''He's like the Energizer Bunny,'' said John W. Bachmann, senior partner at Edward Jones and the past chairman and current treasurer of the chamber's board, calling Mr. Donohue's salary a ''bargain.''
Yet, while increasing the group's influence, Mr. Donohue has also plunged the business lobby into partisan politics. That move has infuriated many Democrats, made some local chambers uneasy and produced an embarrassing flop in the last Congressional elections. The chamber spent millions in an unsuccessful bid to wrest the Senate from Democrats; of 12 chamber-backed Republicans, nine lost.
''They got their clock cleaned,'' said Mr. Tauzin, an outside adviser to Mr. Donohue. ''It was a bold idea. Bold ideas either succeed boldly or fail dismally. In this case, I think Tom would tell you it was a dismal result.''
Not one to back down, Mr. Donohue has ordered his political team to ''figure out what happened'' and to try harder in 2014, said Scott Reed, his senior political adviser. But publicly, Mr. Donohue is changing the subject. He has always been a man of big ambitions, and his latest is to secure an immigration overhaul, long a priority for business. A deal he cut with Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., on a new visa program for low-skilled workers helped produce a bill that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in May.
Mr. Donohue rarely mentions President Obama by name, and in casual conversation allows that he had a better relationship with another Democrat, Bill Clinton. (''You get in a big fight with him one morning, and then two days later you'd be over there for a drink.'') He refers to Mr. Obama as ''the president across the street'' -- a phrase that Mr. Reed says is ''not a disrespectful thing,'' but a reflection of Mr. Donohue's position.
''That's the institution speaking,'' he said.
Immigration is one issue, at least, on which the chamber and the Obama administration might come together. Businesses of all stripes want the immigration system improved. High-tech companies like Facebook want access to skilled foreign workers. Large-scale farms want to hire Mexican and other migrants. Small businesses want a stronger electronic employment verification system, to shift the burden of making sure workers are legal to the government and away from employers.
It is now up to Mr. Donohue to deliver. And while he waves off talk of retirement -- ''If you see me in a box with flowers around it, I'm only thinking about retiring'' -- there is no question that an immigration bill could be a legacy item, a capstone to his long career.
WHILE big, wealthy companies help keep the chamber afloat -- ''We have to raise $5 million a week to run this place,'' Mr. Donohue says -- advocating for small business is perhaps more popular with the public. So one morning in April, Mr. Donohue could be found holding court at America's Small Business Summit, the chamber's annual gathering for small-business owners, who come to network and lobby their lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
Like all things Donohue-related, the meeting was a slick production, with hefty corporate support and Washington-insider speakers like Michael V. Hayden, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Bob Woodward, the Washington Post journalist. In the exhibit hall, representatives of T-Mobile and FedEx handed out trinkets.
Mr. Donohue used his keynote address to exhort the audience to ''defend and advance a free-enterprise system'' whenever it ''comes under attack'' and to give politicians in Washington -- the words ''Republican'' and ''Democrat'' never pass his lips -- a piece of their minds.
''It's about time,'' he thundered, ''that our leaders in Washington start making the tough decisions that we pay them to make!''
The talk was business-lobby boilerplate, if delivered with dramatic flair. Yet Mr. Donohue is a surprising missionary for the free-market message in at least one way: he has little experience working in for-profit businesses.
Born in Brooklyn, he grew up, largely, in Rockville Centre, N.Y., where his parents moved amid the post-World War II housing boom. His father was a factory manager for the American Can Company; his mother was frail and sickly from a childhood illness. As a boy, Mr. Donohue suffered rheumatic fever, and spent most of the second grade at home. Reading was a challenge; he says he is ''a little dyslexic.''
He came by his free-market views as a teenager, through hard work, he said. He delivered meat for a butcher shop, mowed lawns, worked for a pharmacy and ferried bottles of liquor to Wall Street. He put himself through St. John's University in Queens and later got an M.B.A. at Adelphi University while working for the Boy Scouts.
He went on to pursue a seemingly unrelated string of jobs, working for a disability-rights advocacy group, as a university fund-raiser and at the Postal Service. There, he tangled with unions and eventually rose to deputy assistant postmaster general -- a job that took him to the capital, where he began his ascent as a Washington player.
In 1984, after a stint running membership and grass-roots operations for the chamber, Mr. Donohue landed his first big Washington lobbying job, as president and chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, which had been hobbled by a string of legislative defeats. Colleagues remember him as endlessly energetic, especially when it came to raising money.
''We called him the White Tornado,'' said Lana Batts, a former association lobbyist. Ms. Batts recalled how they would fly into a city, round up local trucking executives for dinner, then hit them up for cash. ''People would walk out of that room saying: 'I intended not to give him any money. How did I end up giving him all that?' ''
WHEN Mr. Donohue was hired at the chamber in 1997, it was in desperate need of a fix-it man. The organization was bleeding money and members, and losing political influence over its embrace of parts of Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care bill. Other, more focused business lobbies, like the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Federation of Independent Business, were making incursions onto the chamber's turf.
''The chamber, probably in a perfect world, which I've never been in, would have wanted to hire somebody of more stature, but they had serious challenges, and that's why they hired me,'' Mr. Donohue said. ''My first objective here was to save the place as we knew it.''
He traveled the country, seeking to bolster membership and the budget, which has since quintupled, his aides say. And he vowed to make trouble for traditional adversaries like trial lawyers, environmentalists and union leaders.
Today, Mr. Donohue presides over a $250-million-a-year operation, where roughly 500 employees -- a small army of lobbyists, legislative analysts, economists, lawyers and communications gurus -- devote themselves to carrying out his vision for a more pro-business government.
Since Mr. Obama took office, Mr. Donohue's army has mobilized against the president's health care overhaul, his financial regulatory overhaul, his energy policy and his new consumer protection agency -- though it did help to pass Mr. Obama's financial stimulus package. Often, the chamber is more aggressive than the individual companies in its membership; pharmaceutical companies and insurers, for instance, took a more nuanced stand on the health bill.
''The Donohue chamber is in full-time attack mode,'' said Robert Weissman, who runs the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen. ''From their point of view they've been very aggressive in advancing the interests of their constituents. From our point of view, they have very aggressively expanded the corporate grip over policy making in Washington, D.C.''
The chamber's foray into politics has perhaps been Mr. Donohue's most aggressive strategy. Taking full advantage of the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court, which freed corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited sums on political advertisements, the chamber -- which filed an amicus brief in the case -- plunged headlong into the 2012 Congressional races.
Records show that the chamber spent at least $35 million on the races. It backed two Democrats and 38 Republicans in House races, but no Democrats and 12 Republicans for the Senate, where some veterans found themselves on the other end of chamber attack ads.
''Tom Donohue is a partisan Republican who plays big-money, nasty politics,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who is still irked at a chamber ad showing him looking nefarious with a 5 o'clock shadow. To which Mr. Donohue, a registered Independent, retorted, ''If I had a shot at getting rid of him tomorrow, I'd do it again!''
The chamber also tried unsuccessfully to oust Senator Claire McCaskill, a centrist Democrat from Missouri, despite the fact that Mr. Donohue awarded her a Spirit of Enterprise award in 2009 for her ''support of pro-business issues.'' Her seat seemed vulnerable; Republicans hoped they could take it and gain control of the Senate.
''Anybody in the phone book could have beaten Claire McCaskill!'' Mr. Donohue declared in the interview, neglecting to mention that her opponent, Todd Akin -- who made impolitic remarks about ''legitimate rape'' -- did not.
Not long ago, Ms. McCaskill collared Mr. Donohue in a Capitol corridor to tweak him about his poor return on investment in the election. ''He turned kind of red,'' she recalled, ''and said, 'Don't take it personal.' ''
Mr. Reed, Mr. Donohue's senior political adviser, argues that, despite the losses, the chamber's big spending during the election has jangled the nerves of Democrats who ''want to know what they have to do to get right with the chamber.'' And by engaging thousands of local chambers in campaigns, he said, Mr. Donohue has built the chamber into ''a national brand.''
But at least one of those local chambers -- in Kansas City, Mo., where Ms. McCaskill has support from prominent business leaders, including some Republicans -- quit the national organization in protest over the attacks on her.
''What was disheartening,'' said Jim Heeter, the local chamber president, ''was that so much money was being spent in a very negative way.''
THE election results ''reignited something'' in Mr. Donohue, said Robert W. Goldfarb, a management consultant, who calls Mr. Donohue ''my dearest friend.'' The two men met 50 years ago when, fresh out of college, Mr. Donohue sought Mr. Goldfarb's career advice. Mr. Goldfarb remembers the future chamber chief as someone lacking self-confidence, but burning with ambition.
''The overriding drive for Tom,'' Mr. Goldfarb said, ''is to be limitless, to fly.''
Privately, though, Mr. Donohue has conceded that he has limits; he has told his board that his close aides will tell him when to retire.
''Tom recognizes that there will be a time, and that he probably won't recognize when that time comes,'' Mr. Bachmann, the former board chairman, said. ''So he's got people that he absolutely trusts.''
For now, though, he is seizing what opportunities he can. Early this year, one presented itself: Senators Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, and Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, invited Mr. Donohue and Mr. Trumka of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to Capitol Hill. A group of four Democrats and four Republicans -- the so-called Gang of Eight -- were in negotiations on an immigration bill, and the senators wanted the union leader and the chamber involved.
Mr. Donohue, who worked to pass a bill in 2007, the last time it came up in Washington, jumped in with vigor, hoping to win a new temporary visa program that would ease the way for businesses to hire foreign workers. If any deal was to work, he would have to strike a compromise with labor, which wants protections for low-skilled foreign workers and assurances that companies will hire local residents first, while business wants flexibility to bring in foreigners to fill open jobs.
Over the last weekend in March, after a week when the Gang of Eight talks nearly fell apart, Mr. Schumer got Mr. Donohue and Mr. Trumka on the phone, and they signed off on an accord that let the bill go forward. (Neither the union leader nor the chamber chief would discuss the specifics of their talk.)
''Tom really rode herd, and was very, very personally involved,'' Mr. Graham said, adding, ''He found a way to get everybody to yes.''
With the bill soon to be debated on the Senate floor -- amid grumbling from Silicon Valley that it does not go far enough -- and the House working on its own measure, Mr. Donohue will be busy in the coming months.
He also has personal milestones ahead: his 50-year college reunion (he does not plan to attend), his 50th wedding anniversary (he and his wife, Liz, are planning a big party) and his 75th birthday (Aug. 12).
Wrapping up his speech at the Small Business Summit, he spoke of the immigration legislation, vowing, ''We're going to get that bill.'' But he wasn't quite finished; he wanted to say a few more words.
''Free enterprise isn't perfect -- none of us are,'' he told his audience. ''But it provides one thing that most other systems don't, and that's opportunity.'' He added: ''It allows you to take a responsible risk. Sometimes you take a risk and you fail. O.K. get up off the floor and do it again. The beauty of our system is that you can keep trying.''
It was the expected paean to the American system from Washington's warrior for free enterprise. But it also seemed that Mr. Donohue might have been talking about himself.

HEADLINE: Prisoners Of the Euro

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
TO its custodians and admirers, the European Union is the only force standing between its member states and the age-old perils of chauvinism, nationalism and war. That was the pointed message that the Nobel Committee sent last year, when it awarded the union a Peace Prize for its role in ''the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights.'' And it is the message hammered home relentlessly by the Continent's politicians, who believe their citizens face a stark choice, in the words of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, between continued integration and a return to ''centuries of hatred and blood spill.''
But right now, the E.U. project isn't advancing democracy, liberalism and human rights. Instead, it is subjecting its weaker member states to an extraordinary test of their resilience, and conducting an increasingly perverse experiment in seeing how much stress liberal norms can bear. 
That stress takes the form of mass unemployment unseen in the history of modern Europe, and mass youth unemployment that is worse still. In the Continent's sick-man economies, the jobless rate for those under 25 now staggers the imagination: over 40 percent in Italy, over 50 percent in Spain, and over 60 percent in Greece.
For these countries, the euro zone is now essentially an economic prison, with Germany as the jailer and the common currency as the bars. No matter what happens, they face a future of stagnation -- as aging societies with expensive welfare states whose young people will sit idle for years, unable to find work, build capital or start families.
The question is whether they will face ideological upheaval as well. So far, the striking thing about the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, both in Europe and the United States, is how successfully the center has held. Power has passed back and forth between left and right, but truly radical movements have found little traction, and political violence has been mercifully rare.
In a sense, Francis Fukuyama's post-cold-war declaration of the ''end of history'' -- by which he meant the disappearance of credible alternatives to liberal democracy and mixed-economy capitalism -- has held up pretty well in the last five years. Amid the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression, illiberal societies like Egypt and Syria have faced political crises, but the developed world has not. There has been no mass turn to fascism, no revival of Marxist economics, no coup d'états in Madrid or jackboots in Rome.
But you have to wonder whether the center can hold permanently, if unemployment remains so extraordinarily high. How must liberal democracy and mixed-economy capitalism look to young people in the south of Europe right now? How stable is a political and ideological settlement that requires the rising generation to go without jobs, homes and children because the European project supposedly depends on it? And for that matter, how well is the Continent's difficult integration of Muslim immigrants likely to proceed in a world where neither natives nor immigrants can find work?
Already, the Greek electorate has been flirting with empowering a crypto-communist ''coalition of the radical left,'' even as a straightforwardly fascist party gains in the polls as well. Hungary's conservative government has tiptoed toward authoritarianism. Spain has seen huge street protests whose organizers aspire to imitate the Arab Spring. And lately, Sweden, outside the euro zone but not immune to its youth unemployment problems, has been coping with unsettling, highly un-Scandinavian riots in immigrant neighborhoods.
These perturbations do not threaten democracy in Europe yet, and maybe they never will. Maybe the liberal democratic consensus is so bred into the bone that no amount of elite misgovernment can persuade Europe's younger generation to turn against it. Maybe nothing can end the end of history.
But for the countries facing a youth unemployment crisis, that still seems like an awfully risky bet to make.
Yet there's a Catch-22 facing Greeks and Spaniards and Italians looking for an alternative to just staying the course. As wrenching as it would be, the option that would do the most to defang extremists of the left and the right would probably be to abandon the euro immediately, with each country regaining control of its own fiscal and monetary policy and seeing what options open up. But at the moment, the only people arguing for that course are ... the extremists of the left and the right!
For that to change, more of the Continent's political elites would need to recognize that their beloved integration project may actually be threatening Europe's long democratic peace. For now, there simply aren't enough responsible people ready to unwind what should never have been knitted together in the first place. But with every increase in the unemployment rate, the odds get better that irresponsible and illiberal figures will end up unwinding it instead.

HEADLINE: She's Getting Her Boots Dirty

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- SO when a woman is rolling in millions and has no need to work ever again, what does she do?
Festoon herself with Birkin bags? Deck herself in Tiffany's Gatsby baubles? Revamp a villa in Tuscany?
Not Patty Stonesifer.
Stonesifer could be found in a gritty alley in a downtown neighborhood here on Thursday morning, greeting a line of poor people who had been waiting in the heat for an hour -- mostly older black women, some in wheelchairs, others leaning on canes.
''These folks are just waiting for a bag of food,'' Stonesifer marvels as she looks over the mound of bags filled with vegetables and fruit, cereal and soup. ''They come early because they believe there won't be enough. It looks like the Depression, this long line. And they're not sitting on their butts, waiting for a handout. They're scrambling to meet their basic needs.'' 
After serving as the highest-ranking woman at Microsoft, Stonesifer helped Bill and Melinda Gates start their philanthropy in an office above a Seattle-area pizza parlor in 1997. With Bill Gates Sr. at her side, she was its first chief executive, for 11 years, as it tried to eradicate polio; treat and prevent malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis; and reduce the United States high school dropout rate. They built the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation into the world's largest philanthropy, with more than 500 employees and a $39 billion endowment -- a sum ''higher than the gross domestic products of 70 percent of the world's nations,'' according to The Los Angeles Times.
Now, as Bill and Melinda Gates offer a $100,000 reward to anyone who can design a better condom that will promote ''regular use,'' Stonesifer is taking on a fresh challenge of her own as head of Martha's Table, a Washington community organization (named after the kitchen-bound biblical Martha) that supplies food, clothes, day care and educational programs for those in need.
''Having Stonesifer come run a small local charity is like General Electric business titan Jack Welch showing up to manage the corner appliance store,'' The Washington Post noted.
I talked to the 57-year-old with the Pynchonian name sitting in her tiny office at Martha's Table, decorated with a caricature of her husband, the writer Michael Kinsley, and a group shot with Nelson Mandela.
''He flirts,'' she says delightedly of Mandela. ''He's holding my hand, not his wife's. Someone asked him why he was not more angry. And his answer was, 'If I thought it would be useful, I would be.' ''
Stonesifer wants to be useful. As she did at the Gates Foundation, she's working for free.
''I would love to call my mother and tell her, 'Mom, I'm president of such-and-such,' a university or a great N.G.O. or a corporation,'' she says. (There was talk about her becoming President Obama's domestic policy adviser.) ''But when I sat and really thought about what I wanted to do, I realized that the only job I was interested in would be one that would put me very close to the front lines, to go beyond white papers and PowerPoint presentations and get my boots dirty. I wanted to learn what it takes to change one child's experience from a child born in poverty to a child that's president of something.''
There is a picture in the lobby of President Obama, who has talked about his mother's stint on food stamps, from when he and Michelle came to serve dinner at Martha's Table.
Before she started her job eight weeks ago, as Republicans waged their war on food stamps, Stonesifer tried living for a week on a food-stamp budget of $4 a day.
''If you're relying on food stamps to eat, you're in real trouble,'' she says. ''Carbs are vastly cheaper than nutrients, so it was easy for me to see why hunger and obesity can coexist in the same household.''
What did she learn from Bill Gates?
''The biggest thing is to study hard but think big, right?'' she says. ''Risk failure in order to try to make the biggest change possible. I had a lot of products that bombed at Microsoft, like Microsoft Bob, those little dogs that told you how to use your software. But other products, like Expedia, really addressed a big need because we thought outside the box.
''So here, instead of simply figuring out how to move from providing 60,000 meals a month to 66,000, I want to think about how to end child hunger in D.C.''
I first met Stonesifer in 2001, when the divorced mother of two began dating my friend Kinsley. She is warm and laughs easily, still the down-to-earth Midwesterner from a big Catholic family, the daughter of an Indianapolis car salesman and a physical therapist.
''The No. 1 lesson you learn, being sixth out of nine children, is: It's not about you,'' she says. ''Our family didn't talk about volunteerism. It was just baked in. We went down and put the new missals in the church pews, and we volunteered at the Sunday soup kitchen, and we went with my dad to pick up the deaf children for church. We had foster children a significant part of the time that I was growing up.''
Her dad got a used school bus, took out half the seats and put in flowered wallpaper, and in the summer, they all piled in for camping trips to state parks.
Our culture, from Baz Luhrmann's ''The Great Gatsby'' to Sofia Coppola's ''The Bling Ring,'' is focused on what Time calls ''the glittery trappings of wealth.'' But bling isn't Stonesifer's thing.
Her 89-year-old mother started a Bread for the World chapter in her retirement community in Indianapolis and, until just recently, continued to do volunteer work for St. Vincent de Paul, a Catholic charity. With her family, Stonesifer created a program in her hometown to make sure every child went home from the hospital with a crib, an effort to curb infant deaths.
I ask if her two passions, improving technology and lessening poverty, are at odds, given that some researchers believe that technology short-circuits empathy.
''We have students out every night feeding the homeless,'' she demurs, ''young professionals out driving the vans, fourth graders coming in to read to toddlers. We have 50 percent more requests for volunteering than we can absorb. People give cocktail parties and send us money raised; people have weddings and tell their guests to give to us instead of them.''
Stonesifer is concerned with dignity. She worries about the women in line in the alley who are her age but look older from stress. She has arranged to share space with the nearby Latin-American Youth Center. That way, the alley line can end, and those needing food will have a more self-respecting, and self-serve, grocery experience.
I ask if her husband, a writer and editor at The New Republic, ever comes down to help out. ''Mike's biggest contribution,'' she grins, ''is that he feeds me when I come home exhausted at night -- a lot of scrambled eggs.''

HEADLINE: Turning a Robber Into the Good Guy

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Perhaps it says something about Europe's economic and unemployment troubles that a man who robs banks for a living is the good guy in ''The Prey,'' a French thriller that opens for a run at the AMC Empire 25 in Midtown Manhattan on Friday. 
The plot involves an imprisoned thief named Franck Adrien (Albert Dupontel) whose apparently innocuous cellmate, Jean-Louis Maurel (creepily played by Stéphane Debac), turns out not to be so harmless after all. Adrien realizes too late that Maurel is a particularly devious serial killer, who when released from prison, goes after not only Adrien's stash of bank loot but also his family, framing Adrien for his own killings in the process.
The film, directed by Eric Valette, has echoes of the real-life case of Michel Fourniret, who in 2004 confessed to a series of murders of girls and young women in France and Belgium. Maurel is aided in his crimes by his wife, Christine (Natacha Régnier), as was Mr. Fourniret. Alice Taglioni plays the police investigator who begins by chasing Adrien after his escape from prison, but eventually realizes he is a victim.

HEADLINE: Quantity Over Quality in Bank Profits

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
BANK stocks are back, and with a vengeance. Last week, the KBW Bank Index of 24 leading national and regional bank stocks climbed to its highest closing price since 2008. The index is up 20 percent so far in 2013 and 40 percent if you measure from 12 months ago.
The new high followed a report last week from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, showing record earnings across a wide swath of the banking sector in the first quarter. The F.D.I.C. did not break out individual bank performance, but the data showed that the roughly 7,000 banks whose deposits were federally insured earned $40.3 billion, up from $34.8 billion in the same period last year. That's a nifty 15.8 percent increase. 
There was other good news about the banks in the F.D.I.C.'s report. Returns on assets increased to 1.12 percent, on average, from 1 percent for the same period in 2012. And the number of banks on the regulator's problem list fell to 612 from 651 at the end of last year. Only four insured institutions failed in the first three months of 2013 -- the fewest since mid-2008.
These are all welcome developments, especially after the near-death experience of so many banks and their shareholders during the financial crisis. Clearly, the United States banking industry as a whole is better off than it has been for years.
But, as is often the case, a more nuanced tale emerges when you look more closely at the profit figures. Put simply, there is less to the headline number than some investors may think.
For one thing, the good news wasn't across the board: only half of the insured institutions reported higher quarterly profits, year-over-year. That was the lowest percentage since the last quarter of 2009.
But the quality of the banks' earnings -- an important consideration for investors -- starts to look less pretty when you start examining the data. Once you do that, you can identify one-time gains or other gimmicks that can create ephemeral increases or otherwise make the results appear better than they actually are.
Several red flags pop up in the F.D.I.C. report. The most important appears in its discussion of banks' net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities.
This is a crucial gauge of bank profitability -- after all, banks are in the business of lending money -- and it is on a downward slide. It declined $2.4 billion, or 2.2 percent, among the banks the F.D.I.C. examined during the first quarter, with the average net interest margin falling to 3.27 percent from 3.51 percent in the same period last year. The most recent figure is the lowest since 2006, the F.D.I.C. said.
This crimp comes courtesy of the zero-interest-rate policy of the Federal Reserve Board. As borrowers pay off older loans made at higher rates, banks can replace them only with lower-yielding loans. Sure, their costs are lower, but the spread between what they earn and what they pay out has become razor thin.
Loan balances at these banks also fell slightly during the quarter. Total loans and leases shrank by almost $37 billion, or 0.5 percent, a decline fueled by lower credit card balances, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans. Many bankers may be hesitating to make loans, worrying that interest rates will soon rise; when they do, loans made at current low rates will fall in value.
So how did the banks manage to bolster their overall profits so substantially? They searched for income elsewhere, and found it in the annoying and sometimes egregious fees they charge to consumers. Noninterest income at the banks rose by $5.1 billion in the quarter, according to the F.D.I.C., or 8.3 percent.
Cost-cutting at a few large institutions also contributed to the overall brighter picture in earnings. This was evident in the $4.2 billion decline in noninterest expenses in the quarter, a drop of almost 4 percent.
Another red flag is seen in reductions in set-asides for loan losses. Banks have a good deal of leeway in deciding how much money to provide for future losses. If banks play down the risks in their portfolios and reduce the amount to cover potential losses, that additional money makes their earnings look better.
The loan-loss provisions fell to $11 billion in the quarter, a decline of $3.3 billion, or 23 percent, from the same period a year ago. As the F.D.I.C. noted, this provision is the lowest among the banks since early 2007, at the height of the housing bubble. Reduced allowances for losses were reported by 53 percent of the institutions covered by the report.
So is everything rosy in these institution's loan portfolios? Are their risks much lower? Not exactly. Loans that are delinquent more than 90 days accounted for 3.41 percent of total loans in the first quarter, the F.D.I.C. said. Although this is down from more than 5 percent, a few years ago, it is still high. In 2007, for example, it was 0.83 percent.
Put it all together, and you see the clouds moving in on the sunny earnings report. Banks' considerable profits seem fueled by cost-cutting and lowered loan-loss provisions. The effects of such tonics only last so long.
Scott A. Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, said the F.D.I.C. report showed that scars from the financial crisis remained in the banking system. With banks still reluctant to lend, he said, the nation's economic recovery was being held back.
If banks don't make loans, Mr. Anderson noted, our economy can't expand as it normally does in a recovery. Even six years after credit started to seize up around the world, we are still relying on the Fed to keep the economy moving.
SUCH is the box the Fed finds itself in. Its muscular response to the credit crisis staved off economic disaster. But its continued efforts to keep interest rates low are doing nothing to encourage lending by banks.
''How does the Fed unwind what it's done over the past five years without disrupting the bond market and interrupting the flow of loans in the banking system?'' Mr. Anderson asked in an interview. ''How do you do that without reversing some of the positives?''
Taking away the punch bowl at the party has never been easy for Fed chairmen. This time, though, it's going to be downright treacherous.

HEADLINE: When It May Not Pay to Be Famous

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK. 
The Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- RYAN HART played quarterback for the Rutgers football team from 2002 to 2005. These days, he works in the financial services industry.
But a version of Mr. Hart on the playing field lives on, along with those of thousands of other athletes, in a video game called ''NCAA Football.'' The game allows players to manipulate the actions of more than 100 college teams in fantasy matchups. An unnamed avatar in the game shares Mr. Hart's number, height, weight, biography and playing statistics.
Mr. Hart sued the game's manufacturer, Electronic Arts, saying it should have gotten his permission and paid him a fee. Last month, in a decision that tried to reconcile free speech and commerce, a divided three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in Philadelphia said the company had violated Mr. Hart's right to control the commercial use of his image -- his ''right of publicity.'' 
''There's a lot at stake here, and a lot in play,'' said Mr. Hart's lawyer, Timothy J. McIlwain, who is asking that the case be treated as a class action. Mr. McIlwain said economists have told him that his clients may be entitled to billions of dollars in damages.
Jake Schatz, a lawyer with Electronic Arts, agreed that the case is exceptionally important, but for a different reason. ''The reach of this decision extends far beyond video games,'' he said in a statement. ''If it stands, all creators of expressive works that depict real individuals, including filmmakers, biographers and journalists, would face a stark choice: liability or self-censorship.''
Mr. Schatz said the company will ask the full appeals court to reconsider the panel's decision.
The Screen Actors Guild and several players' unions have filed briefs supporting Mr. Hart, saying that athletes, actors and other celebrities must have the right to control the use of their identities and to harvest the financial fruits of their fame. The movie industry, book publishers and news organizations, including The New York Times, have lined up on the other side, saying that allowing celebrities to control speech about them runs afoul of the First Amendment.
The dueling briefs cited a grab bag of cases that are hard to wrestle into a coherent legal framework.
The courts have, on the one hand, rejected right-of-publicity suits arising from a painting of Tiger Woods, a comic book evoking the musicians Johnny and Edgar Winter, parody baseball trading cards and a fantasy baseball game that used the names, statistics and biographies of Major League players. But courts have allowed suits over the broadcast of a human cannonball's entire act, a comic book using a hockey player's nickname, an ad evoking Vanna White's skill at turning letters on ''The Wheel of Fortune'' and a reference to Rosa Parks in a song.
If there is a legal principle that unites these rulings, it is hard to discern. What is clear, though, according to an expansive 2011 Supreme Court decision, is that video games deserve full First Amendment protection.
Most lawyers and scholars say there is little question that journalists, biographers, novelists and filmmakers can say what they like about famous people if it is truthful and does not invade their privacy. That is why Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, was not entitled to a cut of the profits of the film ''The Social Network'' or to prevent its makers from depicting his rise.
At the other extreme, there is broad consensus that the right of publicity requires companies to obtain permission before they say a celebrity has endorsed their products.
But that leaves a vast gray area in the middle.
In 2001, in what may be the most important right-of-publicity case, the California Supreme Court proposed a test to decide when celebrities should be allowed to insist on payments or suppress expression depicting them. It is the test the appeals court in Philadelphia used to rule in favor of Mr. Hart.
The California case concerned Gary Saderup, an artist who sold charcoal sketches of the Three Stooges on lithographs and T-shirts. The court started by acknowledging that some depictions of celebrities deserve protection as free speech because ''the appropriation of their likenesses may have important uses in uninhibited debate on public issues.'' First Amendment protection, the court went on, does not depend on whether an image of a celebrity was mass produced, in a picture rather than in words, sold for money or put on T-shirts.
But then the court took a turn. Mr. Saderup's sketches, it said, were not artistic enough to warrant protection. They were ''literal, conventional depictions of the Three Stooges'' and lacked any ''significant transformative or creative contribution.''
By contrast, the court said Andy Warhol's portraits of famous people were ''a form of ironic social commentary on the dehumanization of celebrity itself.''
In another age, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that judges might want to stick to legal judgments. ''It would be dangerous,'' he wrote in 1903, ''for persons trained only in the law to constitute themselves the final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations.''
Courts now confront not ''pictorial illustrations'' but digital facsimiles. Some are free: witness the recent initiative from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam to make downloads of high-resolution copies of more than 100,000 works in its collection freely available. Others are protected, for a time, by copyright laws. But copyright applies to expression, not identity.
In 1936, the critic Walter Benjamin wrote that the age of mechanical reproduction had transformed the way art was perceived. If a former college football player has his way, the rise of the age of digital reproduction may have a similar effect on the law.

MOSCOW -- The waiters hovered as Alimzhan T. Tokhtakhounov worked through a platter of chilled mussels, shrimp and octopus one afternoon last month at the restaurant Palazzo Ducale, one of the finest here. The staff could afford to be attentive: there was no one else to serve.
Despite the hour, toward the end of what is usually a busy lunchtime, the restaurant was empty when Mr. Tokhtakhounov came in to speak with a reporter about recent racketeering charges in the United States.
American law enforcement officials view Mr. Tokhtakhounov as a leading figure in Russian organized crime, a member of a storied order of Russian mobsters who is accused of, among other activities, fixing skating matches at the Salt Lake City Olympics and running a high-stakes, trans-Atlantic gambling and money-laundering ring.
But aside from the eerie void in the restaurant and a guard outside, Mr. Tokhtakhounov's life here seems open and even somewhat ordinary. 
Like other men whom the American authorities have identified as Russian mobsters, he walks the streets freely, albeit with a bodyguard. He has his picture taken smiling alongside the glitterati at concerts, fashion shows and soccer matches. He invests in real estate and has recently taken up fiction writing. He showed his guest one of his novels, ''Angel From Couture,'' a semiautobiographical story that focuses on the love affair of a young model and an older man.
Whatever else he may be, he insisted over lunch, he is innocent of all charges against him.
''I am not bad, like you think,'' he said, spearing an octopus tentacle with his fork and washing it down with sparkling mineral water. ''I am not the Mafia, I am not a bandit.''
Federal authorities in the United States have been pursuing Mr. Tokhtakhounov (pronounced toe-TAH-hoon-ov) since 2002, when he was charged with fixing ice dancing and pairs skating competitions at the Salt Lake City Olympics.
In the more recent case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged him in April with being a leader of a sports betting ring with operations in New York, Los Angeles, Russia and Ukraine. The setup drew in billionaire gamblers and laundered money through accounts around the world, prosecutors say.
Their indictment identifies Mr. Tokhtakhounov as a particular type of Russian criminal known as a ''Vor v Zakone,'' or ''thief in law,'' sometimes known as a Vor: a member of an almost priestly order, originally forged from prison hierarchies in the gulags. Vors are said to live by a strict code: They never marry, work or tell lies.
Mr. Tokhtakhounov, who is in his mid-60s, is ''one of the last of the older generation of godfathers,'' said Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University and an authority on Russian criminality. And his is among a handful of names that virtually every Russian gangster recognizes, he said.
Despite that reputation and the American charges, Russian authorities leave Mr. Tokhtakhounov alone. Russia has no extradition treaty with the United States and no outstanding charges against him. His thin criminal history here, an internal passport violation and an infraction for being unemployed, dates from the Soviet era and is no longer on the books.
Russian police officials say they have nothing on Mr. Tokhtakhounov; a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Interior Affairs, which oversees the police, confirmed he is on no wanted list here.
Russia under Vladimir V. Putin has arrived at a sort of détente with organized crime. In the 1990s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia was besieged by mob wars in which gangsters publicly killed their enemies, but such violence has dropped sharply over the past decade.
Mr. Putin, who was president in the early 2000s and is again now, let it be known that such overt displays of gangsterism undermined the authority of the state and would not be tolerated, but he otherwise left the underworld hierarchy intact, Dr. Galeotti said.
Many violent crime figures have evolved into semilegitimate businessmen who carry on their activities through somewhat more acceptable means. Some now operate so openly that they have held gatherings on pleasure boats in the Moscow River in the heart of the city, the police say.
Whatever the benefits of such an arrangement inside Russia, thieves in law remain a menace in émigré communities abroad, said Sergei Kanev, a reporter covering organized crime at the newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
''Even in America the thieves have a huge influence on former Soviet immigrants,'' he said. ''Criminal threads still tie them together. All their relatives are here in Russia. A thief might say, 'Play along, or your uncle and aunt will get it.' ''
Mr. Tokhtakhounov, however, contested the F.B.I.'s characterization of him. He has been married, though he is now single. The police outside Russia, he said, often mistake his penchant for flashy clothes and high-priced meals for the lifestyle of a mobster.
''Let me explain something,'' he said. ''A thief in law, if he is a thief, he should not say, 'I am not a thief.' He should say, 'I am a thief.' And I say, 'I am not a thief.' You understand.''
Asked if he had ordered the restaurant cleared out for the interview, he just smiled, shrugged and suggested it was not a busy time.
American authorities say in the recent case that Mr. Tokhtakhounov served as a ringleader along with two others, Vadim Trincher and Anatoly Golubchik, of one of two overlapping illegal gambling operations. One operation, prosecutors say, was led in part by the scion of a New York art dealing family, Hillel Nahmad, which hosted poker games for celebrities and financial titans in New York and Los Angeles.
In the other operation, Mr. Tokhtakhounov is accused of funneling Russian oligarchs' losses to shell companies in Cyprus, disguised as phony loans. The scheme, prosecutors say, laundered more than $50 million.
All the suspects have pleaded not guilty except Mr. Tokhtakhounov, who has not left Russia for a decade, he said, because of his fugitive status. Lawyers for Mr. Golubchik, Mr. Trincher and Mr. Nahmad said their clients were wrongly charged. The lawyer for Mr. Nahmad, Benjamin Brafman, said his client had never met or spoken to Mr. Tokhtakhounov, and even the indictment does not claim that.
Mr. Tokhtakhounov attributed his latest troubles to American agents' eavesdropping on his phone calls with Mr. Trincher and Mr. Golubchik when he was placing bets, up to $20,000 on individual soccer games. The bets were his own, he said, not those of gambling clients; the agents misinterpreted his Russian slang.
''I speak openly on the phone,'' he said, waving his gold-colored clamshell Samsung. ''That is my whole problem.''
''If I'm a dealer, catch me,'' he said. ''They just catch my words. Ah ha! An organizer. How could I organize gambling in America? It's impossible. And why would I? This is not my business.''
As he tells it, he is a real estate investor in Moscow, an organizer of Russian pop concerts and fashion shows, and now a writer. ''I live peacefully on this business and raise my children,'' he said.
Mr. Tokhtakhounov owned casinos in Moscow before gambling was outlawed there in 2009. His novel ''Angel From Couture,'' published in 2010, is subtitled ''A Novel From the Life of High Fashion.'' In the 1990s, he represented a Russian modeling association in Paris. The inside cover summarizes the story as ''What happens when a young beauty falls for the charms of an older man.'' Last year, he fathered twin girls with a woman 40 years younger than he is.
He lives in a prestigious apartment building in central Moscow and owns a palatial country home outside the city. He is also something of a celebrity, famously friendly with Joseph Kobzon, a crooner known as the Russian Frank Sinatra.
After the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, the F.B.I. said he had directed a scheme to secure a gold medal for the top Russian pairs skaters and for the top ice dancers representing France, one of whom was a Russian. The Russian pairs skaters won the gold, but after questions were raised about the judging, the Olympic committee awarded duplicate gold medals to the second-place Canadian team.
The authorities in Italy, where he then lived, detained him briefly on the charges but released him to Russia rather than extradite him to the United States.
His Interpol wanted poster accuses him of ''bribery in sport contests,'' fraud and other malfeasance and says he is affiliated with Semyon Y. Mogilevich, a man the American authorities consider a Russian Mafia godfather who is on the F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted list. Mr. Mogilevich also lives freely in Russia.
Mr. Tokhtakhounov denied knowing Mr. Mogilevich.
But he glumly recounted friendships with several others reputed to be Mafia leaders, including those known by the nicknames Grandpa Hassan and Yaponchik, or the Little Japanese, who were killed in recent years in two rare occurrences of mob violence. They were shot by snipers while leaving Moscow restaurants after meals.
At the Palazzo Ducale, as Mr. Tokhtakhounov's own guard waited, he denied, line by line, the allegations against him. Three waiters continually circled, topping off the water glasses until one wandered too close during conversation and Mr. Tokhtakhounov told him to go away.
''Alimzhan,'' the waiter responded, ''Don't worry, you know us: we're deaf.''

HEADLINE: Financing for Foreigners

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
The foreigners streaming into New York to buy housing often pay in cash, but with interest rates low, more have been seeking to finance their purchases.
During the financial crisis, risk-wary lenders were less likely to extend financing to foreigners. The pool of lenders offering such financing is still limited, but their foreign loan business is up.
HSBC, the multinational bank based in London, reports that its volume of home loans extended to foreign borrowers in the United States has tripled since 2010. ''It's just the ability to get that money at such a low interest rate that is really driving all these applications,'' said Joe D'Alessio, an HSBC mortgage consultant who works with high-net-worth clients. 
With a presence in 81 countries and territories, HSBC has a big appetite for foreign customers and offers some of the most attractive mortgage terms. Financing is available for up to 70 percent of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $3 million.
Interest rates tend to be slightly higher on loans to foreigners, Mr. D'Alessio said, but the rate on a five-year adjustable mortgage is still in the mid-2 percent range.
HSBC's terms are stiffer on apartments in buildings that are nonwarrantable (meaning they don't meet Fannie Mae's financing guidelines). In these cases, the bank may require 50 percent down.
''But that doesn't seem to deter buyers,'' said Mr. D'Alessio, who has worked with clients from Britain, Hong Kong, Turkey, Japan and Brazil. ''They are usually coming and looking for all-cash deals. Then they find out they can borrow, and so they take advantage of it.''
Borrowing also gives foreigners more buying power. Some choose to ''buy a larger property that might have a higher rate of return in the next few years,'' he said.
Foreign interest in investing in New York is driven in part by the perception that property here is a bargain compared with that in other global cities, said Ace Watanasuparp, the president of DE Capital Mortgage, an affiliate of Wells Fargo.
A recent report by Knight Frank ranked New York the eighth-most-expensive city for residential property. Going by average price per square foot, New York has an edge over Monaco, Hong Kong, London, Geneva, Paris, Singapore and Moscow. The report notes that growth in high-quality housing in New York is also a draw.
Through Wells, DE Capital offers financing for foreign buyers, but the program is ''not an aggressive one,'' Mr. Watanasuparp said. Loan amounts are capped at $1 million, and borrowers must put at least 40 percent down.
First Choice Loan Services, a subsidiary of First Choice Bank, has seen an ''uptick'' in inquiries from foreign nationals in the last few months, according to Jason Auerbach, a divisional manager. The company will lend foreigners up to 65 percent of the purchase price. But such loans are carefully scrutinized by the bank before approval.
''We will also generally ask them to keep a small escrow account with us so we feel that we are definitely protected,'' Mr. Auerbach said.
Other lenders that work with foreigners include the Bank of Internet and Apple Bank.
Still, currency remains king for many foreign buyers. Alen Moshkovich, a sales agent with Douglas Elliman Real Estate, says the vast majority of the foreigners he works with -- most recently buyers from Brazil, Russia, China, Venezuela and Israel -- continue to pay in cash.
For the superwealthy, any savings obtainable from financing is insignificant, Mr. Moshkovich said. More important, he said, ''cash gives them more purchasing power, in terms of negotiating deals, and a quicker closing.''

HEADLINE: Too Little for So Many, Even in The Times

BYLINE: By MARGARET SULLIVAN

 BODY:
ART auctions or soup kitchens? The cost of a luxury loft in SoHo or the number of children in homeless shelters?
Newspaper people make decisions about what to cover and what to emphasize every day. They have finite resources -- only so much space in the paper, only so many reporters -- and they have to choose. In this context, one question I've been thinking about for several months is this: How well does The Times cover those who live in poverty and the news that affects them?
In March, I wrote a blog post about complaints from some advocates for the poor and other observers that poverty was getting short shrift in The Times. Watching closely, I soon noticed several good news articles and opinion pieces on this subject. No one can say that The Times ignores poverty.
But is it enough? Is it the right kind of coverage? Where are the gaps, and what is the big picture? These questions are important, particularly because there is an undeniable moral dimension. Within America's great affluence, nearly 50 million people live in poverty, defined as income below $23,550 for a family of four. Surely, the mission of the nation's greatest newspaper ought to include a deep concern about those 50 million. 
Based on reading, interviewing and simply paying more attention, I've made some observations.
First, when The Times does write about poverty -- whether in a special series or a long feature article -- it usually does so with depth and intelligence. The amount and intensity of the coverage, however, may not be in proportion to the size of the problem. One in six Americans live in poverty, and it's worse for children: one in five. In New York City, it is commonplace to see men and women sleeping on the street. Among the city's 8 million residents, 1.5 million don't have enough to eat; a third of those are children.
Occasional coverage -- no matter how excellent -- doesn't get the job done.
The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that in 52 major mainstream news outlets, including The Times, combined coverage of poverty amounted to far less than 1 percent of all front-page articles. The Times may do better than some, but given New York City's high poverty rate and The Times's special responsibility as the nation's dominant paper, with the most plentiful resources, there should be more. The Times has no metro or national reporter devoted solely to this subject, though many reporters' beats touch on it, and the columnist Ginia Bellafante writes about it frequently and well. Jason DeParle, a Washington reporter who focused much of his time last year on economic mobility, is on a yearlong leave to write a book.
Diane Nilan, an Illinois-based advocate for homeless families, is frustrated by The Times's ''spotty interest'': ''I ache for these people, but until the media make an issue of it, nothing will happen. It would be good to see The Times really take the lead in providing clarity and building compassion.''
Some advocates for the poor see another problem: News organizations, including The Times, tend to treat those in poverty as ''the other,'' a problem that is ''over there.''
''It's isolated, it's in a silo, it's a problem that other people have,'' Melissa Boteach of the Center for American Progress said in an interview. By contrast, The Times's thorough and sustained coverage of gay rights has a remarkable sense of inclusiveness and solidarity: across sections, from Styles to Sports to Metro, The Times movingly tells the stories of admirable individuals who are overcoming challenges.
Poor people really aren't ''the other,'' Ms. Boteach said. ''People cycle in and out of poverty,'' and, she said, in a given four-year period, one in three Americans will experience a spell of poverty.
But poverty coverage does not have the regularity or the inclusive tone of Times coverage on the opposite end of the affluence spectrum, like Paul Sullivan's business feature ''Wealth Matters,'' which is described as a column about ''strategies that the wealthy use to manage their money and their overall well-being.''
Dan Froomkin, a journalist who wrote about the Pew study for Nieman Reports, also notes the ''special occasion'' quality of poverty coverage. During the charity-giving holiday season, or when a major reporting project comes to fruition, the focus is there. But it is not sustained.
Then there is what The Times does not cover. In a recent e-mail, Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, mentioned a stream of current local stories that The Times has not written about: Legal Services NYC went on strike; the city is trying to increase the number of summer meals for low-income children while they are out of school; the sequestration slashed federal spending on the city's soup kitchens and food pantries.
These stories and more, Mr. Berg notes, were covered in other New York City publications, including non-English-language newspapers like El Diario and Sing Tao Daily. ''They cover these issues big time,'' he said. ''If you read them and the New York Times metro coverage for a while, you'd think they were reporting on two entirely different cities.''
He also notes, ''There has not been a single story about the positions (or nonpositions) of people running for mayor on hunger, poverty, homelessness or inequality.''
Wendell Jamieson, the metro editor, said that Mr. Berg's complaints about stories that went without coverage missed an important reality: ''There are eight million stories in the naked city, and for every one he mentioned that we didn't do, there are dozens of comparable stories, in scope and impact, that we did do.'' One example, among many, was Joseph Berger's strong front-page investigative piece that showed how some landlords profit from homelessness.
The Times's coverage of poverty strikes me as a paradox. It is both top-notch and too occasional. Improving that is not impossible.
As an illustration of how quickly change can happen, consider this: Last month, The Times assigned a talented and prolific reporter, Jim Rutenberg, to cover the Hamptons for the summer. He made an immediate impact. In last Sunday's paper alone, one of his entertaining stories appeared on the front page, and another dominated the cover of Styles.
What if The Times decided to assign a few of its several hundred reporters to focus regularly and for a sustained period on poverty -- the issues, the news and, especially, the people? The effect would be powerful.

HEADLINE: Russian Force Arrests Mayor Tied to Killing In Dagestan

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Commandos in armored vehicles surrounded the residence of the mayor of Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, and arrested him on Saturday, bringing a swift end to his 15-year rule of one of Russia's most violent cities and to his ambition to eventually lead the region. 
The mayor, Said D. Amirov, 59, was detained in connection with the 2011 killing of a senior state investigator and will probably be charged under a statute that could send him to prison for life if he is convicted. Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia's powerful Investigative Committee, said investigators were looking into whether Mr. Amirov and a group of associates were behind a series of other high-profile crimes.
Mr. Amirov in many ways embodied the rough-and-tumble North Caucasus city he led, a place where brawls and gunfights are so standard that restaurant menus occasionally list the price of replacing damaged tables and chairs.
Americans know Makhachkala as the place where Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, spent six months in the year before the attack, reportedly meeting with fighters from the region's insurgency.
Mr. Amirov was famous for surviving an extraordinary number of assassination attempts -- he claimed it was more than 15 -- and has used a wheelchair since a bullet lodged in his spine in one such attack, in 1993. Newspaper reporters dubbed him ''Said the Deathless.''
He is also believed to command a formidable private army, and Saturday's operation was carried out under conditions of military-style secrecy that ended only when Mr. Amirov was put on a helicopter bound for Moscow.
The arrests of Mr. Amirov and 10 associates were prompted by testimony from the leader of an illegal armed group who, after being detained last week, said he had collaborated with the mayor, law enforcement officials told the Russian news media on Saturday.
Among the people detained in connection with the case was Mr. Amirov's nephew, who is suspected of commanding a criminal group that sold narcotics and carried out murders, including of law enforcement officers, the Interfax news service reported.
Mr. Amirov's removal and prosecution are likely to send ripples through Dagestan, where power is meticulously balanced between myriad warring clans, more than a dozen major ethnic groups and a variety of legal and illegal armed organizations. The Kremlin is focused on maintaining stability in the North Caucasus ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, which is at the edge of the turbulent region.
Konstantin Kazenin, a journalist and expert on the region, warned that Mr. Amirov had created a ''deeply layered, branched, 'totalitarian' business empire'' in Makhachkala, and that his removal could have far-reaching consequences.
''For many of the key figures of the empire, finding Amirov as mayor was the key to not only their personal prosperity, but also their security and freedom,'' Mr. Kazenin wrote Saturday in a column for the Regnum news agency. ''Unless special decisions and arrangements are made, the urban economy of Makhachkala may well expect a 'great upheaval.' ''

HEADLINE: Breadwinning Wives And Nervous Husbands

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.

 BODY:
GIRLS are generally outperforming boys in high school, and then proceeding in greater numbers to attend and graduate from college. And as women take the helm as chief executives of more major corporations, including Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and PepsiCo, there are hints that the glass ceiling may be at least cracking, if not breaking.
Such developments should encourage aspiring young women to believe that social norms are changing, and that barriers to success are dropping. But a new study reveals that women's gains on the economic front may be contributing to a decline in the formation and stability of marriages.
One reason for this decline may be that women with greater earning power have greater economic security that allows them to leave bad marriages. Yet another possibility is that many men seem to be clinging to a social norm from the ''Mad Men'' days: that the husband should be the primary earner in a family. 
There is an obvious disconnect here. Those men who spent their teenage years goofing off and their college years drinking beer shouldn't be surprised that women who consistently received higher grades and continued further in school might now be earning more money as well. But the evidence suggests that while men tend to applaud their spouses when they help to bring home the bacon, husbands aren't always as enthusiastic when women start bringing home the filet mignon. And it's especially troubling that these old-fashioned social norms about gender identity appear to be adversely affecting family formation and stability.
This is the finding of an interesting new paper by Marianne Bertrand, Emir Kamenica and Jessica Pan, three economists who are colleagues of mine at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. They found that traditional views of gender identity, particularly the view that the right and proper role of the husband is to make more money than the wife, are affecting choices of whom to marry, how much to work, and even whether to stay married.
Suppose that both men and women are happier -- all else being equal -- the more money their spouse makes. In such a world, couples wouldn't care whether the man or woman earns more, so the population of couples would have what we call a ''normal distribution,'' and would be captured in a bell-shaped curve. But that's not what we see in the real-world data.
Instead, there is a sharp drop in the number of male-female couples at exactly the point where the woman starts to earn more than half of household income.
This finding supports earlier research from speed-dating sessions, which found that while women prefer men to be intelligent and ambitious, men have these preferences for women only to the point where women threaten to earn more than they do. These preferences appear to be reflected in whom people choose to marry and in how much women choose to work outside the home.
Women's earnings have been rising relative to men's over the past 40 years -- though, on average, women's pay still lags behind. One sign of change is seen in a recent study from Pew Research, which finds that mothers are providing more than half the income in 15 percent of married households with children at home, up from 3.5 percent in 1960. Given such trends, it's logical that problems would arise if men kept their desire to be the primary breadwinners.
This may be one of many reasons that the share of young adults in marriages decreased 30 to 50 percent across various racial and ethnic groups from 1970 to 2008. Clearly, a choice to marry later in life explains part of this decline, but Ms. Bertrand and her co-authors estimate that the trend in the percentage of women making more than men explains almost one-fourth of the marriage rate's decline in the 40 years ended in 2010.
What happens when a man marries a woman who has the education and skills to earn more than him? The couple can avoid violating the ''man earns more'' social norm if the woman works part time or leaves the labor force altogether. The authors found evidence of both choices. But what if the woman stays in the labor force and does earn more than her spouse? How does this affect the marriage? The findings here are striking. In such couples, surveys show, both wife and husband generally report being less happy about the marriage.
Given these findings, it isn't surprising that when a wife earns more than her husband, the risk of divorce rises, too. To study this, the authors used a survey conducted in two waves, 1987-88 and 1992-93. (There were no more recent data available for this particular test.) Then they investigated the likelihood of a divorce in the five-year interval. For this sample, some 12 percent of all couples were divorced during this period -- a sobering fact about the stability of marriages in general. But the divorce rate rose by half, to about 18 percent, for couples in which the wife earned more than the husband.
How to explain the jump? Some people might think that a wife who earns more will do fewer household chores than her tradition-bound mate expects. Regardless of your opinion about men who harbor such feelings, the facts rule out that explanation: women who earn more than their husbands actually do a greater share of household chores, compared with couples in which the wife works but earns less.
The paper's findings support the anecdotal complaints of many highly educated, high-earning women who say they can't find suitable husbands. And as women continue to outperform men in school, these problems are likely to grow. Perhaps over time, men will catch on to this new world and accept the fact that hard-working girls may well turn into highly paid women.
Until that realization sinks in, problems arising from tradition-bound notions of gender identity will keep taking a toll on our economy and our families. Employers, however, may have opportunities to help.
For a variety of reasons, including the stubbornly persistent norm that women assume more than half the responsibility for raising children, many highly educated women would like to work part-time at a level commensurate with their skills. Businesses, however, have been slow to adapt, even as technology makes it much easier to do some or all of one's work from home. I believe that there are substantial economic opportunities for companies that find ways to hire the millions of talented but underemployed mothers in our economy.
But now back to the notion of couples' contentment: Is there any way to tell whether it's the wife or the husband who becomes unhappy when the wife earns more? Does he think that she is threatening his manliness, or does she think that he's a slacker?
That may be impossible to answer, partly because of something I learned long ago from Alvin E. Roth, a Nobel laureate in economics last year. I call it Roth's rule: In equilibrium, it's impossible for you to be happier than your spouse.
If you and your spouse both understand that rule, you're both likely to be happier -- regardless of how much money either of you make.
Divorce rate among all couples surveyed: 12 percent.; Rate when wife earned more than husband: 18 percent.

To the Editor:
Rachel Shteir's review of three books about Chicago (''Chicago Manuals'') appeared on April 21. Many Chicagoans decried its allegations and tone. The Book Review published several of their letters on May 12, none favorable to Shteir's critique: the symphony's principal conductor praised a city he occasionally visits; a law professor dismissed everything of substance in her review. On May 19, the Book Review gave prominent coverage to a series of corrections, all trivial. 
But the critics ignore the faults Shteir cites. National unemployment is currently 7.5 percent; Chicago's is 9.5 percent. Chicago is the slowest growing of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Its current population -- 2.7 million -- would be smaller still but for the city's influx of recent immigrants. Why do they come? Many seek low-paying service jobs supported by people employed in Chicago's small but lucrative financial services industry. Middle-class neighborhoods decline; they suffer the loss of the residents who once worked in the city's light and heavy industries. Forty-nine of Chicago's public schools were scheduled to close because of depopulation and a billion-dollar deficit in the city's education budget. Chicago's murder rate is better controlled but still explosive. Segregation makes this tolerable because much of it occurs in black neighborhoods isolated from more prosperous areas. Never mind the economic and social disasters this epidemic betrays: Chicago will fix it by hiring a new police chief.
Local pride stares down these embarrassments. Emphasize that Chicago is splendid in many ways. Pillory Shteir for daring to describe its underside. Distract yourself: think Lagos, Dhaka, Oakland or Detroit. Do many cities have Chicago's problems? Yes, though damning the messenger doesn't fix them.
As a Chicagoan living ''abroad,'' I must ask: How did Chicago intimidate the Book Review's editors?

HEADLINE: Paperback Row

BYLINE: By IHSAN TAYLOR

 BODY:
THE REVISED FUNDAMENTALS OF CAREGIVING, by Jonathan Evison. (Algonquin, $14.95.) Ben, the 39-year-old narrator of Evison's bittersweet novel, has lost his children in an accident and is losing his wife to divorce. At the end of his rope, he takes a job as full-time caregiver to Trevor, an angry, girl-crazed teenager suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Together they take a madcap road trip, from Washington State to Utah, to visit Trevor's estranged father.
DOUBLE CROSS: The True Story of the D-Day Spies, by Ben Macintyre. (Broadway, $15.) In ''Agent Zigzag,'' Macintyre exposed the antics of the World War II double operative Eddie Chapman. Next came ''Operation Mincemeat,'' in which the British used a corpse and a briefcase full of false documents to hoodwink the Nazis. Now come the eccentric international spies of ''Double Cross,'' who deceived the Germans into believing that the D-Day invasion would occur somewhere other than Normandy. 
LIONEL ASBO: State of England, by Martin Amis. (Vintage International, $15.) The corrupting influence of money is the Dickensian theme of Amis's novel, as his antihero, a thug burdened by a conscience, wins the lottery and is baffled by legitimate wealth. ''Amis is, like Dickens, an insistently moral writer, satire being an edifying genre with a noble cause: the improvement of society,'' Kathryn Harrison said here.
FARTHER AWAY: Essays, by Jonathan Franzen. (Picador, $16.) Human struggles against the pulls of solipsism and narcissism illuminate every page of this incisive collection -- from a commencement address Franzen presented at Kenyon College, entitled ''Pain Won't Kill You,'' to the title essay, about a recuperative bird-watching expedition to the South Pacific.
THE QUEEN'S LOVER, by Francine Du Plessix Gray. (Penguin, $16.) Structured as the memoirs of the Swedish aristocrat Count Axel von Fersen the Younger (1755-1810), Gray's historical novel follows Fersen as he meets and falls in love with a young Marie Antoinette in Paris, joins the fight for American independence, and returns to the Continent to find the patrician world he once knew on the brink of collapse.
THE PASSAGE OF POWER: The Years of Lyndon Johnson, by Robert A. Caro. (Vintage, $18.95.) The fourth volume of Caro's masterwork tells the dramatic story of Lyndon Johnson's humiliating years as vice president; his rise to the White House after the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and his championing of civil rights legislation and the ''war on poverty.'' ''The Passage of Power'' was one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2012; our reviewer, former President Bill Clinton, called it ''brilliant. . . . Caro shows the new president's genius for getting to people.''
LIVE BY NIGHT, by Dennis Lehane. (William Morrow, $16.99.) Lehane's Prohibition-era gangster tale, an Edgar Award winner, revisits the Coughlins -- who loomed so large in ''The Given Day'' -- tracing the evolution of the family's youngest and wildest son, Joe, from South Boston punk to Florida bootlegger and crime boss.
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE PROMISE OF ROCK 'N' ROLL, by Marc Dolan. (Norton, $17.95.) This superbly detailed portrait explores the economic, social, political, religious and family turmoil that shaped the earnest Everyman rocker from New Jersey.

HEADLINE: What I Read That Summer

 BODY:
The rites of summer are, by definition, fleeting: the summer romance, the summer job or vacation. Only the books seem to stick. Twelve writers recall their most memorable experiences of summer reading, proving perhaps that if you're looking for an enduring summer romance, a good book might be your best bet.
Louise Erdrich
The public library in my hometown was a hushed haven cooled by slow-beating ceiling fans. Behind the high desk, a tall blond woman examined my card, but refused to stamp out the books I'd chosen."White Fang"was too violent for a 9-year-old. I came back with a note from my mother that said I could read anything I wanted. From then on I could range at will. With a worried expression the librarian allowed me to check out Leon Uris's"Exodus."Next, nervously, she let me get away with"Ship of Fools."I had no idea what they were about. I just read them as collections of words. 
And then I found ''The Nylon Pirates,'' by Nicholas Monsarrat. I thought it would be about pirates stealing women's nylon stockings, which seemed shockingly tempting. It must have been the last straw, because the librarian refused to check it out for me. Instead, she gave me"Animal Farm.'' ''Let me know what you think,'' she said. I loved it. ''Well?'' she said when I brought it back. ''A great pig story!'' I told her. She renewed the book with her special red stamp and handed it back to me. ''Read it again,'' she said.
Louise Erdrich's most recent novel, ''The Round House,'' won the National Book Award last year.
Walter Isaacson
When I was growing up in New Orleans, my friend Thomas and I used to go fishing across Lake Pontchartrain. We'd stop for lunch at his uncle's house on the Bogue Falaya, a lazy river teeming with turtles. I was baffled about what ''Uncle Walker'' did for a living, since he always seemed to be at home, sipping bourbon. He was a kindly gentleman, whose placid face seemed to know despair but whose eyes nevertheless often smiled. His daughter said he was a writer. One summer I read Walker Percy's ''The Moviegoer,'' and it dawned on me that writing was something you could do for a living, just like being a doctor or a fisherman. The novel's wry philosophical depth opened my eyes to what Percy called ''the search,'' poking around for clues about why we are here. At the end of that summer, I tried to get him to expound on the religious themes in the book, but he fended me off. ''There are two types of people who come out of Louisiana,'' he said. ''Preachers and storytellers.'' It was better to be a storyteller.
Walter Isaacson is the president of the Aspen Institute and the author of biographies of Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin.
Pico Iyer
I was just out of graduate school, the world was in front of me and I had nothing to do but roam around the Peloponnese for the"Let's Go"guidebooks. Day after day, I'd wake up in a modest taverna, take a bus along the coast and wander through whitewashed villages, seeing sights for a living. I subsisted on Greek salads and Cokes and sported (like a sign of hoped-for wisdom) a beard.
Every day, talking to no one, encircled by the most elemental classical landscape I'd seen -- all blue-and-white intensity -- I'd page through the anguished dramas of Philip Carey and Mildred in Somerset Maugham's"Of Human Bondage."For one not long out of British boarding-school, and hungry for a life of imagination, it became a near-scriptural text. When I looked up, I'd see blue water foaming around rocks, a lonely church amidst olive trees; when I looked down, Mildred was slashing through young Philip's possessions with a carving knife.
In later years I'd reread the book and cherish, as ever, Maugham's rare mix of society shrewdness and traveler's openness. But then, my future as long as the horizons around me, his story held me like a warning and a bildungsroman at once. Books seldom so possess you as when you're a kid, alone and eager for transformation. My summer in Greece became the summer of watching Philip Carey find -- and lose -- himself.
Pico Iyer's most recent book is ''The Man Within My Head.''
Alexander McCall Smith
One summer, over 20 years ago, my wife and I went to stay in a small cottage in France, on a farm in the Auvergne. Our children were small and needed an afternoon sleep, during which I sat on the veranda and readPatricia Highsmith novels, one after the other, and scared myself thoroughly. It started after I was a few chapters into"People Who Knock on the Door,'' and by the time I had reached the end of"Deep Water,'' I felt utterly uneasy.
It was ridiculous, of course; did I really need to look surreptitiously down the track that led to the house in case some passing stranger -- a Highsmithian psychopath -- might drop by? It was worse at night. The cottage had electricity, but only just. One could not leave the light on throughout the night, and the house was very isolated. The Auvergne in my mind now has a slightly sinister edge to it, and Tom Ripley, of course, lives in rural France; worth bearing in mind.
Alexander McCall Smith is the author of the ''No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency'' series.
Joy Williams
In the summer of my 13th year I read Thomas Wolfe's ''Look Homeward, Angel.'' It seemed that only moments before, I was devouring Walter Farley's books and writing love letters to a horse (I will have you. . . . I will . . . ), but this was my first discovery of a novel -- big, poetic, strange, disorderly, ''a story of the buried life,'' as Wolfe described it. I later learned that many eminent critics felt it was not a novel at all. Wolfe was mocked for his lyricism and sprawl. Even my English teacher said that it was autobiography and was thus far easier to write than something of a creative nature. Her name has been forgotten, even by me, but ''Look Homeward, Angel'' remains, in its messy, keening, passionate, horribly comic and tragic way (Ben Gant's death is one of the most moving in literature), ever memorable.
It is a young writer's book -- Wolfe was in his late 20s when it was published -- and it is a marvelous book to read when one is young, lonely and unsure, desperate to become real and protect oneself from ''school, society, all the barbarous invasions of the world.'' It's excessive, indulgent (originally he wanted to title it ''O Lost!'' or ''Alone, Alone''), mythopoetic, a threnody of loss, defined and undefinable. It's his best book, of course. He was on the verge of maturation, of summer, the season that eternally promises and confounds so much.
Joy Williams is the author of four novels, three collections of stories and a book of essays.
Ayana Mathis
I turned 16 in the summer of 1989. Philadelphia was pulling itself out of the hole into which it had fallen in the '70s and early '80s, but the city still had the air of both sinking ship and powder keg. In the high heat of the afternoons I would take two buses and the subway to meet friends in Center City. We wanted to be writers. We felt terrible about everything in our angsty teenage way. Our parents and our lives were complicated in ways we were too young to understand. We hung around one friend's basement, reading and smoking and playing albums. We listened to ''Visions of Johanna'' so often I knew every scratch.
One afternoon I brought Sonia Sanchez' ''Under a Soprano Sky'' with me. I had not intended to read aloud, but the poems got the best of me. After I'd read a few, we were quiet and astonished. Sanchez knew my yearning and my fears, and she was black like me and a woman like me. And she was a poet, which made me think I could be one too. I didn't know how to articulate any of that, so I read the poems again, and then again. Summer blazed on, but my friends and I had each other, and our youth, and poems to say what we could not.
Ayana Mathis is the author of the novel ''The Twelve Tribes of Hattie.''
Christopher Buckley
It was at a camp in Maine with the unimprovable name of Wild Goose. I was 12 years old and utterly miserable. I'd brought along my toy soldiers, and the other boys in Anaconda Cabin made merciless fun of me. Socially marooned, I discovered, for the first time, really, the escape of reading.
The book was a dog-eared paperback whose cover showed a forest penetrated by shafts of sunlight, and two Indians with mohawks walking along. It was a coming-of-age story of a boy torn between two worlds: he is kidnapped by the Delaware tribe as a child and returned to his parents as a teenager.
I would wake early and lie in my bed, devouring every word. I remember the smell of the piney woods outside the cabin and the sound of birds waking.
The book is ''The Light in the Forest,'' by Conrad Richter, first published in 1953, a year after I was born. I know nothing of Richter, but I will always be profoundly grateful to him for providing me with shelter that summer, and for showing me the way into, and out of, the forest.
Christopher Buckley's book of essays, ''But Enough About You,'' is due to be published next year.
Junot Díaz
Junior year I spent my summer working at a steel mill. All my boys were taking it easy and my girl was down at the shore with her family, writing me sketchy letters about all the guys who were ''into her.'' She was at the beach, planning to leave me I was sure, and there I was wearing thermal greens and metatarsal boots five days a week. When we went into the melt shop I had to put on thermals under the greens to keep my inner organs from being cooked. What was even worse, though, were some of my co-workers. A couple of them tried to sell me paper targets with drawings of ''blacks'' on them. Their idea of a joke.
It was seriously a lousy job and an even lousier summer.
Still, you got to fight -- so I fought. Every lunch break I sat on the deck overlooking the scrap yard and read me someToni Morrison. I'd brought all of her novels back from Rutgers, vowing to finish them all by summer's end, and that's exactly what I did. I read with a concentration I have never again matched. I'll sure as hell never forget those lunch hours, turning those pages, the Komatsu loader cranking in the distance. I'll never forget the books or all those heartbreaking lines. ''How loose the silk. How jailed down the juice.'' I'll never forget having to close the books, all the strength that took and getting back to work.
I survived the summer. The girlfriend didn't leave me. And Toni Morrison's novels took hold of me the way books are wont to do when you're a certain age. Took hold and never let go.
Junot Díaz's novel, ''The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,'' won the Pulitzer Prize in 2008. His most recent book is ''This Is How You Lose Her.''
Jorie Graham
Early in the summer of 1963, in Rome, I finished supper and went into the empty living room with a new book. The glossy Gallimard cover of ''Anna Karénine'' in one hand, I arranged the pillows on the dark green velvet couch. Swallows cut their ellipses through the evening. Cicadas continued their strict stitching. Sounds in the house receded. The door stayed shut. I began to cross that other doorway, that frame filled with lines of black on white, and began to forget. My hands disappeared, my head, the room, the garden, its bursts of sparrows. . . .
''Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had absolutely wanted, but in a low-cut black velvet dress. . . . Now she understood that Anna could not have been in lilac, that her loveliness consisted precisely in always standing out from what she wore, that what she wore was never seen on her. And the black dress with luxurious lace was not seen on her; it was just a frame, and only she was seen -- ''
It was then, with the music of the waltz everywhere, and the words ''Just then Vronsky approached,'' that the strangeness began. I went blind. Or, rather, I looked up from the clear page into the deep black velvet, which had become the entire room. I tried to touch it, but my hands fluttered through. Where was I? Then there it was, the velvet -- at my fingertips -- the rim of the pillow. I was in the living room. I was at home. When I looked back to where the page had been, it was gone. Had I not looked away, would they not have vanished, the ballroom, the dancing, the danger, the absolute desire? Was this what Vronsky had seen -- how the thing is everywhere and then it disappears? Then the door opened, and my mother was calling. ''What are you doing here in the dark,'' she said. ''You'll ruin your sight.'' And the light came on. And there was the little paperback again, in my hands, weighing about as much as a hand.
Jorie Graham's most recent book of poems is ''Place.''
Chelsea Cain
In 1979, I got chloroformed and stuffed in a trunk for the first time at the Key West public library. Naturally, I kept going back. It was a pink palace with white shuttered windows -- the perfect place to get bound and gagged and tossed on a ship. No one asked me where my parents were or why I spent five hours a day systematically going through the children's mystery series section. On weekends, when the grown-ups were around, we went to the beach or out on the water. I found a lot of 20-dollar bills floating in the ocean in those days. I used to take the limp wet cash to the T-shirt shop on Duval Street, and they'd press it dry with their decal iron until it looked brand new. Twenties make excellent bookmarks. On Monday I'd be back at the library, another five books in my arms. I would read for hours, marking my favorite scenes with crisp 20s, before returning the books to the shelves. Funny, what we don't question in childhood. It was many years later that I realized that my windfall of floating cash had not been lost by careless swimmers, but instead dumped by smugglers about to be boarded by the Coast Guard. By then it was too late. I had already filled the library's collection of Nancy Drew books with drug money.
Chelsea Cain's new thriller, ''Let Me Go,'' will be published in August.
Cheryl Strayed
I worked two full-time jobs the summer I was 15. One was granted me by a federal program for economically disadvantaged youth, doing cleanup and repairs at the school I attended; the other was at the Dairy Queen. Five days a week my two jobs bumped up against each other in a dawn-to-well-past-dusk 16-hour stream, the graffiti-scrubbing and floor-polishing giving way to banana-split-making and cheerful cashiering. During every break, I had a book in my hands. The same one all summer long: Dalton Trumbo's ''Johnny Got His Gun.'' Every unapologetic page felt to me like a shot to the head. Trumbo didn't use a single comma. He didn't capitalize ''Christmas.'' He conveyed everything I knew and didn't yet know about the world without ever leaving the mind of a physically incapacitated man. I read it as I walked the half-mile from one job to the next. I read it while waiting for my ride in the late-night parking lot of the D.Q. Each time I finished the book I bawled my guts out and then turned to Page 1 and began reading again. It was as if Trumbo put me in a summerlong trance, only of the reverse sort -- not the kind that puts you under, but rather the kind that wakes you up forever.
Cheryl Strayed's books include ''Wild'' and ''Tiny Beautiful Things.''
Jim Holt
It's a roaring, squawking, howling cliché, but my most memorable summer-reading experience was getting through all of Proustwhile hitchhiking and Eurail-passing my way around Europe. It was the summer of 1976, and I was still in college. Flying on cheapo Icelandair, I landed in Luxembourg, thumbed my way to the Channel and eventually made my way to Oxford. There, at the heavenly Blackwell's bookstore, I bought the entire Chatto & Windus edition of ''Remembrance of Things Past'' in the Scott Moncrieff translation. For the next two months, those 12 little yellow-and-blue volumes sustained, engrossed and frequently bored me in my trajectory through Britain, France, Austria and Italy. I sat chuckling in Paris's Parc Monceau in the company of the incomparable Charlus; I endured the longueurs of the narrator's obsession with Albertine, that ''improbable jeune fille'' with the ''pasted-on bosom'' (Nabokov), on an all-night train from Salzburg to Venice; I had a fake Proustian moment of mémoire involontaire on the Pont Neuf a couple of days before my flight back. Corny, but I miss the person I was then.
Jim Holt's latest book is ''Why Does the World Exist?''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: More Regulation, or Less?

 BODY:
Readers discuss government's proper role in the marketplace.
To the Editor:
In a recent and bewildering article, The Times reported that Texans remain wary of government regulation even after a fertilizer explosion killed 14, one of the worst industrial disasters in decades. Even though Texas has the nation's worst record on workplace fatalities, businesses can ''do pretty much what they want to,'' as one Texan observed.
Our regulatory system is a flash point for many. Simply stated (and admittedly oversimplified), the anti-regulatory faction posits that the free market's ''invisible hand'' takes care of itself and ''bad actors'' are eventually eliminated from the marketplace. Regulations, it contends, stifle business and innovation.
On the other side, proponents of regulation contend that unbridled capitalism inevitably leads to excess, fraud and harm. They trace a line from the Triangle shirtwaist fire to thalidomide-related birth defects to the 2008 financial crisis to the Bangladesh factory collapse. Effective regulations might have prevented those unfortunate events. 
Regulation -- like beauty -- is in the eyes of the beholder. There is no dispute that regulations carry increased costs and are sometimes excessive. Nonetheless, most believe that effective regulation is required and beneficial in a complex society.
I recently attended the annual shareholders' meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company. Mr. Buffett said, ''It is in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a manner that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.'' He understands, presumably, that such scrutiny is a legitimate price to pay to live in a society where legal rights are respected and enforced. Moreover, he understands that compliance is profitable.
What is needed is more regulation and tighter enforcement. Moreover, businesses that do not comply should bear the economic consequences of their misdeeds. There should not be any caps on damages recoverable because only then will business do the right thing.
The laissez-faire doctrine developed in the 18th century is a relic not appropriate for the 21st century. Mr. Buffett understands that perfectly. Why don't others?

To steal from Winston Churchill, government regulation is the worst form of oversight, except for all others. In its absence we return to the days of robber barons, badly polluted water and air, unbridled corruption and greed on Wall Street, banks vulnerable to collapse, contaminated food, tainted drugs, unsafe air travel and deathtrap automobiles.
Regulation is costly, inefficient and frustrating, and much better than the alternative. History proves conclusively that unregulated free markets are incapable of reining in the excesses of capitalism, which must be tempered through government meddling. It is ugly, but it works.
JEFF SCHWEITZER Spicewood, Tex., May 30, 2013
The United States has had a regulatory structure since its founding. History reveals that there are alternating cycles in which government is seen as a valuable and active partner in our social and economic lives, or as a serious problem to be avoided.
What our research demonstrates, however, is that government regulation, of both the economy and the civic sphere, has enriched the lives of Americans throughout history. To be sure, we can point to an array of government failures, and those failures must be corrected either through reform or, when appropriate, deregulation.
Over the last three decades, antigovernment rhetoric that extols markets and demonizes government has captured the public conversation. That rhetoric, however, is deeply flawed. Markets cannot exist without government support, whether it is to enforce a contract, protect the civil rights and civil liberties of the weakest among us, or establish and sustain competitive markets.
The real issue is not about the size of government or the amount of regulation; rather, the challenging issue is to find the right mix of government and markets in the name of the common good.
JOSEPH P. TOMAIN SIDNEY A. SHAPIRO Cincinnati, May 29, 2013
The writers are professors at the University of Cincinnati College of Law and Wake Forest School of Law, respectively, and the authors of the forthcoming book ''Achieving Democracy.''
Mr. Chafetz overstates his case. The choice is not necessarily between more and less regulation. The choice should be between effective regulations, well enforced, and the confusing and poorly enforced system of regulations we have now (such as the tax code).
He states that ''what is needed is more regulation and tighter enforcement.'' Why is that? Is there no end to the number of regulations we need? There should be a cost-benefit analysis before enacting any new regulations. Advocates of endless regulations are attempting to achieve the impossible: perfection of society.
An example is my own profession of medicine. New regulations pour out of Congress like a flood, often with no provision to pay for them. Many are rooted in initially worthy goals, but ultimately, in an attempt at perfection, lead to diminishing returns for escalating costs in time, money and morale.
JEFFREY A. RAPP Healdsburg, Calif., May 29, 2013
Historically, regulation was perceived by advocates of small government as problematic for two main reasons. From a political perspective, it was seen as beyond the purview of what government should be doing, which ideally was nothing more than ensuring public order and stable money. From an economic perspective, it was seen as inefficient.
If regulation was intended to prevent the public from harm (for example, pollution, unsafe working conditions or hazardous products), litigation was construed as a more efficient way to ensure that outcome. The threat of having to pay damages to an injured party was to provide sufficient disincentive to industry to engage in unsafe practices.
What is so disturbing about the tort reform movement, supported by industries and legislators that also rail against regulation, is that it leaves the public with no recourse against corporate excess. Not only are we subject to harm from unregulated industry, but awards for the damages we suffer are limited as well.
Calls for tort reform and against regulation are not ideological, despite what right- and libertarian-leaning legislators affirm. They are cynical and antisocial.

Even if markets discipline ''bad actors,'' we suffer severe repeat offenders, about whom the regulatory system fails. Think of BP's record of violations even before the Gulf of Mexico spill, or charter bus operators singled out by the secretary of transportation, or food producers that repeatedly jeopardize our health.
More than ''damages recoverable'' is needed. Severe repeat offenders should be subject to receivership, replacing their boards or other management.
ROY A. SCHOTLAND Washington, May 29, 2013
The writer is professor emeritus at Georgetown Law Center.
As Mr. Chafetz points out: ''The anti-regulatory faction posits that the free market's 'invisible hand' takes care of itself and 'bad actors' are eventually eliminated from the marketplace. Regulations, it contends, stifle business and innovation.'' A self-serving argument if there ever was one.
If only the ''bad actors'' were harmed when conducting their business loosely, perhaps there would be some element of natural justice involved. But too often the irresponsible actions of ''bad actors'' hurt innocents, people with no opportunity to ensure that the business was conducted responsibly. Those are the people whom regulations are intended to protect. And they should be protected.
DAVID M. BEHRMAN Houston, May 29, 2013
Businesses pay for their misdeeds by losing customers and profits. Businesses should be held legally liable for damages they cause, but beyond that there is no need to involve the government in the process.
In general, there is no need for the government to be involved in any transactions that are entered into voluntarily; these transactions can be regulated by the buyer and the seller. The proper role of the government is to regulate where buyers and sellers do not. For example, residents of a town who may be exposed to danger by the building of a factory have a legitimate basis to involve themselves by means of government safety regulations. The same argument is the basis for environmental regulations that protect air and water from pollution.
The problem with the current state of government involvement in our daily lives is that the overwhelming majority of it -- from employment regulations to ''consumer protection'' laws to the Americans With Disabilities Act -- is not regulation but interference, and we are drowning in it. There are legitimate areas for government regulation; if the government would focus on these and let the rest alone, it would do a better job of regulating, and we would all be better off.
DENNIS CANFIELD Western Springs, Ill., May 29, 2013
Mr. Chafetz wonders why so many people oppose lifesaving regulations. Since words powerfully shape our emotional responses, what if we substitute the word ''standards'' for ''regulations''?
''Regulation'' evokes feelings of constriction, constraint, holding back; so it is little wonder that many see regulation as a barrier to progress. The word ''standards'' carries many positive associations as what most people aspire to uphold.
The term ''fuel efficiency standards,'' for example, carries a positive connotation to many, perhaps easing their upgrade passed last year. Might ''fuel efficiency regulations'' have suffered a different fate? Words have tremendous power.
FRANCES MOORE LAPPÉ

The writer is the author of ''Diet for a Small Planet'' and other books.
Regulation is a reactive mechanism. It usually attempts to fix a problem that has already happened so that it doesn't happen again. It cannot predict the future, however, and therefore, cannot fix new problems before they happen.
Civilization does advance, however, when regulation pushes society in new directions. Regulators pushed utilities to bury cables underground rather than hang them from poles, exposing them to the vicissitudes of the weather. Regulators pushed factories to clean up their smokestack emissions, leading to cleaner air. Regulators broke up the telephone monopoly, leading to competition and diversification in telecommunications.
So the problem, right now, is that the message about regulation is steeped in pessimism, and the optimists have been drowned out. When we acknowledge regulation's flaws, but adopt its hopeful guidance for the future, we will feel better about it as a nation.

The Writer Responds
Mr. Schweitzer makes the case for regulation better than I did: Regulations can be ugly, but are nonetheless necessary to curb the inexorable excesses of the marketplace.
Professor Jacobson addresses the importance of litigation and business's risk of paying damages as a disincentive for unsafe practices. One problem, however, is that certain types of lawsuits have been eliminated by the Supreme Court (such as failure-to-warn suits against generic drug makers). This means that seriously injured people have no recourse.
Mr. Canfield's position -- that buyers and sellers can regulate themselves reasonably -- comes from a different planet than mine. I do not agree that we are drowning in regulations, especially employment regulations, consumer protection and the Americans With Disabilities Act. Many Americans from all political spectrums would agree that such laws and regulations have immeasurably improved this country.
Professor Schotland raises an intriguing idea for severe repeat offenders: that the company be placed in receivership and current management and board fired. Does anyone doubt that under such an approach unsafe conditions would plummet? This is also why there should not be any cap on damage awards.
Dr. Rapp makes a point that I had hoped was implicit in my letter -- that there should be better regulations that are effectively enforced. The tax code would be a prime example for overhaul. Regarding his point about cost-benefit analysis, that is already the case under several statutes. Frankly, a danger is the likelihood that business would hire economists to ''demonstrate'' why any new regulation was harmful.
For some time there has been an active campaign against government that is no doubt promoted and financed by business. Professors Tomain and Shapiro indicate that their research demonstrates the effectiveness of regulations for improving Americans' lives. They also point out that the success of American business is to a large extent attributable to the government's support.

HEADLINE: Greed Is Good . . .

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
One recent Thursday, G. Steven Farris, the chairman and C.E.O. of the poorly performing oil-and-gas company Apache, stood before a few hundred shareholders who were about to vote on his salary. Farris, who was hoping to earn well over $10 million for this year, listed a number of his accomplishments. ''We're the No. 1 driller in the Permian Basin,'' he said, referring to the oil reserves in West Texas and New Mexico. But some shareholders, most likely mindful of the company's falling stock price, noted that the proposed pay package seemed out of whack. Still, the tally was a nail-biter: 49.8 percent of the votes favored giving Farris the bump. 
Most C.E.O.'s used to be able to handle their pay negotiations in private, but the Dodd-Frank reforms, which were passed in 2010, now give shareholders the right to vote on executive compensation. This has helped usher in a so-called ''say on pay'' revolution, which tries to stop executives from making more money when their companies don't do that well. In Switzerland, a recent nationwide referendum, passed 2 to 1, gave shareholders the right to restrict the pay for the heads of Swiss companies. The European Union is likely to vote on a similar measure by the end of the year.
C.E.O.'s like Farris have long argued that they should make more money, but what's surprising is that many business-school professors make the case even more energetically. The standard defense is that a talented marketing director or chief engineer can help a company thrive, but the next-best candidate will probably be successful, too. A great C.E.O., they say, is many times better than an average one, and those great ones need high-powered incentives. C.E.O.-friendly economists also suggest that the salary is moot if the chief executive is creating many multiples of their pay in shareholder value. Some of these enthusiasts point out that Steve Jobs rescued Apple (after his exodus) in 1997, when it was near bankruptcy, and turned it into one of the most valuable companies ever. Jobs was worth an estimated $7 billion at his death, but he made hundreds of billions of dollars for his shareholders. Many now say he was underpaid.
C.E.O.'s might indeed need significant incentives, but the problem is that most of them don't perform like Steve Jobs even when they get them. The financial research firm Obermatt recently compared the compensation of C.E.O.'s at publicly traded firms and their performance and found no correlation between the two. Like a bottle of wine or a promising college quarterback turning pro, C.E.O.'s are similar to what economists call experience goods: you commit to a price long before you know if they're worth it. Just ask the shareholders of J.C. Penney, which ousted its C.E.O., Ron Johnson, less than 18 months after hiring him away from Apple. Under his leadership, the company lost more than $500 million in a single quarter.
So far, the ''say on pay'' revolution feels more like the second season of ''Game of Thrones'' -- there's a lot of drama, a bit of blood, some cheers, but things end up more or less exactly where they started. While the Dodd-Frank law requires a shareholder vote on executive pay at least every three years, the vote is not binding. Apache's board eventually lowered Farris's package by around $3 million, but it is the exception. Shareholders ended up approving pay packages around 97 percent of the time. A vast majority of overpaid C.E.O.'s, it seems, have little to fear from all these new guidelines.
Economically speaking, this is more than a little odd. Shareholders should be motivated to pay their C.E.O.'s according to their success. But doing so involves a tricky dance known to game theorists as the principal-agent problem: how does an employer (the principal) motivate a worker (the agent) to pursue the principal's interest? This principal-agent problem is everywhere. (Do you pay a contractor per day of work or per project? Do you pay salespeople by the hour or on commission?) It becomes particularly thorny when the agent knows a lot more about his job than the principal. George Costanza was a comic incarnation of the principal-agent problem. He constantly invented schemes to make his employer think he was doing his job well when he wasn't doing much at all. ''When you look annoyed all the time,'' he once told Jerry and Elaine, ''people think that you're busy.''
Boards and chief executives don't often suffer from Costanza-like ineptitude, but they are harder to rein in. They are often rewarded when they don't succeed but are not usually penalized enough when they do a lackluster job. Lucian Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School and perhaps the leading academic voice for corporate reform, told me that the problem isn't (just) greed. It's the boards of directors. The directors are supposed to represent the stockholders' interests, he says, but most public firms, where C.E.O.'s can have considerable influence over board appointments, neuter those interests. They are structured so that a board tends to side with its chief.
Excessive C.E.O. pay, Bebchuk says, is a manifestation of a deeper problem. A bad C.E.O. pay package can cost shareholders millions; a corporation that is being poorly overseen by its board can cost billions. ''Shareholder rights in the U.S. are still quite weak relative to what they are in other advanced economies,'' he explained. His solution is to pass laws that make it easier for shareholders to vote out boardmembers who fail to discipline underperforming chief executives. This, he argues, will motivate them to push back against executives that do an underwhelming job. At the very least, all the attention would keep boardmembers and C.E.O.'s on their toes. And a multitude of better-run companies would result in billions, perhaps trillions, of wealth returned to the economy.
On some level, Adam Smith offered a similar solution a long time ago. In ''The Wealth of Nations,'' published in 1776, Smith argued that narrow self-interest -- the precursor of high-powered incentives, perhaps -- could lead to the best collective outcome, but he noted that greed alone isn't enough. Businesspeople needed a carrot (lots of money), he said, but they also needed a stick (the fear of being outcompeted). The modern public company, Bebchuk and many others argue, has damaged Smith's core principles. A C.E.O. protected by an overly cozy board (or, in frequent cases like JP Morgan, where Jamie Dimon is both C.E.O. and chairman of his own board) gets rich if he succeeds but is not penalized when his performance is, well, meh.
This is not only maddening; it's not even capitalism. Adam Smith saw this coming too. He warned that a new innovation, the joint stock company, skewed incentives because those who run a company aren't the ones who own it. ''Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company,'' he wrote. Fortunately, Bebchuk says, public companies have outperformed Smith's grim predictions, but they've also underperformed their potential. The solution is simple. Whether it's Jamie Dimon or George Costanza, capitalism works only when people are truly anxious, not faking it. C.E.O.'s need to be afraid that shareholders will cut their pay if they don't do better.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. A lot of people want C.E.O.'s to make less money.
2. So why are they making so much more?
3. Maybe they should be more afraid?

HEADLINE: Stuck in the Shadow of Affluence

BYLINE: By BEN AUSTEN

 BODY:
On a 100-degree day last summer, on Chicago's southernmost edge, Willie Fleming, who goes by J. R. (''It stands for Just Righteousness''), crept up to an abandoned ranch house shrouded in overgrown weeds. The overwhelmingly poor and black neighborhood sits beside a 150-acre, 1,500-unit public-housing complex and is about as far -- literally and figuratively -- from the Loop as you can get and still be in Chicago. Nearly a quarter of the homes in the area had been empty for at least two years. Usually when J. R. scouts for properties to break into and take over, he looks for ones with unmown grass, a sign of vacancy and disregard. But this was excessive. ''I don't come back here without my air gun,'' he said, backing away. A young couple next door had set up lawn chairs on the sidewalk. An infant in only a diaper tottered around them. ''That's the dead-dog cemetery,'' the man announced, motioning to the ranch house. 
J. R. told the couple about the Anti-Eviction Campaign, the group he founded in 2009 with Toussaint Losier, a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Chicago and a fellow housing activist. At 40, J. R. possesses the softening bulk of a former running back -- he was all-state as a high-school sophomore. A skunklike streak of white runs up the center of his ringleted black dreadlocks. In the past year, he said, the Anti-Eviction Campaign freed up 20 abandoned properties, fixing up the buildings and moving ''home-less people into the people-less homes.''
As hard as the foreclosure crisis hit Chicago, its force has been felt with an unevenness that can seem fiendishly unjust. The U.S. Postal Service, which tracks these numbers, reported that 62,000 properties in Chicago were vacant at the end of last year, with two-thirds of them clustered as if to form a sinkhole in just a few black neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. Currently about 40 percent of all homeowners in these communities owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, and countywide 80,000 foreclosures are wending their way through circuit court. Last spring, a nine-month study conducted by the National Fair Housing Alliance revealed what everyone in these neighborhoods already knew: After forcing out families in foreclosure, banks failed to properly market, maintain and secure the vacated homes. Thieves subsequently entered many of the properties and stripped them of copper and anything else that could be trafficked. J. R. couldn't reconcile the idea that homes were being allowed to turn into wrecks with the fact that the city had a shortage of 120,000 units of affordable housing and some 100,000 people sleeping in shelters or on the street each year. Chicago didn't have just a housing crisis, he offered, it had a moral crisis.
The Anti-Eviction Campaign always canvassed a neighborhood before acting, J. R. explained to the young parents. He asked if they would support a takeover of either of the empty houses that sandwiched theirs or of any of the abandoned homes on their block. A family that moved in, he said, most likely wouldn't pay rent or a mortgage, but wasn't that preferable to a vacant property further deteriorating, becoming a haven for gangbangers or drug users?
''Hell, yeah,'' the woman said, without hesitation, from her lawn chair.
''That's what we need, uh-huh, exactly,'' the man added.
Over the last few years, J. R. has been inside more than a hundred abandoned properties, each one a variation on the same theme of despair. He has stumbled upon drugs and whatever paraphernalia people needed to use or make them, along with the gathered sheets and worn-down mattresses of so-called trick houses. He has seen the carcasses of dogs and cats and rats and possums and raccoons. And yet J. R. proves surprisingly upbeat when talking about the efforts of the Anti-Eviction Campaign. At a Y.M.C.A. in Bronzeville, on the South Side, as people crowded into the basement for a screening of ''Inside Job'' -- the 2010 documentary that essentially detailed the depressing back story of their own foreclosure plight -- J .R. told them that he had seen the film 19 times and hoped to see it 150 more. It inspired him. ''The government failed us. The market failed us. Harvard, Yale and the University of Chicago failed us. Our government -- the government -- doesn't belong to us. Forget them; they forgot us. We need to solve our problems ourselves.''
It's not that the City of Chicago and its public and private partners don't care about the areas gutted by foreclosures; it's just that as investments, the numbers on these blocks simply don't add up, and no amount of good intentions is going to change that any time soon. Since 2009, the city has funneled $168 million from the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program into the purchase of 862 vacant foreclosures, fixing up 804 of them, at an average cost of $110,000. It sank $350,000 into the repairs of one home, but even at the asking price of $105,000, no buyers could be found. So far only 91 of the units have sold. Although the real estate market has rebounded elsewhere in Chicago, with construction starts and prices both on the rise, many of the blocks surrounding these renovated homes are still studded with unsellable hulls. Of all the properties the city wanted to purchase under the program, it found it could get title on only about 10 percent of the buildings. To dodge fees, banks often weren't registering their foreclosures, or they didn't complete the foreclosure process to avoid the tax burden and responsibility of the unmovable real estate. Thousands of other bad mortgages were bundled in private securitization trusts, frequently with the trusts technically owning the loans and the evicted homeowners owning the property.
Cook County now plans to form what will become the nation's largest land bank, an entity that will acquire thousands of vacant residences, demolishing some, turning others into much-needed rentals and holding onto others until they can be released, strategically, back into the market. By clearing titles and back taxes, the land bank hopes to attract the most responsible of the investor groups that are currently gobbling up distressed housing in neighborhoods with far better prospects. The best of these firms use sophisticated algorithms to determine when to purchase a property, factoring in, among many things, the surrounding vacancy rates, the prevalence of crime and the quality of the schools. In the Chicago neighborhoods inundated with foreclosures, the homes don't come anywhere close to meeting the minimum threshold for the investors to buy.
''We're not like Detroit, cordoning off sections of the city,'' Benet Haller, Chicago's principal adviser for planning and design, told me. ''But we are like London or Jakarta, with a hyperdense core -- a zone of affluence -- and something else beyond.'' What the housing crisis has revealed, in stark relief, is a Chicago that already looks increasingly like this vision of a ring city, with the moneyed elite residing within the glow of that jewel-like core and the largely ethnic poor and working-class relegated to the peripheries, the banlieues.
In the decades after World War II, as factories and mills closed and the economy that shaped the whole sprawling city until then collapsed, the ''inner city'' of Chicago became the place you fled, at least if you were white and had money. Between 1950 and 1990, the population of Chicago declined by 837,000 people. But in the past two decades, the city began to add residents again. No longer hog butcher or toolmaker, Chicago emerged from its long decline as a self-proclaimed ''global city'' -- a tourist destination for the world, a player with derivatives and trade shows, a city of big transportation hubs. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of residents in the city's central area increased by 48,000 (more than any other city center in the country), and even with tens of thousands of new condos added there before the housing crash, vacancy rates for high-end apartments currently stand near a 10-year low. Richard M. Daley, who during his 22 years as mayor did much to foster the downtown renaissance, even moved from Bridgeport, the family's old sod on the South Side, to a new upscale development overlooking Millennium Park, which he built. The current mayor, Rahm Emanuel, has already induced 15 corporations to relocate their headquarters to Chicago. ''The city is no longer a place to get on a plane and go to the coasts,'' Emanuel said in May, ''but a place to stay and call home.''
None of this is revelatory. It's a thumbnail history that any Chicagoan could tell you, and it's similar to the trajectory of any number of American cities. The conundrum that exists in Chicago, though, is what happens to the ''something else beyond'' now that the center is prospering. For the people trying to make their lives in the areas that J. R. and his fellow activists are trying to save, the question is not at all a theoretical one. The way many of them see it, they're being sacrificed so that the city can be reborn.
In these outlying communities, as well, the residents with the means to leave often have, compounding the problems of concentrated poverty. From 2000 to 2010, while affluent whites were migrating back to downtown, Chicago's African-American population fell by 181,000, an astounding 17 percent drop. Many of them decamped for the south and west suburbs as well as the relative safety and higher living standards of the actual South. The foreclosure crisis then blew through and removed a lot of the remaining homeowners and wealth. It was hard for people on the South Side and the West Side not to see evidence of an engineered shrinkage, a strategy to starve derelict communities of resources, thus bringing about their further depopulation and return to nature. Over the past decade and half, Chicago razed all 82 of its troubled housing project high-rises, the biggest civic redesign since urban renewal placed the massive tower-and-garden developments there in the first place. The towers had become warehouses for the most disadvantaged, symbols of urban decay and the failures of government to reverse this slide. Getting rid of the projects meant that areas near the expanding zone of affluence were cleared of blight. They were also cleared of many of their former inhabitants.
Chicago no longer has the money for big urban renewal projects. Earlier this year, Emanuel did announce an initiative that will couple public and private investment to try to revive several communities that possess -- or are at least on the edge of -- some existing economic development. In Pullman, on the far South Side, for instance, a Walmart is expected to anchor a 180-acre mixed-use facility. The mayor described how these pockets of activity could become larger, link up and eventually form corridors that lead from, say, the South Loop, through Bronzeville and Hyde Park. But most city plans appear to be focused on land use and stabilization, not development. The city is escalating a program that allowed homeowners to acquire adjoining vacant lots, leaving them with expansive grassy estates. It is promoting urban agriculture and looking to turn empty rail lines and other industrial sites into recreation trails and natural drainage systems. At the same time, the city spent $14 million last year to knock down 736 vacant buildings, including 270 abandoned homes that the Police Department identified as shelters for gangs and other criminal activity.
And then there's Emanuel's plan to close 50 schools, almost all of them in the same black and Latino neighborhoods battered by the foreclosures and a recent spike in homicides. The closures weren't a matter of downsizing, Emanuel has said in the face of intense protests and criticism, but of trading up academically; he has pledged $155 million for upgrades at the ''welcoming schools.'' Others were worried more about the long-term consequences of these actions. ''It's a slow death once you take the schools out of these communities,'' Brad Hunt, an urban historian and co-author of the recent book ''Planning Chicago,'' told me. ''No one is talking shrinkage, even though that's what we're doing. In Chicago, that's not the image we have of our city.''
Before turning to activism full time, J. R. still shared a name with his father, everyone calling him Junior. It seemed too small to him. He said his father was a C.I.A. operative, as well as a gunrunner and drug kingpin at the Cabrini-Green housing complex. His mother, Marlene McIntosh, was a former Black Panther and community organizer who moved the family around a lot. J. R. stayed on the South Side, in the Robert Taylor Homes -- once the world's largest housing project before the city tore it down -- and at Cabrini-Green, the Hilliard Homes, the Henry Horner Homes, an apartment on the West Side, another place out in Waukegan and also in the south suburb of Dolton, just outside the Chicago city limits. He left the suburbs before his senior year of high school, moving in with a sister back at Cabrini-Green.
He had his first child there that summer. (The first of 10, a number that city officials, I've found, like to mention with a derisive raising of an eyebrow.) Cabrini-Green was then a 23-tower, 3,600-unit island of black abject poverty amid a steadily encroaching sea of white affluence. Located just blocks from the ritzy Gold Coast, the North Side development offered an unusual mix of isolation and access, and many residents were deeply attached to their home, tragic as it was. The towers clutched around J. R.'s high-rise were each controlled by a different gang, and the blacktop between them was known as the killing fields. On days when rumors spread of a retaliatory sniping, mothers would rush to the schools to collect their children, the teachers left standing before emptied classrooms. But J. R. could also point to the field where he played softball and the path along the river where he walked with girlfriends. He had family in nearly every building of the 70-acre project. Cabrini was his home, his identity, and tearing it down felt like taking an eraser to his past.
J. R. racked up arrests for selling drugs and for fighting with the police. He assaulted an assistant principal at his high school, but he said that was to escape a worse fate from the posse of Spanish Cobras waiting for him outside. When he was 19 years old, he started working for the ward's Young Democrats, a group led in part by Jesse White, a longtime gym teacher at a Cabrini elementary school who went on to become a state representative and is now the Illinois secretary of state. J. R. also operated a recording studio out of a vacant unit in his high-rise, bringing together musicians from the different gangs to record a kind of ''We Are the World'' of public housing. He still remembered a few lyrics to one song: It's such a shame, we living in vain./They took our neighborhood, they don't want us to change./This where my mother grew up. This where my family grew up./Thank the Lord, he sent us to save the Greens through us.
Another Cabrini resident, a man named Joe Peery, helped J. R. land his first job, at U.P.S. Peery was also one of the people running the Chicago-Gary chapter of the National Union of the Homeless. The organization was started in Philadelphia in 1983, when homelessness was shifting from addicts on skid row to displaced families everywhere, and grew to 20 branches nationwide and a membership of 15,000 people. Whereas President Franklin Roosevelt had responded to a similarly dire housing crisis by creating the National Housing Agency, Ronald Reagan reacted by slashing the social safety net, telling stories of a Chicago ''welfare queen'' who drove a Cadillac and ripped off the government for upward of $150,000. The National Union of the Homeless, with the slogan ''You only get what you are organized to take,'' pressured cities to create shelters and to give homeless people access to public showers and the right to vote. Peery remembered a homeless man freezing to death in a cardboard box just 100 feet from one of the Cabrini towers -- a building filled with vacant units, central heat pumping ceaselessly into each of them. On May 1, 1990, the homeless union began an eight-city coordinated takeover of vacant government-owned housing, a prototype for the takeovers of bank-owned homes today. J. R. said of going off to work with Peery: ''He'd talk to all us young guys about our inalienable rights. We'd say: 'That sounds communist, Joe. That's socialist, Joe.' But it was the truth. We started listening to Joe. 'Mr. Parker was homeless, and now he got a place to stay. Who did that? Joe and them? Wow.' We saw what was possible.''
As much as the rights of property owners are sacrosanct in this country, certain gray areas exist in the law that may offer the radical urban homesteader some protection from prosecution. Adverse possession, a doctrine dating back centuries, was created in part to defend residents from distant heirs who might show up with ancient claims on land. If someone occupies an unused property continuously and openly for a set period of time and then begins paying the taxes, he or she becomes its rightful owner. So-called squatter's rights are based on this principle, but actual possession through the process remains incredibly difficult. In Illinois, a squatter must reside in the property without interruption for 20 years. Edward Voci, a lawyer who met J. R. while representing Cabrini-Green residents facing unlawful evictions, now works with Occupy Our Homes, a group affiliated with the Anti-Eviction Campaign. Voci's legal justification for the home takeovers comes not from adverse possession but from an exception in the Illinois trespass statute that exempts someone from prosecution if he or she enters an abandoned and unoccupied property and ''beautifies'' it. Voci admitted that his reading of the trespass law had never been tested in appellate court. But he said, ''Putting a family in an abandoned building, ridding an area of blight, if that's not beautifying, I don't know what it is.''
J. R. liked to proclaim that he didn't concern himself with the law, because he had human rights to back him up. ''We're challenging amoral laws by breaking them.'' In 2009, he gave a tour of Cabrini-Green to an investigator from the United Nations tasked with examining the plight of housing in the United States. Since the mid-'90s, when cities across the country began systematically tearing down their high-rise housing projects, more than 150,000 units of public housing have been lost. Dislocated tenants were generally given Section 8 rent vouchers to find lodging on their own in the private market. But hundreds of thousands of low-end rentals were lost to the foreclosure crisis -- a full 40 percent of all families who have been displaced from their homes were not owners but renters. When the U.N. issued its report detailing the lack of affordable housing in the country, J. R. experienced a surge of triumph. For a brief while, he believed that the international censure would oblige his government to house its citizens. He even kept an eye out for the arrival of the men in blue helmets.
The high-rises at Cabrini-Green were the last in the city to fall, the final one coming down in March 2011. J. R. was one of the few young men living there to join the citywide Coalition to Protect Public Housing. He felt he was part of the long tradition of community organizing and activism in Chicago. His mentors had marched for civil rights, led the voter-registration drives that propelled Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, into office. Barack Obama had walked the very same blocks as J. R., fighting for the rights of public-housing tenants and for better job training for those laid off from the steel mills.
But so much of the struggle today revolves around merely trying to hold on to quickly diminishing resources -- staving off the shuttering of a relatively lousy school or a cluster of low-rise public housing or a health clinic. A great deal of the daily work of the Anti-Eviction Campaign focuses on keeping people from being forced out of their homes in the first place. Members stand in front of houses to physically blockade evictions. J. R. regularly accompanies them to court, and a lawyer provides free legal assistance at weekly meetings. As J. R. and his fellow activists see it, the beautiful thing about the home takeovers is that they capitalize on the isolation and abandonment of these neighborhoods and create their own self-contained, do-it-yourself empowerment zones -- at once providing housing, work, job training and the beginnings of redevelopment.
The idea for the Anti-Eviction Campaign actually came from South Africa. Toussaint Losier had traveled there to study the direct-action tactics of an organization called the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign. Its members had been putting their bodies in front of homes to block evictions, building their own squatter settlements on unused land. So J. R. and Toussaint (who got to know each other when the chairman of the South African group visited Cabrini-Green) started a Chicago chapter together. J. R. realized they didn't need to build lean-tos in Chicago's black community. They had all the empty homes they required. ''We want to do what Roosevelt did,'' he said of the home takeovers. ''If the government won't provide public housing for the people, the people must provide it for themselves.''
Rahm Emanuel spent his formative years outside Chicago, in the wealthy North Shore suburb of Wilmette, where his parents -- as has now been mythologized -- trained him and his brothers to spar verbally and come at life aggressively. He worked as the chief fund-raiser for Richard Daley's first successful mayoral bid, in 1989, and when he returned to Chicago a decade later, with the Clinton White House behind him, it was for a job at a major investment-banking firm. He took home $18 million in just two and half years at the firm, while fortifying his ties to the city's business elite. He spent $450,000 of his own money to run for Congress, eventually representing the same North Side community where his father first lived after immigrating from Israel. To run for mayor, he had to prove in court that he really was a Chicagoan.
I thought a great deal about this back story during the day I spent with the mayor this spring. Did he really understand the neighborhoods overrun by foreclosures and homicides? Did he have anyone from these areas advising him? How could he think school closures would be greeted there by anything but desperation and bitterness? The day actually began in the South Side neighborhood of Englewood, at Lindblom Math and Science Academy, where Emanuel presented a science teacher with a Golden Apple Award. In the school's immediate vicinity, there were dozens of boarded-up homes, many painted with red X's to let firefighters know that the buildings were free of squatters and need not be entered if burning.
From the back seat of his S.U.V., the mayor assured me that he saw it all -- the empty properties and the vacant lots and the teenagers who were just now moseying over to class well after the first bell. But he also pointed out some of the 30 roads in Englewood his administration was repaving, the adults who created safe-passage routes for students traveling to and from Lindblom. There was indeed a renaissance in Chicago, the mayor declared, but the idea that there was some great gulf between downtown and the neighborhoods suggested a ''false dichotomy,'' a premise that needed to be ''scrubbed.'' His administration was investing millions in an Englewood community college that trained students for culinary and hospitality jobs. He was refurbishing a hundred train stations, rebuilding miles of track. By the time he was done, he said, 300 of the city's playgrounds would be overhauled. The previous night, the first balmy one of this year, 20 people were shot around the city. But in the first four months of 2013, there were 67 fewer homicides in Chicago than over the same period in 2012, a 42 percent decline.
The mayor was both oblivious to me and hyperaware of the outside press and whatever unfair critique of his city he felt that represented. Without a hello or a goodbye, he would begin and end our face-to-face sessions. Several times he pushed me in front of those flocked around him, announcing, ''This guy has never been west of the Hudson.'' In fact, I attended public schools on Chicago's South Side, and my family still lives there, with several of the previous night's shootings taking place not far from where I slept at my parents' home. I told the mayor about my Chicago credentials -- in a phone interview the week before and repeatedly over the course of the day. ''Yeah, with a 917 cellphone,'' he harrumphed.
In the afternoon, Emanuel headed back to the South Side, to Bronzeville, where he sang ''Lift Every Voice and Sing'' in the DuSable High School auditorium. Alderman Pat Dowell, who represented the historic African-American neighborhood and led the singing, told me that the economy there had already shown signs of revival and that she was pleased with the mayor's increased investment in her community. Emanuel said he was using Bronzeville's rich cultural past as an economic-development tool. They had moved Gospel Fest from downtown to the neighborhood. They had granted DuSable historical landmark status.
I definitely saw Rahm Emanuel the highly skilled technocrat and business insider in action, but I was surprised by how much he seemed to enjoy the retail politics away from the city center and by how good he was at it. At Lindblom, I overheard an official from the Golden Apple Foundation say with delight that Emanuel visited every school in Chicago and that they couldn't get Daley to do any of this. At DuSable, the mayor entered a raucous cafeteria, handed his jacket to an aide and slipped onto the benches between the students with their chocolate milks and sad slivers of pizza. He squeezed hands, posed for photos, stood arms akimbo, shoulders back, hips forward, as he spoke to the young South Siders about their lives.
''This is the best job I've ever had in public life,'' the mayor told me when we were back at his City Hall office at the end of the day. ''I'm for Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, whoever wants to run in 2016. I'm not going back. How many ways can I say it -- no, nyet, lo.'' He was home, and he loved everything about what he characterized as the most American of American cities -- Chicago's people and energy and the consequences of his decisions there. ''We have challenges in Chicago,'' he said. ''We can't wish them away.'' But every neighborhood had strengths, he explained, and he would take those strengths and make them work for the people of Englewood and elsewhere. ''Every challenge offers an opportunity.''
The Anti-Eviction Campaign was also focused on transforming challenges into opportunities. The first house the group broke into and restored was just a couple of miles from Lindblom, on the 6700 block of South Prairie Avenue, a stretch with four empty homes, wedged into the crease formed by the crossing of the Chicago Skyway and the Dan Ryan Expressway. In the summer of 2011, a friend told J. R. about a redbrick Victorian there. Deutsche Bank foreclosed on it two years earlier, and the house's owner, tired of trying to reach a renegotiated settlement, just walked away, eventually relocating to Philadelphia. But the foreclosure ended up among 1,700 temporarily halted in Chicago when the lawyers for the bank admitted to altering documents. Martha Biggs, who is 36 and serves on the Anti-Eviction Campaign's advisory board, told J. R.: ''This is it. This is where we can make our statement about the human right to housing.''
Biggs's interest in the Prairie Avenue house was also personal, because she hoped to live there with her four children. When she was in her 20s, Biggs was evicted from Cabrini-Green for drug possession. Like many residents kicked out of Chicago public housing back then, she simply moved herself into one of the thousands of units the housing authority failed to refill after they became vacant. When the towers were torn down, she relocated with her children to an apartment on the West Side. But that building went into foreclosure, and she was compelled to move again. She and her children, then between the ages of 1 and 12, ended up sleeping on other people's couches when they could; more often, they huddled for the night in a parked minivan.
Powerfully built, with ropy biceps, Biggs drywalled and tiled and replaced pipes in the house on Prairie. Six weeks after the start of renovations, the Anti-Eviction Campaign held a news conference on the front lawn to announce the takeover. J. R. and Biggs both spoke into a bank of microphones set up by news affiliates, Biggs relating how her children no longer had to worry where they would wash up or get their socks cleaned. Tavis Smiley, on his national television show, covered J. R. and Biggs in an installment of his ''Poverty Tour.'' The New York Times ran an article about the home takeover: ''Foreclosed Home Is a Risky Move for Homeless Family.''
But Biggs didn't think the move too risky. She lived on the first floor with her children and a family friend. (J. R. sometimes slept on the second floor.) Neighbors lent her rakes and donated chairs and a china cabinet. She, in turn, used her handyman skills to do a few small side jobs for them. Just as lenders and downtown officials had revised their economic understanding of property in these neighborhoods, so, too, had the people who stuck it out there. A productive squatter had come to look less like a criminal or a freeloader than a potential boon to a fading community. Biggs didn't worry too much about the sheriff or someone from the bank showing up to evict her. She kept receipts, and at the very least she would be compensated for her improvements to the house. She estimated $9,000 so far in parts and labor. And there were so many other vacant properties out there. As at Cabrini, she could just open up another and start over. ''I've been through so much, really I feel like I can live anywhere,'' she mused. ''As for property, I came from nothing, I can leave with nothing. They say, 'Who are you?' I say, 'Martha Biggs.' They say, 'What's your address?' I say, 'Earth.' ''
J. R. estimates that the Anti-Eviction Campaign and its affiliated groups will be able to liberate a hundred foreclosed and abandoned homes in Chicago in the next year, maybe far more. He was training several other advocacy groups how to identify and occupy vacant properties. The houses they'd already taken were ideal workshops to teach basic carpentry and repairs. Money was always an obstacle, but they've been able to cobble together gifts from like-minded nonprofits. J. R. has also teamed up with a businessman -- a man who used to have the contract to board up public-housing units -- whose community-development corporation has an agreement to obtain houses donated by Citibank. J. R. said the banks were starting to take notice. The campaign needed only to keep on the attack. The Chicago City Council even seemed poised to pass an ordinance that would require banks foreclosing on properties to pay any renters living there $12,000 in relocation fees or allow them to stay put, with rent-controlled leases, until the buildings were finally sold. Cathy Albisa, the executive director of the National Economic and Social Rights Initiative, has worked with J. R. for years. ''He is a man of faith,'' she says. ''J. R. is a believer. He will do this work irrespective of the conditions.''
For the Anti-Eviction Campaign to grow into a truly effective citywide phenomenon, however, it required that people in the neighborhoods take charge of their own communities. That was no easy task. One house they recently reclaimed was a bulky Dutch colonial that dominates a corner in an isolated residential section of South Chicago called the Bush. The area used to be a feeder for a nearby U.S. Steel mill, now shuttered, and some 1,700 homes there are vacant. One evening last summer, J. R. and a group of local activists calling themselves South Chicago Rising held a barbecue in the Bush. Burgers and corn on the cob cooked on a small grill set up on a bulldozed city block that had gone to field, the grass trimmed and parched to an amber hue. Smoke coiled around the 25 people sitting in a ring of foldout chairs. A group of them, all black and ranging in age from 30 to 60, had walked over from a halfway house. ''Be good,'' the man monitoring them would utter forbiddingly when one of them seemed to get a little riled up. Mexican women from the block, some who didn't speak English, also filled out the circle, as did a few white activists who knew J. R. from other ventures. They passed around two-liter bottles of RC Cola and Squirt, listening to the rhythmic school-bell chiming of passing commuter trains and to the radio from a parked Hyundai.
Most of the assembled locals had never heard of the Anti-Eviction Campaign. They had shown up to eat free food and to express their contempt for an incredible development plan called Lakeside that promised to rebuild the old U.S. Steel site. This ''new downtown for the South Side,'' according to the plan's architects, would ultimately contain more than 13,000 new homes, 17.5 million square feet of retail and commercial space and a 1,500-slip marina. Nothing had actually been built, but developers were nevertheless talking up the location's prospects as a vital tech and research center, as a possible future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Library.
Although a realized Lakeside promised jobs, the locals believed that any plan that enriched others had to be bad for them. A woman at the barbecue with purple hair extensions and a sweatshirt that declared her ''Short but sweet,'' said she lived in the neighborhood 22 years and didn't want to see it disappear. A man named Al who had pushed a shopping cart to the gathering said he just wanted a place where he could continue to be homeless. ''They'll get rid of us,'' he lamented.
A leader of South Chicago Rising, Crystal Vance Guerra, alternating between English and Spanish, tried to steer their concerns toward the house across the street. ''How do we begin to organize to make sure Lakeside doesn't kick us out?'' she asked rhetorically. ''By taking back foreclosed homes.'' That was J. R.'s cue. ''The bank won't help you, right?'' he began, in a rhythmic call and response. ''The people are left to do it for themselves, right? We throw our own community cookouts, right?'' He pointed across the street. On the chain-link fence surrounding the reclaimed wood-frame house, someone had hung a bedsheet with a hand-painted message: ''Everything belongs to everyone.'' J. R. explained that they cleaned up the house, taking it away from the drug dealers and the prostitutes. ''That's where you all come in,'' he continued. The house now belonged to the community. It could become a neighborhood center. Homeless families could take up residence there. J. R. wanted to know whether those gathered would come out to defend the property when the call went out. Would they help rehab and maintain it? ''I see a lot of great leaders out there,'' J. R. professed. ''The community will have a sense of power. Your children will know that you did it.''
The food eaten, the sun reduced to a smudge of phosphorescence on the horizon, the residents of the halfway home stood to leave, prompted by their minder. But two of them shouted over their shoulders that they would cook and wash. Most of the others concurred, saying they'd definitely come when called.
One of Mayor Emanuel's stops on the day I shadowed him was at the offices of 1871, a 50,000-square-foot center for digital start-ups named for the rebuilding of the city that occurred after the Great Chicago Fire. The tech hub was celebrating its successful first year of operation, and the mayor said it had created ''a center of gravity for the new economy of the City of Chicago.'' The entire surrounding neighborhood was flourishing. Formerly full of warehouses and prostitutes, and abutting the old Cabrini-Green, River North had become the home to Groupon, Google's Chicago operations and hundreds of other digital start-ups -- 7,500 tech-industry jobs in total. New gleaming towers had sprung up, some offering boat access to the Chicago River, and developers were swiftly adding 2,400 new luxury apartments. The mayor announced that he planned to create another commercial hub -- for the life-sciences and biotech industries -- somewhere nearby in the city center. This summer, he told me, he was opening two Jeanne Gang-designed boathouses, converting a river once used to haul coal and slag into a recreation center for kayaking and sculling and live music.
''My real goal is that the kids out of Lindblom can see themselves at a place like 1871,'' the mayor explained. ''Regardless of where they live in the city, I want children in Chicago to see downtown, the central business district, and envision themselves as part of this dynamic city -- the city of energy and opportunity, the city that's on the move.''
To get them there, he said, he needed to continue to invest in the city's rivers and parks and neighborhoods, its infrastructure and schools. That way he'd attract more residents and businesses to Chicago, and with them would come additional revenue and jobs. He pointed out that another community college on the South Side was already preparing students for open positions in transportation and logistics. ''If you have the best trained workforce, that's the best insurance policy you can buy for the future of your city.''
It was such a perfect spring day in Chicago, with temperatures in the 80s, the sunlight dappling the boat-filled lake and crowds happily lunching in the downtown piazzas, the banners advertising museum and theater shows rippling from every light post. You could almost forget that other parts of the city looked like junkyards, with discarded and broken properties strewn about. You could almost believe that the city's core would be able to radiate out energy like a star and revivify those satellites so far away in space and time.
In the meantime, J. R. and others would keep on trying to piece together a people's public housing. On a Wednesday last fall, J. R. broke into a house on Prairie Avenue, directly across from the one where Martha Biggs lives. He slid open a window off the front porch of the orange-bricked two-flat, then unable to unstick the front door, kicked it open from the inside. Other members of the Anti-Eviction Campaign were smoking cigarettes outside. Thomas Turner wore a bike helmet, because at 6 foot 4, he regularly smacks into low-hanging pipes or ceilings during these maneuvers. He pulled a drill from a black duffel bag and began replacing the lock on the front door. Biggs got started securing the rest of the house, screwing shut the heavy wood windows on the first floor. Filling every silence, J. R. belted out an off-key ''If I Had a Hammer.''
J. R. documented the state in which they found the 100-year-old house. He snapped before photos of a gaping hole in the ceiling, the kitchen stripped bare of its appliances and cabinetry, a bathroom scavenged of everything but a seatless toilet, the plaster and studs blasted to pieces. Windows were shattered or missing altogether. The flotsam and jetsam from capsized lives blanketed the floors -- old winter coats and pants, soiled grocery store bags, a crusted gallon jug of Open Pit barbecue sauce. In the corner of the dining room was a water-stained ''My First Birthday'' photograph of a boy in an adult-size Chicago Bears jersey and winter hat. On a low table nearby rested a solitary Bible. ''There's always a Bible,'' J. R. noted.
Neighbors stopped by during the day to express their support for the home takeover. None of them could recall the last legitimate tenants there. Biggs had run off ''crackheads'' who pulled up in a beat-up moving truck to strip the place, though she figured they later just parked around back. A man from the block mentioned a shooting that happened on the corner over the weekend, one of the 506 homicides in the city in 2012. ''I got it on video,'' J. R. said of the immediate aftermath of the weekend killing. ''Shotgun to the back.'' He was leading an anti-violence rally later that week, and he broke off to stop two lanky teenagers passing by to tell them about it, the guys nodding with confusion as J. R. talked excitably about how together they would take back the block.
J. R. loves all things Chicago no less than the mayor does -- its history and its sports teams and its sudden and striking skyline. It was because he saw the society around his children crumbling that he felt a responsibility to act. And with a little investment from the banks and the big foundations and maybe even City Hall, he believed the Anti-Eviction Campaign could do much more than just engage in guerrilla-style economic warfare. The group could begin to put together the building blocks of a new kind of city, one that might even entail some sort of community land trust and cooperatively owned property.
Jacques Gourguechon, a principal with the city-planning consulting firm Camiros, had worked in these outlying Chicago neighborhoods and also helped develop strategies to shrink sections of Buffalo. He told me that a city has a responsibility to sustain the parts of it that, at least for the moment, have lost vitality. As a planner, he believed in the bigger sweep of history, the shifting promise of global economic cycles, and he imagined a time in the future when the world would again need the services of an Englewood. ''Think about Rome,'' he said, by way of example. About 1,000 years ago, the population there had shrunk to something like 20,000; now the city was bustling with more than two million people.
On the second floor of the Prairie Avenue home, the three bedrooms were largely undamaged. The thick oak doors were adorned with what appeared to be original handles of multifaceted glass. The afternoon light poured into the upstairs living room through floor-to-ceiling windows. The room contained a decorative fireplace and arched entranceways. The hardwood floor, still relatively new-looking after a century, glistened.
Marveling at it all, J. R. thought about the same thing that often came to mind when he first started in on an abandoned home. He remembered Michael Jordan winning those six championships during the '90s, saying to Bob Costas in the postgame interviews, ''This one is special.'' That's what J. R. told himself as he bagged up the trash at the Prairie Avenue home. This is the one. This one can make a difference.

The Kickstarter co-founder Perry Chen understands how communities can fuel creativity. The artist Theaster Gates knows how creativity can invigorate a community. What happens when they put their heads together?At first glance, an Internet entrepreneur and an artist seem to operate in different creative spheres. Yet Perry Chen, the co-founder and C.E.O. of the crowd-funding Web site Kickstarter, and Theaster Gates, a Chicago art star-cum-urban planner, actually think they have a lot in common. Kickstarter began in 2009, and since then the site has raised more than $500 million for 40,000 projects -- from Iraq war documentaries to Brooklyn restaurants -- revolutionizing the way creative ideas are financed in the digital age. Theaster Gates's artistic practice, which encompasses everything from sculpture to a roving choir, is in its way just as groundbreaking. On his own block on the South Side of Chicago, Gates has engineered a miniature urban utopia, turning the once-blighted buildings that surround him into artist residencies, a library and even a cinema house that shows works by aspiring filmmakers from the neighborhood. Both Gates's and Chen's work may inspire social change, but it's the power of creativity, not of compassion, that spurs them from one genre-defying innovation to the next. 
Theaster Gates: I remember not long after we met, we were in Davos, Switzerland, and everyone from presidents on down wanted an audience with you, this 36-year-old punk kid, because you had created something that was important -- a platform that could be more democratic and more immediately generous than the National Endowment for the Arts, or the disbursements of a European nation. It was wonderful to watch people stand in line. I thought, Wow, artists or creative people can have significant consequences in the world.
These interventions that we imagine to simply support our community could be the most important and most prolific inventions in the world.
Perry Chen: But everything comes from somewhere. I didn't even know this till later on, but we found out that Mozart and Beethoven and Whitman and a lot of 19th-century authors used pre-Internet models like Kickstarter -- you know, not just going to rich patrons or the Medici or the Church to get the big check, but people going to dozens or even hundreds of people to fund a creative work, a book where their names might be inscribed in the first edition or a concerto. And the Internet, as it can do, can scale things up and make this same model accessible to millions and billions of people.
Gates: There were a series of moments when I decided that art was important, and it was an important vehicle for me to express my interest in spaces. Like: ''Oh, urban planning isn't the way that I want to talk about urban planning, or talk about the city. Art is the way that I want to reflect on what works and doesn't work in the city.'' I think about Jane Jacobs a lot because she was kind of a normal-person journalist, who was just like, ''You're not gonna tear down my neighborhood.''
And there was a way in which she was willing to be on the ground and imagine that the voice on the ground was intelligible and acute and right. She's different from Frederick Law Olmsted, or Daniel Burnham, or these other guys who are like, ''City Beautiful is important, and to do it, we got to eradicate the poor. Because we should have a lagoon there and a practice range.''
Chen: A lot of the stuff that you're working on and thinking about is art wherever it is. It can be in the white box; it could be out of the white box. . . . There's so much of that kind of stuff on Kickstarter, which is just a platform for creative projects and artists.
Gates: I actually no longer use ''art'' as the framing device. I think I'm just kind of practicing things, practicing life, practicing creation. I'm making a cafe, yes, it's a cafe -- and a cafe isn't art necessarily. But if I were an entrepreneur opening a cafe, I would definitely do that differently. If I had the mantra of developer over my head, it would imply certain things about a return investment. Instead I just said to myself, ''There are no venues in my neighborhood for listening to live music. There's nowhere to get a good pastry. I want those things. I'll apply whoever I am to make it happen.''
Sometimes the creating that we do is creating a platform that allows other creative people to pitch in. Lately I've been saying, ''I no longer want to make the thing,'' which might be a cup. ''I want to make the thing that makes the cup.'' I want to be responsible for the ceramic manufacturing company that made that thing.
Chen: It's like purposeful infrastructure. Like so much infrastructure in the last 100 years has been built for economic reasons, to profit, to make a lot of money.
Gates: Your point about purposeful infrastructure is right, but I'm not the community do-gooder. I rehabbed my building, and the building across the street was jacked up, so I cleaned it up, because I didn't want to look at it. I was really just being a good neighbor. I wasn't trying to be like Mr. Community Builder Man.
Chen: That's such a good point! I remember early on, in the first couple of years especially, I would run into some people that would try to put Kickstarter under the ''social good'' label. And I actually had this very visceral reaction -- I just didn't like that at all. It was as if I had started out with, ''I want to do something good,'' and then just came up with Kickstarter. And that's not true. I was just scratching my own itch. I wanted something like this to exist in the world, and I thought other people would, too. I wasn't calibrating how much good it was going to do.
Gates: People try to create the box that defines the work that we do. I know a bunch of capitalists who put a spin on their hunger for a particular kind of capitalist end: they call it ''social do-gooding.'' But in fact, I want to kind of resist that and say, ''Look, if there's anything that ends up looking like an activist notion, it's secondary to just doing the thing that I wanted to do.'' The reality in the neighborhood that I live in is: if I don't constantly reconcile what I have against what other people don't, either I need to leave and be around other people who have what I have, or I'm constantly engaged in this kind of dynamic flow of opportunity and sharing. And that just feels like smart living. Like if my mom made too much food, she'd send a plate down the street. She doesn't know how to cook greens for two people. She knew how to cook a pot.
I don't want my creativity to be usurped under some spirit of ''social good.''
Chen: Another reason that me and you got along so well so fast was because I think we're both kind of happy right now, at this moment.
Gates: But happiness is funny. There are days that are really heavy and complicated and dark. And I think that if I were to look at the trajectory of life, what has been consistent is that there are highs and lows. I mean at the moment I found out that I was accepted into Documenta, my mom died. In a way I felt like, in late 2010, my mom's death was the thing that somehow actually activated these other future opportunities. But there was tremendous sadness. So, there was a way in which these valences live next to each other all the time.
Perry, I want us to make art together. What would that look like?
Chen: Bales of electrical wires? It should deal with these themes that we're talking about now. Just by spending time together, we have found, and we're going to find, other commonalities. . . . For instance, we both like Depeche Mode. [Laughter.]
Gates: [breaks into song] ''And I don't mean to sound/ Like one of the boys/ That's not what I'm trying to do.''
Chen: We're gonna do something together.
We're gonna go into a bar. And then you never know. You walk out -- you walk out with just Depeche Mode as a bond or you walk out with, like, a scalable platform community.
Gates: What are you most excited about right now, in the work that you're doing?
Chen: I think I'm figuring that out. Kickstarter has been such a heads-down thing. We've been open four years, and I was working on it for years before.
Gates: Has it only been four years? That's phenomenal.
Chen: People often ask me, ''Do you appreciate it?'' But it is a little hard for me to kind of step back. I think because that time before we launched was so stressful and so hard and the fear was just that it wouldn't exist. Everything that's happened since the launch, good or bad, I've actually kind of felt in this very narrow band of emotion. I don't feel like I've gotten too low or too high. I've just been concentrating on: ''What else do we do now?'' Here we are in this moment. We're having a great conversation; we're excited. Let's feed on that.
This conversation has been edited and condensed.

HEADLINE: Kids These Days

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Bill Gates was 20 years old. Steve Jobs was 21. Warren Buffett was 26. Ralph Lauren was 28. Estée Lauder was 29.
These now iconic names were all 20-somethings when they started their companies that would catapult them, and their enterprises, into some of the biggest successes ever known. Consider this: many of the truly remarkable innovations of the latest generation -- a list that includes Google, Facebook and Twitter -- were all founded by people under 30. (Mark Zuckerberg, technically, started Facebook even earlier, when he was 19; at 20 he moved to California to turn it into a business.) The number of people in their mid-20s disrupting entire industries, taking on jobs usually reserved for people twice their age and doing it in the glare of millions of social media ''followers'' seems to be growing almost exponentially.
So what is it about that youthful decade after those awkward teenage years that inspires such shoot-for-the-moon success? Does age really have something to do with it? 
It does. And that leaves the rest of us -- even those of us just a little older -- at a bit of a disadvantage.
The conventional wisdom is that young people bring fresh eyes and a new perspective to confronting problems and challenges that others have given up on. Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, a venture capitalist who backed Google, Yahoo and YouTube, once described the phenomenon of 20-something entrepreneurs as a generation of people ''who see no boundaries, see no limits, see no obstacle that they can't hurdle -- it is the most stimulating environment that you can ever be in.'' Vinod Khosla, another venture capitalist, goes further. ''People under 35 are the people who make change happen,'' he said at an international conference. ''People over 45 basically die in terms of new ideas.''
That may or may not be true, but it's only part of the story.
Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, and now an investor who was an early backer of Facebook, has another, colder theory that may explain it: Ultimately, it's about money.
''How many people do you know who said when they were young that they planned to work for a couple of years, put some money in the bank, so that they could later pursue their passion and start a new business or strike out on their own?'' he asked me. ''It almost never plays out that way in practice. What seems to happen is that after some period of time, people are making good money and they're typically spending all of it and it becomes really hard to dial that back. If you bought a house or have all sorts of obligations of one sort or another it may be very difficult.''
In other words, it's the young people who have nothing to lose, with no mortgage and, frankly, with nothing to do on a Friday night except work, who are the ones often willing to take the biggest risks. Sure, they are talented. But it's their persistence and zeal, the desire to stay up until 6 a.m. chugging Red Bull, that is the difference between being a salaried employee and an entrepreneur.
And with the steady march of technology, young people have gained an even greater sense of credibility among their elders -- still worried that they themselves don't ''get it.'' Since the 1960s, and especially since the rise of the computer era, older people have been more willing to give opportunities to the most talented 20-somethings as the office politics of old break down. Could this latest crop of entrepreneurial success stories have made it in a pre-Twitter era? Sure. But the rapidity of this digital age has hastened their ascent.
That's not to say that most 20-somethings are finding success. They're not. The latest crop of über-successful young entrepreneurs, bloggers, designers and authors are far, far from the norm. In truth, unemployment for workers age 16 to 24 is double the national average. ''Gen X'' and ''Gen Y'' have far less wealth than their parents did at the same age, according to the Urban Institute.
One of the biggest challenges facing this next generation -- and one that may prevent more visionary entrepreneurs from succeeding -- is the staggering rise in the level of debt college students have been left with. If Thiel's theory is right, it is going to be harder and harder for young people to take big risks because they will be crushed with obligations before they even begin.
If you're over 29 years old and still haven't made your world-changing mark, don't despair. Some older people have had big breakthroughs, too. Thomas Edison didn't invent the phonograph until he was 30.

HEADLINE: How to Play Well With China

BYLINE: By IAN BREMMER and JON M. HUNTSMAN Jr.. 
Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, is the author, most recently, of ''Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World.'' Jon M. Huntsman Jr. was the governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009 and the United States ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011.

 BODY:
PRESIDENTS Obama and Xi Jinping will meet in California for two days starting this Friday.
It's about time.
New sources of friction are constantly appearing in the relationship between the United States and China: trade disputes, tension over North Korea, debates over curbing carbon emissions, allegations of cyberattacks by China.
Having survived re-election, President Obama can shrug off charges of appeasement and treat a rising China with the care it deserves. China, with its leadership transition, has a fresh start, too.
The American and Chinese presidents must seize this opportunity to improve relations; if they don't, there won't be another chance for years. 
Until now, Mr. Obama's China policy has been mainly a hedge against China's rise. The administration's ''pivot'' to Asia -- the shift of attention and resources from other regions -- has convinced many in Beijing that Washington intends to try to stunt China's growth and contain it the way that America sought to halt the spread of Soviet power during the cold war.
Hedging should be part of America's strategy. But hedging without a sincere attempt to open up a dialogue risks feeding China's resentment and transforming competition into conflict.
Cooperation between America and China is crucial for the future of both countries and the world, and the current policy of damage control isn't enough.
America and China are the world's two biggest economies, two largest trading nations and two worst polluters. America is the world's largest debtor, China its biggest foreign creditor. There is no way to rebalance the global economy, slow climate change, manage the trouble kicked up by rogue states and keep the peace in Asia unless Washington and Beijing work together in as many areas as possible.
THE first step will be for Mr. Obama and his representatives to stop trying to negotiate with the China they want to see and engage China as it is.
The Chinese won't accept another approach, and the United States doesn't have the power to force them to. China is every bit as exceptionalist as America, and has been for centuries. It is a country prepared to make rather than accept new rules, and one that will compete with the United States for Asian and global hegemony.
Yet, for the moment at least, Mr. Obama can earn more of Mr. Xi's trust by not asking him for things that Beijing can't provide, like a global partnership to address financial crises, climate change, nuclear proliferation and a host of other issues. Creating a so-called Group of Two to tackle the world's major problems includes risks that the Chinese leadership can't afford to accept. China sees itself as a developing country and doesn't believe it can take on huge new global responsibilities that would come with such a formal upgrading of its ties with the United States.
Mr. Xi, in turn, can earn more confidence in Washington by ensuring that China continues to open domestic markets to American companies, by enforcing intellectual property protections and by maintaining a level competitive playing field.
It is time for the two presidents to think big. Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi should begin work on a declaration of principles, a document that can elevate and focus their partnership.
In 1972, at the end of President Richard M. Nixon's historic visit to China, the American and Chinese governments published a remarkable joint communiqué. It included references to their ''different ideologies,'' individual freedom, trade, Korean reunification, Japan, Taiwan and ''progress toward the normalization of relations in the interests of all countries.'' The document and the conversation it opened stand among the greatest diplomatic achievements of the 20th century.
Seven years later, a second communiqué established formal diplomatic relations. A third document, released in 1982, addressed the future of Taiwan.
In creating a new declaration of principles today, each side will have to give. There are some costs and risks that China won't accept because they might endanger stability at home.
For instance, China won't sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions because it fears that slower production could put millions of Chinese workers on the streets. And it won't play a major role in propping up the teetering euro zone if doing so requires them to work with governments other than Germany, whose stability it trusts. And it won't change its position on Taiwan, Tibet or Tiananmen Square.
But there are things China can and will do if the United States offers some incentives that China wants and needs.
China would happily produce a document that Mr. Xi could brag about at home, while accepting responsibility for only a carefully negotiated set of mutually profitable projects. A new communiqué should therefore include negotiated agreements on the joint development of clean energy technologies, cooperation in scientific research and coordinated strategies to mitigate conflict in the developing world.
It's not a sign of weakness that Washington can't force China's leaders to change course on issues they consider central to their national security. Naming and shaming can be an important foreign policy tool. But China will never change its approach on these core issues because of America's objections, and we can't allow criticism to drown out calls for cooperation in other areas.
So Mr. Obama shouldn't expect much movement on issues like Tibet, territorial disputes between China and its neighbors in the East and South China Seas, and a range of human rights issues. Mr. Obama can commit the United States to a frank approach, one that acknowledges China's core interests, and where appropriate, allows Washington to act as an honest broker.
America and China already enjoy an enormously profitable trade and investment relationship. In 1985, trade between the countries amounted to just $7.7 billion. By 2000, the total reached $116 billion, and in 2012, it surged to $536 billion, putting America and China on track to build the largest trade relationship in history. But certain moves by both sides have eroded trust.
The Obama administration has worked to build momentum behind the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a colossal trade deal involving a host of Pacific Rim countries. China sees the partnership as a move to isolate it and won't join because it would force Beijing to open areas of its economy that are not ready to withstand competitive pressures. But this does not mean that China must see it as a threat. Those who join should continue to build new commercial ties with China to help assuage the fear that the partnership is designed specifically to isolate China.
China, meanwhile, has been backsliding on market access for American companies, has failed to protect American intellectual property and has invested in a program of ''indigenous innovation'' that unfairly restricts foreign investment in China's technology sector at a time when Chinese investment in the American economy is growing rapidly. Conflict in cyberspace is also intensifying, and there is evidence that Chinese hackers are seeking to spy, steal and sabotage -- endangering American intellectual property. This is an area where Mr. Obama must continue to vigorously defend American interests.
THE United States should continue to exert as much pressure, both diplomatically and through the World Trade Organization, as necessary, to get Beijing to open up. For the moment, a free-trade agreement is not possible. But there is plenty that the United States and China could do to broaden and deepen their trade and investment relationship and avoid unnecessary clashes. With that in mind, American and Chinese negotiators should begin work to devise a ''trade investment framework agreement,'' the foundation for a more ambitious deal in years to come. To avoid a repeat of some of the bitter investment conflicts that have developed in recent years, Washington must also finally make clear for Beijing where Chinese direct investment in the United States and in American companies is welcome, and where it is not.
In addition, the two sides should form a working group that answers directly to Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi, and whose primary mandate is to draw each side's red lines in a way that minimizes the risk of conflict, particularly on cyberissues. This would ensure that good ideas are not lost in exchanges between two governing bureaucracies that don't always understand each other.America and China have much to offer each other. Both benefit from a more predictable international security environment. Both are major importers of foreign oil. China has huge reserves of shale gas and wants to exploit them, and the United States has the technology and the labor force know-how. A more energy-efficient China will lower energy prices in the United States and inflict less environmental damage.
Failure to make progress in one area should not slow work on another. There will be competition. Beijing will continue to invest in its state capitalist system and to manage its currency to suit its own needs. And lectures on political reform are unlikely to yield good results.
Like the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Xi Jinping and most of China's leadership recognize the need for perestroika, a restructuring. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, they don't see glasnost, openness, as a means of achieving it -- and no amount of sermonizing from America will change that.
In some ways, the stakes are higher for Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi than they were for Ronald Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev. There is no American-Chinese nuclear threat to focus minds on stronger ties, nor is there a Berlin Wall to separate the two countries' fortunes. For better and for worse, America and China are bound together in a form of mutually assured economic destruction.
That's as good a starting point as any for a partnership whose time has come.

HEADLINE: Fracking Tests Ties Between California 'Oil and Ag' Interests

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SHAFTER, Calif. -- Scattered on either side of Shafter Avenue just north of the town center here, new oil pump jacks, some bobbing and others thrusting, tower above this corner of California's prime farmland.
A dirt side road, flanked by an orchard of two-year-old almond trees and a field of alfalfa plants, leads to a two-acre patch where workers were drilling a third well. At a larger rig not too far away, next to a field of potatoes, a 50-foot-tall tower flared off the gas from the crude being extracted from land that used to be a rose field. At yet another site next to almond trees, a fence now surrounds an area where liquids from hydraulic fracturing, the drilling technique commonly known as fracking, leaked into an open pit.
Driven by advances in drilling technology and high oil prices, oil companies are increasingly moving into traditionally agricultural areas like Shafter that make up one of the world's most fertile regions but also lie above a huge untapped oil reserve called the Monterey Shale. Even as California's total oil production has declined slightly since 2010, the output of the North Shafter oil field and the number of wells have risen by more than 50 percent. 
By all accounts, oilmen and farmers -- often shortened to ''oil and ag'' here -- have coexisted peacefully for decades in this conservative, business friendly part of California about 110 miles northwest of Los Angeles. But oil's push into new areas and its increasing reliance on fracking, which uses vast amounts of water and chemicals that critics say could contaminate groundwater, are testing that relationship and complicating the continuing debate over how to regulate fracking in California.
''As farmers, we're very aware of the first 1,000 feet beneath us and the groundwater that is our lifeblood,'' said Tom Frantz, a fourth-generation farmer here and a retired high school math teacher who now cultivates almonds. ''We look to the future, and we really do want to keep our land and soil and water in good condition.''
''This mixing of farming and oil, all in one place, is a new thing for us,'' added Mr. Frantz, who is also an environmentalist and is pressing for a moratorium on fracking.
Fracking is indispensable to extricating crude from the complex geological formation of the Monterey Shale, which makes up two-thirds of the United States's shale oil reserves, oil industry officials and other experts say. If exploited, they say, the Monterey Shale could create the kind of oil boom seen in North Dakota and Texas, and could even transform California into the nation's top oil-producing state.
Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said recently that increasing oil production could hand California a ''fabulous economic opportunity,'' though he said he wanted to learn more about fracking's effects on the environment. The State Department of Conservation, which oversees the oil industry, is leading a yearlong process to establish regulations for fracking, which injects water, sand and chemicals deep into shale rock to unlock the oil and gas underground.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers have introduced nearly a dozen bills that would curtail various aspects of fracking. Environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club, have sued state regulators, arguing that they have given oil companies drilling permits without subjecting them to environmental reviews. In April, after another lawsuit was filed by the groups against the United States Bureau of Land Management, a federal judge temporarily blocked exploratory drilling on 2,700 acres of public lands after ruling that the bureau had failed to review the environmental impact of fracking.
Here in Shafter, at least two farmers have sued the state and oil companies over environmental damage. A new group representing dozens of farmers, the Committee to Protect Farmland and Clean Water, is holding discussions with oil companies on drilling, fracking and compensation. The group's lawyer, George Martin, said he could not comment because of the continuing discussions.
Rex Parris, another lawyer working with farmers, said that unlike environmental groups, most farmers do not seek to ban fracking but to regulate it strictly.
''It's ludicrous to think that we're going to prevent anybody from getting at that oil,'' said Mr. Parris, who is also the mayor of Lancaster, a city north of Los Angeles. ''The only thing we should be focusing on, because it's the only thing we're going to be successful at, is regulating how they get to that oil.''
''We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg of what's coming,'' he said of the drilling for Monterey Shale oil here. ''It could enrich the state beyond belief, but it could also destroy it.''
Lorelei Oviatt, the planning director for Kern County, which includes Shafter and accounts for 80 percent of California's oil production, said that oil companies and farmers would work out their differences, some of which center on compensation. Under California's split estate, many farmers do not own the underground rights to their property but would be compensated for access to the surface.
''We have these new questions because the oil companies have been moving into prime ag land in the past three years,'' Ms. Oviatt said. ''But oil and ag have coexisted here for a hundred years.''
Rock Zierman, the chief executive of the California Independent Petroleum Association, a trade group, says the oil industry is open to groundwater testing before and after fracking to ensure quality.
''When it comes to hydraulic fracturing, we fully expect water-quality monitoring to be part of a comprehensive set of regulations,'' he said.
Industry officials point out that fracking has occurred in California for more than half a century -- without incident. But experts say that new fracking techniques involve more potent cocktails of chemicals that drillers are allowed to leave undisclosed to protect trade secrets; what is more, California regulators barely monitor fracking activities.
''It's somewhat alarming how little the state knows about the fracking that has occurred in the past and the fracking that continues today,'' said Jayni Foley Hein, the executive director of the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley, and a co-author of a recent report on fracking in California.
Last October, Mr. Frantz, the almond farmer, videotaped liquid being discharged into an open pit at a site belonging to Vintage Production California, next to almond orchards. That led to an investigation by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.
Vintage, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, recently released a report acknowledging that although fracking actually took place the day after the video was shot, ''small quantities of fluids'' were discharged during fracking. Susie Geiger, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail that Vintage was continuing to review the information.
Doug Patteson, a supervising engineer at the water board, said that 6 to 10 barrels of fracking liquids, or 252 to 420 gallons, leaked over two days into an open, unlined pit. In addition, Mr. Patteson said, the company also violated regulations by disposing of hundreds of thousands of gallons of liquids, produced directly after the drilling and containing high levels of salts, into the pit. He added that the investigation was still under way.
''If groundwater were impacted from anything, I think it would be from that, and maybe these 6 to 10 barrels of fracking fluids certainly didn't help,'' he said.

HEADLINE: This Man Is Not a Cyborg. Yet.

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL; Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
GET right up close to Dmitry Itskov and sniff all you like -- you will not pick up even the faintest hint of crazy. He is soft-spoken and a bit shy, but expansive once he gets talking, and endearingly mild-mannered. He never seems ruffled, no matter what question you ask. Even if you ask the obvious one, which he has encountered more than a few times since 2011, when he started ''this project,'' as he sometimes calls it.
Namely: Are you insane?
''I hear that often,'' he said with a smile, over lunch one recent afternoon in Manhattan. ''There are quotes from people like Arthur C. Clarke and Gandhi saying that when people come up with new ideas they're called 'nuts.' Then everybody starts believing in the idea and nobody can remember a time when it seemed strange.'' 
It is hard to imagine a day when the ideas championed by Mr. Itskov, 32, a Russian multimillionaire and former online media magnate, will not seem strange, or at least far-fetched and unfeasible. His project, called the 2045 Initiative, for the year he hopes it is completed, envisions the mass production of lifelike, low-cost avatars that can be uploaded with the contents of a human brain, complete with all the particulars of consciousness and personality.
What Mr. Itskov is striving for makes wearable computers, like Google Glass, seem as about as futuristic as Lincoln Logs. This would be a digital copy of your mind in a nonbiological carrier, a version of a fully sentient person that could live for hundreds or thousands of years. Or longer. Mr. Itskov unabashedly drops the word ''immortality'' into conversation.
Yes, we have seen this movie and, yes, it always leads to evil robots enslaving humanity, the Earth reduced to smoldering ruins. And it's quite possible that Mr. Itskov's plans, in the fullness of time, will prove to be nothing more than sci-fi bunk.
But he has the attention, and in some cases the avid support, of august figures at Harvard, M.I.T. and Berkeley and leaders in fields like molecular genetics, neuroprosthetics and other realms that you've probably never heard of. Roughly 30 speakers from these and other disciplines will appear at the second annual 2045 Global Future Congress on June 15 and 16 at Alice Tully Hall, in Lincoln Center in Manhattan.
Though billed as a congress, the event is more like a showcase and conference that is open to the public, with general admission tickets starting at $750. (About 400 tickets, roughly half the total available, have been sold so far.) Attendees will hear people like Sir Roger Penrose, an emeritus professor of mathematical physics at Oxford, who appears on the 2045.com Web site with a video teaser about ''the quantum nature of consciousness,'' and George M. Church, a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School, whose video on the site concerns ''brain healthspan extension.''
As these videos suggest, scientists are taking tiny, incremental steps toward melding humans and machine all the time. Ray Kurzweil, the futurist and now Google's director of engineering, argued in ''The Singularity Is Near,'' a 2005 book, that technology is advancing exponentially and that ''human life will be irreversibly transformed'' to the point that there will be no difference between ''human and machine or between physical and virtual reality.''
Mr. Kurzweil was projecting based on the scientific and intellectual ferment of the time. And technological achievements have continued their march since he wrote the book -- from creating computers that can that can outplay humans (like Watson, the ''Jeopardy'' winner from I.B.M.) to technology that tracks a game player's heartbeat and perhaps his excitement (like the new Kinect) to digital tools for those with disabilities (like brain implants that can help quadriplegics move robotic arms).
But most researchers do not aspire to upload our minds to cyborgs; even in this crowd, the concept is a little out there. Academics seem to regard Mr. Itskov as sincere and well-intentioned, and if he wants play global cheerleader for fields that generally toil in obscurity, fine. Ask participants in the 2045 conference if Mr. Itskov's dreams could ultimately be realized and you'll hear everything from lukewarm versions of ''maybe'' to flat-out enthusiasm.
''I have a rule against saying something is impossible unless it violates laws of physics,'' Professor Church says, adding about Mr. Itskov: ''I just think that there's a lot of dots that aren't connected in his plans. It's not a real road map.''
Martine A. Rothblatt, another speaker at the coming conference and founder of United Therapeutics, a biotech company that makes cardiovascular products, sounds more optimistic.
''This is no more wild than in the early '60s, when we saw the advent of liver and kidney transplants,'' Ms. Rothblatt says. ''People said at the time, 'This is totally crazy.' Now, about 400 people have organs transplanted every day.''
At a minimum, she and others believe that interest in building Itskovian avatars will give birth to and propel legions of start-ups. Some of these far-flung projects have caught the eyes of angel investors, and one day these enterprises may do for the brain and androids what Silicon Valley did for the Internet and computers.
Mr. Itskov says he will invest at least part of his fortune in such ventures, but his primary goal with 2045 is not to become richer. In fact, the more you know about Mr. Itskov, the less he seems like a businessman and the more he seems like the world's most ambitious utopian. He maintains that his avatars would not just end world hunger -- because a machine needs maintenance but not food -- but that they would also usher in a more peaceful and spiritual age, when people could stop worrying about the petty anxieties of day-to-day living.
''We need to show that we're actually here to save lives,'' he said. ''To help the disabled, to cure diseases, to create technology that will allow us in the future to answer some existential questions. Like what is the brain, what is life, what is consciousness and, finally, what is the universe?''
MR. ITSKOV'S role in the 2045 Initiative is bit like that of a producer in the Hollywood sense of the word: the guy who helps underwrite the production, shapes the script and oversees publicity. He says he will have spent roughly $3 million of his own money by the time the second congress is over, and though he is reluctant to disclose his net worth -- aside from scoffing at the often-published notion that he's a billionaire -- he is ready to spend much more.
For now, he is buying a lot of plane tickets. He flies around the globe introducing himself to scientists, introducing scientists to one another and prepping the public for what he regards as the inevitable age of avatars. In the span of two weeks, his schedule took him from New York (for an interview), to India (to enlist the support of a renowned yogi), home to Moscow, then to Berkeley, Calif. (to meet with scientists), back to Moscow and then to Shanghai (to meet with a potential investor).
When he isn't pushing his initiative, he leads a life that could best be described as monastic. He meditates and occasionally spends days in silent retreat in the Russian countryside. He is single and childless, and he asked to keep mention of his personal life to a minimum, for fear that he would come across either as an oddball or an ascetic boasting about his powers of restraint.
''In some ways, I'm a monk,'' he said. ''Not entirely. Some monks struggle to stay monks. But I'm happiest when I live like a monk.''
Maybe it's all his talk of androids, but Mr. Itskov has the kind of generically handsome face and perfect smile that seem computer-generated. He speaks English with a slight accent and wears Borrelli blazers and an Audemars Piguet watch made of rose gold, both of which seem like extravagances to him now. Rubles that aren't plowed into the initiative are, to him, a waste.
''I used to have a collection of watches,'' he says, grinning at how inane that now seems. ''I gave most of them away, and I'm never buying anything like that again.''
A few weeks ago, Mr. Itskov, wearing a Borrelli blazer, traveled to the University of California, Berkeley, where a group of researchers and professors gave him a tour of their labs. The main point of his visit was to discuss a brain-related project that is now under wraps. That happened at a private dinner, and Mr. Itskov politely declined to say anything about it. But during the day, it was basically show-and-tell time for brain-tech fanboys, and it started at the Berkeley Wireless Research Center. The center is sponsored by Intel, Samsung and other companies eager for a first look at whatever is being conceived there. The day ended on the other side of the campus, at the Swarm Lab, which is subsidized by Qualcomm.
At the Swarm Lab, Peter Ledochowitsch, a researcher with a thick red beard, described a minimally invasive brain implant designed to read intentions from the surface of the brain. So far, the device has been implanted in an anesthetized rat; a prototype for alert animals is in the works. But eventually, he said, it would allow paralyzed people to communicate, or to control a robotic arm or a wheelchair. It could also allow you to start your car if you think, ''Start my car.''
Like other researchers on campus, Mr. Ledochowitsch has founded a company -- his is called Cortera Neurotechnologies -- that he hopes will eventually mass-produce and market this device. He has no expectation that Mr. Itskov will be an angel investor in the business, but angel investor money is what he will seek.
''We've talked to a number of venture capitalists,'' he said. ''The problem is that they're spoiled by Silicon Valley, where six guys can turn around some stupid social networking software in six months. If your timeline is 2021, it makes them very nervous.''
MR. ITSKOV'S timeline is even further out, but he is still eager for progress. He was mostly silent during the tour of the Berkeley labs, aside from asking variations on the theme of, ''When will this be ready?'' He could have discussed Berkeley's secret project over the phone, rather than flying from Moscow for a dinner, but he relishes visiting any place that could produce breakthroughs in cybernetic immortality.
''It's good to see the atmosphere,'' he said the next day over lunch at a restaurant in Berkeley. ''I want my project to be international, a huge collaboration of different scientists. It's worth meeting, in person, everyone who is in this field.''
Mr. Itskov has apparently never done anything halfway. He was raised in Bryansk, a city about 230 miles southwest of Moscow, with a father who directed musical theater and a mother who was a schoolteacher. The father, Ilya Itskov, said through an interpreter in a phone interview that his son was a perfectionist who would not stop trying to learn a subject -- be it a foreign language or windsurfing -- until he'd mastered it.
''From the very beginning,'' he said, ''we realized that Dmitry is not an ordinary person.''
He attended the Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics, where he met his future business partner, Konstantin Rykov. In 1998, Mr. Rykov started an e-zine with an English-language obscenity for a name, which was loaded with jokes about culture, showbiz and relationships.
Mr. Itskov came on board the next year, and the two began branding their collaborations as Goodoo Media. The company built tarakan.ru, a blog about the Russian Internet, and an online newspaper, Dni.ru, a tabloidy take on sports, politics and entertainment. Online game sites and other online newspapers would follow, along with a glossy print magazine, a book publisher and Internet TV channel. A media empire was born. In ''The Net Delusion,'' Evgeny Morozov, an expert on the tangle of Russian politics and the Web, writes that Mr. Rykov became ''an undisputed Godfather of the Russian Internet.''
The sites earned money through ads, Mr. Itskov says, but the company, renamed New Media Stars, also came to have very highly placed allies. At some point, Mr. Rykov segued from counterculture bad boy to friend of the Kremlin. Mr. Morozov writes that the company and its media empire have churned out ''heaps of highly propagandistic video content'' for the United Russia party of President Vladimir V. Putin. One of the company's sites was called zaputina.ru, which translates to ''For Putin!''
Mr. Rykov declined a request for an interview. Mr. Itskov, whose principal roles were business development and managing New Media's roughly 250 employees, says the company never received money from the United Russia party. He has never met Mr. Putin, he adds, though he voted for him. ''In Russia, the majority of people love him,'' he said.
Mr. Itskov was helping to build New Media Stars when he had an uncomfortable epiphany. It was 2005, and he was staring at his computer screen at the company's offices, then housed on a barge on the Moscow River. In an instant, he knew that a life spent accumulating money would not suffice.
''At the time, we'd had a very interesting proposal to sell some shares of the company,'' he recalls, ''and I realized, given what the offer meant for the valuation of the company, that I could live very well. And then I realized that I wouldn't be happy, just working and spending money. I would just age and then die. I thought there should be something deeper.''
At the age of 25, he started to have the symptoms of a midlife crisis. He anticipated the regrets he might have as an old man -- the musical instruments unlearned, the books unread. The standard span of 80 or so years suddenly seemed woefully inadequate. He soon was seeking out leaders from almost every religion, in a search for purpose and peace.
The more he contemplated the world, the more broken it seemed.
''Look at this,'' he said, opening his laptop on the table and starting a slide show with one heartbreaking statistic after another: Almost one billion people are now starving. Forty-nine countries are currently involved in military conflict. Ten percent of people are disabled. And so on.
''That is the picture of this world that we created, with the minds we have today, with our set of values, with our egotism, our selfishness, our aggression,'' he went on. ''Most of the world is suffering. What we're doing here does not look like the behavior of grown-ups. We're killing the planet and killing ourselves.''
TO change that picture, he reasons, we must change our minds, or give them a chance to ''evolve,'' to use one of his favorite words. Before our minds can evolve, though, we need a new paradigm of what it means to be human. That requires a transition to a world where most people aren't consumed by the basic questions of survival.
Hence, avatars. They may sound like an improbable way to solve the real problems on Mr. Itskov's laptop, or like the perfect gift for the superrich of the future. But the laws of supply and demand abide in Mr. Itskov's utopia, and he assumes that once production of avatars is ramped up, costs will plunge. He also assumes that charities now devoted to feeding, clothing and healing the poor will focus on the goal of making and distributing affordable bodies, which in this case means machines.
For now, just acquiring a lifelike robotic head is a splurge. Among the highlights of the congress at Lincoln Center will be the unveiling of what Mr. Itskov describes as the most sophisticated mechanical head in history. It is a replica of Mr. Itskov from the neck up, and it is now under construction in Plano, Tex., home of Hanson Robotics, a company founded by David Hanson, who has a doctorate in interactive arts and engineering and who has previously fabricated robotic heads for research labs around the world. (Mr. Itskov said Mr. Hanson would not allow him to discuss price.)
''Most robotic heads have 20 motors,'' Mr. Hanson said in a phone interview. ''Mine have 32. This one will have 36. So, more facial expressions, simulating all the major muscle groups. We've had four people working on this full time since March.''
The even more remarkable expectation is that while Mr. Itskov is in another room, sitting before a screen with sensors to pick up his every movement, the head will be able to reproduce his expressions and voice. ''He's controlling that robot, controlling its gestures, its expression and its speaking with his voice in real time,'' Mr. Hanson says. ''It's somewhere between a cellphone call and teleportation.''
MR. ITSKOV'S initiative is nothing if not forward-looking, but he sees it as a present-day end in itself.
''The whole problem with humanity is that we don't currently plan for the future,'' he said. ''Our leaders are focused on stability. We don't have something which will unite the whole of humanity. The initiative will inspire people. It's about changing the whole picture, and it's not just a science-fiction book. It's a strategy already being developed by scientists.''
It's also been dramatized by Hollywood. Mr. Itskov is a fan of ''Avatar'' and other films in the sci-fi genre, like ''Surrogates,'' a Bruce Willis vehicle about a world where people can interact with society through remotely controlled humanoid robots.
''Surrogates,'' like so many films of its kind, contains plenty of terrifying, brink-of-extinction plot twists. And Mr. Itskov is well aware that few visions of a techo-Edenic future end well. That is one reason he recruits spiritual figures to his cause, with the idea that a project with such immense ramifications needs buy-in from various faiths and, more important, input about ethics.
Just because religious leaders will appear at the congress doesn't make them eager boosters. One of the speakers is Lazar Puhalo, a retired archbishop of the Orthodox Church in America, who has also studied physics and neurobiology. In recent telephone interview, he said avatars of some kind would almost certainly be part of our future, a notion that fills him with considerable dread.
''The creators of this 'something else' will have their own fears and prejudices,'' he says, ''and you could produce those robotically. Which could be a real horror for humanity.''
His goal in attending the Congress is to stand up for human beings, which he sees as interesting precisely because of their shortcomings and foibles. And he'd like to make the point that immortality sounds like a ghastly idea.
''Life would get deathly boring,'' he says. ''It's like talking to couples that want to divorce. The hormones have quieted down. You don't feel butterflies. The longer you're around, the duller it gets.''
Do people want to live forever? If yes, would they like to spend that eternity in a ''nonbiological carrier''? What happens to your brain once it's uploaded? What about your body? If you could choose when to acquire an avatar body, what's the ideal age to acquire it? Can avatars have sex?
These are just a few of the dozens of questions raised by the 2045 Initiative. (Yes, avatars can have sex, Mr. Itskov writes in an e-mail, because ''an artificial body can be designed to receive any sensations.'') One point of the coming congress is to address such issues.
But a larger question hovers above all others: Should Mr. Itskov be taken seriously? Much about his initiative sounds preposterous. On the other hand, many of those conversant in the esoteric disciplines that would produce an avatar are huge fans.
So one can imagine two radically different legacies for this singular man. If he succeeds, history will remember Mr. Itskov as a daring visionary whose money and energy redefined life in ways that solved some of the world's most intransigent problems. If he fails, the word ''cockamamie'' is sure to show up somewhere in his obituary.

On the Road to Avatars: Some random stops along the way to joining humans and machines.
1784: First known use of the word ''avatar,'' according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. From Sanskrit, it refers to a Hindu deity in human form.
1924: Hans Berger begins the history of braincomputer interfaces by developing EEG, which measures electrical activity in the brain.
1958: In Sweden, Arne Larsson becomes the first person to receive a surgically implanted pacemaker.
1961: The first cochlear implant, called a bionic ear. It marks the first time that a machine is able ''to restore a human sense,'' as The New York Times puts it.
1987: ''Max Headroom,'' about a fictional avatar, makes its debut on ABC. In the story line, Max was created by downloading the memories of a TV reporter into a computer.
1992: ''Snow Crash,'' a Neal Stephenson novel, helps popularize avatars. ''If you're ugly,'' he writes, ''you can make your avatar beautiful.''
1997: Researchers at Emory University teach a stroke victim to use electrodes implanted in his brain, and sensors taped to his body, to move a cursor and spell words with his thoughts.
2003: Linden Lab starts Second Life, an online world that allows users to create avatars that can interact with other avatars.
2008: At Duke University, a monkey implanted with a brain-computer interface controls a robot on a treadmill in Japan.
2011: Dmitry Itskov starts the 2045 Initiative.
2012: At the University of Pittsburgh, a quadriplegic woman, Jan Scheuermann, eats a chocolate bar attached to a robotic arm controlled by implants in her brain.
2013: The MIT Technology Review reports that Samsung is working on a tablet computer that can be controlled by your mind.
David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, says his robotic model of Dmitry Itskov's head will use 36 motors to reproduce his facial expressions and voice. (BU4)

HEADLINE: The Triumph of the Working Mother

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE COONTZ. 
Stephanie Coontz, a guest columnist, co-chairs the Council on Contemporary Families.

 BODY:
FIFTY years ago, Betty Friedan made a startling prediction in her controversial best seller, ''The Feminine Mystique.'' If American housewives would embark on lifelong careers, she claimed, they would be happier and healthier, their marriages would be more satisfying, and their children would thrive.
At the time, experts believed that a woman should work only to kill time while searching for a husband or to fill time after the children had left home. A wife who pursued a career was considered a maladjusted woman who would damage her marriage and her kids. 
Today, with almost two-thirds of married mothers employed and women the sole or main breadwinner in 40 percent of households with children under the age of 18, according to a Pew study released Wednesday, we can test these competing points of view.
Ms. Friedan wins on the question of whether working improves women's well-being. At all income levels, stay-at-home mothers report more sadness, anger, and episodes of diagnosed depression than their employed counterparts.
And the benefits of employment mount over a lifetime. A recent multiyear study by the sociologists Adrianne Frech and Sarah Damaske found that women who worked full time following the birth of their first child had better mental and physical health at age 40 than women who had not worked for pay. Low-wage jobs with urgent and inflexible time demands do raise the risk of depression, especially among new mothers. But in less stressful low-wage jobs, mothers who work relatively long hours during the first year following childbirth experience less depression than those who cut back to fewer hours.
Back in the 1960s and '70s, a wife taking a job raised the risk of divorce. Today, however, a wife's employment lowers the couple's risk of divorce. Among middle-class Americans, dual-earner couples report the highest marital quality. Things are less rosy for wives who do not want to work but are forced to by economic necessity, especially if their husbands don't pitch in at home. Such women have the least happy marriages in America.
Yet staying home doesn't necessarily help, because financial distress is an even more potent source of marital unhappiness and conflict than it used to be. In a 2012 Gallup poll, stay-at-home mothers in low-income families were less likely than employed moms at the same income level to report that they had smiled, laughed, or enjoyed themselves ''yesterday.''
What about the kids? As more wives took jobs between 1965 and 1985, the time mothers spent with children decreased. But since 1985, both mothers and fathers have increased their time with children. Employed moms spend fewer hours per week with their children than stay-at-home mothers, but they spend more time with their children than homemakers did in 1965!
And fathers nearly tripled their amount of time with children. A review of nearly 70 studies in the United States finds no significant negative effects of maternal employment on the intellectual achievement of young children. And in low-income families, children whose mothers had stable jobs had fewer behavior problems than children whose mothers experienced job instability or who did not work at all, according to another study. In Britain, researchers who controlled for mothers' education and household income found no negative effects of maternal employment for boys, while girls in two-earner families had fewer behavioral problems than girls in male breadwinner-female homemaker households. And a 2013 study of 75,000 Norwegian children found no behavioral problems linked to children's time in day care.
Of course, Britain offers 52 weeks of maternity leave, 39 of them paid, while Norway, unlike the United States, has strict standards for day care. Also, the same review that found no ill effects of maternal employment on young children in the United States did identify some added risks for adolescents, suggesting that society would benefit from more structured after-school programs for this age group. And a 2010 study found that some children had slightly lower cognitive achievement if mothers worked 30 hours or more a week in the first 9 months after their birth.
So while Friedan was right in her counterintuitive claim that maternal employment could be good for women and families, she failed to foresee that the United States, which pioneered public education for all and was on the verge of establishing a comprehensive child care system in 1971 (before President Richard M. Nixon vetoed the bill), would by the early 21st century have fallen to last place among developed nations in supports for working families. While the average working woman might be better off, we need to offer better maternity leave and child care for those more at risk.
After 50 years, shouldn't we stop debating whether we want mothers to work and start implementing the social policies and working conditions that will allow families to take full advantage of the benefits of women's employment and to minimize its stresses?

HEADLINE: Techs and the City

BYLINE: By ALEC APPELBAUM. 
Alec Appelbaum, who teaches at Pratt Institute, writes frequently on urban planning and design.

 BODY:
THIS spring New York City is rolling out its much-ballyhooed bike-sharing program, which relies on a sophisticated set of smartphone apps and other digital tools to manage it. The city isn't alone: across the country, municipalities are buying ever more complicated technological ''solutions'' for urban life.
But higher tech is not always essential tech. Cities could instead be making savvier investments in cheaper technology that may work better to stoke civic involvement than the more complicated, expensive products being peddled by information-technology developers. 
Of course, you'd never hear such an idea from the likes of I.B.M., which has plastered airports with ads about how its consultants help municipalities cut costs with its ''Smarter Cities'' analytics platform, or Cisco, which has teamed with Toyota and other companies to sponsor annual conferences about how to automate cars and gather information on urban activity through streetlight-mounted sensors. For these companies, the more complicated the technology, the more cities can save -- aside, of course, from the eye-popping price tags of the technology itself.
To be sure, big tech can zap some city weaknesses. According to I.B.M., its predictive-analysis technology, which examines historical data to estimate the next crime hot spots, has helped Memphis lower its violent crime rate by 30 percent.
But many problems require a decidedly different approach. Take the seven-acre site in Lower Manhattan called the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area, where 1,000 mixed-income apartments are set to rise. A working-class neighborhood that fell to bulldozers in 1969, it stayed bare as co-ops nearby filled with affluent families, including my own.
In 2010, with the city ready to invite developers to bid for the site, long-simmering tensions between nearby public-housing tenants and wealthier dwellers like me turned suddenly -- well, civil.
What changed? Was it some multimillion-dollar ''open democracy'' platform from Cisco, or a Big Data program to suss out the community's real priorities? Nope. According to Dominic Pisciotta Berg, then the chairman of the local community board, it was plain old e-mail, and the dialogue it facilitated. ''We simply set up an e-mail box dedicated to receiving e-mail comments'' on the renewal project, and organizers would then ''pull them together by comment type and then consolidate them for display during the meetings,'' he said. ''So those who couldn't be there had their voices considered and those who were there could see them up on a screen and adopted, modified or rejected.''
Through e-mail conversations, neighbors articulated priorities -- permanently affordable homes, a movie theater, protections for small merchants -- that even a supercomputer wouldn't necessarily have identified in the data.
The point is not that software is useless. But like anything else in a city, it's only as useful as its ability to facilitate the messy clash of real human beings and their myriad interests and opinions. And often, it's the simpler software, the technology that merely puts people in contact and steps out of the way, that works best.
Even San Francisco, one of the most technophilic towns in America, understands the limits of ''smart city'' technology. It has a chief innovation officer, Jay Nath, and sponsors ''hackathons'' to develop software to, say, bring more fresh produce to the underserved Central Market area. But Mr. Nath talks proudly of how San Franciscans helped retool taxi-dispatch systems by meeting in person. ''We decided to do an 'unhackathon,' '' he told me. ''And we had about 100 people from our community'' at the meeting.
''Technology doesn't walk into a room and take over everything,'' San Francisco's mayor, Edwin M. Lee, said last year. ''It has to be combined with a spirit that people from all skill sets can solve problems that government over the years has kind of done in silos.''
Indeed, some high-tech solutions being offered to cities run roughshod over urban values. Cisco is marketing cafe-like spaces in residential neighborhoods where creative workers can telecommute to their offices, using powerful communications technologies unavailable to the average home. Take that logic to its limit, and only low-wage workers whose employers can't afford the jazzed-up satellite sites will actually show up, physically, for work.
That's because the answers that make cities run more smoothly only inadvertently end up being the ones that make cities run more equitably. Deep data can learn and display policy cues that used to flow from guesswork. What it can do less reliably is reflect democratic action.
For that, you need more people discussing issues with more equal information and franchise. And that can most easily come from decidedly low-tech, but widely accessible, technologies like Facebook pages and e-mail chains. After all, cities don't have to buy ''smart'' software to get smarter.

HEADLINE: A Picket-Fence Experience

BYLINE: By VERA HALLER

 BODY:
People who live in Queens Village will tell you that the neighborhood lives up to its name. Residential and calm, with a distinct commercial center, it is often described as feeling like a small town.
''It's a nice neighborhood, clean and quiet,'' said Joseph Koshy, a retired city Transit Authority supervisor who recently bought a two-bedroom co-op in the Bell Park Manor Terrace complex. ''It's like living in a village upstate.''
Now a driving-school instructor, Mr. Koshy, who lives alone and used to rent a place nearby, said he had decided to buy his spacious co-op in order to build equity in a property. He found Queens Village economical.
Affordability is one of the main draws to this stable middle-class neighborhood, made up mainly of single-family homes and some co-ops, in the eastern part of the borough. 
House prices tend to be lower than in nearby Floral Park and Bellerose, which also offer the qualities of suburban-style living and lower taxes than on Long Island. Another attraction of Queens Village: its own centrally located Long Island Rail Road station, which allows residents to get to Penn Station in Manhattan in about half an hour.
In the words of Anne Donohue, a broker who owns an agency bearing her name, ''It's affordable, it is in District 26, which has excellent schools, it is convenient to transportation and it's easy to get in and out of the city,'' being near to both the Grand Central and Cross Island Parkways.
Commercial life in this sprawling neighborhood (its two main ZIP codes, 11428 and 11429, cover about two square miles) revolves around the intersection of Springfield Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue, where the train station is.
The retail strip that runs along Jamaica Avenue, with small, independent stores, restaurants, bakeries and hair salons, is filled with energy and activity. Other stores are found along Springfield Boulevard and Hempstead Avenue.
The neighborhood also is dotted with churches. The imposing Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church on 220th Street runs a parochial school, as does the stately St. Joseph's Episcopal Church on 217th Lane, with its spire and red clapboard exterior.
A hallmark of Queens Village is its diversity. According to 2010 census data, half of the 52,000 residents are African-American, 18.4 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, and 6 percent white. Among the growing Asian population are many South Asians and a small community of Filipinos, the census figures show.
Cecille Lagan, a real estate broker, says Queens Village is popular among immigrant families who are looking to break into the housing market. ''Everybody is looking for value,'' she said, ''and immigrants are very good at finding these neighborhoods, finding the value.''
She is currently selling the four-bedroom home of a woman in her 80s who has lived there since the 1960s, raising her family. The woman has decided to move to a smaller place, but Ms. Lagan, having spent time at the house, understands why it is difficult to leave. ''I sit on the porch and I don't see too many people,'' she said. ''It's very peaceful.''
What You'll Find
Queens Village has an eclectic mix of housing types that enhance its character. You'll find older Dutch colonials next to newer Capes, across from semiattached two-family houses that sit a block over from a line of brick town houses. But even with the diversity of architecture, the neighborhood has a well-tended air. Yards are neatly kept, trees hang invitingly over streets and some houses are surrounded by crisp white picket fences.
Parts of the neighborhood are zoned for two-family homes, allowing owners to rent out apartments that provide income to offset mortgages, said Kathy Gibbons, the manager of Laffey Fine Homes in Bellerose, who oversees properties in Queens Village.
Some of the larger homes are also attractive to families looking to house more than one generation, she said.
The co-op market is mainly in garden apartment complexes like Bell Park Manor Terrace, which has 900 units on a leafy campus. Ms. Donohue says young professionals buying their first homes are often interested in these places.
''It's usually a buyer looking to leave their family home or starting a new job in the city,'' she said. ''That market never goes away.''
What You'll Pay
At the peak of the market in 2006, the average price of a single-family house in Queens Village was about $460,00, said Ms. Gibbons. The average for the first quarter of 2013 was $350,000.
And although that may seem like a significant difference, several brokers reported witnessing a bump in prices this year. The average price of a house in the first quarter of 2012 was $330,000, Ms. Gibbons said.
Ms. Donohue said she had noticed an increase in activity recently, with properties receiving multiple offers and homes that had been languishing finally being sold. ''What's out there is bringing in competitive offers,'' she said, ''and what we're seeing is it's starting to clean out existing inventory that's been there a long time.''
In mid-May the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which covers Queens and Brooklyn, listed 122 single-family properties in Queens Village, ranging from a small, run-down house at $180,000 to a larger, renovated home asking $690,000.
Co-op listings included a one-bedroom unit in Bell Park Manor Terrace selling for $142,000 and a three-bedroom unit asking $170,000.
The Commute
Queens Village does not have direct subway service. But many residents are willing to pay the extra commuting costs for the convenience of taking the Long Island Rail Road. Rush-hour travel is quick; the 7:42 a.m. train arrives at Penn Station at 8:14 a.m. A one-way ticket during peak travel times costs $9.50; a monthly pass runs $210.
Another commuter option is the X68 express bus, which runs along Hillside Avenue. A ride from the Springfield Boulevard stop in Queens Village takes an hour to reach East 57th Street in Manhattan. Alternatively, a number of buses along Hillside Avenue deliver riders to the F train at the Jamaica/179th Street subway station.
What to Do
Besides the commercial strip on Jamaica Avenue, the neighborhood has shopping options including a Sears appliance and hardware store at Hillside and Braddock Avenues. Long Island malls are a short drive away.
For outdoor recreation, Alley Pond Park, on the northern end of Springfield Avenue, is the closest city park.
The Schools
The neighborhood falls within the Department of Education's District 29. The main elementary school is No. 33, the Edward M. Funk School, which has 1,000 students and runs from kindergarten through Grade 5. It got a C on its most recent progress report. The Jean Nuzzi Intermediate School 109 on 92nd Avenue serves Grades 6 through 9 and has about 1,100 students. Its progress report grade was a B. (This school has been in the news lately, since the suicide of a seventh-grade student who apparently had been bullied at school and online.)
The main high school, nearby in District 26, is Martin Van Buren, where the most recent SAT averages were 400 in reading, 406 in math and 391 in writing, versus 496, 514 and 434 citywide.
The History
For a short period at the beginning of the 1900s, a tract of land in Queens Village was privately developed as ''Interstate Park,'' a site for national pigeon trapshooting contests.
An account in The New York Times on Jan. 20, 1901, related that a steady wind swept the birds in one direction, ''a fact that the shooters realized early in the day, with results extremely disastrous for the birds.'' The park declared bankruptcy around 1902, and houses were eventually developed there.

HEADLINE: Let the Games Begin

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
IT WAS A SUNDAY AFTERNOON in SoHo and while most New Yorkers were having brunch, Makeda Peters and her boyfriend were on a street corner craning their necks at a seven-story art installation called ''The Wall,'' about to embark on what's known among travelers who love puzzles and prizes as a ''gamified city tour.''
For the next three hours the couple would explore the area and learn about its history by tackling trivia questions and accepting benign dares -- challenges that came not from a tour guide, but from an app called Stray Boots that Ms. Peters had downloaded to her iPhone. 
The first question seemed like a test to ensure that they were in the right spot: ''What color is the wall painted?'' Ms. Peters typed ''blue'' on her iPhone. Up popped the verdict: ''Correct!'' That earned her 10 points from the app, which then provided some history about the 1973 artwork by Forrest Myers. The couple spent the rest of the afternoon racking up points for each riddle and dare they polished off, striving to achieve a perfect score of 240. At the Hollister store they were told to snap a photo of themselves with the shirtless greeters who flank the doors like naughty cousins of the toy soldiers outside F. A. O. Schwarz. Near Greene Street they were asked how many ''real'' glass windows were above the first floor of the trompe l'oeil public artwork by Richard Haas.
''As we answered questions correctly, we were high-fiving in the middle of the street,'' said Ms. Peters, a program coordinator in Brooklyn for a national nonprofit organization called Playworks. ''You learn so many cool things.''
Stray Boots, which sells $2-to-$12 tours of more than a dozen cities including New Orleans, Philadelphia and Miami, was introduced last year, though the company began testing the concept in 2009 using only text messages. Since then, it has sold more than 85,000 tours, roughly doubling sales each year, said its chief executive, Avi Millman. (Stray Boots is also available in Britain, where it's known as UK: The Game.)
I decided to take a tour in Times Square to see if even I, who work there, could learn a thing or two. I rolled my eyes when the app sent me to Toys ''R'' Us and the M&M's World store. And I was disappointed that it didn't explain the evolution of Father Duffy Square. I did, however, pick up a few factoids including how in the 1840s New York Police Department officers wore badges made of copper, which may have inspired the nickname ''coppers'' and later ''cops.''
Yet the app is merely one product in a wave of new travel programs and promotions that are using game theory to win over customers, particularly those under 30 (so-called millennials). Today online tour operators like Expedia are incorporating avatars and trivia contests into the browsing and booking process. Tourism offices in Pennsylvania and Illinois are proffering exclusive Foursquare badges to those who check in at sites in their states. Museums are using portable multimedia players to make walking through their collections feel a bit like being in a multiplayer video game. And the America's State Parks Foundation is rolling out a new app by ParksbyNature Network called the Pocket Ranger -- available in 40 states by the end of the year -- that enables users to earn points and win prizes by signing up for GeoChallenges, outdoor quests that require players to use the app's GPS feature to navigate to sites like dams, trails and reservoirs.
It may sound like play, but it's part of a broader business trend known as gamification. Gabe Zichermann, author of the new book ''The Gamification Revolution'' and chair of the annual Gsummit in San Francisco, describes it as the process of using the best ideas from games, loyalty and behavioral economics to engage people and solve problems (or both). It generally involves the use of motivational techniques and psychological triggers, like being alerted to a challenge or offered an opportunity for higher status, often in combination with digital candy like badges, points and leader boards. (Some of the fundamental ideas are derived from research by the social scientist BJ Fogg at Stanford University; you can learn about gaming your own behavior at Behaviorwizard.org.)
Mr. Zichermann, himself an avid traveler, said that things elemental to travel are also elemental to gamification. Hard-core travelers like to keep score: they know how many countries they've visited and how many miles they've flown. They take pleasure in accumulating badges, like stamps on their passport (and, in bygone days, stickers on their luggage). They check off must-see landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Parthenon as if they are levels in a video game. Even the act of traveling from one place to another becomes a personal challenge: to do so with ever more speed and status.
On a deeper level, though, great gaming experiences speak to our inner desire for mastery, autonomy and purpose, Mr. Zichermann noted. The same can be said of travel. ''Why do we travel?'' he said. ''It's all about creating memories and discovering ourselves. Gamification is perfectly aligned with that.''
But a common misperception is that it's strictly about competition, Mr. Zichermann said. Gamification can engage people simply by making travel more playful and social, like Virgin America's new seat-to-seat delivery feature that encourages fliers to ''get lucky'' by sending one another cocktails and messages through the entertainment system touchscreens on seatbacks. Or KLM's Meet & Seat program, which allows passengers to view one another's Facebook and LinkedIn profiles before the flight and then pick a spot next to an intriguing stranger. Even acquiring travel skills has become a game with language-learning Web sites like Duolingo and MindSnacks. And photo-sharing apps like Instagram and Flickr, while not pure gamification, borrow elements of the practice, making travel feel more communal.
Thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones and big data, gamification is now prevalent in practically every industry, though some of its roots are in travel, going back to the early 1980s, when American Airlines introduced its AAdvantage frequent flier program to create brand loyalty. Despite gamification's popularity, there are many poorly designed experiences. In fact, the technology research company Gartner is predicting that by next year 80 percent of gamification projects will fail to meet business objectives. When done right, however, gamification can garner brand loyalty while also helping travelers interact, learn, share opinions and explore the world.
To achieve the latter, companies that specialize in gamification say they are trying to design experiences that are emotional, that delight or surprise, unlike early loyalty programs, which Mr. Zichermann described as ''transactional systems that are trying to get as much out of consumers as possible while giving as little as possible.''
Even airlines whose longstanding loyalty programs are transactional, are testing new kinds of perks and fresh ways to earn them. Last month American Airlines teamed up with Klout, the company that measures the digital influence of people using Twitter and other social networking sites by assigning them a score from 1 to 100. People with Klout scores of 55 or higher (the average person has a score of 40) received a day pass to one of nearly 40 American Airlines Admirals Clubs around the world.
It was not the first time an airline partnered with Klout: last year travelers in San Francisco International Airport who used the Klout iPhone app and had a score of 40 or higher were granted access to the Cathay Pacific First and Business Class Lounge. Other travel brands, like Airbnb, Legoland California and Virgin America, have also dangled perks to people whom Klout deemed high-ranking influencers.
Ken Comée, the chief executive of Badgeville, which specializes in gamification for brands like Samsung and NBC, said first-generation loyalty programs are expensive to manage and have become too complicated. ''I think people have become numb to it,'' he said. ''That's really the problem that exists that we're trying to solve.''
One of the ways Badgeville says it's doing that is with a game it created for Expedia.com called Around the World in 100 Days, which Expedia plans to introduce in the coming weeks. Designed to get travelers more engaged with the Web site and Expedia's loyalty program, the game begins with an introductory video. Then, players are asked to choose one of eight avatars and to select the type of travel experience that most appeals to them (city slicker, adventure addict, escape artist or culture buff).
The final step is registering for the game with your Expedia account information (or creating an account if you don't have one). Tokens finance your avatar's virtual trip to up to 20 destinations around the world. There are several ways to earn tokens including answering trivia questions (which might also get your name put on a leader board), downloading the Expedia mobile app and, of course, booking travel through Expedia.
The more cities your avatar visits, the more Expedia Rewards points you receive. A map of the world shows players where their avatar is on its journey, and an Indiana Jones-style graphic line between cities enables users to track their progress. There is also a weekly sweepstakes, where five players are randomly selected to earn 100,000 points. ''A lot of people are surprised that Expedia has a loyalty program,'' said Julius Lai, the senior director of loyalty marketing for Expedia.com. He said that games like Around the World in 100 Days are just the sort of thing a digital company like Expedia would use to ''engage people in a very entertaining way in order to achieve what is a very standard goal of a promotion.''
Yet of all the gamification infusing the travel industry, some of the most playful experiences can be found in the hallowed halls of museums.
To appeal to younger generations, many, like the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, have kiosks that enable visitors to send images of themselves to friends or social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. The Cleveland Museum of Art has a ''Rembrandt Yourself'' application on its Facebook page that allows visitors to put their face into one of four 17th-century Rembrandt portraits.
At the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania, instead of the usual artwork wall labels, there is the O, a device loaded with information about the art on display. The O picks up your location in each gallery and shows you images of nearby works. Click on one for details like information about the art, an interview with the artist or music that references the piece. You're invited to play the role of critic by tapping a button to indicate whether you ''love'' or ''hate'' the artwork. At the same time, the O spits out stats culled from other museumgoers, like ''35 percent of women hated this'' or ''two out of three Americans love this.''
You can also save your tour, so that when you're back home you can revisit your path through the museum -- along with the works you loved and hated. It shouldn't come as a surprise that there is an option to share those images on Facebook and Twitter, too.
As for Ms. Peters, she and her boyfriend liked their first gamified city tour so much that they tried another one. Also from Stray Boots, it led them through the West Village, from the ''secret'' garden of St. Luke's Church to New York's oldest continuously running Off Broadway theater, the Cherry Lane. The tour was called The Perfect Date.
And it was. ''We were able to see New York landmarks that we never really knew existed,'' Ms. Peters said. ''It gave us the opportunity to open our eyes and see things differently.''

HEADLINE: The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MERRICK, N.Y. -- Deirdre Yapalater's recent colonoscopy at a surgical center near her home here on Long Island went smoothly: she was whisked from pre-op to an operating room where a gastroenterologist, assisted by an anesthesiologist and a nurse, performed the routine cancer screening procedure in less than an hour. The test, which found nothing worrisome, racked up what is likely her most expensive medical bill of the year: $6,385.
That is fairly typical: in Keene, N.H., Matt Meyer's colonoscopy was billed at $7,563.56. Maggie Christ of Chappaqua, N.Y., received $9,142.84 in bills for the procedure. In Durham, N.C., the charges for Curtiss Devereux came to $19,438, which included a polyp removal. While their insurers negotiated down the price, the final tab for each test was more than $3,500. 
''Could that be right?'' said Ms. Yapalater, stunned by charges on the statement on her dining room table. Although her insurer covered the procedure and she paid nothing, her health care costs still bite: Her premium payments jumped 10 percent last year, and rising co-payments and deductibles are straining the finances of her middle-class family, with its mission-style house in the suburbs and two S.U.V.'s parked outside. ''You keep thinking it's free,'' she said. ''We call it free, but of course it's not.''
In many other developed countries, a basic colonoscopy costs just a few hundred dollars and certainly well under $1,000. That chasm in price helps explain why the United States is far and away the world leader in medical spending, even though numerous studies have concluded that Americans do not get better care.
Whether directly from their wallets or through insurance policies, Americans pay more for almost every interaction with the medical system. They are typically prescribed more expensive procedures and tests than people in other countries, no matter if those nations operate a private or national health system. A list of drug, scan and procedure prices compiled by the International Federation of Health Plans, a global network of health insurers, found that the United States came out the most costly in all 21 categories -- and often by a huge margin.
Americans pay, on average, about four times as much for a hip replacement as patients in Switzerland or France and more than three times as much for a Caesarean section as those in New Zealand or Britain. The average price for Nasonex, a common nasal spray for allergies, is $108 in the United States compared with $21 in Spain. The costs of hospital stays here are about triple those in other developed countries, even though they last no longer, according to a recent report by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that studies health policy.
While the United States medical system is famous for drugs costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and heroic care at the end of life, it turns out that a more significant factor in the nation's $2.7 trillion annual health care bill may not be the use of extraordinary services, but the high price tag of ordinary ones. ''The U.S. just pays providers of health care much more for everything,'' said Tom Sackville, chief executive of the health plans federation and a former British health minister.
Colonoscopies offer a compelling case study. They are the most expensive screening test that healthy Americans routinely undergo -- and often cost more than childbirth or an appendectomy in most other developed countries. Their numbers have increased manyfold over the last 15 years, with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting that more than 10 million people get them each year, adding up to more than $10 billion in annual costs.
Largely an office procedure when widespread screening was first recommended, colonoscopies have moved into surgery centers -- which were created as a step down from costly hospital care but are now often a lucrative step up from doctors' examining rooms -- where they are billed like a quasi operation. They are often prescribed and performed more frequently than medical guidelines recommend.
The high price paid for colonoscopies mostly results not from top-notch patient care, according to interviews with health care experts and economists, but from business plans seeking to maximize revenue; haggling between hospitals and insurers that have no relation to the actual costs of performing the procedure; and lobbying, marketing and turf battles among specialists that increase patient fees.
While several cheaper and less invasive tests to screen for colon cancer are recommended as equally effective by the federal government's expert panel on preventive care -- and are commonly used in other countries -- colonoscopy has become the go-to procedure in the United States. ''We've defaulted to by far the most expensive option, without much if any data to support it,'' said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.
In coming months, The New York Times will look at common procedures, drugs and medical encounters to examine how the economic incentives underlying the fragmented health care market in the United States have driven up costs, putting deep economic strains on consumers and the country.
Hospitals, drug companies, device makers, physicians and other providers can benefit by charging inflated prices, favoring the most costly treatment options and curbing competition that could give patients more, and cheaper, choices. And almost every interaction can be an opportunity to send multiple, often opaque bills with long lists of charges: $100 for the ice pack applied for 10 minutes after a physical therapy session, or $30,000 for the artificial joint implanted in surgery.
The United States spends about 18 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, nearly twice as much as most other developed countries. The Congressional Budget Office has said that if medical costs continue to grow unabated, ''total spending on health care would eventually account for all of the country's economic output.'' And it identified federal spending on government health programs as a primary cause of long-term budget deficits.
While the rise in health care spending in the United States has slowed in the past four years -- to about 4 percent annually from about 8 percent -- it is still expected to rise faster than the gross domestic product. Aging baby boomers and tens of millions of patients newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are likely to add to the burden.
With health insurance premiums eating up ever more of her flat paycheck, Ms. Yapalater, a customer relations specialist for a small Long Island company, recently decided to forgo physical therapy for an injury sustained during Hurricane Sandy because of high out-of-pocket expenses. She refused a dermatology medication prescribed for her daughter when the pharmacist said the co-payment was $130. ''I said, 'That's impossible, I have insurance,' '' Ms. Yapalater recalled. ''I called the dermatologist and asked for something cheaper, even if it's not as good.''
The more than $35,000 annually that Ms. Yapalater and her employer collectively pay in premiums -- her share is $15,000 -- for her family's Oxford Freedom Plan would be more than sufficient to cover their medical needs in most other countries. She and her husband, Jeff, 63, a sales and marketing consultant, have three children in their 20s with good jobs. Everyone in the family exercises, and none has had a serious illness.
Like the Yapalaters, many other Americans have habits or traits that arguably could put the nation at the low end of the medical cost spectrum. Patients in the United States make fewer doctors' visits and have fewer hospital stays than citizens of many other developed countries, according to the Commonwealth Fund report. People in Japan get more CT scans. People in Germany, Switzerland and Britain have more frequent hip replacements. The American population is younger and has fewer smokers than those in most other developed countries. Pushing costs in the other direction, though, is that the United States has relatively high rates of obesity and limited access to routine care for the poor.
A major factor behind the high costs is that the United States, unique among industrialized nations, does not generally regulate or intervene in medical pricing, aside from setting payment rates for Medicare and Medicaid, the government programs for older people and the poor. Many other countries deliver health care on a private fee-for-service basis, as does much of the American health care system, but they set rates as if health care were a public utility or negotiate fees with providers and insurers nationwide, for example.
''In the U.S., we like to consider health care a free market,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund and a former adviser to President Obama. ''But it is a very weird market, riddled with market failures.''
Consider this:
Consumers, the patients, do not see prices until after a service is provided, if they see them at all. And there is little quality data on hospitals and doctors to help determine good value, aside from surveys conducted by popular Web sites and magazines. Patients with insurance pay a tiny fraction of the bill, providing scant disincentive for spending.
Even doctors often do not know the costs of the tests and procedures they prescribe. When Dr. Michael Collins, an internist in East Hartford, Conn., called the hospital that he is affiliated with to price lab tests and a colonoscopy, he could not get an answer. ''It's impossible for me to think about cost,'' he said. ''If you go to the supermarket and there are no prices, how can you make intelligent decisions?''
Instead, payments are often determined in countless negotiations between a doctor, hospital or pharmacy, and an insurer, with the result often depending on their relative negotiating power. Insurers have limited incentive to bargain forcefully, since they can raise premiums to cover costs.
''It all comes down to market share, and very rarely is anyone looking out for the patient,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Rice, the chief executive of Healthcare Blue Book, which tracks commercial insurance payments. ''People think it's like other purchases: that if you pay more you get a better car. But in medicine, it's not like that.''A Market Is Born
As the cases of bottled water and energy drinks stacked in the corner of the Yapalaters' dining room attest, the family is cost conscious -- especially since a photography business long owned by the family succumbed eight years ago in the shift to digital imaging. They moved out of Manhattan. They rent out their summer home on Fire Island. They have put off restoring the wallpaper in their dining room.
And yet, Ms. Yapalater recalled, she did not ask her doctors about the cost of her colonoscopy because it was covered by insurance and because ''if a doctor says you need it, you don't ask.'' In many other countries, price lists of common procedures are publicly available in every clinic and office. Here, it can be nearly impossible to find out.
Until the last decade or so, colonoscopies were mostly performed in doctors' office suites and only on patients at high risk for colon cancer, or to seek a diagnosis for intestinal bleeding. But several highly publicized studies by gastroenterologists in 2000 and 2001 found that a colonoscopy detected early cancers and precancerous growths in healthy people.
They did not directly compare screening colonoscopies with far less invasive and cheaper screening methods, including annual tests for blood in the stool or a sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower colon where most cancers occur, every five years.
''The idea wasn't to say these growths would have been missed by the other methods, but people extrapolated to that,'' said Dr. Douglas Robertson, of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is beginning a large trial to compare the tests.
Experts agree that screening for colon cancer is crucial, and a colonoscopy is intuitively appealing because it looks directly at the entire colon and doctors can remove potentially precancerous lesions that might not yet be prone to bleeding. But studies have not clearly shown that a colonoscopy prevents colon cancer or death better than the other screening methods. Indeed, some recent papers suggest that it does not, in part because early lesions may be hard to see in some parts of the colon.
But in 2000, the American College of Gastroenterology anointed colonoscopy as ''the preferred strategy'' for colon cancer prevention -- and America followed.
Katie Couric, who lost her husband to colorectal cancer, had a colonoscopy on television that year, giving rise to what medical journals called the ''Katie Couric effect'': prompting patients to demand the test. Gastroenterology groups successfully lobbied Congress to have the procedure covered by Medicare for cancer screening every 10 years, effectively meaning that commercial insurance plans would also have to provide coverage.
Though Medicare negotiates for what are considered frugal prices, its database shows that it paid an average of $531 for a colonoscopy in 2011. But that does not include the payments to anesthesiologists, which could substantially increase the cost. ''As long as it's deemed medically necessary,'' said Jonathan Blum, the deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ''we have to pay for it.''
If the American health care system were a true market, the increased volume of colonoscopies -- numbers rose 50 percent from 2003 to 2009 for those with commercial insurance -- might have brought down the costs because of economies of scale and more competition. Instead, it became a new business opportunity.Profits Climb
Just as with real estate, location matters in medicine. Although many procedures can be performed in either a doctor's office or a separate surgery center, prices generally skyrocket at the special centers, as do profits. That is because insurers will pay an additional ''facility fee'' to ambulatory surgery centers and hospitals that is intended to cover their higher costs. And anesthesia, more monitoring, a wristband and sometimes preoperative testing, along with their extra costs, are more likely to be added on.
In Mount Kisco, N.Y., Maggie Christ had two colonoscopies two months apart, after her doctor decided it was best to remove a growth that had been discovered during the first procedure. They were performed by the same doctor, with the same sedation. The first, in an outpatient surgery department, was billed at $9,142.84 (insurance paid $5,742.67). The second, in the doctor's office, was billed at $5,322.76 (insurance eventually paid $2,922.63) because there was no facility fee. ''The location was about accommodating the doctor's schedule,'' Ms. Christ said. ''Why would an insurance company approve this?''
Ms. Yapalater, a trim woman who looks far younger than her 64 years, had two prior colonoscopies in doctor's offices (one turned up a polyp that required a five-year follow-up instead of the usual 10 years). But for her routine colonoscopy this January, Ms. Yapalater was referred to Dr. Felice Mirsky of Gastroenterology Associates, a group practice in Garden City, N.Y., that performs the procedures at an ambulatory surgery center called the Long Island Center for Digestive Health. The doctors in the gastroenterology practice, which is just down the hall, are owners of the center.
''It was very fancy, with nurses and ORs,'' Ms. Yapalater said. ''It felt like you were in a hospital.''
That explains the fees. ''If you work as a 'facility,' you can charge a lot more for the same procedure,'' said Dr. Soeren Mattke, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation. The bills to Ms. Yapalater's insurer reflected these charges: $1,075 for the gastroenterologist, $2,400 for the anesthesia -- and $2,910 for the facility fee.
When popularized in the 1980s, outpatient surgical centers were hailed as a cost-saving innovation because they cut down on expensive hospital stays for minor operations like knee arthroscopy. But the cost savings have been offset as procedures once done in a doctor's office have filled up the centers, and bills have multiplied.
It is a lucrative migration. The Long Island center was set up with the help of a company based in Pennsylvania called Physicians Endoscopy. On its Web site, the business tells prospective physician partners that they can look forward to ''distributions averaging over $1.4 million a year to all owners,'' ''typically 100 percent return on capital investment within 18 months'' and ''a return on investment of 500 percent to 2,000 percent over the initial seven years.''
Dr. Leonard Stein, the senior partner in Gastroenterology Associates and medical director of the surgery center, declined to discuss patient fees or the center's profits, citing privacy issues. But he said the center contracted with insurance companies in the area to minimize patients' out-of-pocket costs.
In 2009, the last year for which such statistics are available, gastroenterologists performed more procedures in ambulatory surgery centers than specialists in any other field. Once they bought into a center, studies show, the number of procedures they performed rose 27 percent. The specialists earn an average of $433,000 a year, among the highest paid doctors, according to Merritt Hawkins & Associates, a medical staffing firm.
Hospitals and doctors say that critics should not take the high ''rack rates'' in bills as reflective of the cost of health care because insurers usually pay less. But those rates are the starting point for negotiations with Medicare and private insurers. Those without insurance or with high-deductible plans have little weight to reduce the charges and often face the highest bills. Nassau Anesthesia Associates -- the group practice that handled Ms. Yapalater's sedation -- has sued dozens of patients for nonpayment, including Larry Chin, a businessman from Hicksville, N.Y., who said in court that he was then unemployed and uninsured. He was billed $8,675 for anesthesia during cardiac surgery.
For the same service, the anesthesia group accepted $6,970 from United Healthcare, $5,208.01 from Blue Cross and Blue Shield, $1,605.29 from Medicare and $797.50 from Medicaid. A judge ruled that Mr. Chin should pay $4,252.11.
Ms. Yapalater's insurer paid $1,568 of the $2,400 anesthesiologist's charge for her colonoscopy, but many medical experts question why anesthesiologists are involved at all. Colonoscopies do not require general anesthesia -- a deep sleep that suppresses breathing and often requires a breathing tube. Instead, they require only ''moderate sedation,'' generally with a Valium-like drug or a low dose of propofol, an intravenous medicine that takes effect quickly and wears off within minutes. In other countries, such sedative mixes are administered in offices and hospitals by a wide range of doctors and nurses for countless minor procedures, including colonoscopies.
Nonetheless, between 2003 and 2009, the use of an anesthesiologist for colonoscopies in the United States doubled, according to a RAND Corporation study published last year. Payments to anesthesiologists for colonoscopies per patient quadrupled during that period, the researchers found, estimating that ending the practice for healthy patients could save $1.1 billion a year because ''studies have shown no benefit'' for them, Dr. Mattke said.
But turf battles and lobbying have helped keep anesthesiologists in the room. When propofol won the approval of the Food and Drug Administration in 1989 as an anesthesia drug, it carried a label advising that it ''should be administered only by those who are trained in the administration of general anesthesia'' because of concerns that too high a dose could depress breathing and blood pressure to a point requiring resuscitation.
Since 2005, the American College of Gastroenterology has repeatedly pressed the F.D.A. to remove or amend the restriction, arguing that gastroenterologists and their nurses are able to safely administer the drug in lower doses as a sedative. But the American Society of Anesthesiologists has aggressively lobbied for keeping the advisory, which so far the F.D.A. has done.
A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman said that the label did not necessarily require an anesthesiologist and that it was safe for the others to administer propofol if they had appropriate training. But many gastroenterologists fear lawsuits if something goes wrong. If anything, that concern has grown since Michael Jackson died in 2009 after being given propofol, along with at least two other sedatives, without close monitoring.'Too Much for Too Little'
The Department of Veterans Affairs, which performs about a quarter-million colonoscopies annually, does not routinely use an anesthesiologist for screening colonoscopies. In Austria, where colonoscopies are also used widely for cancer screening, the procedure is performed, with sedation, in the office by a doctor and a nurse and ''is very safe that way,'' said Dr. Monika Ferlitsch, a gastroenterologist and professor at the Medical University of Vienna, who directs the national program on quality assurance.
But she noted that gastroenterologists in Austria do have their financial concerns. They are complaining to the government and insurers that they cannot afford to do the 30-minute procedure, with prep time, maintenance of equipment and anesthesia, for the current approved rate -- between $200 and $300, all included. ''I think the cheapest colonoscopy in the U.S. is about $950,'' Dr. Ferlitsch said. ''We'd love to get half of that.''
Dr. Cesare Hassan, an Italian gastroenterologist who is the chairman of the Guidelines Committee of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, noted that studies in Europe had estimated that the procedure cost about $400 to $800 to perform, including biopsies and sedation. ''The U.S. is paying way too much for too little -- it leads to opportunistic colonoscopies,'' done for profit rather than health, he said.
Some doctors in the United States are campaigning against the overuse of the procedure, like Dr. James Goodwin, a geriatrician at the University of Texas. He estimates that about a quarter of Medicare patients undergo the screening test more often than recommended, even though the risks of complications, like long recovery times and poor tolerance of sedation, increase for older people. Routine screening is not recommended for all people over 75.
And some large employers have begun fighting back on costs. Three years ago, Safeway realized that it was paying between $848 and $5,984 for a colonoscopy in California and could find no link to the quality of service at those extremes. So the company established an all-inclusive ''reference price'' it was willing to pay, which it said was set at a level high enough to give employees access to a range of high-quality options. Above that price, employees would have to pay the difference. Safeway chose $1,250, one-third the amount paid for Ms. Yapalater's procedure -- and found plenty of doctors willing to accept the price.
Still, the United States health care industry is nimble at protecting profits. When Aetna tried in 2007 to disallow payment for anesthesiologists delivering propofol during colonoscopies, the insurer backed down after a barrage of attacks from anesthesiologists and endoscopy groups. With Medicare contemplating lowering facility fees for ambulatory surgery centers, experts worry that physician-owners will sell the centers to hospitals, where fees remain higher.
And then there is aggressive marketing. People who do not have insurance or who are covered by Medicaid typically get far less colon cancer screening than they need. But those with insurance are appealing targets.
Nineteen months after Matt Meyer, who owns a saddle-fitting company near Keene, N.H., had his first colonoscopy, he received a certified letter from his gastroenterologist. It began, ''Our records show that you are due for a repeat colonoscopy,'' and it advised him to schedule an appointment or ''allow us to note your reason for not scheduling.'' Although his prior test had found a polyp, medical guidelines do not recommend such frequent screening.
''I have great doctors, but the economics is daunting,'' Mr. Meyer said in an interview. ''A computer-generated letter telling me to come in for a procedure that costs more than $5,000? It was the weirdest thing.''

The Cost of a Colonoscopy Varies Across the Country: Prices for a routine colonoscopy can vary widely between different locations across the country, and even within the same metropolitan area. For the most part, the differences are explained by the type of facility performing the procedure, with hospitals generally commanding the highest prices, according to Jeff Rice, chief executive of Healthcare Blue Book.

HEADLINE: The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MERRICK, N.Y. -- Deirdre Yapalater's recent colonoscopy at a surgical center near her home here on Long Island went smoothly: she was whisked from pre-op to an operating room where a gastroenterologist, assisted by an anesthesiologist and a nurse, performed the routine cancer screening procedure in less than an hour. The test, which found nothing worrisome, racked up what is likely her most expensive medical bill of the year: $6,385.
That is fairly typical: in Keene, N.H., Matt Meyer's colonoscopy was billed at $7,563.56. Maggie Christ of Chappaqua, N.Y., received $9,142.84 in bills for the procedure. In Durham, N.C., the charges for Curtiss Devereux came to $19,438, which included a polyp removal. While their insurers negotiated down the price, the final tab for each test was more than $3,500. 
''Could that be right?'' said Ms. Yapalater, stunned by charges on the statement on her dining room table. Although her insurer covered the procedure and she paid nothing, her health care costs still bite: Her premium payments jumped 10 percent last year, and rising co-payments and deductibles are straining the finances of her middle-class family, with its mission-style house in the suburbs and two S.U.V.'s parked outside. ''You keep thinking it's free,'' she said. ''We call it free, but of course it's not.''
In many other developed countries, a basic colonoscopy costs just a few hundred dollars and certainly well under $1,000. That chasm in price helps explain why the United States is far and away the world leader in medical spending, even though numerous studies have concluded that Americans do not get better care.
Whether directly from their wallets or through insurance policies, Americans pay more for almost every interaction with the medical system. They are typically prescribed more expensive procedures and tests than people in other countries, no matter if those nations operate a private or national health system. A list of drug, scan and procedure prices compiled by the International Federation of Health Plans, a global network of health insurers, found that the United States came out the most costly in all 21 categories -- and often by a huge margin.
Americans pay, on average, about four times as much for a hip replacement as patients in Switzerland or France and more than three times as much for a Caesarean section as those in New Zealand or Britain. The average price for Nasonex, a common nasal spray for allergies, is $108 in the United States compared with $21 in Spain. The costs of hospital stays here are about triple those in other developed countries, even though they last no longer, according to a recent report by the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that studies health policy.
While the United States medical system is famous for drugs costing hundreds of thousands of dollars and heroic care at the end of life, it turns out that a more significant factor in the nation's $2.7 trillion annual health care bill may not be the use of extraordinary services, but the high price tag of ordinary ones. ''The U.S. just pays providers of health care much more for everything,'' said Tom Sackville, chief executive of the health plans federation and a former British health minister.
Colonoscopies offer a compelling case study. They are the most expensive screening test that healthy Americans routinely undergo -- and often cost more than childbirth or an appendectomy in most other developed countries. Their numbers have increased manyfold over the last 15 years, with data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting that more than 10 million people get them each year, adding up to more than $10 billion in annual costs.
Largely an office procedure when widespread screening was first recommended, colonoscopies have moved into surgery centers -- which were created as a step down from costly hospital care but are now often a lucrative step up from doctors' examining rooms -- where they are billed like a quasi operation. They are often prescribed and performed more frequently than medical guidelines recommend.
The high price paid for colonoscopies mostly results not from top-notch patient care, according to interviews with health care experts and economists, but from business plans seeking to maximize revenue; haggling between hospitals and insurers that have no relation to the actual costs of performing the procedure; and lobbying, marketing and turf battles among specialists that increase patient fees.
While several cheaper and less invasive tests to screen for colon cancer are recommended as equally effective by the federal government's expert panel on preventive care -- and are commonly used in other countries -- colonoscopy has become the go-to procedure in the United States. ''We've defaulted to by far the most expensive option, without much if any data to support it,'' said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.
In coming months, The New York Times will look at common procedures, drugs and medical encounters to examine how the economic incentives underlying the fragmented health care market in the United States have driven up costs, putting deep economic strains on consumers and the country.
Hospitals, drug companies, device makers, physicians and other providers can benefit by charging inflated prices, favoring the most costly treatment options and curbing competition that could give patients more, and cheaper, choices. And almost every interaction can be an opportunity to send multiple, often opaque bills with long lists of charges: $100 for the ice pack applied for 10 minutes after a physical therapy session, or $30,000 for the artificial joint implanted in surgery.
The United States spends about 18 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, nearly twice as much as most other developed countries. The Congressional Budget Office has said that if medical costs continue to grow unabated, ''total spending on health care would eventually account for all of the country's economic output.'' And it identified federal spending on government health programs as a primary cause of long-term budget deficits.
While the rise in health care spending in the United States has slowed in the past four years -- to about 4 percent annually from about 8 percent -- it is still expected to rise faster than the gross domestic product. Aging baby boomers and tens of millions of patients newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are likely to add to the burden.
With health insurance premiums eating up ever more of her flat paycheck, Ms. Yapalater, a customer relations specialist for a small Long Island company, recently decided to forgo physical therapy for an injury sustained during Hurricane Sandy because of high out-of-pocket expenses. She refused a dermatology medication prescribed for her daughter when the pharmacist said the co-payment was $130. ''I said, 'That's impossible, I have insurance,' '' Ms. Yapalater recalled. ''I called the dermatologist and asked for something cheaper, even if it's not as good.''
The more than $35,000 annually that Ms. Yapalater and her employer collectively pay in premiums -- her share is $15,000 -- for her family's Oxford Freedom Plan would be more than sufficient to cover their medical needs in most other countries. She and her husband, Jeff, 63, a sales and marketing consultant, have three children in their 20s with good jobs. Everyone in the family exercises, and none has had a serious illness.
Like the Yapalaters, many other Americans have habits or traits that arguably could put the nation at the low end of the medical cost spectrum. Patients in the United States make fewer doctors' visits and have fewer hospital stays than citizens of many other developed countries, according to the Commonwealth Fund report. People in Japan get more CT scans. People in Germany, Switzerland and Britain have more frequent hip replacements. The American population is younger and has fewer smokers than those in most other developed countries. Pushing costs in the other direction, though, is that the United States has relatively high rates of obesity and limited access to routine care for the poor.
A major factor behind the high costs is that the United States, unique among industrialized nations, does not generally regulate or intervene in medical pricing, aside from setting payment rates for Medicare and Medicaid, the government programs for older people and the poor. Many other countries deliver health care on a private fee-for-service basis, as does much of the American health care system, but they set rates as if health care were a public utility or negotiate fees with providers and insurers nationwide, for example.
''In the U.S., we like to consider health care a free market,'' said Dr. David Blumenthal, president of the Commonwealth Fund and a former adviser to President Obama. ''But it is a very weird market, riddled with market failures.''
Consider this:
Consumers, the patients, do not see prices until after a service is provided, if they see them at all. And there is little quality data on hospitals and doctors to help determine good value, aside from surveys conducted by popular Web sites and magazines. Patients with insurance pay a tiny fraction of the bill, providing scant disincentive for spending.
Even doctors often do not know the costs of the tests and procedures they prescribe. When Dr. Michael Collins, an internist in East Hartford, Conn., called the hospital that he is affiliated with to price lab tests and a colonoscopy, he could not get an answer. ''It's impossible for me to think about cost,'' he said. ''If you go to the supermarket and there are no prices, how can you make intelligent decisions?''
Instead, payments are often determined in countless negotiations between a doctor, hospital or pharmacy, and an insurer, with the result often depending on their relative negotiating power. Insurers have limited incentive to bargain forcefully, since they can raise premiums to cover costs.
''It all comes down to market share, and very rarely is anyone looking out for the patient,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Rice, the chief executive of Healthcare Blue Book, which tracks commercial insurance payments. ''People think it's like other purchases: that if you pay more you get a better car. But in medicine, it's not like that.''A Market Is Born
As the cases of bottled water and energy drinks stacked in the corner of the Yapalaters' dining room attest, the family is cost conscious -- especially since a photography business long owned by the family succumbed eight years ago in the shift to digital imaging. They moved out of Manhattan. They rent out their summer home on Fire Island. They have put off restoring the wallpaper in their dining room.
And yet, Ms. Yapalater recalled, she did not ask her doctors about the cost of her colonoscopy because it was covered by insurance and because ''if a doctor says you need it, you don't ask.'' In many other countries, price lists of common procedures are publicly available in every clinic and office. Here, it can be nearly impossible to find out.
Until the last decade or so, colonoscopies were mostly performed in doctors' office suites and only on patients at high risk for colon cancer, or to seek a diagnosis for intestinal bleeding. But several highly publicized studies by gastroenterologists in 2000 and 2001 found that a colonoscopy detected early cancers and precancerous growths in healthy people.
They did not directly compare screening colonoscopies with far less invasive and cheaper screening methods, including annual tests for blood in the stool or a sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower colon where most cancers occur, every five years.
''The idea wasn't to say these growths would have been missed by the other methods, but people extrapolated to that,'' said Dr. Douglas Robertson, of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is beginning a large trial to compare the tests.
Experts agree that screening for colon cancer is crucial, and a colonoscopy is intuitively appealing because it looks directly at the entire colon and doctors can remove potentially precancerous lesions that might not yet be prone to bleeding. But studies have not clearly shown that a colonoscopy prevents colon cancer or death better than the other screening methods. Indeed, some recent papers suggest that it does not, in part because early lesions may be hard to see in some parts of the colon.
But in 2000, the American College of Gastroenterology anointed colonoscopy as ''the preferred strategy'' for colon cancer prevention -- and America followed.
Katie Couric, who lost her husband to colorectal cancer, had a colonoscopy on television that year, giving rise to what medical journals called the ''Katie Couric effect'': prompting patients to demand the test. Gastroenterology groups successfully lobbied Congress to have the procedure covered by Medicare for cancer screening every 10 years, effectively meaning that commercial insurance plans would also have to provide coverage.
Though Medicare negotiates for what are considered frugal prices, its database shows that it paid an average of $531 for a colonoscopy in 2011. But that does not include the payments to anesthesiologists, which could substantially increase the cost. ''As long as it's deemed medically necessary,'' said Jonathan Blum, the deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ''we have to pay for it.''
If the American health care system were a true market, the increased volume of colonoscopies -- numbers rose 50 percent from 2003 to 2009 for those with commercial insurance -- might have brought down the costs because of economies of scale and more competition. Instead, it became a new business opportunity.Profits Climb
Just as with real estate, location matters in medicine. Although many procedures can be performed in either a doctor's office or a separate surgery center, prices generally skyrocket at the special centers, as do profits. That is because insurers will pay an additional ''facility fee'' to ambulatory surgery centers and hospitals that is intended to cover their higher costs. And anesthesia, more monitoring, a wristband and sometimes preoperative testing, along with their extra costs, are more likely to be added on.
In Mount Kisco, N.Y., Maggie Christ had two colonoscopies two months apart, after her doctor decided it was best to remove a growth that had been discovered during the first procedure. They were performed by the same doctor, with the same sedation. The first, in an outpatient surgery department, was billed at $9,142.84 (insurance paid $5,742.67). The second, in the doctor's office, was billed at $5,322.76 (insurance eventually paid $2,922.63) because there was no facility fee. ''The location was about accommodating the doctor's schedule,'' Ms. Christ said. ''Why would an insurance company approve this?''
Ms. Yapalater, a trim woman who looks far younger than her 64 years, had two prior colonoscopies in doctor's offices (one turned up a polyp that required a five-year follow-up instead of the usual 10 years).

It is a lucrative migration. The Long Island center was set up with the help of a company based in Pennsylvania called Physicians Endoscopy. On its Web site, the business tells prospective physician partners that they can look forward to ''distributions averaging over $1.4 million a year to all owners,'' ''typically 100 percent return on capital investment within 18 months'' and ''a return on investment of 500 percent to 2,000 percent over the initial seven years.''

He estimates that about a quarter of Medicare patients undergo the screening test more often than recommended, even though the risks of complications, like long recovery times and poor tolerance of sedation, increase for older people. Routine screening is not recommended for all people over 75.
And some large employers have begun fighting back on costs. Three years ago, Safeway realized that it was paying between $848 and $5,984 for a colonoscopy in California and could find no link to the quality of service at those extremes. So the company established an all-inclusive ''reference price'' it was willing to pay, which it said was set at a level high enough to give employees access to a range of high-quality options. Above that price, employees would have to pay the difference. Safeway chose $1,250, one-third the amount paid for Ms. Yapalater's procedure -- and found plenty of doctors willing to accept the price.
Still, the United States health care industry is nimble at protecting profits. When Aetna tried in 2007 to disallow payment for anesthesiologists delivering propofol during colonoscopies, the insurer backed down after a barrage of attacks from anesthesiologists and endoscopy groups. With Medicare contemplating lowering facility fees for ambulatory surgery centers, experts worry that physician-owners will sell the centers to hospitals, where fees remain higher.
And then there is aggressive marketing. People who do not have insurance or who are covered by Medicaid typically get far less colon cancer screening than they need. But those with insurance are appealing targets.
Nineteen months after Matt Meyer, who owns a saddle-fitting company near Keene, N.H., had his first colonoscopy, he received a certified letter from his gastroenterologist. It began, ''Our records show that you are due for a repeat colonoscopy,'' and it advised him to schedule an appointment or ''allow us to note your reason for not scheduling.'' Although his prior test had found a polyp, medical guidelines do not recommend such frequent screening.
''I have great doctors, but the economics is daunting,'' Mr. Meyer said in an interview. ''A computer-generated letter telling me to come in for a procedure that costs more than $5,000? It was the weirdest thing.''

But the actual procedure was performed at the Long Island Center for Digestive Health, an ambulatory surgery center that is in the same office building. The doctors at the gastroenterology practice are also owners of the surgery center. Because the procedure was done at a surgery center and not in the doctors' office, Ms. Yapalater was charged a $2,910 facility fee, of which her insurance ultimately paid $1,751.

The Cost of a Colonoscopy Varies Across the Country: Prices for a routine colonoscopy can vary widely between different locations across the country, and even within the same metropolitan area. For the most part, the differences are explained by the type of facility performing the procedure, with hospitals generally commanding the highest prices, according to Jeff Rice, chief executive of Healthcare Blue Book.

HEADLINE: Disruptions: The Echo Chamber of Silicon Valley

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: Sometimes, tech entrepreneurs create companies best appreciated by other people who live and breathe technology. 

 BODY:
In San Francisco, a bad habit can be the spark that leads to starting a company.
Mike Belshe and Bill Lee were continually running late for meetings and texting each other: "I'll be there in 5 mins!" So they created Twist, a 10-person start-up in the city's South of Market neighborhood. The company's first product is a smartphone app that helps you tell someone you're late by showing your location on a map. Investors liked the idea enough to give Twist $6 million in venture financing last year.
"We thought there had to be something better than sending a text message," Mr. Belshe said in a phone interview. "We were trying to tackle that problem of meeting up and making it easier." 
Is Twist a great idea, or are Mr. Belshe and Mr. Lee falling into a local propensity for creating a product for technophile friends rather than the public?
Sometimes, Hollywood screenwriters create scripts filled with inside jokes that only people in Hollywood could appreciate. Sometimes, New York media writers write about other New York media writers. And sometimes, tech entrepreneurs in San Francisco and Silicon Valley to the south create companies best appreciated by other people who live and breathe technology.
Twist is hardly the only start-up whose target audience does not seem to extend far from San Francisco Bay. Among many, there's BlackJet, which offers "affordable private jet" solutions for people in the area. And there's Swig, which connects people with local liquor stores that provide home deliveries.
"One of the most important lessons I've learned is that we are guilty in the Valley of designing things for ourselves, and we are not the target market," said Andy Smith, who is the co-author of "The Dragonfly Effect," a book about marketing, technology and entrepreneurship.
Engineers tend to move to the Bay Area because of the opportunity to get together with other engineers and, just maybe, create a great company, Mr. Smith said. But in a region that has the highest concentration of tech workers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the bars, restaurants and other haunts of entrepreneurs can be an echo chamber. The result can be a focus on solutions for mundane problems.
"Some of the start-ups being created are designed for people who have rung the cash register already," Mr. Smith said. "They are not necessarily bad ideas but they are not the ideas the world needs more."
As George Packerwrote in The New Yorker last week: "Life inside Silicon Valley can be a paradise (for its winners) of opportunity and reward. Meanwhile, life outside falls further and further behind." Mr. Packer's critique started a new round of hand-wringing in the industry among people who worry that they are, well, thinking small.
That's not to say there aren't still people thinking about big markets. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, which sells electric cars that can cost more than $100,000, said last week at the D: All Things Digital conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., that he hoped to offer a $30,000 version of the car in the next five years. Mr. Musk is also working on SpaceX, which is already taking cargo to the International Space Station and which he hopes will one day take regular people (or at least regular rich people) into outer space.
But too often, says Jason Pontin, the editor in chief and publisher of MIT Technology Review, these start-ups are solving "fake problems that don't actually create any value." Mr. Pontin knows a thing or two about companies that aren't exactly reaching for the stars. From 1996 to 2002, he was the editor of Red Herring, a magazine in San Francisco that chronicled the region's dot-com boom and eventual collapse.
Still, some companies that start out with Silicon Valley in mind have shown they can adapt to the rest of society. Take Uber, which began in the San Francisco area as an online service meant to shuffle the affluent around in fancy town cars. As the company has expanded to other cities, it has created less expensive options for customers.
Even the founders of Twist see a future beyond informing their friends that they are five minutes late. Mr. Belshe said Twist planned to offer a version of the app that can give users the "estimated time of arrival for your packages, too."
Just as Facebook is synonymous with relationships, and Google is synonymous with search, Mr. Belshe said he hoped Twist could be the essential company for people who want to know the estimated arrival time for any number of things.
"When you're a start-up, it doesn't matter if you have it all figured out," said Mr. Belshe, who has worked for Google and previously sold a software company to Microsoft. "It matters that you have some large opportunities." Mr. Lee, his co-founder, is also an industry veteran.
And if the company flops, that's fine, because most start-ups do.
"One of perhaps the most compelling things about Silicon Valley is that it is a place where you can fail, and if you do, you can raise money and try again," said Mark Leslie, a retired entrepreneur and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. "It's a miraculous place; the streets are lined with gold here."

HEADLINE: In China, Concern of a Chill on Foreign Investments

BYLINE: NEIL GOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: A ruling by the top court is one of a number of recent signals that China&#8217;s long-assumed tolerance for foreign investment may be on the wane. 

 BODY:
China was booming, and Nina Wang, a Hong Kong billionaire, wanted a piece of the action.
It was 1995, and a group of investors was setting up the first nationwide joint-stock bank of the Communist era to be primarily owned by nongovernment companies.
 But Ms. Wang, considered to be the richest woman in Asia and a flamboyant figure who wore her hair in pigtails well into her 60s, faced an obstacle: Foreigners were barred from holding stakes in Chinese financial institutions.
To this day, it remains a hurdle in China, where swaths of the economy can be partially or totally off limits to foreign investment, including areas like education, finance, media and technology.
To get around the problem, Ms. Wang became a pioneer in the use of regulatory loopholes to control restricted assets in China. The practice has since been refined by Chinese companies that have raised billions of dollars on stock markets in the United States and Hong Kong and also by some multinational corporations with onshore business in China. 
Ms. Wang's Hong Kong company, Chinachem Financial Services, used a series of contracts to effectively gain economic control over a mainland Chinese firm, which in turn acted as a proxy to buy and hold the stake in the new bank, the China Minsheng Banking Corporation.
Chinachem soon had a falling out with the Chinese holding company over the ownership and dividends from the bank shares. The dispute ended up in mainland courts for 12 years - until a little-noticed ruling in October by the Supreme People's Court, the top judicial body in China.
In what appears to be the first time that high-ranking Chinese authorities have weighed in on the issue of foreign control agreements, the court ruled that the contracts Ms. Wang had signed were invalid. The court said the shares in the bank - by then worth about $700 million, compared with Ms. Wang's original investment of $11 million - belonged to the Chinese holding company.
Moreover, the court, in a 16-page judgment, ruled the contractual agreements between the Hong Kong and mainland companies had clearly been intended to circumvent China's restrictions on foreign investment, and amounted to "concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form."
The ruling was the latest indication that Beijing's long-assumed tolerance of overseas capital finding its way into the economy's restricted sectors might be waning, a development that could have far-reaching implications for investors and the companies they support. 
"This case shows that contracts used to get around China's foreign investment restrictions can be struck down by the courts,'' said Paul W. Boltz Jr., a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray in Hong Kong. Until then, many observers had come to regard the general absence of an official response as a sign of tacit approval - an acknowledgment that such investment could help build corporate champions and create jobs.
"'While this situation is fundamentally different" than how such contracts are now drafted and put in place, Mr. Boltz said, the ruling "'does raise the possibility that a Chinese court could take a similar position on other contracts."
The loopholes used by foreign investors in China, and by Chinese companies seeking to list on overseas stock markets, have become more sophisticated since Ms. Wang made her play for the stake in Minsheng bank.
Beginning in 2000, when Nasdaq listed the Internet company Sina.com, most Chinese companies in restricted sectors have relied on complex investment vehicles known as variable interest entities, or V.I.E., as a way to sell shares to foreigners and get around China's laws on outside investment.
About half of the more than 200 Chinese companies listed on the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges rely on the investment vehicles to control onshore assets in China, according to research by Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, and Fredrik Öqvist, an independent financial analyst.
The structure has also been used in Hong Kong listings, like that of Tencent Holdings, China's biggest publicly traded Internet company, with a market value of more than $70 billion.
While variable interest entities in such cases are technically owned by the Chinese, foreign-owned corporations maintain de facto control through a series of contracts that can involve equity pledges, profit assignments, purchase options and service or consulting agreements.
The complexity of the agreements, and the fact that they have not often been tested in court, has created some prominent challenges for foreign investors.
In 2011, Yahoo shareholders were caught by surprise when the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, in which Yahoo held a 40 percent stake, announced that it had transferred the assets of its online payment unit, Alipay, to a variable interest entity controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba's chief executive.
A large online video company, Tudou Holdings, delayed its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2010 after the former wife of the company's founder filed a lawsuit in a Shanghai court seeking control of the investment vehicle that held Tudou's operating licenses, claiming it was common property from her marriage.
The matter was settled by the court in June 2011, and Tudou successfully listed two months later. (Tudou merged with a rival Internet video company, Youku, last year.)
In the Chinachem case, Ms. Wang signed several lending and trust contracts in 1995 with the mainland Chinese firm that was to hold the bank stake, China Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Development, or China S.M.E.
Chinachem then transferred $11 million to a mainland bank account owned by China S.M.E., which in turn acquired a board seat and a 6.5 percent stake in Minsheng bank. China S.M.E. was to use its board seat to vote in accord with Chinachem's wishes, and to transfer dividends to the Hong Kong company.
Problems became apparent in 1997, when the mainland firm did not respond to Chinachem's requests for information about the bank's finances. The next year, Chinachem sought to enforce its contracts and lay claim to the bank shares. China S.M.E. responded that it was the shares' rightful owner.
Chinachem eventually sued in Beijing, seeking ownership of the Minsheng shares. The court ruled against the Hong Kong firm in 2001, but ordered China S.M.E. to pay Chinachem about $15 million in compensation.
Chinachem appealed the case to the high court in 2002, and Ms. Wang died in Hong Kong five years later, before the court ruled.
It is unclear why it took a decade to issue the ruling, which confirmed a lower court's decision that Chinachem had no right to the bank stake. It did, however, increase the compensation payable by the mainland firm to more than $300 million.
Today, Minsheng bank is traded in both Shanghai and Hong Kong and has a market value of around $45 billion. China S.M.E. retains a stake worth $1.26 billion based on the stock's current valuation.
China's courts are not independent, and rulings do not have the same precedent-setting effect that they do in the United States.
Still, other foreign-control contracts have come under official scrutiny in recent years. In August, China's Ministry of Commerce attached a notable condition in allowing Wal-Mart Stores to bolster its stake in one of China's biggest e-commerce companies, Yihaodian.
The ministry, which enforces China's antimonopoly legislation, said Wal-Mart could lift its shareholding in the online retailer to a controlling stake. But it expressly forbid the American company from using a variable interest entity to operate an Internet trading platform that Yihaodian had hosted for other online retailers and consumers.
Since 2010, Shanghai's arbitration board has invalidated two variable interest entities that had been used by foreign companies to control onshore businesses. In one case involving an online game company, the panel applied China's contract law to reach the same conclusion as the supreme court in the Chinachem case - saying that the variable-interest entities were "concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form."
"I think what you are looking at here is that China is attacking these V.I.E. structures and the other ways that people have used legal form to get around the substance of what Chinese law says you can't do," said Mr. Gillis, of Peking University, who also serves as a member of the standing advisory group of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States.
"Of course," he said, "people have been doing that as long as there has been foreign investment in China."

HEADLINE: Bank of Ireland Bond Sale Confirms a Credit Boom

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The bond bonanza has eased the short-term financing troubles for many of Europe&#8217;s struggling companies. 

 BODY:
Investors' appetite for Bank of Ireland bonds has changed a lot in the last four years.
In September 2009, the Irish lender, which received a 4.8 billion euro ($6.2 billion) bailout during the financial crisis, was forced to offer investors a return of around 4.6 percent to sell $1.3 billion of three-and-a-half year bonds.
Yet when the bank returned to the European corporate bond market last week, the yield, or interest rate, had almost halved, to 2.75 percent, on its $650 million of unsecured three-year bonds. 
More important, the issuance was almost three times oversubscribed, as investors clamored to secure access to the relatively risky bonds.
"Ireland has recovered strongly in the past couple of years," said Christopher Whitman, global head of risk syndicate at Deutsche Bank in London, which helped sell the bonds to investors. "Many credit investors are now comfortable with Ireland, as well as with the Bank of Ireland."
The demand for the Bank of Ireland's bonds is the latest example of the credit boom that is gripping Europe.
Despite concerns about the Continent's wider economy, companies including global giants like Siemens and Barclays as well as smaller local firms have issued more than $430 billion of bonds this year, according to the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's. In contrast, companies in the United States have pocketed around $380 billion.
The bonanza has eased the short-term financing troubles for many of Europe's struggling companies.
With banks cutting back on lending to meet more stringent capital requirements, the debt markets have provided companies an opportunity to refinance maturing loans, often at reduced interest rates. The new financing has also helped offset the impact of dwindling sales caused by the financial crisis.
Even in debt-ridden southern European countries like Greece and Portugal, companies have found willing bondholders to back new issuances.
The Greek oil-refining company Hellenic Petroleum, for example, raised $650 million in four-year bonds on April 30, after it offered investors an annual return of 8 percent. Portucel, a Portuguese paper manufacturer, also won backing in mid-May for its seven-year bonds worth a combined $455 million. The company had offered investors a return of 5.4 percent.
In total, European companies have issued $64.1 billion of high-yield bonds this year, almost double the amount compared with the same period in 2012, according to the data provider Dealogic.
Europe's banking sector has also gotten into the financing act.
Faced with regulatory demands to increase their financing reserves, a number of large European financial institutions, including UBS of Switzerland and BBVA of Spain, have issued so-called contingent capital, or CoCos, to fill the void.
These complex financial instruments offer bondlike returns to investors, but convert to equity - or, in some cases, wipe out bondholders' investments altogether - if a bank's capital falls below a certain threshold. European banks have raised almost $5 billion through these products this year, and analysts expect more issuances by the end of the year.
"CoCos are an attractive option for some of Europe's largest banks," said James Longsdon, a managing director at the credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings.
While Europe's corporate and financial sectors have benefited from the near record amount of bond issuances so far this year, analysts worry that investors may be setting themselves up for trouble.
As demand for new corporate bonds has outstripped supply, many investors are now looking to buy debt from noninvestment grade companies in the so-called high yield market.
These companies once had to guarantee double-digit returns to entice investors to part with their money. Now, the average coupon, or return, on offer in the European high-yield market has fallen to around 6 percent, almost an all-time low.
For some, that still represents a healthy return.
But other investors fret that the falling yields do not compensate for the dangers associated with backing these somewhat risky companies. The returns have plunged in the last 12 months because more investors are fighting for access to the bonds, which allows companies to reduce the interest rate payments that they offer to bondholders.
For analysts, the concern is that investors may face major losses if companies cannot repay the borrowed money when interest rates start to rise.
"Investors will get absolutely shellacked," said Robin Doumar, managing partner of Park Square Capital, a company based in London that invests in debt financing. "As rates rise, investors will get savaged by both interest rate and credit risk. This will end in tears."

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund, Under Fire, Braces for Withdrawals

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Steven A. Cohen&#8217;s SAC Capital Advisors, long under investigation, faces what could be billions of dollars in withdrawals by a Monday deadline. Prosecutors face a deadline of their own. 

 BODY:
The embattled hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors is bracing for investors to pull out as much as several billion dollars by a Monday deadline. Withdrawals have stepped up as a separate deadline looms for law enforcement officials investigating the firm.
Over the next several weeks, the authorities must decide whether to bring a criminal case against SAC related to suspicious trading in two drug stocks. The government has already brought charges against a former SAC employee connected to those trades, which involved the fund's billionaire founder, Steven A. Cohen. Authorities have explored new avenues on how they might bring a criminal case against the firm and possibly a civil action against Mr. Cohen, people briefed on the case said.
 The escalated investigative activity has caused SAC investors to grow increasingly worried about the fund's future. Already this year, investors have pulled $1.7 billion from the $15 billion fund, or about a quarter of the outside money managed by SAC. (Mr. Cohen's fortune and employee money accounts for about $9 billion of the fund.)
Depending on the total amount of withdrawals on Monday, a scheduled quarterly deadline, SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., could shut its door to outside investors and manage only internal funds. 
But the ultimate fate of the fund may be determined this summer, as the government's investigation enters the final stages. Prosecutors expect four senior SAC executives who received subpoenas last month to testify before a grand jury, according to the people briefed on the case. The executives include the firm's chief compliance officer and head trader, and they are expected to field questions about trading and compliance practices, these people said.
Mr. Cohen has also received a grand jury subpoena, but he is expected to assert his constitutional right against self-incrimination rather than subject himself to unlimited questioning, the people briefed on the case said. He has already provided testimony to securities regulators in a parallel civil inquiry. Neither Mr. Cohen nor the firm has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Though SAC has been a focus of investigators since at least 2006, the firm came under heightened scrutiny in November. Prosecutors accused Mathew Martoma, a former SAC employee, of obtaining secret data about clinical trials being done by the drug companies Elan and Wyeth, and using the information both to earn trading profits and avoid losses, a total of $276 million. For the first time in the inquiry, the government said that Mr. Cohen authorized the trades. Prosecutors have not claimed that Mr. Cohen knew about the confidential information that Mr. Martoma is accused of obtaining.
Mr. Martoma is fighting the charges against him and has rejected overtures to cooperate and testify against Mr. Cohen.
Because the Elan and Wyeth trades occurred in mid-July 2008, the government is running up against a five-year deadline to bring charges related to them. Prosecutors also face an August deadline to file charges related to trading in Dell shares, a case that has resulted in two indictments of former SAC employees, one of whom pleaded guilty.
As these deadlines approach, clients are fleeing. At least three have indicated they are withdrawing money, according to people briefed on the matter. Blackstone Group, SAC's largest outside client, is expected to redeem more than half of roughly $500 million. Magnitude Capital, a New York-based firm that invests client money in hedge funds, has asked for its money, though how much is unclear.
A third investor, Ironwood Capital Management, has also put in a withdrawal request. Ironwood, a San Francisco-based fund, decided to pull its money after SAC said last month that it was no longer cooperating "unconditionally" with the government or providing investors with updates about the investigation.
 Based on these withdrawals, SAC may decide to return money to all outside investors and become a "family office," managing only Mr. Cohen's wealth.
The investor retreat comes after Mr. Cohen and his legal team thought that they had resolved most of SAC's legal problems. In March, it agreed to pay $616 million to settle two civil cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Elan, Wyeth and Dell trades.
But despite the record fine, the S.E.C. is still contemplating a civil action against Mr. Cohen, according to the people briefed on the case. The agency is considering a number of possible claims against him, including insider trading related to the drug-stock trades. Another option is a lawsuit accusing Mr. Cohen of failing to supervise his employees.
The S.E.C., which could assess a fine and seek to ban Mr. Cohen from the securities industry, has a lower threshold for proving its case than criminal authorities do. Prosecutors need to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, but the S.E.C. would have to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence.
The criminal authorities also continue to press their case. In recent weeks, by serving new subpoenas on SAC executives, they have made it clear that they are still trying to build evidence against the fund, and perhaps Mr. Cohen. Prosecutors often hesitate to indict companies, fearing job losses and the threat to the economy. Often they file a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, suspending charges as long as the company begins reforms. But prosecutors are not considering such an agreement with SAC, say people briefed on the investigation.
At least nine current or former SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the fund; four have pleaded guilty.
In late April, SAC's lawyers called a meeting to lay out their defense to possible charges, according to people briefed on the investigation. They were taken aback when 17 government officials - prosecutors, S.E.C. lawyers, F.B.I. agents and postal inspectors - attended the meeting at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.
Underscoring the importance of the SAC case, Richard B. Zabel, the deputy United States attorney in Manhattan, and Lorin L. Reisner, the head of the office's criminal division, helped lead the meeting and have taken an active role in the investigation. Lawyers from Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison are defending SAC.
A few weeks after the meeting, the authorities issued the grand jury subpoenas to the SAC executives, including one to Mr. Cohen. That day, the firm told investors it was no longer fully cooperating, a sign that Mr. Cohen will decline to testify. The other subpoenaed executives are Thomas Conheeney, the firm's president; Solomon Kumin, chief operating officer; Steven Kessler, chief compliance officer; and Phillipp Villhauer, head of trading.
None have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr. Cohen's lieutenants are expected to testify, but if they refuse, the government could compel testimony with a grant of immunity. One risk is that the executives could tell the grand jury they have no knowledge that Mr. Cohen ever violated securities laws.
Some government officials hold out hope that the two former SAC employees under indictment will turn against Mr. Cohen. If convicted, Mr. Martoma, 38, married with three young children, faces up to 25 years in prison. Much of the case rests on what was said during a 20-minute call between Mr. Martoma and Mr. Cohen the night before SAC began executing the trades.
Another of Mr. Cohen's former employees, Michael S. Steinberg, 41, also married with a young family, is also staring at possible prison time for his involvement in the Dell trade. The authorities sought the cooperation of Mr. Steinberg, one of SAC's longest-serving employees and a friend of Mr. Cohen. But he, too, has denied the charges.
Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty to trading Dell shares illegally, and said he passed inside tips to Mr. Steinberg. He is expected to be the government's main witness at Mr. Steinberg's trial, set for Nov. 18. SAC is paying for the legal bills of both Mr. Martoma and Mr. Steinberg.

HEADLINE: Obama's Covert Trade Deal

BYLINE: By LORI WALLACH and BEN BEACHY. 
Lori Wallach is the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, where Ben Beachy is the research director.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- THE Obama administration has often stated its commitment to open government. So why is it keeping such tight wraps on the contents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the most significant international commercial agreement since the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995?
The agreement, under negotiation since 2008, would set new rules for everything from food safety and financial markets to medicine prices and Internet freedom. It would include at least 12 of the countries bordering the Pacific and be open for more to join. President Obama has said he wants to sign it by October. 
Although Congress has exclusive constitutional authority to set the terms of trade, so far the executive branch has managed to resist repeated requests by members of Congress to see the text of the draft agreement and has denied requests from members to attend negotiations as observers -- reversing past practice.
While the agreement could rewrite broad sections of nontrade policies affecting Americans' daily lives, the administration also has rejected demands by outside groups that the nearly complete text be publicly released. Even the George W. Bush administration, hardly a paragon of transparency, published online the draft text of the last similarly sweeping agreement, called the Free Trade Area of the Americas, in 2001.
There is one exception to this wall of secrecy: a group of some 600 trade ''advisers,'' dominated by representatives of big businesses, who enjoy privileged access to draft texts and negotiators.
This covert approach is a major problem because the agreement is more than just a trade deal. Only 5 of its 29 chapters cover traditional trade matters, like tariffs or quotas. The others impose parameters on nontrade policies. Existing and future American laws must be altered to conform with these terms, or trade sanctions can be imposed against American exports.
Remember the debate in January 2012 over the Stop Online Piracy Act, which would have imposed harsh penalties for even the most minor and inadvertent infraction of a company's copyright? The ensuing uproar derailed the proposal. But now, the very corporations behind SOPA are at it again, hoping to reincarnate its terms within the Trans-Pacific Partnership's sweeping proposed copyright provisions.
From another leak, we know the pact would also take aim at policies to control the cost of medicine. Pharmaceutical companies, which are among those enjoying access to negotiators as ''advisers,'' have long lobbied against government efforts to keep the cost of medicines down. Under the agreement, these companies could challenge such measures by claiming that they undermined their new rights granted by the deal.
And yet another leak revealed that the deal would include even more expansive incentives to relocate domestic manufacturing offshore than were included in Nafta -- a deal that drained millions of manufacturing jobs from the American economy.
The agreement would also be a boon for Wall Street and its campaign to water down regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Among other things, it would practically forbid bans on risky financial products, including the toxic derivatives that helped cause the crisis in the first place.
Of course, the agreement must eventually face a Congressional vote, which means that one day it will become public.
So why keep it a secret? Because Mr. Obama wants the agreement to be given fast-track treatment on Capitol Hill. Under this extraordinary and rarely used procedure, he could sign the agreement before Congress voted on it. And Congress's post-facto vote would be under rules limiting debate, banning all amendments and forcing a quick vote.
Ron Kirk, until recently Mr. Obama's top trade official, was remarkably candid about why he opposed making the text public: doing so, he suggested to Reuters, would raise such opposition that it could make the deal impossible to sign.
Michael Froman, nominated to be Mr. Kirk's replacement, will most likely become the public face of the administration's very private negotiations and the apparent calculation that underlies them. As someone whose professional experience has been during the Internet era, he must know that such extreme secrecy is bound to backfire.
Whatever one thinks about ''free trade,'' the secrecy of the Trans-Pacific Partnership process represents a huge assault on the principles and practice of democratic governance. That is untenable in the age of transparency, especially coming from an administration that is otherwise so quick to trumpet its commitment to open government.

HEADLINE: Courting Thrifty Shoppers With Value and Quality

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ALMOST five years after the financial crisis, the economy has improved significantly, but remains uncertain enough that millions of worried Americans continue to watch how they spend. That has left marketers and agencies trying to figure out the right tone and tack to take in selling products as varied as cars and cans of soup.
Many on Madison Avenue are deciding to focus on value, as in value for money, celebrating thriftiness as they did during the dark days of 2008 and 2009 but also, in an effort to keep ads from growing stale, suggesting that product attributes like quality matter, too, in a ''you get what you pay for'' fashion. 
For example, advertising to be introduced on Monday by Vonage, the Internet phone provider, replaces its usual message of lower prices, expressed by exhortations like ''Ditch the big bill,'' with a theme, ''Crazy generous,'' voiced by a brand character styled as the company's new chief generosity officer. ''What we need is a company that connects us with generosity,'' the character says in a commercial by JWT, part of WPP.
The new theme is ''bigger than just saving money,'' said Barbara Goodstein, chief marketing officer at Vonage Holdings in Holmdel, N.J.
''We believe people should have the opportunity to find value in technology,'' she added, listing elements that, in addition to low cost, include ''flexibility, simplicity, quality, new products and innovation.''
The ''Crazy generous'' theme is meant to convey that Vonage remains ''committed to providing consumers with low-cost communications services,'' Ms. Goodstein said, as part of ''a business philosophy'' embodied by the brand character.
''He is a champion of the people,'' she added, in a populist way, which makes him ''the right spokesperson for our times.''
Procter & Gamble, the nation's largest advertiser by spending, has been scrambling to fine-tune its lineup of mostly premium-price household staples in categories like beauty, detergents and paper goods. The goal is to add lower-price items to appeal to shoppers who have been switching brands to save money but still seek efficacy from what they buy, while not eroding sales for the company's higher-price merchandise.
The recent abrupt departure of the Procter & Gamble chief executive, Robert A. McDonald, who was succeeded by his predecessor, A. G. Lafley, was attributed partly to concerns the effort was hitting too many bumpy patches.
One example of how Procter has sought to adapt to the times was the return in January of Vidal Sassoon hair products, discontinued in North America in 2003, as what the company called the ''affordable'' Vidal Sassoon Pro Series line -- i.e., priced lower than the company's Pantene brand name hair products, but higher than store brands.
This June, Procter & Gamble plans to introduce Iams So Good, a dog food that will cost about 15 percent less than the Iams line, which is among the higher-price dog foods like Eukanuba and Hill's. Iams So Good, aimed at brands like Beneful and Pedigree, is being introduced with advertising by the creative agency for Iams, Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, that includes commercials, print and online ads, displays in stores and content in social media. The budget for the Iams So Good campaign, which echoes the Iams brand's ad theme, ''Keep love strong,'' is estimated at more than $50 million.
Making Iams ''more accessible'' is ''a big move for us,'' said Kristine Decker, marketing director for North America at the Procter & Gamble pet care division in Cincinnati.
''We're broadening our appeal,'' she added, because ''we realize a lot of our brands need to 'tier down' to appeal to more consumers.'' She compared adding Iams So Good as part of the Iams line to the way the company added lower-price Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic products to the premium-price Bounty and Charmin lines of paper goods.
As Iams So Good arrives in stores, Procter intends to ''support regular Iams, too,'' Ms. Decker said, because ''we've got to build the base as we expand.'' According to Kantar Media, a division of WPP, Procter spent $69.9 million to advertise Iams last year in major media, compared with $67.4 million in 2011. That could help deter defections to Iams So Good by buyers of Iams.
The campaign for Iams So Good promotes the absence of ingredients like added sugar, dyes and artificial preservatives and proclaims that the new variety ''has 100 percent wholesome ingredients and nothing else.'' The product's lower cost will be conveyed through the store displays and packaging rather than brought up in commercials or print ads.
''We don't talk about the value or the price,'' said Tris Gates-Bonarius, global creative director on the Iams and Eukanuba brands at Saatchi & Saatchi, so ''the look and feel of the campaign'' can be in ''the Iams tone of voice, celebrating authentic, real relationships between pets and owners.'' For instance, she added, the commercials for Iams So Good will feature pets, rather than trained animals, that appear with their owners, just as commercials for Iams do. One spot for Iams So Good depicts a dog named Harvey performing what is described as his '' 'I'm happy you're home' dance.''
Ms. Decker echoed Ms. Gates-Bonarius. ''Our first priority is to create awareness of what's in your dog's bowl,'' Ms. Decker said of the campaign's emphasis on the ingredients in Iams So Good. ''We will drive more overt value awareness in stores.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: New ads for Vonage carry the theme ''Crazy generous'' and feature a chief generosity officer.

HEADLINE: Bank of Ireland Bond Sale Confirms a Credit Boom

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
Investors' appetite for Bank of Ireland bonds has changed a lot in the last four years.
In September 2009, the Irish lender, which received a 4.8 billion euro ($6.2 billion) bailout during the financial crisis, was forced to offer investors a return of around 4.6 percent to sell $1.3 billion of three-and-a-half year bonds.
Yet when the bank returned to the European corporate bond market last week, the yield, or interest rate, had almost halved, to 2.75 percent, on its $650 million of unsecured three-year bonds. 
More important, the issuance was almost three times oversubscribed, as investors clamored to secure access to the relatively risky bonds.
''Ireland has recovered strongly in the past couple of years,'' said Christopher Whitman, global head of risk syndicate at Deutsche Bank in London, which helped sell the bonds to investors. ''Many credit investors are now comfortable with Ireland, as well as with the Bank of Ireland.''
The demand for the Bank of Ireland's bonds is the latest example of the credit boom that is gripping Europe.
Despite concerns about the Continent's wider economy, companies including global giants like Siemens and Barclays as well as smaller local firms have issued more than $430 billion of bonds this year, according to the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's. In contrast, companies in the United States have pocketed around $380 billion.
The bonanza has eased the short-term financing troubles for many of Europe's struggling companies.
With banks cutting back on lending to meet more stringent capital requirements, the debt markets have provided companies an opportunity to refinance maturing loans, often at reduced interest rates. The new financing has also helped offset the impact of dwindling sales caused by the financial crisis.
Even in debt-ridden southern European countries like Greece and Portugal, companies have found willing bondholders to back new issuances.
The Greek oil-refining company Hellenic Petroleum, for example, raised $650 million in four-year bonds on April 30, after it offered investors an annual return of 8 percent. Portucel, a Portuguese paper manufacturer, also won backing in mid-May for its seven-year bonds worth a combined $455 million. The company had offered investors a return of 5.4 percent.
In total, European companies have issued $64.1 billion of high-yield bonds this year, almost double the amount compared with the same period in 2012, according to the data provider Dealogic.
Europe's banking sector has also gotten into the financing act.
Faced with regulatory demands to increase their financing reserves, a number of large European financial institutions, including UBS of Switzerland and BBVA of Spain, have issued so-called contingent capital, or CoCos, to fill the void.
These complex financial instruments offer bondlike returns to investors, but convert to equity -- or, in some cases, wipe out bondholders' investments altogether -- if a bank's capital falls below a certain threshold. European banks have raised almost $5 billion through these products this year, and analysts expect more issuances by the end of the year.
''CoCos are an attractive option for some of Europe's largest banks,'' said James Longsdon, a managing director at the credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings.
While Europe's corporate and financial sectors have benefited from the near record amount of bond issuances so far this year, analysts worry that investors may be setting themselves up for trouble.
As demand for new corporate bonds has outstripped supply, many investors are now looking to buy debt from noninvestment grade companies in the so-called high yield market.
These companies once had to guarantee double-digit returns to entice investors to part with their money. Now, the average coupon, or return, on offer in the European high-yield market has fallen to around 6 percent, almost an all-time low.
For some, that still represents a healthy return.
But other investors fret that the falling yields do not compensate for the dangers associated with backing these somewhat risky companies. The returns have plunged in the last 12 months because more investors are fighting for access to the bonds, which allows companies to reduce the interest rate payments that they offer to bondholders.
For analysts, the concern is that investors may face major losses if companies cannot repay the borrowed money when interest rates start to rise.
''Investors will get absolutely shellacked,'' said Robin Doumar, managing partner of Park Square Capital, a company based in London that invests in debt financing. ''As rates rise, investors will get savaged by both interest rate and credit risk. This will end in tears.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Obama Prevailed In 2012

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE CENTER HOLDS Obama and His Enemies
By Jonathan Alter Illustrated. 428 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
Jonathan Alter's revealing 2010 book, ''The Promise,'' provided a detailed look at President Obama's first year in office, tracing his decision-making process on issues like health care reform and the Afghanistan war. Mr. Alter's highly informed, energetically reported but often tiresomely familiar new book, ''The Center Holds: Obama and His Enemies,'' is less a sequel than a chronicle of the president's fight to win re-election and his continuing battles with an obstructionist Republican party.
Mr. Alter does not offer a real assessment of Mr. Obama's handling of important second-term issues like immigration reform and gun control. And while the book mentions in passing the debate surrounding the attacks on the United States Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, it went to press too early to grapple with the two other controversies swirling around the White House: that is, revelations that the Internal Revenue Service singled out conservative groups for special scrutiny and that the Justice Department had seized the phone records of journalists at The Associated Press. 
Indeed, the problems with ''The Center Holds'' -- which draws upon interviews with more than 200 people -- underscore the difficulties faced by even the most astute reporters writing what the author calls ''contemporary history.'' Especially at a time when there is wall-to-wall, 24/7 news coverage online and on TV, and when one narrative -- concerning, say, Mr. Obama's resounding victory in last fall's election -- can so quickly give way to another one of gridlock and dysfunction.
Read today, much of the material here feels like reheated news. Once again, we hear about the ''clown car'' antics that dominated the Republican primary process as candidates like Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum and Rick Perry vied to become their party's front-runner. Once again, we hear about disarray within the Mitt Romney campaign and its failure to blunt his image as a wealthy businessman out of touch with everyday middle-class concerns. And once again, we hear about the rise of the Tea Party and the president's clashes with Republicans in Congress over the budget, the debt ceiling and sequestration.
What this book does do is provide context for the Obama White House's current woes. Mr. Alter gives us a lucid picture of the toxic, highly partisan political environment in which today's controversies are occurring. It is an environment in which anti-government conservatives have faced off against the administration over health care reform, taxes and a host of other issues, and in which Mr. Obama's adversaries (ranging from the Republican leadership opposed to his legislative agenda to right-wing groups like the birthers, who suffer from what Mr. Alter calls ''Obama Derangement Syndrome'') have demonstrated an eagerness to block the president any way they can.
This book also provides a close analysis of what Mr. Alter sees as the administration's missteps, focused around the author's conviction that the president's ''detached and self-contained nature had hampered his presidency.'' Mr. Alter contends that what he calls Mr. Obama's lack of ''the schmooze gene'' (''standard equipment for people in politics'') and his reticence in cultivating relationships with members of Congress and other politicians left him with ''one less way to leverage his authority.''
Many of Mr. Alter's observations echo complaints frequently heard within the Beltway. He argues that the Obama White House has been too insular, that it has often done a poor job of selling its agenda (say, on health care) and that the president has frequently been slow to go on offense: he ''developed a habit of letting the dialogue deteriorate until he rode to the rescue like a one-man cavalry, solving all the problems with a big speech, large chunks of which he wrote himself at the last minute.''
One of Mr. Obama's first big financial supporters said he thought the president, in Mr. Alter's words, ''had been humbled by the opposition's intransigence'': ''he had never failed to bring anyone around before, and it changed him.''
In Mr. Alter's view, the president's lack of experience in negotiations hobbled his efforts to cut deals with Republicans, much the way his paucity of earlier political experience ''hampered him on management questions.'' ''Relations with Cabinet-level departments were so tangled that it was often hard to get decisions made,'' Mr. Alter writes. ''While centralizing the national security apparatus at the White House worked well enough (unless you happened to work at the State Department), domestic agencies had to deal with several competing power sources inside the White House that each got to say, 'It's the White House calling.' ''
Mr. Alter's thesis is that the 2012 election was possibly ''the most consequential'' in recent times and ''a hinge of history'' -- ''a titanic ideological struggle'' that put the ''social contract established during the New Deal era'' on the line. He readily acknowledges that he thinks the United States ''dodged a bullet in 2012,'' and that in re-electing Barack Obama and rejecting the Republicans' ''extremist'' views, America reaffirmed its identity as an essentially ''centrist nation.''
Toward the end of this volume, Mr. Alter quotes Mr. Obama telling an aide that if he lost, his presidency would be ''a footnote'' and that ''all of the progress we made in the first four years would be reversed''; if he won, his first-term achievements would be cemented for a generation and he could move ahead on promises sidetracked by the recession.
Whereas there had ''famously been 'two Clintons,' the brilliant policy analyst'' and ''the volcanic and self-pitying victim of his own appetites,'' Mr. Alter says, President Obama was ''pretty much the same calm and self-contained guy inside the bubble as he was in public.'' With one exception, Mr. Alter adds: ''the intense racial consciousness that he had nurtured in his own mind since childhood was more apparent in private. He knew that if he crossed a certain line in reacting to criticism, he would hand his enemies a weapon: '' 'See, he's like all the rest of them.' It was better for him to be perceived as 'different,' with all the challenges that brought.'' This ''stifling of himself,'' this ''inability to swing at certain pitches,'' made him, according to one aide, about ''5 percent more aloof than he had been before coming to the presidency.''
A similar sort of dynamic, in Mr. Alter's opinion, helps explain the president's dismal first debate, which jeopardized his re-election: ''Obama didn't trust himself to tangle with Romney. He thought Romney was a liar and an empty suit and would reverse everything worthy he had done as president,'' and he had ''long worried that his attitude would spill out. Suppressing that was part of what threw him off his game'' in that Denver debate.
Such observations help propel the well-worn narrative of the presidential campaign forward, and Mr. Alter scatters some worthwhile nuggets of information along the way.
He reports that Bill Clinton had for many months thought Mr. Romney would win (''the Obama-Christie moment during Hurricane Sandy,'' Mr. Alter says, changed the former president's mind). And he provides some interesting observations on Republican-backed efforts to implement election ''reform'' around the country (like requiring state-issued photo ID's and cutting back on early in-person voting) that would hold down ''turnout among young people and minorities, who tended to vote Democratic.'' Those efforts failed, says Mr. Alter, instead creating a backlash against Republicans as a wave of black voters headed to the polls in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and Florida, angry at attempts to suppress their votes.
Over all, however, the long passages in this book recounting the 2012 presidential campaign feel like tired television reruns of a not-too-popular show. The only sections that substantially add to our understanding of the campaign are those chronicling, in minute detail, the Obama team's creation of a sophisticated operation for reaching out to potential supporters and getting out the vote -- an operation that combined impressive ground troops with the digital analysis of huge amounts of data.
This big data helped the campaign figure out what worked and what didn't (for a while, e-mails with yellow backgrounds ''generated 10 to 20 percent'' more responses than those with white backgrounds) and assess the ever-shifting metrics of the contest. Some 4,000 to 9,000 phone calls a night were placed to voters in battleground states, Mr. Alter says, providing ''the campaign high command'' with ''a 360-degree view of the state of the race.'' Facebook was used for ''supporter mobilization'' and cable television data was employed to help micro-target ad buys. A mobile app, ''Quick Donate,'' Mr. Alter reports, ''raised an extra $75 million by letting supporters give money with one click instead of filling out a form.''
This state-of-the-art campaign machine would help insure that Mr. Obama won a second term. After the election, Mr. Alter says, the Obama for America campaign was reincarnated as a group called Organizing for Action. With more than 20 million e-mail addresses in its database, Organizing for Action ''would try to make the 2012 Chicago machine a permanent force in American politics, applying money, analytics, door-knocking, and the rest of the magic formula to advancing the president's agenda.''

HEADLINE: Fighting the Image of the 'Burning' Borough

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The Bronx has been trying to remove the scorch marks from its name since the 1970s, when arson fires, rampant crime and poverty pushed residents out in droves; made the borough a national symbol of urban decay; and saddled it with the apocalyptic phrase, ''the Bronx is burning.''
So the borough's boosters were aghast last month that in the midst of Bronx Week, a celebration of food, culture and history that concludes with a black-tie gala, a bus company from Manhattan was rolling through its streets giving European tourists a taste of what it called ''the real Bronx.'' That meant a housing project, a food pantry, and a once-sketchy park on what the tour said was a ride through a genuine New York City ghetto.
Bronx leaders rushed to condemn the tour, with Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. and City Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito writing in a letter to the company that they were ''sickened by the despicable way in which you portray the great borough of the Bronx to tourists.'' 
The outcry, which ended with the company's canceling its tours, highlighted the Bronx's continuing struggle to remake its reputation. Even today, a Bronx leader in charge of economic development said she had to beg Bronx officials not to mention ''the Bronx'' and ''burning'' in the same sentence. And though crime has dropped, suburban-style ranch houses have risen from rubble, and hundreds of new stores including a Macy's and a Target are opening in the borough, the first question that many prospective companies ask is whether it is safe to do business in the Bronx.
At a time when New York enjoys a particularly gilded reputation, its poorest borough still lags behind the rest of the city in many indicators, including crime, poverty and unemployment. But it has also made so much progress that it now offers amenities like high-end hotels, local craft breweries, green buildings, and soon a Donald Trump-branded golf course.
''We're not trying to rewrite history,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''We know where we came from. We lived it. What we're saying is, 'Give us credit, man.' ''
The Bronx's image problem exposes the inherent tension for a place that seeks to establish itself as a viable alternative to the other boroughs even as it takes pride in its rough past and often casts itself as a working-class refuge from the excesses of Manhattan. Many of the same Bronx leaders and community activists who emphasize progress have often pointed out when lobbying for money from government and corporations that the South Bronx is home to the poorest congressional district in the nation.
''A lot of rebuilding that took place in the Bronx took place because we were able to make the point the need was there more than in other places,'' said Representative Jose E. Serrano, who represents the South Bronx. Still, Mr. Serrano said that he no longer liked to draw that distinction because he would rather talk about the accomplishments since then.
The city's northern borough once drew well-to-do families with its abundance of parkland and stately Art Deco apartment buildings. But poverty and crime later settled in, and those who could fled to the suburbs, leaving behind a disproportionately poor and minority population. By 1977, the borough was so ravaged by misfortune that President Jimmy Carter came to walk amid the ruins of Charlotte Street in the South Bronx. Three years later, his challenger, Ronald Reagan, returned to the very same spot to make the case that it was as bad as ever.
It is that image of the old Bronx, popularized in the movie ''Fort Apache, the Bronx'' and skewered by the author Tom Wolfe in ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' that residents have long chafed against. In 2007, there was a surge of outrage when news spread about a German Army training video in which a soldier was told to imagine himself in the Bronx confronting hostile African-Americans as he fired his machine gun.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president from 1987 to 2001, recalled that even George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, one of the borough's most beloved institutions, routinely used to trash the Bronx as a place where cars were broken into and nobody wanted to be. At one point, some well-intentioned community leaders suggested renaming the South Bronx as ''Downtown Bronx'' to give it a fresh start. ''The insults were slung not only from foreign shores, but more homegrown sources,'' Mr. Ferrer said.
Dominique Isbecque, a Manhattan image consultant, said that the Bronx was struggling with a problem well known in her business: a bad first impression. The general rule of thumb, she said, is that it takes ''17 redos'' to change a bad impression, and even then there is no guarantee of success. ''I hear of crime,'' she said of the Bronx. ''I hear of traffic accidents, and I hear that I'm not sure I want to go there at night -- and I don't hear that about Brooklyn.''
Such perceptions of the Bronx drove Alec Diacou, a former banker, to start a nonprofit group, Yes the Bronx, that is proposing to build a $50 million, 176-foot observation tower as a new focal point for the borough. ''It's so the people who are racing through the Bronx and don't want to know the Bronx are forced to stop and ask, 'Why is this world-class structure here?' '' he said.
Bronx officials have also stepped up efforts to re-brand their borough. A tourism magazine will be relaunched this summer with a feature called ''What I love about the Bronx.'' And a new Bronx tourism Web site, ilovethebronx.com, lists a dozen approved tours of the Bronx so far, including a free trolley ride to City Island that attracts hundreds of tourists every month.
The Bronx name already carries weight in some unexpected places. In the Kansas City area, for instance, a chain of four restaurants named d'Bronx deliver New York-style sandwiches and pizza.
The singer Ashlee Simpson has a young son named Bronx, and a hard-core punk band from Los Angeles also chose that name before ever stepping foot in the Bronx proper (the members have visited since). ''It's got a tough vibe to it,'' explained Matt Caughthran, 34, a band member. ''It always struck me as a place where you have to be street-smart, and that's where we were coming from.''
Andrew Meyers, the director of a program on the Bronx experience at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the borough, said that half of his incoming students now associated the Bronx with the zoo or Yankee Stadium rather than the ''Fort Apache'' movie. ''These kids were born in the late 1990s,'' he said. ''I think the stigmas that we grew up with are on the way out.''
But if history is an indication, the Bronx will always have one more slight to endure. Long before there were burning buildings, there were naysayers like the poet Ogden Nash, who penned a couplet in 1931 that rankled Bronx leaders: ''The Bronx? No Thonx.''
But Mr. Nash had a change of heart in later years, and at the request of the dean of the faculty at Bronx Community College, offered a poem as an apology of sorts during the borough's golden jubilee celebration in 1964.
''I can't seem to escape the sins of my smart-alec youth,'' Mr. Nash wrote. ''Here are my amends. I wrote those lines, 'The Bronx? No thonx'; I shudder to confess them. Now I'm an older, wiser man I cry, 'the Bronx? God bless them!' ''

HEADLINE: China Is Reaping Biggest Benefits of Iraq Oil Boom

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Tim Arango reported from Baghdad, and Clifford Krauss reported from Houston.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Since the American-led invasion of 2003, Iraq has become one of the world's top oil producers, and China is now its biggest customer.
China already buys nearly half the oil that Iraq produces, nearly 1.5 million barrels a day, and is angling for an even bigger share, bidding for a stake now owned by Exxon Mobil in one of Iraq's largest oil fields.
''The Chinese are the biggest beneficiary of this post-Saddam oil boom in Iraq,'' said Denise Natali, a Middle East expert at the National Defense University in Washington. ''They need energy, and they want to get into the market.''
Before the invasion, Iraq's oil industry was sputtering, largely walled off from world markets by international sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein, so his overthrow always carried the promise of renewed access to the country's immense reserves. Chinese state-owned companies seized the opportunity, pouring more than $2 billion a year and hundreds of workers into Iraq, and just as important, showing a willingness to play by the new Iraqi government's rules and to accept lower profits to win contracts. 
''We lost out,'' said Michael Makovsky, a former Defense Department official in the Bush administration who worked on Iraq oil policy. ''The Chinese had nothing to do with the war, but from an economic standpoint they are benefiting from it, and our Fifth Fleet and air forces are helping to assure their supply.''
The depth of China's commitment here is evident in details large and small.
In the desert near the Iranian border, China recently built its own airport to ferry workers to Iraq's southern oil fields, and there are plans to begin direct flights from Beijing and Shanghai to Baghdad soon. In fancy hotels in the port city of Basra, Chinese executives impress their hosts not just by speaking Arabic, but Iraqi-accented Arabic.
Notably, what the Chinese are not doing is complaining. Unlike the executives of Western oil giants like Exxon Mobil, the Chinese happily accept the strict terms of Iraq's oil contracts, which yield only minimal profits. China is more interested in energy to fuel its economy than profits to enrich its oil giants.
Chinese companies do not have to answer to shareholders, pay dividends or even generate profits. They are tools of Beijing's foreign policy of securing a supply of energy for its increasingly prosperous and energy hungry population. ''We don't have any problems with them,'' said Abdul Mahdi al-Meedi, an Iraqi Oil Ministry official who handles contracts with foreign oil companies. ''They are very cooperative. There's a big difference, the Chinese companies are state companies, while Exxon or BP or Shell are different.''
China is now making aggressive moves to expand its role, as Iraq is increasingly at odds with oil companies that have cut separate deals with Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region. The Kurds offer more generous terms than the central government, but Iraq and the United States consider such deals illegal.
Late last year, the China National Petroleum Corporation bid for a 60 percent stake in the lucrative West Qurna I oil field, a stake that Exxon Mobil may be forced to divest because of its oil interests in Iraqi Kurdistan. Exxon Mobil, however, has so far resisted pressure to sell, and in March the Chinese company said it would be interested in forming a partnership with the American company for the oil field.
If the United States invasion and occupation of Iraq ended up benefiting China, American energy experts say the unforeseen turn of events is not necessarily bad for United States interests. The increased Iraqi production, much of it pumped by Chinese workers, has also shielded the world economy from a spike in oil prices resulting from Western sanctions on Iranian oil exports. And with the boom in American domestic oil production in new shale fields surpassing all expectations over the last four years, dependence on Middle Eastern oil has declined, making access to the Iraqi fields less vital for the United States.
At the same time, China's interest in Iraq could also help stabilize the country as it faces a growing sectarian conflict.
''Our interest is the oil gets produced and Iraq makes money, so this is a big plus,'' said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department coordinator for international energy affairs in the first Obama administration. ''Geopolitically it develops close links between China and Iraq, although China did not get into it for the politics. Now that they are there, they have a great stake in assuring the continuity of the regime that facilitates their investment.''
For China, Iraq is one of several countries it increasingly relies on to keep its growing economy running. China recently became the world's biggest oil importer, and with its consumption growing, it is investing heavily in oil and gas fields around the world -- $12 billion worth in 2011, according to the United States Energy Department. Over 50 percent of its oil imports come from the Middle East, even as imports from Iran have been reduced in recent years. ''It's pretty simple,'' said Kevin Jianjun Tu, an expert on Chinese energy policies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''China needs more energy and needs to diversify its sources.''
The Iraqi government needs the investment, and oil remains at the heart of its political and economic future. Currently OPEC's second largest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, the Iraqi government depends on oil revenues to finance its military and social programs. Iraq estimates that its oil fields, pipelines and refineries need $30 billion in annual investments to reach production targets that will make it one of the world's premier energy powers for decades to come.
The revenue that investment would produce could either help pave over tensions between Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis, or worsen those tensions as competing camps fight over the spoils.
But the kind of investment that is necessary has required contracting the services of foreign oil companies that are not always enthusiastic about Iraq's nationalistic, tightfisted terms or the unstable security situation that can put employees in danger. Some like Statoil of Norway have left or curtailed their operations.
But the Chinese, frequently as partners with other European companies like BP and Turkish Petroleum, have filled the vacuum. And they have been happy to focus on oil without interfering in other local issues. ''The Chinese are very simple people,'' said an Iraqi Oil Ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to speak to the news media. ''They are practical people. They don't have anything to do with politics or religion. They just work and eat and sleep.''
International energy experts said the Chinese had a competitive advantage over Western oil companies working in Iraq. They noted that the Chinese, unlike many Western oil companies, are willing to accept service contracts at a very low per barrel oil fee without the promise of rights to future reserves. While private oil companies need to list oil reserves on their books to satisfy investors demanding growth, the Chinese do not have to answer to shareholders.
The Chinese companies and their workers also win high marks for their technical expertise, as long as they are not working in complicated oil fields, like those in deep waters. ''They offer a lot of capital and a willingness to get in quickly and with a high appetite for risk,'' said Badhr Jafar, president of Crescent Petroleum, an independent oil and gas company based in the United Arab Emirates and a big gas producer in Iraq. He said the Chinese were vital to Iraq's efforts to expand oil production, adding, ''They don't have to go through hoops to get people on the ground and working.''

HEADLINE: As Congress Returns, Legislation And Controversies Compete

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers will return to the Capitol on Monday from a weeklong recess, facing a critical juncture on immigration legislation and controversies at the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department that will test Congress's ability to balance its twin responsibilities of legislating and investigating.
For President Obama, how those competing priorities balance out could mean the difference between securing a landmark accomplishment -- the first overhaul of the nation's immigration laws since 1986 -- or becoming consumed by charges of scandal.
Invigorated by the uproars, House Republicans are setting their sights more firmly this week on the I.R.S. and Mr. Obama's embattled attorney general. After weeks of trying to leaven the House's growing investigatory zeal with serious legislating, House leaders and committee chairmen appear to be giving themselves over to an expanding and aggressive oversight effort -- on the I.R.S., the Justice Department's targeting of reporters, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.'s statements to Congress on that targeting and the Sept. 11 attack on the United States Mission in Benghazi, Libya. 
House leaders including Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio have acknowledged the risk if voters see the investigations as driven primarily by politics. But with the legislative season moving toward the routine task of passing spending bills, oversight appears to be the biggest splash that the House hopes to make.
The Senate, by contrast, plans to bring a sweeping immigration bill to the floor next Monday, with the goal of passage by July 4. The bill's bipartisan advocates express increasing confidence that they will have more than the 60 votes they will need.
''These so-called scandals have not diverted us one iota,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''
The White House plans to keep the president in the public eye, concentrating on kitchen-table issues like the economy and the carrying out of Mr. Obama's health care law as well as on high-profile foreign-policy efforts. The hope, officials say, is to prevent Congress from seizing a public agenda that has largely been set by Mr. Obama this year.
Republican investigators over the weekend rolled out what they called more evidence of I.R.S. mismanagement, including new transcripts of interviews with unidentified lower-level employees suggesting that officials in Washington pushed to give conservative groups that were applying for tax-exempt status special scrutiny. A soon-to-be-released report by the Treasury Department's inspector general will also take the I.R.S. to task for spending tens of millions of dollars on conferences over two years.
The reserved statements from lawmakers who over the past weeks withheld at least some judgment on the expanding probes seemed to give way Sunday to a much more accusatorial posture. Republicans pointed to new evidence that they said would extend the cloud of scandal into higher echelons of the Obama administration.
''As the last few weeks have demonstrated, Congressional oversight is not only a constitutional duty, but also a vitally important check and balance to the Obama administration,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, wrote in a memo to members. He added: ''During June and the coming months, the House will continue to hold the administration accountable.''
Hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday will open new fronts against the I.R.S. After allowing conservative groups to sound off about being targeted by the agency, the committees will examine its spending on conferences and entertainment between 2010 and 2012.
During that span, the I.R.S. held at least 220 conferences, at a cost of $50 million, according to the audit by the Treasury inspector general, portions of which the oversight committee released.
The committee's chairman, Representative Darrell Issa of California, let loose a volley of accusations on Sunday that seemed to end a brief period of restraint for him. He said Washington officials had known of the flagging of applicants for tax-exempt status but had covered it up during the presidential election and allowed groups that were ''not a friend of the president to be disenfranchised through an election.''
''My gut tells me that too many people knew that this wrongdoing was going on before the election,'' he said Sunday on the CNN program ''State of the Union.''
On the same program, he accused Mr. Holder of lying to Congress under oath when he told the House Judiciary Committee last month that the ''potential prosecution of the press'' for disclosing classified material was ''not something that I've ever been involved in or heard of.'' Mr. Holder testified amid reports of the seizure of telephone records from The Associated Press.
Mr. Issa said ''perjury is a criminal charge that has to be proven, but certainly it's hard to have confidence in what this attorney general says or his people say when so often it turns out not to be true.''
He also called the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, the administration's ''paid liar.''
The Republican broadsides went beyond Mr. Issa to voices that had been more measured in the past.
''I think the attorney general has to ask himself the question: Is he really able to effectively serve the president of the United States and the American people under the present circumstances?'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on the CBS program ''Face the Nation. ''That's a decision he'd have to make.''
Mr. Issa ratcheted up the pressure over the weekend with the selective release of excerpts from continuing committee interviews with I.R.S. employees in Cincinnati involved in the added scrutiny of Tea Party groups and other conservative associations.
In one excerpt, an employee said I.R.S. officials in Washington as far back as March 2010 had ordered up the screening of tax-exemption applications for references to ''Tea Party'' and other conservative keywords. By April that year, the employee had forwarded 7 of around 40 screened cases to Washington.
Another employee told committee investigators of seeking another job in July 2010 because of ''micromanagement'' from Washington.
''It was the whole Tea Party. It was the whole picture,'' the employee said, according to the excerpt. ''I mean it was the micromanagement, the fact that the subject area was extremely sensitive, and it was something that I didn't want to be associated with.''
None of that constituted evidence of wrongdoing at the White House, but Republicans suggested on Sunday that such evidence would emerge in due time.
''This pattern of deception, administration-wide, is starting to become concerning,'' Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, said on ''Meet the Press.'' ''You know, when you look at the I.R.S., and you look at the Benghazi issue, and you look at the A.P. issue, I think the trouble here isn't even the individual specific scandals. It's this broader notion that there's a pattern of this activity.''
The White House plans to focus on its own agenda as much as possible rather than let Congress command attention. On Monday, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will host a national conference on mental health at the White House, bringing together advocates, care providers, educators and others. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama will host President Sebastián Piñera of Chile at the White House.
The president will travel to Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday to talk about middle-class jobs and then fly to California for a summit meeting Friday with President Xi Jinping of China at Sunnylands, the Walter and Leonore Annenberg estate in the Palm Springs area. It will be their first meeting since Mr. Xi's ascension, with issues like economics, North Korea and cybersecurity on the agenda.

1913 London's View of 'Frisco' Situation
LONDON -- American bankers in London, who have hitherto been reticent on the situation created by the receivership of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad, were more inclined yesterday [June 2] to discuss the matter. Their views were varied, but the tendency was to take a moderate view of the difficulty. One said that the incident might exercise a disturbing influence, as the European investor in American bonds does not quite understand the meaning of a receivership. The European investor attributes to it a graver sense than is customary in America. ''Anyone who is hunting about for a 7 per cent. [SIC] rate of interest is taking a risk and knows it,'' said one investor. The English investing public is well able to discriminate between one bond and another. It is generally observed that the railroad's earnings are ample to cover its fixed charges. 
1938 Dollar's Stability Aiding Exports
WASHINGTON -- Rumors of a further devaluation of the dollar, or a change in the price of gold, were scouted today [June 2] by Henry Morgenthau jr., Secretary of the Treasury, who pointed out that American exporters are already in an ''advantageous position'' and the nation's foreign trade has continued to flourish while domestic business is in the doldrums. Secretary Morgenthau stressed that exports are exceeding imports by $100,000,000 monthly. At the same time, he revealed unofficially that the stabilization fund operated at a profit throughout 1937, and is ahead so far this year. The statement of the Secretary of the Treasury allayed worry over the possibility of the dollar being devalued anew in order to line up with the recent depreciation of foreign currencies. On Wall Street, the dollar hardened slightly today in relation both to the pound and the franc.
1963 City Gives In to Civil Rights Demands
JACKSON, Miss. -- The City of Jackson has given into three of the four major demands made by its Negro citizens in their fight for civil rights, it was announced yesterday [June 1]. The announcement by Mayor Allen Thompson and the City Commission came less than half an hour after Roy T. Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was arrested here for picketing. Mr. Wilkins and two other Negroes -- a state NAACP official and a Jackson woman -- were accused of interfering with trade and released under $1,000 bond. Mayor Thompson and the commission said the city has agreed to hire Negro policemen to patrol Negro sections and Negro school-crossing guards for Negro schools and to upgrade Negroes on the city's payroll. The mayor turned down the fourth demand, that a biracial committee be formed.

HEADLINE: France Appears Poised to Soften a Law Aimed at Deterring Internet Piracy

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
SERRAVAL, France -- A French experiment in cracking down on digital media piracy by threatening to kick copyright cheats offline is about to end -- without solving the problem.
In 2009, French lawmakers, aiming to curb unauthorized file-sharing and to slow the erosion of media industry revenue, approved what was billed as the toughest anti-piracy law in the world. Repeat offenders who ignored two warnings to quit downloading movies or music illegally were confronted with the prospect of a suspension of their Internet connection. The system was emulated in several other countries, including the United States, though generally with softer penalties.
But now the government of President François Hollande appears poised to shut down the agency that was created to enforce the law, imposed under Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, and to defang the measure of much of its menace. 
Fleur Pellerin, the French minister in charge of Internet policy, said during a recent visit to a high-technology complex in Sweden that suspending Internet connections was incompatible with the French government's hopes of spurring growth in the digital economy.
''Today, it's not possible to cut off Internet access,'' she said. ''It's something like cutting off water.''
A report on digital policy that was prepared for the government by Pierre Lescure, the former president of the pay-television company Canal Plus, in April recommended dropping the threat of disconnections and replacing it with a fine of &#x20ac;60, or $78, for repeat offenders. The report also recommended disbanding the enforcement agency, known by its French acronym, Hadopi, and subsuming some of its functions in the French media regulator, Conseil supérieur de l' audiovisuel.
While government ministers have voiced support for Mr. Lescure's recommendations, some lawmakers, including Patrick Bloche, an influential Socialist deputy, have suggested that the administration should go further and simply scrap the entire system of warnings and potential penalties.
Despite all the debate that the system has prompted, in and outside France, evidence of its effects remains skimpy. A study by researchers at Wellesley College near Boston and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh that was published last year showed that the threat of disconnection was directing more French Internet users toward Apple's iTunes store, a licensed source of digital music. Separate studies, commissioned by Hadopi, have shown a decline in illegal file sharing.
Yet the French music business remains deeply troubled. SNEP, a French recording company group, said Friday that industry revenue fell by 6.7 percent in the first quarter of the year. More alarmingly, revenue from digital outlets fell by 5.2 percent -- the first quarterly decline -- though the organization said several special factors played a role in this.
Meanwhile, SNEP said the number of visits to illegal music sites by French Internet users had risen by 7 percent between January 2010 and January 2013, to 10.7 million.
Guillaume Leblanc, director general of SNEP, said the group was willing to accept dropping the threat of disconnection, as long as the warning system was preserved, but said the proposed &#x20ac;60 fine was too low.
''Maintaining graduated response is essential for the music industry,'' he said. ''For the legal offer to keep developing, it's important to have strong copyright protection on the Internet.''
While Hadopi has sent out hundreds of thousands of warnings to those suspected of being pirates, only a handful of cases have reached the third and supposedly final stage. Several of these were thrown out by the courts; others resulted in fines or suspended sentences.
''If you cannot chop off a few heads as an example, then the chopping machine inspires less fear,'' said Jérémie Zimmermann, spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a group that has campaigned against the law.
Supporters of the law say cutting off large numbers of Internet connections was never the point.
''From our standpoint this was always meant to be an educational and deterrent measure,'' said Frances Moore, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group.
The Lescure report recommends that the downgraded penalty -- a fine rather than disconnection -- be accompanied by greater certainty that it would be applied, through the adoption of an administrative court procedure, like the one used for minor traffic violations.
A downgrade of the French system would leave South Korea, which also imposed a similar system in 2009, as the country with perhaps the toughest anti-piracy measures in place. More than 400 Internet accounts or Web sites have been suspended in South Korea since the law went into effect.
Recording industry revenue in South Korea rose by 26 percent from 2008 through 2012, a period in which sales worldwide fell by 14 percent, according to the international recording industry federation.
Whether the law is responsible for the gains is debatable; the surge has coincided with the K-Pop phenomenon, in which South Korean acts like Psy and his ''Gangnam Style'' have taken the world by storm.
The law is unpopular with free-speech groups, which are campaigning for a repeal.
In March, the Korean National Human Rights Commission recommended that the measure should be reviewed to determine whether it clashes with constitutional protections.
Elsewhere, countries that have adopted systems involving warnings and penalties, also known as graduated response, have tended to opt for less draconian measures than France or South Korea, sometimes involving private-sector deals rather than legislation.
In the United States, for example, five major Internet providers recently agreed to put in place a so-called copyright alert system, negotiated with the entertainment industry. Sanctions, which can include a temporary slowdown in Internet access speed, do not kick in until an account holder ignores at least five warnings.
Analysts say that the backtracking by the French could lessen legislators' enthusiasm for graduated response systems in other countries, at least if they involve the threat of disconnection.
''Looking at this politically, if one of the few countries where they were able to get the political support to pass this -- if they get rid of it, it could make it harder to do graduated response elsewhere,'' said Brett Danaher, a professor at Wellesley College who worked on the study examining the effects of Hadopi on iTunes sales.
He and others said the entertainment industry and policy makers might now turn more of its attention to efforts to block Web sites that host content that infringes on copyright, rather than going after individual Internet users.
Ms. Moore said neither strategy would provide an easy solution.
''We have to take a holistic approach,'' she said. ''Web site blocking and alert systems are just two tools.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Digital Commissioner Getting Down to Brass Tacks

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- For most of her tenure as European commissioner for digital policies, Neelie Kroes has been a stark contrast to her predecessor, the former journalist Vivian Reding, who delivered the European Union's retail price caps on mobile roaming fees. Ms. Reding, a Luxembourg native, was never averse to using all the levers at her disposal when appeals for compromise -- whether on price caps or lawsuits against E.U. countries -- went unheeded.
Ms. Kroes, a Dutch economist, sought a more cooperative relationship with Europe's telecommunications industry. After taking over as commissioner for the digital agenda in 2010, she formed a panel of the chief executives of Europe's largest operators -- France Télécom, Telefónica, Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia and Vodafone -- who have advised her on issues like investment returns on networks and barriers to cross-border mergers. 
But during the past week, with European Parliament elections less than a year away and time winding down to make big changes to the telecommunications sector during this legislative period, Ms. Kroes showed that there were limits to her inclination for compromise.
In a bluntly worded speech Thursday to a key committee in Parliament, she surprised lawmakers by urging them to ban mobile roaming fees outright before elections next May.
The fees are a scourge for border-crossing Europeans and make up about 5 percent of a typical operator's annual revenue. Ms. Kroes's proposal was cheered by lawmakers, well aware that the roaming caps first enacted in 2007 remain one of the most popular recent achievements of the European Parliament, whose members often tend to labor in the shadows of more prominent peers in national legislatures.
Malcolm Harbour, the chairman of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, a group considered the gatekeeper to any meaningful overhaul of the telecommunications industry, said Ms. Kroes had made a shrewd bid for parliamentary support. ''She was basically saying that if we pass a ban on roaming fees, we can use this in re-election campaigns,'' Mr. Harbour, a former automotive engineer from the West Midlands in England, said in an interview.
Deutsche Telekom, the German operator, criticized her proposal as costly at a time when the same commission was urging operators to bolster Europe's broadband infrastructure to catch up with those of the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Vodafone saw in the plan a frustrating change of course, noting that last year Ms. Kroes helped extend roaming fees through 2017 and ordered operators to sell roaming services separately by July 2014.
Ms. Kroes, a wily political veteran, no doubt knew her plan would provoke the ire of her erstwhile business allies. But it may bring a recalcitrant industry to the bargaining table, with a new willingness to give up a significant source of income in return for investment incentives that could give Europe a fast, cutting-edge broadband grid.
Time is not an ally. But Ms. Kroes's predecessor, Ms. Reding, needed only seven months in 2006 and 2007 to shepherd through the first roaming price caps against fierce industry opposition. The price controls have limited but not eliminated Europe's cross-border premium on mobile data.
Today, a German consumer can view a 1-gigabyte film on Apple TV -- delivered over a landline connection -- for as little as &#x20ac;4, or $5.20. But downloading the same amount of data from a mobile carrier could cost as much as &#x20ac;800 while roaming within the 27-nation bloc, or as much as &#x20ac;13,700 from some countries outside the European Union, according to Paul Rübig, a member of the European Parliament from Wels, Austria, who sponsored the 2007 legislation on roaming.
''I support Ms. Kroes's goal, but I want to see the details,'' Mr. Rübig said during the past week in an interview. She aims to introduce a detailed proposal before a summit meeting set for October on Europe's digital future, leaving only seven months to push it through, in a last-minute legislative roll of the dice.
''That's not much time, but we did it once before,'' Mr. Rübig said.

HEADLINE: The Geezers Are All Right

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last month the Congressional Budget Office released its much-anticipated projections for debt and deficits, and there were cries of lamentation from the deficit scolds who have had so much influence on our policy discourse. The problem, you see, was that the budget office numbers looked, well, O.K.: deficits are falling fast, and the ratio of debt to gross domestic product is projected to remain roughly stable over the next decade. Obviously it would be nice, eventually, to actually reduce debt. But if you've built your career around proclamations of imminent fiscal doom, this definitely wasn't the report you wanted to see.
Still, we can always count on the baby boomers to deliver disaster, can't we? Doesn't the rising tide of retirees mean that Social Security and Medicare are doomed unless we radically change those programs now now now? 
Maybe not.
To be fair, the reports of the Social Security and Medicare trustees released Friday do suggest that America's retirement system needs some significant work. The ratio of Americans over 65 to those of working age will rise inexorably over the decades ahead, and this will translate into rising spending on Social Security and Medicare as a share of national income.
But the numbers aren't nearly as overwhelming as you might have imagined, given the usual rhetoric. And if you look under the hood, the data suggest that we can, if we choose, maintain social insurance as we know it with only modest adjustments.
Start with Social Security. The retirement program's trustees do foresee rising spending as the population ages, with total payments rising from 5.1 percent of G.D.P. now to 6.2 percent in 2035, at which point they stabilize. This means, by the way, that all the talk of Social Security going ''bankrupt'' is nonsense; even if nothing at all is done, the system will be able to pay most of its scheduled benefits as far as the eye can see.
Still, it does look as if there will eventually be a shortfall, and the usual suspects insist that we must move right now to reduce scheduled benefits. But I've never understood the logic of this demand. The risk is that we might, at some point in the future, have to cut benefits; to avoid this risk of future benefit cuts, we are supposed to act pre-emptively by...cutting future benefits. What problem, exactly, are we solving here?
What about Medicare? For years, many people -- myself included -- have warned that Medicare is a much bigger problem than Social Security, and the latest report from the program's trustees still shows spending rising from 3.6 percent of G.D.P. now to 5.6 percent in 2035. But that's a smaller rise than in previous projections. Why?
The answer is that the long-term upward trend in health care costs -- a trend that has affected private insurance as well as Medicare -- seems to have flattened out significantly over the past few years. Nobody is quite sure why, but there are indications that some of the cost-reducing measures contained in the Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare, are actually starting to ''bend the curve,'' just as they were supposed to. And because there are a number of cost-reducing measures in the law that have not yet kicked in, there's every reason to believe that this favorable trend will continue.
Furthermore, there's plenty of room for more savings, if only because recent research confirms that Americans pay far more for health procedures than citizens of other advanced countries pay; that the price premium can and should be brought down, and when it is, Medicare's financial outlook will improve further.
So what are we looking at here? The latest projections show the combined cost of Social Security and Medicare rising by a bit more than 3 percent of G.D.P. between now and 2035, and that number could easily come down with more effort on the health care front. Now, 3 percent of G.D.P. is a big number, but it's not an economy-crushing number. The United States could, for example, close that gap entirely through tax increases, with no reduction in benefits at all, and still have one of the lowest overall tax rates in the advanced world.
But haven't all the great and the good been telling us that Social Security and Medicare as we know them are unsustainable, that they must be totally revamped -- and made much less generous? Why yes, they have; they've also been telling us that we must slash spending right away or we'll face a Greek-style fiscal crisis. They were wrong about that, and they're wrong about the longer run, too.
The truth is that the long-term outlook for Social Security and Medicare, while not great, actually isn't all that bad. It's time to stop obsessing about how we'll pay benefits to retirees in 2035 and focus instead on how we're going to provide jobs to unemployed Americans in the here and now.

HEADLINE: A Billionaire Dreams of Steering Europe's Future

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- Outside the secure elevator leading to his penthouse hotel suite at Le Bristol, Nicolas Berggruen handed a visitor his key.
''I'll meet you there,'' he said as he inserted the white buds of an iPhone into his ears and bounded up five flights of lushly carpeted stairs.
When Mr. Berggruen, the billionaire founder of the private equity group Berggruen Holdings, arrived at the hotel's top floor -- just as the elevator doors opened for the visitor -- he was wrapping up a quick phone call.
''I'm sorry,'' he said, shrugging, not the least bit winded. ''I don't get much exercise.'' 
Nor, it seems, does he ever stand still.
Having amassed an estimated $2.5 billion fortune over the last two decades by buying up troubled companies and turning them around, Mr. Berggruen, 51, has been preoccupied of late in addressing what he sees as the woeful state of Western democratic institutions.
To that end, he spent more than $100 million in 2009 to establish the Berggruen Institute on Governance, packed with a global A-list of the rich and powerful. Its mission is to urge new -- and, he says, better -- forms of global governance.
Mr. Berggruen was in Paris in the past week to convene a ''town hall'' meeting of European political and business leaders to discuss the future of Europe.
In the United States, his efforts have so far focused on California -- the institute is based in Beverly Hills -- pushing (not always successfully) for tax, budget and education overhauls.
Globally, meanwhile, the institute's ''21st Century Council'' of more than three dozen business leaders and former heads of state is set up to lobby the leaders of the Group of 20 richest nations with recommendations for economic and financial market overhauls.
But it is in Europe where Mr. Berggruen and his institute have been most active recently.
As the debt crisis has ground on and recession has set in, fraying the always loosely woven fabric of European political unity, Mr. Berggruen has shuttled among capitals in his private jet, leveraging the collective influence of about two dozen prominent friends in the hope of saving Europe from itself.
His coterie includes Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor; Jacques Delors, the former president of the European Commission; and Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain.
''Europe really suffers from a structural governance problem,'' Mr. Berggruen said in an interview overlooking his sprawling hotel terrace. ''Brussels is powerless. It doesn't have the legitimate political authority -- not because they wouldn't like to, they just don't have it.''
When the debt crisis first emerged in 2009, he said, ''we felt very quickly that this was a political crisis, that the financial and economic repercussions were really just symptoms.''
Not everyone is so enamored of Mr. Berggruen's professed crusade.
Claus Leggewie, director of the Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities in Essen, Germany, wonders why wealthy financiers and power brokers should be entrusted to devise solutions to a crisis that he argues is largely of their own making.
He also rejects the notion that true reform can be forged through ''back-room politics, by a closed shop of influential ex-politicians that thinks it can solve problems from the top down.''
''That kind of policy-making is democratically problematic,'' he wrote in an e-mail, ''and in view of those in the European periphery who are affected by it, paternalistic.''
Mr. Berggruen, for his part, insists that it is by addressing some of Europe's most acute economic symptoms collectively that public faith in the European Union can be mended -- a requisite first step, he argues, toward the goal of deeper political and economic integration.
In that vein, the Berggruen Institute's gathering in the past week -- timed to coincide with the annual ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- made a convenient backdrop for prominent discussion of a multinational program to address Europe's alarmingly high youth unemployment rate.
Only the broad outlines of a European youth jobs initiative, which is still being negotiated by governments, were announced at the conference by President François Hollande of France. They included low-interest loans to small companies to encourage hiring, new job-training programs and steps to increase the geographic mobility of young people.
Initial financing would come from a pool of 6 billion euros, or nearly $8 billion, that has already been set aside by the European Investment Bank, the European Union's bursar for big development projects. Priority would be given to parts of the union where youth unemployment is above 25 percent.
The plan, which is to be formally introduced in time for a gathering of European labor ministers in July, was strongly endorsed by top European officials in attendance. Several paid tribute to Mr. Berggruen's role in getting the conversation started.
''You have paid a great service to Europe,'' Mr. Hollande said of his efforts.
In the hands of someone without Mr. Berggruen's gilded Rolodex, his mission might seem quixotic. But Mr. Berggruen, a dual citizen of the United States and Germany, is a card-carrying member of the global elite.
His father, Heinz Berggruen, was a renowned German-American art dealer and collector. Nicolas Berggruen grew up in Paris and attended the Institut Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school sometimes referred to as the ''school of kings'' for the many royals among its alumni.
He went on to study finance at New York University and then parlayed a modest trust from his father into a multibillion-dollar fortune through investments in real estate and stocks of media, technology and retail companies.
Berggruen Holdings was founded in 1984, and its biggest investments now include large stakes in Burger King and the struggling German department store chain Karstadt, which he snapped up in bankruptcy in 2010.
Until this year, when he decided it was too big a distraction from his political activities, Mr. Berggruen was host to a lavish annual Oscar week party at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, which drew celebrities from the worlds of film, fashion and finance.
In embracing his new role as a serious would-be political reformer, Mr. Berggruen seems eager to shed the image of an itinerant playboy. A bachelor for many years, he now says he would be eager for the ''challenge'' of a wife and family.
Several years ago, he sold most of his possessions -- including a Fifth Avenue apartment and a private island home near Miami -- and used the proceeds to set up a foundation based in the Virgin Islands that now finances his institute's various activities.
With no fixed address, he shuttles between five-star hotels carrying little more than a change of bespoke clothes, a phone and an iPad. The world's gossip pages have nicknamed him the ''homeless billionaire,'' a label he dismisses as an irritating distraction.
For now, he seems intent on directing media attention to his institute's European agenda, which includes drumming up popular interest in the elections for a new European Parliament scheduled for next May. Under the terms of the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, the new Parliament will, for the first time, elect the president of the European Commission, the principal leader of the union on the world stage.
So far, there are no official candidates for the European Union presidency (the current president, Herman Van Rompuy, is ineligible). Mr. Berggruen says he hopes that the contest might draw at least a few high-wattage names -- perhaps, one wonders, someone who is already programmed into his speed-dial.
''The opportunity is that these parliamentary elections will actually become something significant,'' he said. ''If people who have a certain presence present themselves to become the face of the people in Brussels, then I believe some power and legitimacy would transfer.''
In addition to a more energized Parliament and a charismatic leader, Mr. Berggruen argues that Europe needs a stronger, more centralized government that is empowered to make critical decisions -- particularly economic ones -- for the entire 27-nation bloc.
Deeper integration, of course, is a touchy subject across much of Europe these days. A Pew Research Center survey of thousands of voters in major European Union member countries published in May found deepening disillusionment with the European project as the continuing economic crisis slowly drains citizens' sense of regional solidarity.
''Look, we have a choice to federate certain things more, or we go the other way -- we break up,'' he said. ''But either way, in this environment, is going to be costly. It's not like one way is the easy way. Both are hard.''

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund, Under Fire, Braces for Withdrawals

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
The embattled hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors is bracing for investors to pull out as much as several billion dollars by a Monday deadline. Withdrawals have stepped up as a separate deadline looms for law enforcement officials investigating the firm.
Over the next several weeks, the authorities must decide whether to bring a criminal case against SAC related to suspicious trading in two drug stocks. The government has already brought charges against a former SAC employee connected to those trades, which involved the fund's billionaire founder, Steven A. Cohen. Authorities have explored new avenues on how they might bring a criminal case against the firm and possibly a civil action against Mr. Cohen, people briefed on the case said.
The escalated investigative activity has caused SAC investors to grow increasingly worried about the fund's future. Already this year, investors have pulled $1.7 billion from the $15 billion fund, or about a quarter of the outside money managed by SAC. (Mr. Cohen's fortune and employee money accounts for about $9 billion of the fund.)
Depending on the total amount of withdrawals on Monday, a scheduled quarterly deadline, SAC, which is based in Stamford, Conn., could shut its door to outside investors and manage only internal funds. 
But the ultimate fate of the fund may be determined this summer, as the government's investigation enters the final stages. Prosecutors expect four senior SAC executives who received subpoenas last month to testify before a grand jury, according to the people briefed on the case. The executives include the firm's chief compliance officer and head trader, and they are expected to field questions about trading and compliance practices, these people said.
Mr. Cohen has also received a grand jury subpoena, but he is expected to assert his constitutional right against self-incrimination rather than subject himself to unlimited questioning, the people briefed on the case said. He has already provided testimony to securities regulators in a parallel civil inquiry. Neither Mr. Cohen nor the firm has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Though SAC has been a focus of investigators since at least 2006, the firm came under heightened scrutiny in November. Prosecutors accused Mathew Martoma, a former SAC employee, of obtaining secret data about clinical trials being done by the drug companies Elan and Wyeth, and using the information both to earn trading profits and avoid losses, a total of $276 million. For the first time in the inquiry, the government said that Mr. Cohen authorized the trades. Prosecutors have not claimed that Mr. Cohen knew about the confidential information that Mr. Martoma is accused of obtaining.
Mr. Martoma is fighting the charges against him and has rejected overtures to cooperate and testify against Mr. Cohen.
Because the Elan and Wyeth trades occurred in mid-July 2008, the government is running up against a five-year deadline to bring charges related to them. Prosecutors also face an August deadline to file charges related to trading in Dell shares, a case that has resulted in two indictments of former SAC employees, one of whom pleaded guilty.
As these deadlines approach, clients are fleeing. At least three have indicated they are withdrawing money, according to people briefed on the matter. Blackstone Group, SAC's largest outside client, is expected to redeem more than half of roughly $500 million. Magnitude Capital, a New York-based firm that invests client money in hedge funds, has asked for its money, though how much is unclear.
A third investor, Ironwood Capital Management, has also put in a withdrawal request. Ironwood, a San Francisco-based fund, decided to pull its money after SAC said last month that it was no longer cooperating ''unconditionally'' with the government or providing investors with updates about the investigation.
Based on these withdrawals, SAC may decide to return money to all outside investors and become a ''family office,'' managing only Mr. Cohen's wealth.
The investor retreat comes after Mr. Cohen and his legal team thought that they had resolved most of SAC's legal problems. In March, it agreed to pay $616 million to settle two civil cases brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Elan, Wyeth and Dell trades.
But despite the record fine, the S.E.C. is still contemplating a civil action against Mr. Cohen, according to the people briefed on the case. The agency is considering a number of possible claims against him, including insider trading related to the drug-stock trades. Another option is a lawsuit accusing Mr. Cohen of failing to supervise his employees.
The S.E.C., which could assess a fine and seek to ban Mr. Cohen from the securities industry, has a lower threshold for proving its case than criminal authorities do. Prosecutors need to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, but the S.E.C. would have to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence.
The criminal authorities also continue to press their case. In recent weeks, by serving new subpoenas on SAC executives, they have made it clear that they are still trying to build evidence against the fund, and perhaps Mr. Cohen. Prosecutors often hesitate to indict companies, fearing job losses and the threat to the economy. Often they file a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, suspending charges as long as the company begins reforms. But prosecutors are not considering such an agreement with SAC, say people briefed on the investigation.
At least nine current or former SAC employees have been tied to insider trading while at the fund; four have pleaded guilty.
In late April, SAC's lawyers called a meeting to lay out their defense to possible charges, according to people briefed on the investigation. They were taken aback when 17 government officials -- prosecutors, S.E.C. lawyers, F.B.I. agents and postal inspectors -- attended the meeting at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.
Underscoring the importance of the SAC case, Richard B. Zabel, the deputy United States attorney in Manhattan, and Lorin L. Reisner, the head of the office's criminal division, helped lead the meeting and have taken an active role in the investigation. Lawyers from Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison are defending SAC.
A few weeks after the meeting, the authorities issued the grand jury subpoenas to the SAC executives, including one to Mr. Cohen. That day, the firm told investors it was no longer fully cooperating, a sign that Mr. Cohen will decline to testify. The other subpoenaed executives are Thomas Conheeney, the firm's president; Solomon Kumin, chief operating officer; Steven Kessler, chief compliance officer; and Phillipp Villhauer, head of trading.
None have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr. Cohen's lieutenants are expected to testify, but if they refuse, the government could compel testimony with a grant of immunity. One risk is that the executives could tell the grand jury they have no knowledge that Mr. Cohen ever violated securities laws.
Some government officials hold out hope that the two former SAC employees under indictment will turn against Mr. Cohen. If convicted, Mr. Martoma, 38, married with three young children, faces up to 25 years in prison. Much of the case rests on what was said during a 20-minute call between Mr. Martoma and Mr. Cohen the night before SAC began executing the trades.
Another of Mr. Cohen's former employees, Michael S. Steinberg, 41, also married with a young family, is also staring at possible prison time for his involvement in the Dell trade. The authorities sought the cooperation of Mr. Steinberg, one of SAC's longest-serving employees and a friend of Mr. Cohen. But he, too, has denied the charges.
Jon Horvath, a former SAC analyst, pleaded guilty to trading Dell shares illegally, and said he passed inside tips to Mr. Steinberg. He is expected to be the government's main witness at Mr. Steinberg's trial, set for Nov. 18. SAC is paying for the legal bills of both Mr. Martoma and Mr. Steinberg.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rare Protest In Vietnam Raises a Call To Curb China

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
HANOI, Vietnam -- An anti-China march here in the Vietnamese capital on Sunday showed the domestic pressure the government faces when dealing with Beijing's muscular approach to territorial claims in the South China Sea. 
Scuffles broke out at the rally, which was a rare show of dissent in this tightly controlled one-party state, as the police hauled some 15 ringleaders or especially vocal protesters away in buses. ''Down with the henchmen of China! Down with the traitors!'' a detainee shouted through a window of the government bus taking him away.
Some members of the ruling Communist Party fear that popular anger over China, Vietnam's ideological ally and biggest trading partner, could easily bleed into a broader protest movement against the government. The party already faces growing calls for reform because of economic malaise, corruption and the free spread of information critical of it over the Internet.
Sunday's protest, which was advertised via blogs and Facebook pages, was in the heart of Hanoi around Hoan Kiem Lake, where many residents and foreign tourists gather Sunday mornings to walk and sip coffee in cafes.
Uniformed and plainclothes security officers outnumbered the approximately 150 men, women and children at the rally, some of whom held banners calling China a ''bully.''
Officers using loudspeakers shouted for the marchers to disperse, but also said the government was determined to defend its sovereignty against China.
It was unclear whether those detained would be charged. Typically, detainees from protests like this are released after a few hours.
''The government is not doing enough -- it must do more'' against China, said Nguyen Quang A, a well-known economist who took part in the march.
Vietnam and China have long sparred over who controls the South China Sea, a dispute that also involves the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
Over the last two years, the United States' diplomatic focus on Southeast Asia and energy-hungry China's growing assertiveness in the waters has focused international attention on the issue.
Last week, Vietnam accused a Chinese vessel of ramming and damaging a Vietnamese fishing boat. China said it had done nothing wrong.
The deputies of Vietnam's Communist Party-controlled National Assembly urged the government to take stronger action to defend the country's sovereignty and protect its fishermen.
In Singapore on Sunday, Vietnam's deputy minister of national defense, Col. Gen. Nguyen Chi Vinh, said at a security conference that the region had not enjoyed stability, and he called for the protection of fishermen and the avoidance of ''the use of force against the fishermen by all means.''
Two months of weekly anti-Chinese protests in Hanoi in summer 2011 were an unprecedented show of popular anger by the Vietnamese. The police broke up anti-Beijing demonstrations in 2012, gradually using more force as it became clear the protests were becoming a source of domestic opposition to the Communist Party.

HEADLINE: In China, Ruling Raises Concern of a Chill on Foreign Investment

BYLINE: By NEIL GOUGH

 BODY:
China was booming, and Nina Wang, a Hong Kong billionaire, wanted a piece of the action.
It was 1995, and a group of investors was setting up the first nationwide joint-stock bank of the Communist era to be primarily owned by nongovernment companies.
But Ms. Wang, considered to be the richest woman in Asia and a flamboyant figure who wore her hair in pigtails well into her 60s, faced an obstacle: Foreigners were barred from holding stakes in Chinese financial institutions.
To this day, it remains a hurdle in China, where swaths of the economy can be partially or totally off limits to foreign investment, including areas like education, finance, media and technology.
To get around the problem, Ms. Wang became a pioneer in the use of regulatory loopholes to control restricted assets in China. The practice has since been refined by Chinese companies that have raised billions of dollars on stock markets in the United States and Hong Kong and by some multinational corporations with onshore business in China. 
Ms. Wang's Hong Kong company, Chinachem Financial Services, used a series of contracts to effectively gain economic control over a mainland Chinese firm, which in turn acted as a proxy to buy and hold the stake in the new bank, the China Minsheng Banking Corporation.
Chinachem soon had a falling out with the Chinese holding company over the ownership and dividends from the bank shares. The dispute ended up in mainland courts for 12 years -- until a little-noticed ruling in October by the Supreme People's Court, the top judicial body in China.
In what appears to be the first time that high-ranking Chinese authorities have weighed in on the issue of foreign control agreements, the court ruled that the contracts Ms. Wang had signed were invalid. The court said the shares in the bank -- by then worth about $700 million, compared with Ms. Wang's original investment of $11 million -- belonged to the Chinese holding company.
Moreover, the court, in a 16-page judgment, ruled the contractual agreements between the Hong Kong and mainland companies had clearly been intended to circumvent China's restrictions on foreign investment, and amounted to ''concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form.''
The ruling was the latest indication that Beijing's long-assumed tolerance of overseas capital finding its way into the economy's restricted sectors might be waning, a development that could have far-reaching implications for investors and the companies they support.
''This case shows that contracts used to get around China's foreign investment restrictions can be struck down by the courts,'' said Paul W. Boltz Jr., a partner at the law firm Ropes & Gray in Hong Kong. Until then, many analysts had come to regard the general absence of an official response as a sign of tacit approval -- an acknowledgment that such investment could help build corporate champions and create jobs.
''While this situation is fundamentally different'' than how such contracts are now drafted and put in place, Mr. Boltz said, the ruling ''does raise the possibility that a Chinese court could take a similar position on other contracts.''
The loopholes used by foreign investors in China, and by Chinese companies seeking to list on overseas stock markets, have become more sophisticated since Ms. Wang made her play for the stake in Minsheng bank.
Beginning in 2000, when Nasdaq listed the Internet company Sina.com, most Chinese companies in restricted sectors have relied on complex investment vehicles known as variable interest entities, or V.I.E., as a way to sell shares to foreigners and get around China's laws on outside investment.
About half of the more than 200 Chinese companies listed on the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges rely on the investment vehicles to control onshore assets in China, according to research by Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, and Fredrik Öqvist, an independent financial analyst.
The structure has also been used in Hong Kong listings, like that of Tencent Holdings, China's biggest publicly traded Internet company, with a market value of more than $70 billion.
While variable interest entities in such cases are technically owned by the Chinese, foreign-owned corporations maintain de facto control through a series of contracts that can involve equity pledges, profit assignments, purchase options and service or consulting agreements.
The complexity of the agreements, and the fact that they have not often been tested in court, has created prominent challenges for foreign investors.
In 2011, Yahoo shareholders were caught by surprise when the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, in which Yahoo held a 40 percent stake, announced that it had transferred the assets of its online payment unit, Alipay, to a variable interest entity controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba's chief executive.
A large online video company, Tudou Holdings, delayed its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2010 after the former wife of the company's founder filed a lawsuit in a Shanghai court seeking control of the investment vehicle that held Tudou's operating licenses, claiming it was common property from her marriage.
The matter was settled by the court in June 2011, and Tudou successfully listed two months later. (Tudou merged with a rival Internet video company, Youku, last year.)
In the Chinachem case, Ms. Wang signed several lending and trust contracts in 1995 with the mainland Chinese firm that was to hold the bank stake, China Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Development, or China S.M.E.
Chinachem then transferred $11 million to a mainland bank account owned by China S.M.E., which in turn acquired a board seat and a 6.5 percent stake in Minsheng bank. China S.M.E. was to use its board seat to vote in accord with Chinachem's wishes, and to transfer dividends to the Hong Kong company.
Problems became apparent in 1997, when the mainland firm did not respond to Chinachem's requests for information about the bank's finances. The next year, Chinachem sought to enforce its contracts and lay claim to the bank shares. China S.M.E. responded that it was the shares' rightful owner.
Chinachem eventually sued in Beijing, seeking ownership of the Minsheng shares. The court ruled against the Hong Kong firm in 2001, but ordered China S.M.E. to pay Chinachem about $15 million in compensation.
Chinachem appealed the case to the high court in 2002, and Ms. Wang died in Hong Kong five years later, before the court ruled.
It is unclear why it took a decade to issue the ruling, which confirmed a lower court's decision that Chinachem had no right to the bank stake. It did, however, increase the compensation payable by the mainland firm to more than $300 million.
Today, Minsheng bank is traded in both Shanghai and Hong Kong and has a market value of around $45 billion. China S.M.E. retains a stake worth $1.26 billion based on the stock's current valuation.
China's courts are not independent, and rulings do not have the same precedent-setting effect that they do in the United States.
Still, other foreign-control contracts have come under official scrutiny in recent years. Last August, China's Ministry of Commerce attached a notable condition in allowing Wal-Mart Stores to bolster its stake in one of China's biggest e-commerce companies, Yihaodian.
The ministry, which enforces China's antimonopoly legislation, said Wal-Mart could lift its shareholding in the online retailer to a controlling stake. But it expressly forbid the American company from using a variable interest entity to operate an Internet trading platform that Yihaodian had hosted for other online retailers and consumers.
Since 2010, Shanghai's arbitration board has invalidated two variable interest entities that had been used by foreign companies to control onshore businesses. In one case involving an online game company, the panel applied China's contract law to reach the same conclusion as the supreme court in the Chinachem case -- saying that the variable interest entities were ''concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form.''
''I think what you are looking at here is that China is attacking these V.I.E. structures and the other ways that people have used legal form to get around the substance of what Chinese law says you can't do,'' said Mr. Gillis, of Peking University, who also is a member of the standing advisory group of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States.
''Of course,'' he said, ''people have been doing that as long as there has been foreign investment in China.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Beginning in 2000, when Nasdaq listed the Internet company Sina.com, most Chinese companies in restricted sectors have relied on complex investment vehicles known as variable interest entities, or V.I.E., as a way to sell shares to foreigners and get around China's laws on outside investment.
About half of the more than 200 Chinese companies listed on the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges rely on the investment vehicles to control onshore assets in China, according to research by Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, and Fredrik Öqvist, an independent financial analyst.
The structure has also been used in Hong Kong listings, like that of Tencent Holdings, China's biggest publicly traded Internet company, with a market value of more than $70 billion.
While variable interest entities in such cases are technically owned by the Chinese, foreign-owned corporations maintain de facto control through a series of contracts that can involve equity pledges, profit assignments, purchase options and service or consulting agreements.
The complexity of the agreements, and the fact that they have not often been tested in court, has created some prominent challenges for foreign investors.
In 2011, Yahoo shareholders were caught by surprise when the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, in which Yahoo held a 40 percent stake, announced that it had transferred the assets of its online payment unit, Alipay, to a variable interest entity controlled by Jack Ma, Alibaba's chief executive.
A large online video company, Tudou Holdings, delayed its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2010 after the former wife of the company's founder filed a lawsuit in a Shanghai court seeking control of the investment vehicle that held Tudou's operating licenses, claiming it was common property from her marriage.
The matter was settled by the court in June 2011, and Tudou successfully listed two months later. (Tudou merged with a rival Internet video company, Youku, last year.)
In the Chinachem case, Ms. Wang signed several lending and trust contracts in 1995 with the mainland Chinese firm that was to hold the bank stake, China Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Development, or China S.M.E.
Chinachem then transferred $11 million to a mainland bank account owned by China S.M.E., which in turn acquired a board seat and a 6.5 percent stake in Minsheng bank. China S.M.E. was to use its board seat to vote in accord with Chinachem's wishes, and to transfer dividends to the Hong Kong company.
Problems became apparent in 1997, when the mainland firm did not respond to Chinachem's requests for information about the bank's finances. The next year, Chinachem sought to enforce its contracts and lay claim to the bank shares. China S.M.E. responded that it was the shares' rightful owner.
Chinachem eventually sued in Beijing, seeking ownership of the Minsheng shares. The court ruled against the Hong Kong firm in 2001, but ordered China S.M.E. to pay Chinachem about $15 million in compensation.
Chinachem appealed the case to the high court in 2002, and Ms. Wang died in Hong Kong five years later, before the court ruled.
It is unclear why it took a decade to issue the ruling, which confirmed a lower court's decision that Chinachem had no right to the bank stake. It did, however, increase the compensation payable by the mainland firm to more than $300 million.
Today, Minsheng bank is traded in both Shanghai and Hong Kong and has a market value of around $45 billion. China S.M.E. retains a stake worth $1.26 billion based on the stock's current valuation.
China's courts are not independent, and rulings do not have the same precedent-setting effect that they do in the United States.
Still, other foreign-control contracts have come under official scrutiny in recent years. In August, China's Ministry of Commerce attached a notable condition in allowing Wal-Mart Stores to bolster its stake in one of China's biggest e-commerce companies, Yihaodian.
The ministry, which enforces China's antimonopoly legislation, said Wal-Mart could lift its shareholding in the online retailer to a controlling stake. But it expressly forbid the American company from using a variable interest entity to operate an Internet trading platform that Yihaodian had hosted for other online retailers and consumers.
Since 2010, Shanghai's arbitration board has invalidated two variable interest entities that had been used by foreign companies to control onshore businesses. In one case involving an online game company, the panel applied China's contract law to reach the same conclusion as the supreme court in the Chinachem case -- saying that the variable-interest entities were ''concealing illegal intentions with a lawful form.''
''I think what you are looking at here is that China is attacking these V.I.E. structures and the other ways that people have used legal form to get around the substance of what Chinese law says you can't do,'' said Mr. Gillis, of Peking University, who also serves as a member of the standing advisory group of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in the United States.
''Of course,'' he said, ''people have been doing that as long as there has been foreign investment in China.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Fight Over Water, And to Save A Way of Life

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
APALACHICOLA, Fla. -- If these were ordinary times, Leroy Shiver would be scissoring his heavy tongs along the shallows of Apalachicola Bay and hauling up bushels of oysters for hours on end.
Instead, in a task requiring equal doses of patience and hope, Mr. Shiver shoveled piles of dried oyster shells off his boat into the bay. A long line of oystermen and oysterwomen in boats alongside him also joined in the shell dump, a government-sanctioned, last-ditch attempt to revive the decimated oyster industry in Apalachicola. Under the right circumstances, baby oysters should attach to the shells and grow.
''This bay would be filled with boats,'' said Mr. Shiver, 36, whose father and grandfather plunged nets, set traps and dipped tongs into the water along this stretch of the Florida Panhandle. ''There used to be oysters everywhere in here, and now there is none.''
In a budding ecological crisis, the oyster population has drastically declined in Apalachicola Bay, one of the country's major estuaries and the cradle of Florida's prized oyster industry. 
The fishery's collapse, which began last summer and has stretched into this year, is the most blatant sign yet of the bay's vulnerability in the face of decades of dwindling flow from two rivers originating in Georgia. For 23 years now, Georgia, Alabama and Florida have waged a classic upstream-downstream water war, with Alabama and Florida coming out on the losing end of a long court battle in 2011.
Oyster overharvesting in the bay after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which largely missed this area, worsened the situation, as did persistent drought.
But researchers found this year that the lack of fresh water had made it nearly impossible for the bay to bounce back as it typically does after stressful events. Last year, the Apalachicola River reached its lowest level and stayed there for nine months, a record.
While the oysters face the most immediate threat, environmentalists and lawmakers said the diminished flow has other far-reaching consequences on Apalachicola's $6.6 million seafood industry. It could affect some of Florida's most popular catches, including grouper, snapper, blue crab and shrimp, which early on feed and grow in the estuary's perfectly calibrated mixing bowl of salt water and fresh water.
It could also lead to the demise of one of the state's last fishing villages, an undeveloped, picturesque slice of old Florida on the Gulf Coast fortified by generations of fishermen. The working-class men and women in these parts were born into fishing, the way others are born into farming; it is a job, a mind-set, passed down through generations.
Economically, the situation has become so desperate that Gov. Rick Scott, a conservative Republican who is not inclined to ask for federal help, wrote to the United States Commerce Department last year and asked it to declare the oyster harvesting areas a fishing disaster. No designation has been made yet.
''Our message is that this is worth saving,'' said Chris Millender, 38, a lifelong oysterman here who helped form the Seafood Management Assistance Resource and Recovery Team to help save the bay. ''Once it's gone, it's gone.''
Since last year, oystermen have scarcely been able to scrape up several sacks of oysters a day from the bay, a far cry from the 40 they fill in the best of times. The number of adult oysters began to decline in 2007, oystermen said, and has gotten progressively worse. This year, the so-called spat, the larvae of oysters, are struggling to mature.
Under the best circumstances, it would take at least two years for this crop of young oysters to grow large enough for harvest. Typically, the bay here produces 90 percent of Florida's oysters and 10 percent of the country's overall oyster haul.
''The spat is just not where it should be,'' said Shannon Hartsfield, the president of the Franklin County Seafood Workers Association. ''And it all points to the river.''
Alarmed, Congressional and state lawmakers from both parties are scrambling to heighten awareness and push for either a legislative solution to control the river flow or a new agreement on water use with Georgia. Considering that the feud between Georgia and Florida has lasted decades, the odds of an agreement are not favorable.
Georgia, where 80 percent of the river basin is, is first in line for the water. Six percent of the basin is in Alabama, and 14 percent is in Florida.
Georgia uses water from Lake Sidney Lanier, a federal reservoir, to quench the thirst and lawns of the residents of ever-expanding metropolitan Atlanta, which sits nearby. Farther south, Georgia farmers use the water to irrigate thousands of acres of agricultural fields. As a result, Georgia has long opposed sending more water downstream to Florida's Apalachicola River.
In 2009, Florida thought it had won the long battle. A senior Federal District Court judge ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers could not draw more water from Lake Lanier. The decision would have freed up more water for Florida.
But in 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, reversed the ruling. It decided that the corps had the authority to allocate additional water from the reservoir to supply Atlanta. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
The appeals court ruling, coupled with the drought, which forced Georgia to draw more water, has starved Apalachicola Bay, scientists and lawmakers said. ''These levels are unprecedented,'' said Dan Tonsmeire, the executive director of Apalachicola Riverkeeper, an environmental group. ''The decline in the entire productivity of the bay is not only an ecological disaster but puts the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen at risk of being lost forever. And it's not just Apalachicola Bay. It affects the entire Gulf Coast.''
In Congress last month, senators from Alabama and Florida tried to address the flow issue in an amendment to the 2013 Water Resources Development Act. The bill passed the Senate on May 15, but the amendment was blocked by Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida.
''Georgia won't agree,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''They want what they want. We say that's not what Mother Nature intended.''
The House has yet to draft its own legislation. The entire Florida delegation sent a letter last month to Representative Bill Shuster, a Pennsylvania Republican and the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, asking him to take up the issue. Governor Scott sent a separate letter to Mr. Shuster.
Representative Steve Southerland II, Republican of Florida, said Mr. Shuster had assured him that a bill would be drafted this year.
For Florida, help cannot come soon enough. The estuary has endured a lifetime of hurricanes and drought. Its fishermen have survived commercial fishing restrictions and inexpensive shrimp imports. But the linchpin remains the flow of fresh water, experts said.
''Whether it's a drought or a hurricane, the river's resurrection depends on the flow of the water coming down,'' said State Senator Bill Montford, a Democrat who grew up on the Apalachicola River and represents the area. ''There is not another place on earth where the blessings of nature come together as they do in the basin and the bay. We have something special there. But it's also a very delicate treasure.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 3 about the decline of oyster beds in Florida's Apalachicola Bay, one of the country's major estuaries, described incorrectly the flow of water from a river in Georgia as it heads toward Alabama and Florida to help create the proper mix of salt and fresh water in the estuary. The flow of water grows stronger as it heads toward Florida; it does not diminish.

HEADLINE: Mortgaged Diplomas

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: For reasons similar to those that precipitated the mortgage crisis of 2007, many college students today are staggering under a burden of debt they may not be able to repay, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Current and prospective college students are receiving real-world instruction in the dismal political economy of public finance. 
Unless Congress can overcome its partisan differences, interest rates on federally guaranteed Stafford loans, an important means of paying for college, will double to 6.8 percent in July. 
With the Bank on Students Loan Fairness Act, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, proposes to reduce this interest rate to the same level that large banks pay for loans from the Federal Reserve Bank - 0.75 percent - for at least one year, during which longer-term remedies could be explored. 
The bill, one of many aimed at addressing the scheduled interest-rate increase, seems unlikely to win passage. But it highlights the double standard that puts the interests of banks and other businesses well ahead of those of students and ordinary people when it comes to debt relief. 
As Robert Kuttner explains (both in The New York Review of Books and in his new book "Debtors' Prison"), bailouts and bankruptcy proceedings both provide a means for businesses to get out from under bad debt. The obligations of a college loan, by contrast, "follow a borrower to the grave." 
The rolling thunder of accumulating student debt sounds a lot like the perfect storm of mortgage liabilities that threatened major financial institutions and precipitated the Great Recession in 2007. 
According to a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (nicely summarized in a publication by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis), the dollar value of college loan debt in the United States now surpasses both auto loan and credit card debt. 
As states have steadily reduced their support for public higher education, tuition and fees have increased far more rapidly than the rate of inflation. Slow economic growth and persistently high unemployment rates have made it harder for parents to help with tuition bills, while students feel increasing pressure to gain a credential that could improve their job market chances. 
The number of student borrowers increased 54 percent from 2005 to 2012, while the average debt per borrower increased 56 percent, to $25,000.
Whether or not you call it a bubble, evidence shows something is likely to pop. 
Both delinquency and default rates have increased substantially since 2005. According to the Institute for Higher Education Policy, only a little more than a third of 1.8 million borrowers who entered repayment in 2005 repaid their student loans successfully without delay or delinquency for the first five years. 
Low-income minority students, disproportionately likely to attend for-profit schools, are the most vulnerable.
Like the tranches of mortgage securities that were labeled "sub-prime," their federally guaranteed loans, often arranged by for-profit schools positioned to cash in on them, are the least likely to be repaid.
The New York Fed study reports that students at private, for-profit colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, though they represent only 10 percent of total enrollment. 
In a speech titled "Subprime Goes to College," Steve Eisman, one of the few major investors to anticipate and profit from the earlier mortgage crisis, has drawn explicit parallels between loan-peddling in both realms. 
In both cases, federal and state regulation was weak. Yet regulatory tools clearly work. Default rates on college loans declined sharply in the early 1990s, after federal policy makers began penalizing for-profit colleges with default rates greater than 25 percent. 
More recent efforts to impose higher loan-repayment standards on colleges have run into legal obstacles.
Meanwhile, many students, like older family members who found themselves underwater on home mortgages, don't fully understand the complex process of loan renegotiation. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a hard-won political response to the mortgage crisis, has noted that students who feel confused about the terms of their loan are particularly likely to default. The National Consumer Law Center offers a detailed policy agenda for reducing default rates.
The Obama administration has put in place an important income-based repayment system that could considerably alleviate stress for many student borrowers by limiting the amount they pay monthly to a fixed percentage of their income. Yet the details are complicated, and some students may fear the prospect of paying a larger total amount of interest if they spread their payments out over time. 
Like mortgage debt, which discouraged many homeowners from either selling their homes or buying new ones, student loan debt has knock-on effects, making it harder for young people to buy cars or homes.
The reduction in major purchases by the younger generation slows economic growth and contributes to persistently high unemployment and underemployment rates that leave some college graduates with no recourse but default. 
High default rates in turn, raise the cost of the loans, fueling the conservative argument that interest rates on them should be set much higher than those on loans to banks. 
Of course, loans to large banks are more secure in part because they are bailed out when they get into temporary trouble. My students wish that they, too, were too big to fail.

HEADLINE: 24 Years Later, Tensions Continue Over Crushed Chinese Protests

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: With officials in Beijing on high alert to prevent public commemorations, the capital awaits another anniversary of the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - Early June in Beijing is always tense, with tighter security and special workplace orders affecting some in the city as the authorities try to prevent public commemorations of the crushing of the student-led democracy movement of 1989.
This year is no different. 
Starting early Sunday, administrators and party members at Beijing universities were placed on 24-hour work duty - that is, on call around the clock - until the end of Tuesday, the anniversary of the crackdown, to prevent outbreaks of unrest on campus, university sources said. Campuses elsewhere in the country were also affected; the United States-based China Digital Times reported similar orders, at Shenzhen University in the far south of the country, with party members and staff told "prevention and control efforts" must be "tight within" but appear "relaxed outside," the Web site reported.
Elsewhere in the capital, uniformed and plainclothes police presence was heavy, especially around Tiananmen Square, the epicenter of the 1989 protests that the army ended by firing on unarmed civilians, killing hundreds, possibly thousands of people on the night of June 3-4. 
On Sunday afternoon, an unknown person threw "bunches" of what appeared to be fliers out of a bus on Tiananmen Square, according to an eyewitness on another bus. Photographs show the police picking white pieces of paper off the street amid stopped traffic. In an interview, the eyewitness said a person sitting next to her said "June 4" but declined to speak further. Outside, passersby photographed the scene and some picked up pieces of the thrown paper, but their content was not known. Fliers have been used in the past to spread political messages on sensitive political anniversaries. During last year's Communist Party congress, buses crossing the square were ordered to tape their windows shut to prevent such incidents. 
In her home in western Beijing, Ding Zilin, the mother of Jiang Jielian, who was 17 when he was shot dead by troops 24 years ago, changes the number on the memorial she keeps for her son with every passing year.
This year Tiananmen Mothers, the group founded by Ms. Ding, 76, a former philosophy professor, issued a statement saying that despite having been ignored by the government for nearly a quarter of a century, they would not give up their search for justice. 
Signed by 123 living members, and with the signatures attached of 33 deceased members who had signed such statements in the past, the group wrote: "The Tiananmen Mothers will certainly find a way out of the field of death."
They have written 36 open letters to the government since 1989 asking for dialogue, an accounting of the tragedy and punishment for those responsible, the group said. "To this day, all our efforts have been in vain, we have received not a single response from the government," they wrote.
Nor do they think anything will change soon: "Facts have clearly shown that during the past nearly quarter century, China's top leaders have never been real political reformers. Jiang Zemin was not, Hu Jintao was not, nor is Xi Jinping, who just took office," they wrote. "They come one after another, as if through a revolving door; and as they move forward, they become ever more distant and outrageous, causing a universal feeling of despair to descend on the people from all sides," the group wrote. 
The group accused Mr. Xi of taking the country backwards into a Maoist past, saying that "we have not seen him reflect upon or show remorse in the slightest for the sins committed during the three decades of Maoist communism. We also have not seen him criticize in the slightest or make anyone accountable for the three decades of Deng-style 'lame reform,' " they added, referring to economic reforms initiated by the former leader Deng Xiaoping.
Another well-known Beijing-based voice called for an accounting of the June 4 tragedy: Bao Tong, a former aide to the reforming leader Zhao Ziyang, who was deposed after the crushing of the demonstrations. 
In an interview with Mr. Bao, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post wrote that Mr. Bao said the tragedy must be "completely repudiated" if China is to move forward. 
"The former top aide of reformist leader Zhao Ziyang said all Chinese people - including top leaders - should stop protecting the legacy of Deng Xiaoping and Mao Zedong and reflect on the events of June 4, 1989," the Post wrote.
Over the weekend, the Chinese authorities reacted angrily to a statement by the United States calling on China to fully account for the tragedy, accusing it of "prejudice."
China had already reached a "clear conclusion" about the event, said Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. China declared the democracy movement a counterrevolutionary rebellion, though today it more commonly refers to it as "political turmoil," as Mr. Hong did. 
Mr. Hong said the U.S. government should "correctly treat China's development."
 What exactly is "China's development"? In the next post, two authors warn the growing global footprint of China's state capitalism - poses a real threat to democracy around the world.

HEADLINE: The Triumph of Peter Kenen, The Revenge of Robert Mundell

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The curse of labor mobility? 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
In America, it's sad when your friends move away; in Europe, it may be a tragedy.
Back in the 1960s, a new concept emerged in international macroeconomics: optimum currency area theory. The question it sought to answer was, when should countries adopt a common currency? Everyone noted that by adopting a common currency, countries would give up much of their policy independence; the question was how costly that would be, and how large the benefits. 
One variant, pushed by Ronald McKinnon, stressed the amount of trade; the more two countries trade, the bigger the advantages of not having to change currencies, and arguably, also, the less adjustment is needed to correct trade imbalances. Another (actually the first paper on the subject), by Robert Mundell, stressed labor mobility: you don't need as much policy independence if unemployed workers can move to where the jobs are. A third, stressed by my late colleague Peter Kenen, stressed fiscal integration: if countries or regions share common budgets for major programs, there will be a lot of automatic compensation for "asymmetric shocks".
As I've argued in the past, it turns out that Kenen, not Mundell, is the best guide to problems in Europe right now. And while I didn't think of it until now, there's even a case to be made that labor mobility within Europe is actually worsening the problem, making the euro less sustainable.Via FTAlphaville, Frances Coppola documents the extraordinary rates of emigration among young people in Europe's disaster economies - not really a surprise when you consider the incredible levels of youth unemployment. But as she says, once those young people are gone, who will pay the taxes to support retirees?
The point is that the interaction among large welfare states, relatively high labor mobility, and lack of fiscal integration in a currency area may turn out to be really deadly.

HEADLINE: Waltz With Vladimir

BYLINE: MASHA GESSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Russian intelligentsia faces the same choice as under the Soviet Union: emigrate externally or internally, by retreating into elaborate rituals bearing no connection to the problems of the day. 

 BODY:
MOSCOW - On Saturday morning we had our hair done. Then my two older kids and I put on our finest party clothes - we looked like we were going to a prom - and drove from our dacha into the city.
First we went to the studios of TV Dozhd, an independent channel that broadcasts via satellite and the Internet, to take part in an adoption talk-a-thon in honor of the International Day for the Protection of Children. The Russian government had picked that day to announce that it would ban adoptions by same-sex couples, and we went on the air to say that my oldest son, who is adopted and being raised by lesbians, will be leaving for boarding school in the United States in a few weeks, in part to make sure the Russian authorities cannot get to him. 
"It would appear there is no place in this country for Sergei Guriev or for Masha Gessen's children," the host said ruefully. Sergei Guriev, a leading Russian economist, announced last week that he has left the country because he feared arrest. His statement was a profound shock: While fairly outspoken politically, Guriev had appeared well connected to the highest levels of the government and therefore well protected. If he believes he could have gone to jail, then anyone could.
We left TV Dozhd and rushed over to the Andrei Sakharov Museum and Public Center, two small buildings in Moscow that house a museum about dissidence in the Soviet Union and host debates, discussions and series of films. On this day, though, it was a different sort of event: About 50 participants, aged roughly five to 55 were dressed in tuxedos or floor-length white gowns; the exhibit hall would be doubling as a dance hall.
We began by dancing a cotillion that required assembling in the street outside and rushing indoors. While we stood in a circle on the sidewalk, several people joked that the formation looked like "a white circle," a reference to protests held in Moscow and other cities last year. But that was the afternoon's sole political reference. For the next four hours, we danced the quadrille and patterned waltzes - one involving candles - the galop and two kinds of polka pas de trois.
The event came about because the Sakharov Center's director and his wife had been researching historical dance. A few months ago, they invited friends to study with them, with the idea of starting a series of balls at the center. Some people attended rehearsals for months; others, like me and my kids, joined at the last minute, cramming dance lessons into a couple of days before the big event.
The organizers reminded everyone of the correct steps and patterns at the start of each dance, so that guests of every level of expertise could participate. The result was strikingly beautiful, but also bittersweet: Though no one mentioned it, everyone present knew that this first ball may well be the last one, since the Sakharov Center, facing growing pressure from the authorities, may be forced to close.
As the party slowly dispersed after the last dance, I heard someone mutter something about "fiddling while Rome burns." I realized then why the occasion had felt nostalgic, like something from my own childhood, even though I grew up with no dancing: Escaping into private communities is a time-honored Russian tradition.
In the '70s and '80s some people identified themselves as "internal émigrés"; they abandoned the state but didn't leave the country. To do this they often constructed elaborate rituals, involving things like music and stamp collecting - anything that provided an opportunity to unite with other people around a common knowledge or a common language with no relation to the problems of the day.
Today the Russian intelligentsia faces the same choice again: emigrate externally, like Guriev, or internally, by waltzing away into a private community of amateur dancers.

HEADLINE: The Macroeconomics of European Disunion

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Aggregate madness. 

 BODY:
Wolfgang Münchau makes a point that isn't new, but still gets overlooked too often: the euro area is, for practical macroeconomic purposes, a single unit - and one that doesn't really do all that much trade with the rest of the world. Aggregate euro area policy, monetary and fiscal, should therefore be subject to more or less the same rules that apply to the United States. 
Yet because monetary union wasn't accompanied by political union, the continent as a whole is pursuing what amount to insanely restrictive policies. Here we have an economy with massive unemployment and inflation that is too low by any reasonable standard (Europe, even more than America, would do a lot better with a 4 percent inflation target):
Yet what we see is sharply restrictive fiscal policy:
And the ECB isn't even trying to offset this fiscal drag with expansionary monetary policy, in part because of fear of adverse reactions to possible higher inflation in Germany.
We can and often do get bogged down in the details of country analysis, not to mention the difficult politics of the situation. But every once in a while it's worth backing up and thinking about the fundamental craziness of aggregate European policy.

HEADLINE: The Fed and Inequality

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Inequality, in terms of both income and wealth, has widened since the recession, and some attribute the gap at least in part to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s efforts to revive the economy. 

 BODY:
Is the Federal Reserve a driving force behind the post-recession growth in inequality? It's a provocative idea, voiced by writers including Neil Irwin and Robert Frank.
It is certainly true that inequality, in terms of both income and wealth, has widened since the recession. A study by the lauded economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, found that the top 1 percent of earners have accounted for all of the income gains in the first two full years of the recovery. Their incomes have climbed about 11.2 percent. The incomes of the 99 percent have declined by about 0.4 percent.
Those patterns repeat when looking at measures of wealth, meaning the value of a family's assets, like its house and savings account, minus the value of its debts, like mortgages and credit card balances. A recent report from the Pew Research Center found that the wealth of the richest 7 percent of households climbed about 28 percent from 2009 to 2011. For the remaining 93 percent, average wealth dropped about 4 percent. 
The Federal Reserve has been a major force propping up economic growth, even as Washington has started to slash the federal deficit and as droughts and debt crises abroad have taken their toll. A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimated that the Fed's aggressive policies have shaved 1.5 percentage points off the unemployment rate and have more broadly aided growth.
So if the Fed has been propping up the economy, has it also been propping up inequality? The argument would go something like this: 
First, many financial experts consider the Fed's policies a driving force behind the surge in the stock market. Since the depths of the crisis, the Dow Jones industrial average has more than doubled, increasing about 16 percent this year alone. Such gains have helped to lift the earnings and the net worth of the half of Americans who own stocks. But the wealthy have benefited disproportionately. According to recent research by the New York University economist Edward Wolff, the richest 10 percent of households own more than 81 percent of stocks, as measured by value.
A second factor is the rebound in the housing market, aided by the Federal Reserve's purchase of about $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities every month. The effort has helped push down mortgage rates and make it cheaper for millions of families to buy a house or to free up some cash by refinancing. But because of tight credit standards, that windfall has mostly gone to the rich - families that meet the standards to refinance, and investors with enough cash to buy.
Looking at those two factors, there's a strong argument that the Fed stands behind growth in inequality, particularly when it comes to wealth. But the picture is murkier when it comes to income. And experts sounded a note of caution about trying to work out the distributional effect that the central bank's policies might be having more generally.
"I don't think we know that much about it," said Josh Bivens, an economist at the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based research group. "It would be interesting to have a really determined academic look at the effect on all these asset groups and try to figure it out from there."
Even if the Fed had stoked some wealth inequality through the stock and housing markets, he said, that would not be the full picture. How much did the Fed's policies account for the housing turnaround, or the stock-price rebound? That would be hard to say. In the case of the stock markets, corporate earnings seemed the main factor, Mr. Bivens said.
Moreover, the fuller picture would need to take into account how the Federal Reserve might have eased earnings inequality by reducing unemployment. "High unemployment is much more destructive to wage growth for low-income workers than for high-income workers," Mr. Bivens said. "The Fed might have done quite a bit to keep wages from falling even further at the low end."
Other experts said they thought the Fed might have reduced inequality, if anything, and that one way or another it would be difficult to tell. "The effect is going to be at the margin if it is there at all," said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed official now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "It's kind of a silly question to ask, though. It's relevant to talk about international trade. It's relevant to talk about technology. It's relevant to talk about regulation. Monetary policy seems far down the list."
One piece of analytical evidence that the Fed might be stoking inequality comes from the Bank of England. That central bank also undertook an aggressive round of asset purchases, and a report released last year found it helped the economy over all - but the rich much more than the poor.
Still, it described those distributional effects as unavoidable, and worth it in the long run. "Without the bank's asset purchases, most people in the United Kingdom would have been worse off," the report said. "Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. More companies would have gone out of business. That would have had a detrimental impact on savers and pensioners along with every other group in our society."
One way or another, it is a subject the Federal Reserve itself might have some interest in. Speaking at a conference in New York in April, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a Federal Reserve governor, posed the question of whether "inequality itself is undermining our country's economic strength." Her answer was an unequivocal yes. "I am persuaded that because of how hard these lower- and middle-income households were hit, the recession was worse and the recovery has been weaker," she said.
"It is not part of the Federal Reserve's mandate to address inequality directly," she added, "but I want to explore these issues today because the answers may have implications for the Federal Reserve's efforts to understand the recession and conduct policy in a way that contributes to a stronger pace of recovery."

HEADLINE: China's Development a 'Threat' to Democracies, Authors Say

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: As China buys strategic assets around the world and flexes its commercial muscle, will Western countries have to increasingly play by Beijing&#8217;s statist rules? Do these threaten democracies elsewhere? 

 BODY:
BEIJING - When China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, told the United States late on Saturday that it should "correctly treat China's development," what did he mean? 
The reprimand came after the U.S. State Department on Friday called on China to "fully account for those killed, detained or missing in the 1989 bloody military crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square," The Associated Press reported. Mr. Hong also told the U.S. to "discard" its "political prejudice" toward China.
China often emphasizes that it seeks peaceful development. But the authors Heriberto Araújo and Juan Pablo Cardenal believe there is more to it.
In an opinion piece in The New York Times, they write that the state capitalist model behind China's increasingly successful global push threatens the values of the established democracies.
"While China is not taking over the world militarily, it seems to be steadily taking it over commercially," they write. "In just the past week, Chinese companies and investors have sought to buy two iconic Western companies, Smithfield Foods, the American pork producer, and Club Med, the French resort company," they write. (A third, high-profile example last week is a deal between the city of London and a Chinese company, ABP, to develop the Royal Albert Dock for about $1.5 billion, for Chinese and Asian businesses.) 
China has been able to amass a lot of cash that it is using to buy strategic assets around the world, the authors write, "ultimately" through the use of Chinese savers' deposits in a financially repressed economy (the financial repression is imposed by the state). 
"It is important to remember what is really behind China's global economic expansion: the state. China may be moving in the right direction on a number of issues, but when Chinese state-owned companies go abroad and seek to play by rules that emanate from an authoritarian regime, there is grave danger that Western countries will, out of economic need, end up playing by Beijing's rules," write the authors of "China's Silent Army: The Pioneers, Traders, Fixers and Workers Who Are Remaking The World in Beijing's Image."
"As China becomes a global player and a fierce competitor in American and European markets, its political system and state capitalist ideology pose a threat. It is therefore essential that Western governments stick to what has been the core of Western prosperity: the rule of law, political freedom and fair competition," they write.
"They must not think shortsightedly," they add. "Giving up on our commitment to human rights, or being compliant in the face of rapacious state capitalism, will hurt Western countries in the long term. It is China that needs to adapt to the world, not the other way around." 
 What do you think? Does China's state-led development pose a threat to fundamental democratic values around the world? Will China adapt as it invests abroad, or can it, will it, should it, bring its values with it?

HEADLINE: Ben Bernanke Endorses A 73 Percent Tax Rate

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Fed chairman channels Rawls. 

 BODY:
OK, he didn't actually say that in so many words. But if you follow through on the logic of his excellent speech at Princeton yesterday, that's where you end up.
Actually, there were several things Bernanke said that were politically controversial. When he declared that
physical beauty is evolution's way of assuring us that the other person doesn't have too many intestinal parasites 
he was endorsing the theory of evolution - which puts him at odds with a large majority of Republicans, 58 percent of whom believe that man was created in his present form within the last 10,000 years. 
But the big thing in Bernanke's remarks was his discussion of the obligations of the successful, even within a supposedly meritocratic society:
We have been taught that meritocratic institutions and societies are fair. Putting aside the reality that no system, including our own, is really entirely meritocratic, meritocracies may be fairer and more efficient than some alternatives. But fair in an absolute sense? Think about it. A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate-these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. The only way for even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.
OK, this is, whether BB realizes it or not (he probably does) basically a Rawlsian view of the world, in which you think of life as a kind of lottery in which you draw a ticket that includes things like your genetic endowment as well as the wealth of your parents. And what you're supposed to do, ethically, is support the economic and social system you would choose if you had to enter that lottery not knowing what ticket you were going to draw - if you were making political choices behind the "veil of ignorance".
As soon as you portray the choice that way, you've introduced a strong presumption in favor of redistribution. After all, if you should happen to end up as a member of the top 1 percent, an extra dollar at the margin won't mean a lot to you; but if you should happen to end up as a member of, say, the bottom quintile, an extra dollar could make a lot of difference. So you should, other things equal, favor a system of progressive taxation and generous aid to the poor and unlucky.
So why not favor complete leveling, America as Cuba? Because for many reasons, both economic and political, we favor a market economy in which people make decentralized decisions about working, saving, and so on. And this means that incentive effects become important; you can't levy 100 percent taxation on the rich, or completely insulate the poor from any consequences of low income, without destroying the incentives you need to make the economy work.
The question then becomes one of numbers. In particular, how high should we set the top tax rate? From a Rawlsian perspective, the key thing about very high incomes is that making them a bit higher or lower basically doesn't matter - if you are lucky enough to find yourself in the top 0.1 percent (say), the marginal value of a dollar to your welfare is trivial compared with the value of that dollar to almost anyone else. So the top tax rate should be set solely with regard to the amount of money it raises for other purposes; essentially, you should soak the rich up to the point where any further rise in the tax rate would actually reduce revenue.
And we have a pretty good idea, based on careful statistical studies, of where that optimal top rate lies; 73 percent, say Diamond and Saez, maybe 80 percent, say Romer and Romer.
Does this sound wildly radical to you? Well, it's just where the logic and evidence take you once you adopt a more or less Rawlsian view of social justice - which is exactly what Ben Bernanke did at Princeton.
Some people have suggested that BB's speech had a touch of radicalism to it. Little did they know!

HEADLINE: Why Young People Don't Vote Republican

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A new report explains how the 18-29 cohort views the G.O.P. 

 BODY:
There has been no shortage of Republican post-mortems on the 2012 presidential election - and no shortage of apologists who claimed the party need only change its rhetoric (and stop nominating members of the legitimate-rape caucus) to attract women, minorities and young people. 
The latest of these analyses, focused on voters aged 18-29, sometimes falls into the apologist/rebranding trap. It suggests, for example, that abortion is a problematic topic for the G.O.P. because young people "conflate" abortion with Planned Parenthood, contraception and women's health care in general - as though Republican officeholders and candidates across the country hadn't done their best to draw that connection.
But the report is far more candid than other post-mortems. It could also be far more helpful if it pushes the G.O.P. to examine the actual policies, rather than the slogans, that turn off young voters.

The report points out that a better Facebook page is not going to help much if voters don't like your ideas. It says younger voters aren't particularly wary of "big government," for example, which has been a central Republican bogeyman for decades.
Younger voters don't buy Republican dogma that lowering taxes on rich people will generate jobs and help everyone. In a survey conducted for the group in March, 54 percent of young voters said that "taxes should go up on the wealthy," while only 31 percent said "taxes should be cut for everyone."
Noting that many young Americans reported putting off marrying or having children because of the state of the economy, the report said: "It is extraordinarily important for Republicans to have a plan that can grow the economy and that ultimately allows young people to make these choices about family and home on their own terms."
The most damning conclusions lay in the survey's examination of how people view the two major parties in terms of broad attributes. For Democrats, young voters chose "tolerant," "diverse" and "open-minded," while for Republicans they often chose "rich" and "religious."
In focus groups in January, the report said, young voters were asked to list leaders of the Democratic Party. "They named prominent former or currently elected officials: Pelosi, the Clintons, Obama, Kennedy, Gore. When those same respondents were asked to name Republican leaders, they focused heavily on media personalities and commentators: Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck."
So it's not terribly surprising that when they were asked what words came to mind when they heard "Republican Party," the results "were brutal - closed-minded, racist, rigid, old-fashioned."

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The More Subarus Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Subaru struggles to produce enough cars to match American demand, and two storm chasers were killed in an Oklahoma tornado on Friday. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Subaru appears to be scrambling to keep up with American demand for its cars. Surging sales - particularly for the popular Forester - could outstrip the company's production capacity, leading to a shortage at dealerships. Yasuyuki Yoshinaga, Subaru's chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal that sales have already exceeded the company's 380,000-unit goal for 2016. Subaru saw a 17 percent jump in American sales in the first quarter of 2013. To date, the United States accounts for about half of the automaker's business. (Autoblog) 
 The storm chasers, Tim Samaras, his son Paul and their colleague Carl Young, were among 13 people reported killed by a tornado in Oklahoma on Friday. Also, a truck carrying a Weather Channel meteorologist and several storm chasers was picked up by a twister and flung into a field. Some of the passengers were injured, but no one was killed. Although some trucks are designed to be driven into tornados, it's still a very risky business that has grown in popularity over the last decade-and-a-half since the movie Twister came out in 1996. (The New York Times)

 According to a University of Michigan study released last week, older drivers are more likely to buy new cars. Researchers found that compared with licensed drivers from ages 35 to 44, drivers from 55 to 64 were most likely to buy new cars in 2011. Data were different in 2007, and the study said that a probable reason for the change was that the 35- to 44-year-old age group was hardest hit by the recession. Lacey Plache, chief economist for Edmunds.com, cautioned dealers not to discount younger drivers from the new car equation, pointing out that many of them have merely delayed buying new cars as a result of the recession. (Automotive News)
 The federal Justice Department has nearly closed its case against Daimler, which was charged with bribing public officials in 22 countries with millions of dollars from 1998 to 2008 in order to win contracts. Between the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Daimler has paid nearly $200 million in fines, as well as enduring a two-year probationary period. An S.E.C. official said that if companies doing business in the United States are caught bribing public officials anywhere - standard practice in some places, but against American law - they will face the American justice system. (The Detroit Bureau)
 Volkswagen Group of America has pledged $1.7 million toward expanding its research partnership with Stanford University. The company said the money would aid the study of virtual intelligence, material research, data security and vehicle dynamics, as well as educating aspiring engineers in computer science and electromechanical design. Volkswagen also said it would invest $5 billion into developing new products for North America over the next three years. (Autotalk)

HEADLINE: Finding a High-Yield Checking Account

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Some smaller banks offer high-yield checking accounts, but there are often catches. 

 BODY:
Interest rates on most savings and checking accounts remain anemic. But for those who are comfortable with electronic banking and who are active debit-card users, high-yield checking accounts offered by smaller, regional banks and credit unions can be a more lucrative option. 
The financial site Bankrate.com examined 56 "high yield" checking accounts across the country, and found an average yield of 1.64 percent. That's considerably lower than rates the site found last year. But it looks quite good in comparison to most interest-bearing checking accounts, which had a national average yield of just 0.05 percent.
The catch is that to benefit from the accounts, which are federally insured, users have to meet some requirements each month. 
For instance, all of the accounts reviewed by Bankrate require at least 10 debit-card transactions a month, and all require that users receive their monthly statements electronically. Most also require direct deposit or automated bill payments.
The penalty for not meeting the requirements is severe - the average interest rate drops to just 0.07 percent.
If 10 debit transactions are required a month and you make just nine, you're out of luck, said Greg McBride, senior analyst at Bankrate.
In addition, the accounts all carry balance caps - maximum balances on which the above-market interest rate applies.
The average cap is about $17,000 (down from about $19,000 last year), but the highest-yielding accounts tend to have the lowest caps. None of the 14 best-paying accounts available nationally, for instance, have a cap above $15,000, so if you had $20,000 in the account, the additional $5,000 would not earn the higher rate.
Still, Mr. McBride notes, consumers who can handle the requirements may still benefit from the accounts, perhaps as a place to park emergency funds or other cash.
Roughly a third of the high-yield accounts that Bankrate surveyed are available nationally, although some require a visit to a branch to open the account. About 39 percent of the accounts have some geographic limitation, like in-state residency.
Ouachita Independent Bank in Monroe, La., for example, offers a 3.01 percent annual percentage yield - but the account is available only to residents of Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi.
Do you have a high-yield checking account? Do you find it easy to meet its requirements?

HEADLINE: How Work Is Rebounding (or Not) Globally

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A report on employment from the International Labor Organization paints a picture of a world still struggling to create jobs after the global recession. 

 BODY:
The International Labor Organization put out a mammoth report Monday on employment around the world. Want to know about part-time work in Germany? The minimum wage in Bangladesh? The middle class in Burkina Faso? It is all in there. The study paints a picture of a world still struggling to create jobs in the wake of the global recession, with developing economies enjoying stronger growth and a better jobs picture than developed economies - especially those in Europe. Here are eight main takeaways. 

        
The global employment rate of 55.7 percent is still nearly a percentage point lower than it was before the crisis. The world needs about 31 million jobs to make up the gap.
        
Globally, there are about 200 million - 200 million - unemployed people.
        
For developing economies, employment rates will return to their precrisis levels around 2015. For advanced economies, it will take until after 2017. Employment rates are higher now than they were before the crisis in 13 out of 28 developing economies that the I.L.O. examined. That is true for only six out of 37 advanced economies. And the United States is not one of them. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are currently about 135.5 million Americans employed, down from about 138 million at the beginning of 2008. The employment rate - specifically, the employment-to-population ratio - has dropped from about 63 percent when the crisis hit to 59 percent today.
        
For some countries, the crisis never ended. In Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain, the overall employment rate has fallen more than three percentage points in the past two years alone.
        
For developed countries, a better job market has often gone hand in hand with worse jobs. More people are being hired, but those jobs are often part time, low paying or temporary. That is true in Germany, Israel and Luxembourg. It is, however, not true for the United States. The country has fewer jobs, but those jobs are, on balance, of higher quality, the I.L.O. found.
        
Long-term unemployment is a global scourge. It increased in more than half of surveyed countries, and labor forces have shrunk in more than half of surveyed countries, in part because so many workers have simply given up on looking for a job. In the United States, the falling unemployment rate is in part due to hundreds of thousands of workers' leaving the labor force.
        
The bad economy is giving rise to social unrest in many regions of the globe, especially Europe. Economic growth and the unemployment rate are the two strongest determinants of unrest, the I.L.O. said. Unsurprisingly, Europe, which has struggled to recover from the recession, has had the biggest spike in unrest. Latin America, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - all growing decently well - have experienced declines in the I.L.O. measure of unrest.
        
The American middle class is shrinking. And it has been for three decades. The share of adults living in middle-income households has fallen to 51 percent in 2010 from 61 percent in 1970.

HEADLINE: Behind the Rise in House Prices, Wall Street Buyers

BYLINE: NATHANIEL POPPER


HIGHLIGHT: Homes in struggling markets are being snapped up by big investment companies, shutting out regular buyers and creating concern about soaring prices. 

 BODY:
The last time the housing market was this hot in Phoenix and Las Vegas, the buyers pushing up prices were mostly small time. Nowadays, they are big time - Wall Street big.
Large investment firms have spent billions of dollars over the last year buying homes in some of the nation's most depressed markets. The influx has been so great, and the resulting price gains so big, that ordinary buyers are feeling squeezed out. Some are already wondering if prices will slump anew if the big money stops flowing.
 "The growth is being propelled by institutional money," said Suzanne Mistretta, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. "The question is how much the change in prices really reflects market demand, rather than one-off market shifts that may not be around in a couple years."
Wall Street played a central role in the last housing boom by supplying easy - and, in retrospect, risky - mortgage financing. Now, investment companies like the Blackstone Group have swooped in, buying thousands of houses in the same areas where the financial crisis hit hardest. 
Blackstone, which helped define a period of Wall Street hyperwealth, has bought some 26,000 homes in nine states. Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, is spending $250 million each month and already owns 10,000 properties. With little fanfare, these and other financial companies have become significant landlords on Main Street. Most of the firms are renting out the homes, with the possibility of unloading them at a profit when prices rise far enough.
While these investors have not touched many healthy real estate markets, they are among the biggest buyers in struggling areas of the country where housing prices have been increasing the fastest. Those gains, in turn, have been at the leading edge of rising home prices nationwide.
Some see the emergence of Wall Street buyers as a market-driven answer to the nation's housing ills. Investment companies are buying up rundown homes at a time when ordinary people can't or won't.
Nationwide, 68 percent of the damaged homes sold in April went to investors, and only 19 percent to first-time home buyers, according to Campbell HousingPulse. That is helping to shore up prices and create confidence in the broader markets.
"When people write the story of this housing recovery, these investors will be seen to have helped put the floor under the housing market," said David Bragg, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. "In some of the key markets, that contributed to the recovery."
The story, though, often looks more complicated on the ground. Joe Cusumano, a real estate agent in Riverside County, Calif., said that in recent months 90 percent of his business had been for companies like Invitation Homes, a Blackstone subsidiary. Home values in Riverside County have risen by 15 percent in the last year, according to CoreLogic.
But Mr. Cusumano said he wondered if faraway investors would properly maintain the homes they buy. He said that Invitation Homes had been willing to put money into the properties, but he was not so sure about the other players. He also worries what will happen when these investors start selling, as they inevitably will.
"The thing that scares me is the values going up so quickly," said Mr. Cusumano. "That's what happened before and that's what's scaring me. Is this going to happen again?"
The idea of investors' buying homes and renting them out is nothing new. But in the past, landlords were almost always local. Now big investors are using agents like Mr. Cusumano to stake a claim to entire neighborhoods.
In a sign of the potential peril ahead, some of the investment firms have recently taken the first steps to cash out.
The investment fund financed by Colony Capital filed last week to go public, the second firm to do so in May. Another early player in the business, the Carrington Holding Company, said last week that prices had risen too far, leading the firm to begin selling some of its holdings.
Fitch Ratings warned last Tuesday that prices for single-family homes in the regions with the biggest housing rebounds had been outpacing the growth rate in the local economies and "could stall or possibly reverse" if big investors start selling.
"We see economies that continue to struggle - we don't see them recovering enough to justify this drastic increase in prices," said Ms. Mistretta at Fitch.
Despite the recent gains, housing prices remain well below their precrisis highs. In Riverside, for example, home values are still down more than 40 percent from their 2006 records, according to CoreLogic.
To the extent that the housing rebound is becoming overheated in some pockets, it does not carry the most significant risks of the real estate boom that came crashing down in 2008. The new investment groups are not heavily indebted, making them less vulnerable to small movements in real estate values, and the risks are not spread as widely through the financial system.
Nearly all of the big investors have insisted that they plan to rent the houses they are buying for years to come. The Blackstone unit, Invitation Homes, has opened 14 offices across the country to serve the homes it has bought, a spokesman for the firm said.
At American Residential Properties, which went public in May, the chief executive, Stephen G. Schmitz, said that if other firms start selling their houses, "we'll step up our buying."
He added: "We still think that we're in a buyer's market."
Yet some investment companies are already pulling back in the markets that have had the fastest growth. In Phoenix, the percentage of all house purchases involving investors fell to about 25 percent in March from a high of 36 percent last summer, according to the Campbell HousingPulse Survey. The same survey shows that investors have been increasing their presence in new areas like Florida and California.
All of this has made it hard for house hunters like Jeff Martin, who is looking to buy a fixer-upper in Riverside County. Mr. Martin, 58, has made offers on 15 houses over the last year. Last Wednesday, he received his latest rejection. On most of the houses, Mr. Martin has lost out to investors offering all cash.
Mr. Martin, a retired Navy veteran, puts much of the blame on banks that have been holding onto empty houses, lowering the supply of available homes. He said he has trouble faulting the investors, given that he was involved in real estate financing during the last boom. But he is worried that if mortgage rates begin to rise he will lose out on his opportunity to buy. Rising mortgage rates could also lead to a broader slowdown in the real estate recovery.
Mr. Cusumano said that the investors he works for have been trimming back their purchases in the area. His agency closed on three houses for investors in May, down from eight in February.
But the fevered pitch of the market has not died down.
In late May, one of his clients closed on a house just a month after it went on the market. There were eight bidders, despite a listing that said "NEEDS TLC!!" Mr. Cusumano's client won the house only after agreeing to go $500 over the asking price of $194,500.
"It's just a strange market," he said. "We are in uncharted territory."

HEADLINE: Airline Group Is Predicting Rising Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Packed planes should help the world's airlines earn a $12.7 billion profit this year, as travel demand accelerates faster than the airlines add seats, according to a new prediction by a trade group. 
If the estimate by the International Air Transport Association proves accurate, it would represent a 67 percent increase in airline profit from the $7.6 billion they earned last year. The new estimate is a 20 percent jump over the association's estimate just three months ago.
The association said that if its forecast holds, the global airline industry will have its third-strongest year since 2001.
The biggest factor is full planes. Airline occupancy will rise to a record 80.3 percent this year, from an estimated 79.2 percent last year, the group said. It also said passenger traffic would rise 5.3 percent, but the number of seats to carry that traffic would rise just 4.3 percent. This will be the second year in a row that airlines have added fewer seats than passengers.
Airlines have become increasingly sophisticated about predicting demand for each flight, allowing them to match supply and demand more closely by putting a plane of the proper size on each route. American and European airlines in particular have also become more cautious about adding new planes because of the recession in Europe and uncertainty about the recovery in the United States.
Profits will also be helped by slightly lower oil prices. Jet fuel is one of the biggest expenses for airlines. The group said airlines have adapted to tough economic conditions by cutting costs and adding fees for add-ons like food and checked baggage.
Commerce is one of the biggest drivers of airline traffic, and it is booming on routes linked to emerging economies, the association said, even though trade among developed economies is in the doldrums because of uncertainty in Europe.
''This is a very tough business,'' said the association's director general and chief executive, Tony Tyler. ''The day-to-day challenges of keeping revenues ahead of costs remain monumental.'' He said most airlines earn about $4 for every passenger.
Profit margins are expected to be 3.4 percent worldwide, the highest level since 2010. The biggest margins are expected for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region at 5 percent, followed by 4.2 percent for airlines in North America and 1.3 percent in Europe.
The group said freight revenue would rise 1.5 percent, after falling for the last two years. It expects freight yields to fall 2 percent this year after dropping 6.3 percent last year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Dispute Over Restrictions In a U.S. Auction of Airwaves

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the mobile high-speed Internet market, the Obama administration believes it may be necessary to limit competition in order to promote it.
That paradox sums up a brewing fight over whether the two largest cellphone companies -- AT&T and Verizon Wireless -- will be allowed to participate without restrictions in the planned auction of new airwaves for wireless broadband next year.
The administration's antitrust team urged the Federal Communications Commission in April to develop auction rules that ensure that T-Mobile US and Sprint, the two smaller nationwide mobile carriers, are able to buy some of the prime airwaves and better compete nationally with the two larger companies. 
The suggestion that some auction participants could get favored treatment has spawned a dispute involving corporate lobbyists, academics and members of Congress on both sides of the debate. Some television and radio broadcasters have weighed in against auction limits while consumer advocates and some big companies that use mobile broadband in their operations have backed limits.
Whatever the F.C.C. decides will have huge implications on the ability of American consumers to inexpensively use the Internet from their smartphones, tablets and other portable devices. It could also affect how much money will be available to build a nationwide communications network for first responders, a plan that has been on the drawing board since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The newly available airwaves, also known as spectrum, will relieve some of the congestion that has plagued cellphone carriers' networks. The airwaves being auctioned, in the 600 megahertz band, also have highly valuable characteristics, like the ability to move easily through buildings, which helps users stay connected in cities, and the ability to travel long distances between radio towers, which allows for greater coverage of rural areas.
The Justice Department and other advocates on auction limits say that if AT&T and Verizon are allowed to significantly increase their holdings of that prime spectrum, T-Mobile and Sprint will be unable to continue expanding their networks. AT&T and Verizon already control more than three-quarters of other, previously sold, low-frequency airwaves.
The commission ''can potentially improve the competitive landscape by preventing the leading carriers from foreclosing their rivals from access to low-frequency spectrum,'' William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the department's antitrust division, told the F.C.C. in a filing in April.
AT&T responded angrily. ''It is surprising that the antitrust division of the Department of Justice would even propose measures that are so nakedly designed to help specific companies,'' Wayne Watts, a senior executive vice president and general counsel at AT&T, wrote in filing to the F.C.C.
''The department is quite candid about its motive for this blatant favoritism,'' Mr. Watts said. But, he added, ''picking winners and losers in this fashion would be patently unlawful.''
Both sides claim Congressional intent is on their side. In the 2012 law authorizing the auctions, Congress said that no qualified carrier may be excluded.
Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said doing so would defeat Congress's goals for the auction. The auctions were intended to compensate television broadcasters that are voluntarily giving up spectrum to be auctioned; to pay to relocate television stations that remain on the air; and to contribute up to $7 billion toward the construction of a nationwide public safety broadband network.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce committee, says Mr. Upton misses the point. While the law ''prohibits the F.C.C. from preventing a person from participating in a 'system of competitive bidding,' '' he said that it would be permissible for the commission to form multiple blocks of spectrum with participants being allowed to bid on some but not all of the blocks.
The F.C.C. already enforces rules limiting ''spectrum aggregation.'' In general, the commission's screen prevents further acquisition once a company goes above 33 percent of the licensed airwaves in one market area. But it applies that limit on a case-by-case basis, usually when one company buys another and asks to transfer ownership of the spectrum licenses.
The costs and benefits of such limits are the subject of dueling academic studies. One, conducted through the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, estimated that participation restrictions could reduce auction revenue by up to 40 percent, or $12 billion, and cost 118,000 jobs by 2017.
In another study, Jonathan B. Baker, a former F.C.C. chief economist and now a law professor at American University, wrote that spectrum caps in auctions can encourage, rather than limit, participation, that way increasing auction proceeds. His study was commissioned by T-Mobile.
The decision on which way to go will rest with the commission, which has only three members, with two spots empty. The lone Republican commissioner, Ajit Pai, said recently that the point of the auction -- to maximize revenue -- means ''letting all the wireless players participate in the auction and letting market forces sort out who wins and who loses.''
One of the two Democrats on the panel, Mignon Clyburn, the acting chairwoman, has emphasized that spectrum limits should be intended ''to facilitate access, by all providers, to valuable spectrum resources.''
That would appear to leave Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel as the swing vote. In a statement last September, when the F.C.C. issued its requests for comments on spectrum limits, Ms. Rosenworcel called for rules that provide ''opportunities for incumbents as well as new entrants,'' signaling possible support for setting limits on the sale of some auction lots.
She also highlighted, however, ''the larger context'' of the auctions, to raise money to build the first-responder communications network. ''It is imperative,'' she said, ''that we not lose sight of this goal.''

HEADLINE: Ford Showing Its Vigor as Industry Recovers

BYLINE: By JACLYN TROP

 BODY:
For decades in Detroit, there was a clear pecking order among automakers: General Motors sold the most cars in the United States, followed by Ford Motor Company and then the Chrysler Group.
But in the world of the postbailout auto industry, that firmament has gradually shifted, as Ford has introduced appealing fuel-efficient models while G.M. has contracted, dropping brands and reducing capacity.
On Monday, Ford continued to chip away at its rival, reporting a robust 14 percent gain in American sales in May, to 246,000, about 6,000 behind G.M., which reported a tepid 3 percent gain. Chrysler reported an 11 percent sales increase, to more than 166,000, beating analyst expectations. 
The strong performances by Ford and Chrysler helped the overall industry to stay on track to sell more than 15 million vehicles this year for the first time since 2007, before the financial collapse that sent carmakers into a tailspin. All automakers combined to sell 1.44 million new vehicles in the United States in May, an 8.2 percent gain over the same month in 2012.
''The industry is settling into a healthy place where supply and demand are meeting,'' said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the auto research site Edmunds.com, ''but demand is still growing. We're edging our way into what would be the sweet spot for sales.''
Now demand is driving supply, with Ford, Chrysler and Toyota adding more production and more jobs at United States plants to capture sales momentum. On Monday, Ford announced plans to increase capacity by 10 percent, to 740,000 vehicles, in the third quarter, as it strives to meet increasing demand for its S.U.V.'s and midsize passenger cars.
Ford's sales increase was driven not only by continued strong demand for large pickups and sport utility vehicles but also by rising sales of its smaller models, like the Fusion, Focus and Fiesta. Sales of the automaker's Fusion midsize sedan, for example, rose 10 percent, to 29,553 vehicles, for its best May ever.
Ford also reported strong sales of its Escape utility vehicle, which also had its best month ever, and the Lincoln MKZ, which soared 42 percent for its best May on record.
G.M., by contrast, continues to struggle in some major passenger car categories even as other segments like trucks remain strong. Its passenger car sales slipped 6.4 percent, in part because of a 31.7 percent decline for its full-size Chevrolet Impala and a 36.1 percent drop for its Chevrolet Malibu midsize sedan. Its Buick LaCrosse, down 15.2 percent in May, and Regal, down 37 percent, also struggled.
In a sign of G.M.'s urgency, on Friday it unveiled a refreshed version of its Malibu, only a year after introducing a revamped model.
G.M., which sold 253,000 vehicles in May, did have success in its smaller cars, maintaining sales for its midsize Chevrolet Cruze while introducing the smaller Chevrolet Spark and Sonic models.
''It's not necessarily saying G.M.'s performance was bad, because it wasn't,'' Ms. Caldwell of Edmunds.com said. ''It was just that Ford was better. Ford has a balance in their portfolio, while G.M. is a little more hit or miss.''
The strongest sales across the industry remained in pickups and S.U.V.'s, which rose 10.9 percent to 718,890 vehicles in May, in contrast to a 5.7 percent increase in car sales, to 725,736 vehicles.
Sales of Ford's F-Series rose 30.6 percent, while Chrysler's Dodge Ram truck brand climbed 21.6 percent. At G.M., large pickup truck sales rose 23 percent, accompanied by a 25.3 percent gain for its Chevrolet Silverado truck, the country's No. 2 best-selling vehicle with 43,283 units sold.
The 19.2 percent rise in pickup truck sales continues to reflect strong marketplace demand after a recovery in the housing market and a surge in the construction and oil industries. Automakers also cited an aging fleet of pickups and pent-up demand.
''Quite simply, it's a great time to be in the truck business,'' said Kurt McNeil, head of General Motors sales operations in the United States.
Several foreign automakers also reported double-digit sales increases, including a 24.7 percent gain for Nissan, driven by price cuts on seven of the Japanese automaker's vehicles and the popularity of its Sentra and Altima models.
Mazda reported gains of 19.2 percent, and Subaru of 34.2 percent.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, lagged competitors with a 2.5 percent increase, in line with expectations.
For both Toyota and G.M., ''the marketplace has become so competitive in their bread-and-butter segments,'' said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.

HEADLINE: Illinois: Pension Woes Cause Downgrade To Credit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings said Monday that it would downgrade Illinois state government credit from A to A- because lawmakers failed to enact a solution to the state's public-employee pension crisis. Illinois already has the lowest rating in the nation. Lower ratings mean paying higher interest rates on borrowed money. Decades of underpayment has left the five employee retirement systems $97 billion below what they need to cover future obligations. The House and Senate both enacted their own plans toward a fix, but neither would take up the other's proposal. The legislature adjourned its spring session Friday.

HEADLINE: Throat Cancer Link to Oral Sex Gains Notice

BYLINE: By ANAHAD O'CONNOR

 BODY:
For many years, smoking and drinking were considered the dominant risk factors for cancers of the throat. But on Monday, The Guardian, a British newspaper, reported that the actor Michael Douglas believed that his throat cancer was caused by an infection acquired during oral sex, highlighting a trend that has alarmed many scientists.
Mr. Douglas, 68, had previously speculated that years of smoking and drinking played a role in his disease, and his spokesman later said that although the actor had discussed oral sex's link to cancer, he did not say it was the cause of his own cancer. But The Guardian quoted Mr. Douglas as saying, ''Without wanting to get too specific, this particular cancer is caused by HPV, which actually comes from cunnilingus.'' 
Indeed, in recent years scientists have documented a steep rise in throat cancers caused by a strain of HPV that can be transmitted through oral sex. The virus, human papillomavirus Type 16, also causes many cases of cervical cancer in women.
In the 1980s, only a small number of throat cancers were linked to HPV infection. Historically, patients who developed the disease were in their 70s and were heavy smokers and drinkers.
Now, about 70 percent of all throat cancers are caused by HPV, up from roughly 15 percent three decades ago. Patients are now more frequently middle-aged husbands and fathers who are economically well off, nonsmokers and not particularly heavy drinkers. Men are three times more likely to be diagnosed than women with HPV-related throat cancer.
There are many strains of HPV, and the virus is so common that at some point most sexually active adults are exposed to it. A majority of people fight off the infection and do not develop symptoms. But in a very small number of people chronic infection causes oropharyngeal cancers near the base of the tongue and the area just behind the mouth.
Throat cancers caused by HPV are easier to treat than those caused by tobacco, doctors say. Rates of these cancers are increasing but are still fairly uncommon, striking about 3 in 100,000 people. Studies have not proved that vaccines against HPV prevent throat cancers, but many doctors believe they will.
The cancers typically occur decades after initial infection with HPV, and the diagnosis can raise delicate questions for spouses who wonder how partners were infected and worry that they, too, may contract the virus.
''It is a sexually transmitted virus, so that by itself obviously creates uncomfortable discussions between my patients and their partners,'' said Dr. Robert I. Haddad, the disease center leader of the head and neck oncology program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
In 2009, Tony Simotes, 62, learned that he had a tumor in his throat, which was diagnosed as Stage 3 oropharyngeal cancer. Mr. Simotes had never been a smoker or a drinker. He and his wife, Lucy, were relieved at first to learn the cancer was HPV-related, because that raised the odds that he could be cured.
''But then I started going through all the motions of what does that mean for me, too?'' said Ms. Simotes, 50. ''Because this cancer came from a virus, and I may or may not have it.''
She said she had a Pap test that came back negative.
Because both partners had been previously married, they were comfortable discussing the cancer and its cause, said Mr. Simotes, the artistic director and president of Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass. ''We know that we've lived pretty full lives until we met each other,'' he said. ''The reality is that a lot of times people carry the virus and it doesn't affect them.''
Mr. Simotes underwent chemotherapy and radiation, and his cancer is in remission.
In a study presented last weekend at a conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Haddad and other researchers showed for the first time that the partners of people with throat cancers caused by HPV were not at greater risk of developing oral HPV infections themselves. The study involved more than 200 people followed for about a year.
Dr. Haddad said the findings suggest that spouses and longtime partners do not need to take special precautions or change their sexual behavior.

HEADLINE: Violent Crime In U.S. Rises For First Time Since 2006

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Violent crime rose in the United States in 2012 for the first time in six years, led by an increase in major crimes in large cities, according to preliminary data released Monday by the F.B.I. 
The largest increases took place in cities with populations of between 500,000 and one million people, where violent crime rose by 3.7 percent, including a 12.5 percent spike in murder rates, according to the data.
The nation's largest cities, those with more than one million people, also had upturns in violent crimes, though at more modest rates. The largest cities had a 1.4 percent increase in violent crime, including 1.5 percent for murders and 3.2 percent for rapes, according to the statistics.
Over all, the nation's violent crime rate ticked up by 1.2 percent in 2012 after years of steep declines.
In 2011, for instance, the nation's rate of violent crime rate fell by 3.8 percent after having dropped by 6 percent in 2010 and 5.5 percent in 2009, according to F.B.I. data.
The last year in which violent crime rose nationally was 2006, when the rate went up by 1.9 percent. Before that, from 1996 to 2005, violent crime had declined by 17.6 percent, according to the F.B.I. figures.
In fact, crime levels have been dropping so much for so long that criminologists had been left guessing the reasons -- and where it might end.
''We probably now have answered the question of how low it can go, and we may be bouncing off the bottom now,'' said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
But Dr. Kenney added a note of caution, saying that seeking to pin a reason for a single year's increase in serious crime was inadvisable. ''We probably need another year to tell if we've got a pattern here,'' he said.
Joseph Pollini, another John Jay College professor, said that one possibility was that there were fewer police officers on patrol in some metropolitan areas that have cut spending sharply in recent years because of the recession.
''You're dealing with depleted police resources,'' he said of budget cuts that have caused a reduction in the size of nearly every urban police department.
Among the big cities where violent crime increased was Indianapolis, with a population of 840,000.
While murders there rose only modestly -- the 101 recorded in 2012 were five more than in 2011 -- there were nearly 780 additional violent crimes in the city, led by 5,967 aggravated assaults. That figure, according to the F.B.I. data, represents some 700 more aggravated assaults than in 2011.
Memphis, with a population of 657,000, had an increase of more than 1,000 violent crimes -- 11,505 in 2012 compared to 10,338 in 2011. That included a jump in the number of murders to 133 from 117.
While Detroit, with 707,000 residents, saw a drop in its violent crime rate, murders in the city increased to 386 from 344. In New York, where there was a small increase in violent crime, murders dropped by about 20 percent to 419, the lowest number in more than half a century.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Legislature Approves Budget

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
HARTFORD -- Connecticut legislators on Monday passed a two-year, $37.6 billion budget that includes a large expansion of gambling and reflects the degree to which Connecticut faces continuing financial budget distress despite passing a record $1.5 billion tax increase in 2011.
After approval by the Connecticut House at 5:15 Sunday morning, the State Senate voted 19 to 17 on Monday night to adopt the budget, which preserves aid to Connecticut municipalities, includes major spending increases for science and technology at the University of Connecticut, and maintains the state's safety net for social services without large-scale tax increases. No Republican in either chamber voted to approve the budget. 
To strike the budget, legislators relied on one-time revenues from various sources, adding 600 lottery terminals to bars and restaurants around the state for keno -- a gambling contest in which players try to guess which numbers will be randomly generated by a computer -- and by shifting about $6 billion in federal Medicaid assistance out of the budget, which kept it under the state spending cap.
Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat in a state where the party controls both houses of the legislature, acknowledged that the budget was imperfect, and that it reflected ''many tough choices and hard compromises.'' But he said the budget contained no new taxes -- Republicans noted that tax revenues would still go up -- and made substantial investments in education and economic development.
''This budget shows that we've got our priorities straight, and we are determined to keep Connecticut moving forward,'' Mr. Malloy said in a statement.
Mr. Malloy and Democrats in the legislature say the budget maintains important services and addresses fundamental fiscal problems like adequately financing the state's pension system after two decades of fiscal slippage under Republican governors. The budget raises the pension contribution to $1.9 billion from about $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
It also expands education reforms adopted last year, and it adds a new expansion on science and technology programs at the University of Connecticut.
Supporters say the budget helps towns across the state by avoiding feared budget cuts that could have forced them to raise property taxes. And it made commitments to education, like $27.5 million for the Commissioner's Network, which aids the state's lowest-achieving schools.
But Republicans said the budget was full of gimmicks and failed to comply with the rigorous accounting principles Mr. Malloy promised to implement after his election in 2010 but has since delayed.
They say it reflects the degree to which Mr. Malloy has failed to live up to his promise two years ago that a record tax increase would put Connecticut on a path to fiscal sustainability. In question now is whether the state can balance its budget in the biennium that follows the 2014 governor's election without major program cuts or substantial new taxes on top of the ones passed two years ago.
State Senator L. Scott Frantz, a Republican from Greenwich, raised the specter of Connecticut as a state in long-term decline and offered reports on Connecticut's debt, business climate and job growth that showed the state near the bottom nationally in economic health. Mr. Frantz said the current budget seemed to offer more of the same in a state undergoing an ''anemic'' business recovery.
''They see the writing on the wall,'' he said of those casting harsh judgments on the state. ''They see that we are on an unsustainable path.''
Even some supporters of the bill's spending priorities expressed alarm at the fiscal foundation underlying them.
''We applaud lawmakers for passing a budget that advances early education and health coverage and preserves supports for low-income families in the state,'' said Wade Gibson, a senior policy fellow at Connecticut Voices for Children. ''However, we are concerned about the budget practices employed to make things balance. A heavy reliance on borrowing and a variety of one-shot revenues will leave holes in future budgets. At the same time, multiple fund transfers and accounting changes obscure precisely how revenues and spending were brought into balance.''
While there are no new taxes, Republicans say the budget includes $316 million over the biennium in new tax revenues, in large part as a result of taxes that were continued after they were due to expire. Low-income workers would lose $21 million in tax relief next year because of a reduction in the state earned-income tax credit.
Other revenue will come from money from a various funds, including the state's transportation fund just as a gas tax increase, approved in 2005, that could raise $60 million kicks in. The budget would not have met the state's budget cap without taking the federal Medicaid financing out, but Democrats say the changes comply with the standard for states around the country in accounting for Medicaid.
Senator Jason Welch, a Republican from northwest Connecticut, said the budget was particularly disappointing because the tax increases two years ago were billed as both a hard pill to swallow and a panacea. ''It was a hard pill to swallow, but it certainly was no panacea,'' he said.

HEADLINE: When Billionaire Sets Rules, It's Exclusive Race

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Victory in the America's Cup of 2010 gave Larry Ellison, the tech titan who had spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to capture sailing's ultimate prize, the right to set the rules for this year's regatta.
Mr. Ellison, whose Silicon Valley software company, Oracle, has made him the world's fifth-richest man, decided to bring the race home to the postcard-perfect, television-friendly San Francisco Bay, promising a sporting event that would showcase the city and transform its waterfront. But another decision -- calling for the design of extremely expensive, sophisticated and fast 72-foot catamarans that would, for the first time in the history of the 162-year-old competition, fly above the water in high winds in a maneuver known as ''foiling'' -- immediately raised worries about cost and safety.
Now, with just weeks left before the start of competition, those worries could imperil the race's success. Only four teams have signed up because of the costs, the smallest contingent in the race's modern history and far fewer than the 15 organizers had predicted in selling the event to city officials hungry for its economic benefits. 
As a result, civic leaders are concerned that fewer contestants will mean less interest and, with fund-raising lagging, the city might even be stuck for a significant part of the tab.
Jane Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the city's America's Cup project, said San Francisco would ultimately benefit from the event. But she said fund-raising had been made difficult by sailing's lack of popularity in the United States and the sailing community's split over the new boats.
Under longstanding rules, the winner of an America's Cup competition, which is not held on any set schedule, is allowed to decide the next competition's location and boat design.
Aaron Peskin, a former member of the city's Board of Supervisors who has started an online campaign to pressure Mr. Ellison to personally cover the city's operating costs, offered a different explanation.
''Other well-to-do, philanthropic individuals and organizations aren't really interested in donating to the hobby of the third-richest person in the United States who's down to his last $40 billion,'' Mr. Peskin said. (Forbes Magazine estimates Mr. Ellison's wealth at $43 billion, ranking him behind only Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett in the United States.)
The more immediate concern is the dearth of contestants. Races to determine which nation will go up against Mr. Ellison's defending team are set to begin on the Fourth of July, with the final competition starting Sept. 7.
Artemis, the Swedish team, has not decided whether to drop out after its boat capsized during training last month in San Francisco Bay, killing a crew member; Mr. Ellison's team's boat was also wrecked when it capsized last fall, though without serious injuries. The teams are considering last-minute changes, including not racing if winds are too high and sturdier helmets and body armor, to improve safety.
And so even before the first race, organizers have begun acknowledging that the design choice for this year's yacht, known as the AC72, had been a poor one.
''There is no doubt that the AC72 was more expensive to manufacture and prepare for than we anticipated. When you couple that with the economic downturn that we experienced in 2010 and 2011, that's the reason we have fewer teams participating this summer than we would have liked,'' said Stephen Barclay, chief executive of the America's Cup Event Authority, the company established by Mr. Ellison to run the event, adding, however, that the boats are safe.
In San Francisco, an increasingly unaffordable city where critics say the booming tech industry has been coddled at the expense of the less affluent, criticism has been rising. Much of it has been leveled at Mr. Ellison, who recently appeared at a red-carpet premiere of ''The Wind Gods,'' a laudatory documentary about his 2010 victory that was produced by his son, David.
''Larry Ellison made the event so big that it made it really difficult for people to put teams out,'' said John Avalos, a member of the Board of Supervisors. ''Maybe it's going to result in Larry Ellison winning by default.''
Mr. Avalos, who voted for the event but now says its promoters' claims ''weren't true or exaggerated,'' recently led a hearing on the race's economic impact. Because the number of teams had fallen to four from the organizers' prediction of 15 in 2010, the Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimated that the event would generate $900 million in economic activity, compared with an earlier projection of $1.4 billion; attract 2 million spectators, instead of 2.7 million; and bring 6,500 jobs instead of 8,800.
Mr. Ellison's Event Authority last year also backed out of an original plan to spend more than $100 million to build boathouses and repair piers that the city and a succession of private businesses had failed to develop in the past two decades. In return, the Event Authority would have gained long-term rent credits and development rights to the refurbished waterfront. Instead, the city itself is now paying for about $22 million in waterfront upgrades.
What's more, the America's Cup Organizing Committee, a civic group created to raise money to offset the city's extra operating costs for the event, has struggled to meet its goals, leading Mayor Edwin M. Lee to campaign personally. The committee has raised $15 million -- of which $5 million are loans from the Event Authority -- out of its initial goal of $32 million, though the city's operating costs are now expected to go down with the size of the event, Ms. Sullivan said.
Mr. Ellison declined through a spokeswoman to comment for this article. But aides said that the AC72's problems could not be foreseen three years ago and that Mr. Ellison, in keeping with the innovation he has shown in the tech industry, tried to make the race more attractive to television by introducing the high-tech boats and bringing the race away from the open seas to the bay here.
''It's easy to blame him,'' said Russell Coutts, chief executive of Mr. Ellison's Oracle Team USA. ''They also say he was trying to drive costs up for competitive reasons despite all the cost-cutting that we did.'' He added that Mr. Ellison's cost-cutting measures, especially reducing the previous crew size from 17 members to 11 aboard the AC72, had kept overall costs down despite the expensive boats.
Given the AC72's problems, however, Mr. Coutts said it was clear that the competition must be made less expensive. ''In the future, I'm pretty sure that, no matter who wins, they'll go for a smaller boat,'' he said.
Each team has spent between $65 million and $100 million on this year's America's Cup, while the ''common view is that if you want to win, you have to spend $100 million,'' said Mr. Barclay of the Event Authority. Making the boats smaller, he said, would bring down costs to a more desirable $40 million to $50 million.
New Zealand's team, financed by its government and Emirates Airlines, is the only team not bankrolled by an individual billionaire. Artemis belongs to Torbjorn Tornqvist, the Swedish oil magnate, while Patrizio Bertelli, Prada's chief executive, is backing Italy's Luna Rossa.
In the most recent regattas, teams, on average, derived 40 percent of their budgets from wealthy individuals and 60 percent from commercial sponsors, said Scott MacLeod, a managing director at WSM Communications, a sports marketing firm.
''This one's ratio is 90-10,'' said Mr. MacLeod, who has represented corporate sponsors in previous America's Cups. ''Unless you're a billionaire, it's very difficult.''
Indeed, without a billionaire backer, the New Zealand team was scrambling to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to meet the new safety changes.
''We can't just snap our fingers and make one phone call to the boss,'' said Grant Dalton, the team's managing director. ''It's difficult, really difficult.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Manufacturing Gauge Falls to June 2009 Level

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A measure of United States manufacturing fell in May to its lowest level since June 2009 as slumping overseas economies and a pullback in business spending reduced new orders and production. 
The Institute for Supply Management said on Monday that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 49 last month, from 50.7 in April. That is the lowest level in nearly four years and the first time the index has dipped below 50 since November. A reading under 50 indicates contraction.
A gauge of new orders fell to 48.8, its lowest level in nearly a year. Production and employment also declined.
Manufacturing has struggled this year as weak economies abroad have slowed exports from the United States. Businesses have also reduced their pace of investment in areas like equipment and computer software.
At the same time, consumers are holding back on spending more for factory-made goods, possibly a reflection of higher Social Security taxes that have reduced paychecks this year.
A separate report Monday said a measure of Chinese manufacturing dropped last month to 49.2, from 50.4 in April. As with the institute's index, a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The figure added to signs that a resurgence of China's economy, the world's second-largest after the United States, might be losing momentum.
Europe remains mired in recession and is buying fewer American goods. In the first three months of the year, American exports to Europe fell 8 percent compared with the same period a year ago.
After a steep fall in March, companies in April stepped up their orders for United States machinery, electronic products and other equipment that reflect their investment plans. Overall orders for so-called durable goods jumped 3.3 percent in April from March.
Much of the April gain reflected more orders for commercial aircraft. But excluding the volatile transportation sector, which includes aircraft and autos, orders rose 1.3 percent in April, a big turnaround after a decline in March.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Buyers Behind the Rise In House Prices

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The last time the housing market was this hot in Phoenix and Las Vegas, the buyers pushing up prices were mostly small time. Nowadays, they are big time -- Wall Street big.
Large investment firms have spent billions of dollars over the last year buying homes in some of the nation's most depressed markets. The influx has been so great, and the resulting price gains so big, that ordinary buyers are feeling squeezed out. Some are already wondering if prices will slump anew if the big money stops flowing.
''The growth is being propelled by institutional money,'' said Suzanne Mistretta, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. ''The question is how much the change in prices really reflects market demand, rather than one-off market shifts that may not be around in a couple years.''
Wall Street played a central role in the last housing boom by supplying easy -- and, in retrospect, risky -- mortgage financing. Now, investment companies like the Blackstone Group have swooped in, buying thousands of houses in the same areas where the financial crisis hit hardest. 
Blackstone, which helped define a period of Wall Street hyperwealth, has bought some 26,000 homes in nine states. Colony Capital, a Los Angeles-based investment firm, is spending $250 million each month and already owns 10,000 properties. With little fanfare, these and other financial companies have become significant landlords on Main Street. Most of the firms are renting out the homes, with the possibility of unloading them at a profit when prices rise far enough.
While these investors have not touched many healthy real estate markets, they are among the biggest buyers in struggling areas of the country where housing prices have been increasing the fastest. Those gains, in turn, have been at the leading edge of rising home prices nationwide.
Some see the emergence of Wall Street buyers as a market-driven answer to the nation's housing ills. Investment companies are buying up rundown homes at a time when ordinary people can't or won't.
Nationwide, 68 percent of the damaged homes sold in April went to investors, and only 19 percent to first-time home buyers, according to Campbell HousingPulse. That is helping to shore up prices and create confidence in the broader markets.
''When people write the story of this housing recovery, these investors will be seen to have helped put the floor under the housing market,'' said David Bragg, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. ''In some of the key markets, that contributed to the recovery.''
The story, though, often looks more complicated on the ground. Joe Cusumano, a real estate agent in Riverside County, Calif., said that in recent months 90 percent of his business had been for companies like Invitation Homes, a Blackstone subsidiary. Home values in Riverside County have risen by 15 percent in the last year, according to CoreLogic.
But Mr. Cusumano said he wondered if faraway investors would properly maintain the homes they buy. He said that Invitation Homes had been willing to put money into the properties, but he was not so sure about the other players. He also worries what will happen when these investors start selling, as they inevitably will.
''The thing that scares me is the values going up so quickly,'' said Mr. Cusumano. ''That's what happened before and that's what's scaring me. Is this going to happen again?''
The idea of investors' buying homes and renting them out is nothing new. But in the past, landlords were almost always local. Now big investors are using agents like Mr. Cusumano to stake a claim to entire neighborhoods.
In a sign of the potential peril ahead, some of the investment firms have recently taken the first steps to cash out.
The investment fund financed by Colony Capital filed last week to go public, the second firm to do so in May. Another early player in the business, the Carrington Holding Company, said last week that prices had risen too far, leading the firm to begin selling some of its holdings.
Fitch Ratings warned last Tuesday that prices for single-family homes in the regions with the biggest housing rebounds had been outpacing the growth rate in the local economies and ''could stall or possibly reverse'' if big investors start selling.
''We see economies that continue to struggle -- we don't see them recovering enough to justify this drastic increase in prices,'' said Ms. Mistretta at Fitch.
Despite the recent gains, housing prices remain well below their precrisis highs. In Riverside, for example, home values are still down more than 40 percent from their 2006 records, according to CoreLogic.
To the extent that the housing rebound is becoming overheated in some pockets, it does not carry the most significant risks of the real estate boom that came crashing down in 2008. The new investment groups are not heavily indebted, making them less vulnerable to small movements in real estate values, and the risks are not spread as widely through the financial system.
Nearly all of the big investors have insisted that they plan to rent the houses they are buying for years to come. The Blackstone unit, Invitation Homes, has opened 14 offices across the country to serve the homes it has bought, a spokesman for the firm said.
At American Residential Properties, which went public in May, the chief executive, Stephen G. Schmitz, said that if other firms start selling their houses, ''we'll step up our buying.''
He added: ''We still think that we're in a buyer's market.''
Yet some investment companies are already pulling back in the markets that have had the fastest growth. In Phoenix, the percentage of all house purchases involving investors fell to about 25 percent in March from a high of 36 percent last summer, according to the Campbell HousingPulse Survey. The same survey shows that investors have been increasing their presence in new areas like Florida and California.
All of this has made it hard for house hunters like Jeff Martin, who is looking to buy a fixer-upper in Riverside County. Mr. Martin, 58, has made offers on 15 houses over the last year. Last Wednesday, he received his latest rejection. On most of the houses, Mr. Martin has lost out to investors offering all cash.
Mr. Martin, a retired Navy veteran, puts much of the blame on banks that have been holding onto empty houses, lowering the supply of available homes. He said he has trouble faulting the investors, given that he was involved in real estate financing during the last boom. But he is worried that if mortgage rates begin to rise he will lose out on his opportunity to buy. Rising mortgage rates could also lead to a broader slowdown in the real estate recovery.
Mr. Cusumano said that the investors he works for have been trimming back their purchases in the area. His agency closed on three houses for investors in May, down from eight in February.
But the fevered pitch of the market has not died down.
In late May, one of his clients closed on a house just a month after it went on the market. There were eight bidders, despite a listing that said ''NEEDS TLC!!'' Mr. Cusumano's client won the house only after agreeing to go $500 over the asking price of $194,500.
''It's just a strange market,'' he said. ''We are in uncharted territory.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pyongyang Losing Grip on Economy

BYLINE: By JOHN RUWITCH and JU-MIN PARK | REUTERS

 BODY:
CHANGBAI, China -- Chinese renminbi and U.S. dollars are being used more widely than ever in North Korea instead of the country's own money, a stark illustration of the extent to which the North Korean leadership under Kim Jong-un has lost control of the country's economy.
The use of dollars and renminbi has accelerated since a disastrous revaluation of the North Korean currency, the won, in 2009 wiped out the savings of millions, according to experts on the country, defectors and Chinese border traders.
On the black market, the won has shed more than 99 percent of its value against the dollar since the revaluation, according to exchange rates tracked by Daily NK, a Seoul-based news and information Web site focused on North Korea. 
North Korea is one of the most closed countries in the world, so it is difficult to determine what effect this could ultimately have on Mr. Kim's regime.
But experts say the growing use of foreign currency is making it increasingly difficult for Pyongyang to implement economic policy, resulting in the creation of a private economy outside the reach of the state, which may be able to rein it in only with draconian measures.
For now, Pyongyang appears to be capitulating, rather than trying to stamp out foreign currency use, they said.
Estimates of how much hard foreign currency is in circulation vary, but an analyst at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul put the total value at $2 billion in an April study. By comparison, some estimates say North Korea's gross domestic product is $21.5 billion. Pyongyang does not publish economic data.
The use of dollars and renminbi is so pervasive that there is little Pyongyang can do about it, said Marcus Noland, a North Korea expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. The government will increasingly have to force people to provide goods and services to the state and accept payment in won, added Mr. Noland, who studies the North Korean economy.
''It's been a tug of war for 20 years, where the state would like to get control of the economy, to quash the market and to get everyone to use the North Korean won, but it just doesn't have the capacity to do any of those things,'' he said. ''It just makes it harder and harder for them to govern. Nobody wants what they're selling.''
In the Chinese town of Changbai in Jilin Province, just across the border from the North Korean city of Hyesan, one Chinese trader said North Korean officials he dealt with wanted renminbi more than anything else, even food.
The Chinese currency they earn from doing business quickly gets circulated into Hyesan, a city of about 190,000 people whose industry-based economy has slumped since the 1990s.
The trader, who sells products including medicine and tea in Changbai, declined to be identified because he did not want to jeopardize his business or endanger his North Korean partners.
In April, Daily NK posted video that it said had been shot secretly in February at an open-air market in Hyesan. The shaky footage showed vendors openly quoting prices in renminbi for products like gloves and jackets, and one accepting payment in the currency.
Pyongyang has waged periodic campaigns to try to stop the use of foreign currencies, but with no success.
North Korea made circulating foreign currency a crime punishable by death in September 2012, the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights said in a report last month.
Another group, Human Rights Watch, recently interviewed more than 90 defectors who had fled North Korea in the past two years about the punishments they had received for economic crimes. None said they had been penalized for using or holding hard currency.
Nevertheless, ordinary North Koreans are very careful.
''I have heard multiple stories of people hiding foreign money under the floorboards in the house, or burying it up the hill in the woods out back,'' said one person in northeastern China who has lived in Pyongyang and regularly interacts with North Koreans. ''Nobody puts it in the bank because nobody trusts the government.''
Faith in the North Korean won crumbled when Mr. Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, ordered the sudden revaluation of the currency in November 2009.
At the time, the government simply removed the last two zeroes from the value of its new bank notes and limited the amount of old money that could be exchanged for new cash. The move, seen as an attack on private market activity, prompted a rush to hold hard foreign currency.
It also increased inflation and, according to the South Korean spy agency, set off rare civil unrest in one of the world's most entrenched authoritarian states, after North Koreans realized the won was not a safe store of value.
U.S. dollars have circulated in North Korea for decades, partly because of the cash siphoned off from official foreign trade.
The rise in the use of renminbi is a more recent phenomenon and reflects a surge in trade and smuggling between North Korea and China along their 1,400-kilometer, or 870-mile, land border, where a lot of the currency physically changes hands. Official trade with China is worth $6 billion annually.
Black market rates illustrate how far the won has fallen since the revaluation. It has plunged from 30 won per dollar to about 8,500 won per dollar, according to exchange rates tracked by Daily NK. The current official exchange rate is about 130 won per dollar.
Daily NK relies on people in North Korea who report every two weeks on rates in Hyesan, Pyongyang and the city of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong.
In border areas, about 90 percent of transactions occur in hard currency, said Christopher Green, Daily NK's manager of international affairs. Elsewhere, foreign cash accounts for 50 percent to 80 percent of transactions in private markets, he estimated.
North Koreans increasingly refer to prices in foreign currencies, Dong Yong-sueng, senior fellow at the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, wrote in the April study on the use of foreign currency in the country.
Prices were marked in U.S. dollars for beer, university preparation courses and apartments, Mr. Dong wrote.
In 2000, the South Korean central bank estimated foreign currency in circulation in North Korea at $1 billion. Today, Mr. Dong estimates that figure has doubled to $2 billion. About half was in U.S. dollars, 40 percent in renminbi and 10 percent in euros, he told Reuters.
It was not possible to estimate the amount of North Korean won in circulation, Mr. Dong added. But he estimated that North Korea's informal economy had become bigger than the formal, state-led economy.
''Without foreign exchange, the economy would stop functioning,'' Mr. Dong said.
John Ruwitch and Ju-min Park are Reuters correspondents. Ju-min Park reported from Seoul.

HEADLINE: U.S. Adds To Its List Of Sanctions Against Iran

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The Obama administration escalated sanctions pressure against Iran on Monday for the third time in a week, taking actions that could further weaken the country's already-devalued currency and seriously disrupt its automotive industry, a significant domestic employer and revenue generator for the Iranian government.
The latest actions, contained in an executive order effective July 1, were a response to what a White House statement called Iran's ''continued failure to meet its international obligations,'' a reference to its disputed nuclear energy program, which Iran has called peaceful and Western nations call a guise to achieve the ability to make atomic bombs. 
Talks aimed at resolving that protracted dispute have stalled in advance of Iran's presidential elections in less than two weeks, and the leading candidate, Saeed Jalili, is Iran's top nuclear negotiator. He has said that the country will never compromise on the nuclear issue and that the sanctions will have no effect.
Under the executive order, President Obama authorized sanctions on any foreign financial institutions that conduct ''significant transactions'' in the Iranian rial, the national currency, or maintains rial accounts outside Iran. While the United States and European Union have taken other steps that severely limit Iran's ability to conduct financial transactions, the administration's action is the first time that the rial itself has been directly targeted for sanctions.
''As of July 1, significant transactions in the rial will expose anyone to sanctions,'' said an administration official briefing reporters in a telephone conference call. ''It should cause banks and exchanges to dump their rial holdings.''
The rial already has lost half its value from a year ago in part because of the cumulative effects of other economic sanctions, which have made it far costlier for Iran to import goods. Inflation has accelerated in Iran, and many people are worried that the rial could weaken further. The objective of the new sanction, the administration official said, is to ''make the rial essentially unusable outside of Iran.''
The executive order also authorized sanctions against any companies or individuals who do business with Iran's automotive industry, essentially adding that industry to Iran's shipping, shipbuilding and energy sectors, which have already been targeted under a sanctions law that took effect last year.
The sanctions generally freeze American assets of targeted Iranian businesses or individuals and prohibit them from commerce with any American companies or citizens. Foreign companies that help Iran evade the sanctions can also face severe reprisals, including a ban on doing business in the United States.
Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington group that supports tough sanctions, said the automotive sanctions could have serious consequences for Iran, where the automotive industry is one of the biggest employers. Sanctions advocates in the United States also contend Iran's automotive industry is a major procurement network that imports material and technologies used to build uranium centrifuges instead of cars.
Last week, the United States blacklisted companies in Iran's petrochemical industry for the first time and issued sanctions against more than 50 Iranian officials for what the administration called their efforts to stifle political dissent in Iran.
Critics of the sanctions policy say it has done nothing to weaken the Iranian government's resolve and may be having the opposite effect. Trita Parsi, the founder of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based group that opposes the sanctions, pointed to Iran's intransigence on the nuclear issue, its more aggressive stance in military aid to the Syrian government and a State Department report last week that asserted Iran's support for terrorism is at its highest in 20 years.
Despite the sanctions, Mr. Parsi said, ''Iran has moved in the wrong direction on every front.''

HEADLINE: Conservatives Giving Lhota Party's Spot On the Ballot

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The Conservative Party of New York State endorsed Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican, for mayor on Monday, all but ensuring that Mr. Lhota and his chief rival for the Republican nomination, John A. Catsimatidis, will both carry their campaigns into the November general election. 
Mr. Catsimatidis was endorsed last month by the Liberal Party.
In an announcement in front of City Hall, the chairman of the Conservative Party, Michael R. Long, said that Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a deputy mayor in the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, was the only candidate who shared the party's positions on keeping taxes low and making the city safe.
Mr. Lhota said he was proud to run on the Conservative Party's line, saying he was focused on ''making sure that we maintain all of the advances that we've made over the last 20 years, with an enhanced quality of life, sound fiscal policy, reduced crime.''
Mr. Lhota has described himself as a libertarian, and some of his views -- he supports same-sex marriage and the legalization of marijuana -- clash with those of the Conservative Party.
''Joe and I have talked at great length on all the issues, and it's very clear that there are differences between the two of us, but this is not a race about social issues,'' Mr. Long said when asked about these different views.
''This is about the future of the city of New York,'' he added.
Asked if he would run on the Conservative Party line in November even if he lost the Republican primary, Mr. Lhota answered that he would, but added that he considered it a hypothetical question.
''I will win the Republican nomination,'' he said. ''There's no question in my mind about that.''

HEADLINE: Mozart and Haydn? He's Jazzed

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
A magical moment arrives in every concert I have seen involving the conductor Nicholas McGegan, and it comes before any music has been made. It happened on Saturday night as the Orchestra of St. Luke's sat onstage at Carnegie Hall, ready for a program of canonical works by Mozart and Haydn. The stage door opened, and Mr. McGegan bounded out to the podium, beaming and exuding enthusiasm. This, not the opening bars of Mozart's Symphony No. 29 in A (K. 201), was the real start of the concert, which turned out to be one of the most appealing, satisfying performances I have heard this season. (The concert was originally scheduled for last November, but was postponed because of Hurricane Sandy.) 
Mr. McGegan is hardly the only charismatic conductor in the business. Still, there is something about his abundant zeal and affection that seems to enhance his work in the Baroque and Classical repertory he favors. Surely this has contributed to the enduring success of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, the San Francisco period-instrument ensemble he has directed for 27 years.
What's more, Mr. McGegan's early-music expertise translates readily to modern-instrument settings, as has been proved by his memorable encounters with the New York Philharmonic. Pairing him as a guest conductor with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, an ensemble that plays virtually everything authoritatively and stylishly, is as close to a sure bet as can be found on a New York stage.
Mr. McGegan's tempos in the Mozart symphony were brisk but not driven, his dynamics keenly shaded and attention-grabbing. Everything about this account felt just right, including silken, muted strings in the Andante; springy rhythms in the Menuetto; and splendid work from the oboes and French horns throughout.
In Haydn's Cello Concerto No. 2, Mr. McGegan was an alert partner for the soloist, Steven Isserlis, whose ebullience rivaled the conductor's. Mr. Isserlis played with fiery dexterity and swashbuckling vivacity. In solo lines he pushed and pulled at the tempo, but in ensemble passages he was in perfect accord.
Where the first half of the program showed Mozart and Haydn at their most engaging, the second half highlighted each composer's ingenuity. Mozart's ballet music for the opera ''Idomeneo'' offered a reminder of his unparalleled knack for vivid, economical aural dramaturgy; Haydn's Symphony No. 99 in E flat showed why his innovations were the model for all that followed. Mr. McGegan again elicited superb work from his players, earning a loud, long ovation.
The Orchestra of St. Luke's performs next on June 22 at the Caramoor Summer Music Festival, Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, Katonah, N.Y.; (914) 232-1252, caramoor.org.

HEADLINE: Weak Reports Have a Silver Lining, and Shares Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
For now, bad news is good for the stock market.
Investors judged that the latest weak economic reports would make it more likely that the Federal Reserve would continue to stimulate the economy and support a rally on Wall Street.
On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said that a measure of United States manufacturing fell in May to its lowest level since June 2009 as overseas economies slumped and weak business spending reduced new factory orders. 
The index of manufacturing activity fell to 49 last month, from 50.7 in April. That is the lowest level in nearly four years and the first time the index has dipped below 50 since November. A reading under 50 indicates contraction.
That helped convince investors that the Fed would not slow its $85 billion bond-buying program. Speculation that the central bank was ready to ease that stimulus program, a major impetus for this year's rally in stocks, has caused trading to become volatile in the last two weeks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell in the morning after the manufacturing report was published at 10 a.m. It moved between gains and losses for much of the day, then climbed decisively in the last hour of trading.
The good-news-is-bad-news interpretation of economic reports may support stocks in the short term, but the economy has to keep improving for stocks to reach new highs, said Alec Young, a global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.
''This was a big miss on the I.S.M. report,'' Mr. Young said. ''Regardless of what it means for the Fed, ultimately you're buying a stream of earnings and you want to see the economy doing well.''
Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, helped allay investors' concerns that the central bank was poised to stop the stimulus. He told Bloomberg Television on Monday that Fed officials remained committed to the stimulus program.
Manufacturing has struggled this year as nations with weak economies have slowed imports from the United States. Europe remains in a recession and is buying fewer American goods. In the first three months of the year, American exports to Europe fell 8 percent compared with the same period a year ago.
Businesses have also reduced the pace of investment in areas like equipment and computer software. A gauge of new orders fell to 48.8, its lowest level in nearly a year. Production and employment also declined.
A separate report on Monday said a measure of Chinese manufacturing dropped last month to 49.2, from 50.4 in April. As with the institute's index, a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The figure added to signs that a resurgence of China's economy, the world's second largest after the United States, might be losing momentum.
The S.& P. 500-stock index climbed 9.68 points. to 1,640.42, up 0.59 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 138.46 points, to 15,254.03, a gain of 0.92 percent. The Dow got a lift from Merck, which rose nearly 4 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, rose 9.45 points, to 3,465.37, an increase of 0.27 percent.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note barely changed from late Friday, closing at 2.13 percent, with the benchmark up 1/32, to 96 20/32. The yield climbed as high as 2.17 percent in early trading, then fell as low as 2.09 percent after the manufacturing report was released.
Despite the advance Monday, signs are emerging that this year's rally may be starting to falter. The S.& P. 500 index closed higher for a seventh straight month in May, but the index also logged its first back-to-back weekly declines since November. On Friday, the Dow plunged 208 points, its worst drop in six weeks. The Dow is still up 16.4 percent this year, and the S.& P. 500 is 15 percent higher.

HEADLINE: Statements to F.B.I. by Detained Terror Suspect Are a Focus at Another Man's Sentencing

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
He was known as ''the Doctor,'' an Egyptian terrorism suspect who was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a foreign country where he had been held since his arrest. From the start, he made utterly clear his hatred for the United States, describing how he had even recruited a Brooklyn man to conduct surveillance of the New York Stock Exchange for a possible attack.
Now, four years after that interrogation, the detainee's statements are at the center of a dispute in federal court in Manhattan, where the Brooklyn man, Sabirhan Hasanoff, 37, who was later arrested and pleaded guilty to supporting terrorism, faces sentencing this month. 
Prosecutors want to use the detainee's claims about Mr. Hasanoff's assistance to Al Qaeda as part of an argument that he should receive a maximum 20-year prison sentence. Mr. Hasanoff's lawyers contend the statements are unreliable, in part because the detainee was quite likely tortured while in foreign custody before he met with the F.B.I.
The dispute highlights the debate over the admissibility and reliability of testimony from detainees who are held outside the civilian court system.
Publicly filed court documents do not identify the witness or the country where he was held, although the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has said in a filing that he was based in Yemen and held a senior position with Al Qaeda there.
The F.B.I. summaries also quote the witness as saying that in the mid-1990s, he swore an oath of allegiance to an Egyptian Islamic Jihad leader whose description fits that of Ayman al-Zawahiri, who later became deputy to Osama bin Laden, and his successor. The witness also spent time with Bin Laden in Sudan.
Prosecutors have told the judge, Kimba M. Wood, in a sentencing memorandum that the defense claim that the witness was most likely tortured in foreign custody was ''pure speculation,'' and his statements were corroborated through F.B.I. interviews with another detainee and a cooperating witness, and other evidence.
Joshua L. Dratel, a lawyer for Mr. Hasanoff, said on Monday that although he could not identify the country in question because it was under seal in the case, the claim of torture was based on reports by the State Department and Amnesty International, which ''have repeatedly noted the problem of mistreatment of detainees, including torture,'' in that country.
Mr. Dratel said of Mr. Hasanoff, a dual citizen of the United States and Australia, ''This episode represents a mistake that he regrets, that he pleaded guilty to and that he is trying to move beyond, recognizing his error.'' Prosecutors had no comment.
The 2009 interrogation of the witness, as recounted in highly redacted F.B.I. summaries, show that the agents said they were not seeking to charge him, but rather wanted to learn about a group of American terrorism suspects, including Mr. Hasanoff, and others. (A co-defendant of Mr. Hasanoff's, Wesam El-Hanafi, has also pleaded guilty in the case.)
They worked to build a rapport with him: he was given water, juice and food, and regular prayer breaks. One day, he was treated to a traditional dinner at a ''safe house'' that was attended by investigators from both countries, the summaries say.
By the time the agents finished their first of five interviews with the witness, he had eaten a Kit Kat bar and was hugging and kissing them on the cheek.
He was open about his views, the summaries note. ''As a seasoned jihadi,'' the F.B.I. wrote, ''the subject had long hoped for an opportunity to create an attack on U.S. soil.''
''The subject is very clear in his desire to attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests anywhere and feels completely justified in his hatred of the U.S. and its policies,'' the summary added.
During the interviews, the witness was shown photographs of senior Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad members, and explained how he used Internet cafes to search the news on the Web because he did not have access to the Internet at home. He also explained that he wanted to have ''Americans travel to America to conduct terrorist operations.'' And he talked about making the New York Stock Exchange a target, the summaries show.
''The subject had very little idea about the stock exchange, i.e. its location, security measures, size, etc.,'' the F.B.I. wrote, ''but advised that his motivation to do an attack there was because it represented to him the world's economy, so it was a highly desirable target.''
He told the agents that in 2008, he gave Mr. Hasanoff an assignment, through his co-defendant, Mr. El-Hanafi, to conduct surveillance of the exchange. Mr. Hasanoff visited the exchange, but the witness said he was ultimately not happy with Mr. Hasanoff's report, the summary says.
''Subject reported that he tore up the report and 'threw it in the street' and never showed it to anyone,'' the F.B.I. said.

HEADLINE: Yen Falls Past A Milestone As the Rally In Japan Ebbs

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Less than a month after the yen breached 100 to the dollar, celebrated as a milestone for this export-loving economy, the yen is back on the wrong side of that symbolic threshold. Shares traded in Tokyo have lost 15 percent of their value since May 23, as a euphoric rally suddenly gave way to nerve-racking market swings. 
It is still too early to tell whether the recent southward turn in Japanese markets is a temporary correction, or whether it is the end of the road for a spectacular rally that seemed to foreshadow a resurgence of the Japanese economy after years of deflation and disappointing growth.
But the market retreat reflects a growing anxiety among investors over the program of bold monetary stimulus, fiscal spending and economic reforms instituted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, intended to help Japan break out of its economic stupor. The yen, made weaker by these policies, made Japanese exports more competitive globally.
''Until May 23, all attention was on how far the market could rise. But within a week, everyone is talking about how far it could fall,'' Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, wrote in a research note published Monday.
The wild market gyrations, Mr. Fujito said, threatened to make predictions from even the most seasoned of market experts almost meaningless.
''Turning to analysts who said just a week ago that stocks might rise to 18,000, or 20,000, is hardly an effective mood-stabilizing move,'' he said. At times like these, investors might be wise simply to ''wait and see.''
Early Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index, which is trading around 13,000, slipped 0.5 percent in the opening minutes before a slight rebound, then appeared to lose direction, slinking back into negative territory.
On Monday, the index fell 3.7 percent, the fourth rout in eight days. The dollar was trading at 99.43 yen, after the Japanese currency strengthened overnight, crossing over the 100 yen mark against the dollar for the first time since early May.
Other, immediate factors have propelled recent market moves, analysts say, including comments from United States Federal Reserve officials that seemed to suggest a tightening of monetary policy later this year; a rise in long-term interest rates in both the United States and Japan; profit-taking by overseas hedge funds and other foreign investors who had piled into Japanese equities; and high-frequency trading that has magnified market swings.
But there has also been an increasingly cold-eyed analysis of the risks of Mr. Abe's economic push. Japan's central bank has seemingly been caught unaware by volatility in long-term interest rates, brought about by its pump-priming and large-scale purchases of government bonds.
The government pushed through a sizable budget last month, but in the eyes of many investors, that is more of the same from a country that has long poured money into public projects, staving off a deeper decline but with little to show toward long-term, sustainable economic growth.

HEADLINE: Why Health Care Costs Are So High

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The American College of Gastroenterology is disappointed that ''The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill'' (''Paying Till It Hurts'' series, front page, June 2) unfairly casts outsized blame for high medical care costs on colonoscopy and by extension on gastroenterologists.
The roots of the problem of high medical costs are many, varied and complicated. The fact that the article focuses attention on the one and only preventive cancer test that has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the incidence of colon cancer and death from the disease is disappointing. The evidence suggests that colonoscopy is a public health success story. 
Indeed, an article in The Times last year, ''Report Affirms Lifesaving Role of Colonoscopy,'' reported on a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine that showed a 53 percent decline in deaths for patients who underwent colonoscopy and had precancerous polyps removed.
The American College of Gastroenterology is proud to have led the way on the issue of advancing colorectal cancer screening by colonoscopy. This is the test we recommend for our friends and family, as well as our patients. It is correct that there are screening strategies other than colonoscopy and likewise there are varied patient preferences, so while colonoscopy is our preferred screening strategy, we agree that the best test is the one that actually gets taken.
RONALD J. VENDER President American College of Gastroenterology New Haven, June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
I suspect that if physicians were salaried there would be a substantial decrease in the number of medical procedures performed, including colonoscopies. Money has an insidious way of biasing medical judgment. When physicians profit from every procedure, it is too easy for some to justify it as in the patient's best interest even when sound clinical judgment argues the contrary.
Second: There is a yawning and unjustifiable gap between payment for procedures and consultations. When I spend an hour to an hour-and-a-half with a patient who brings a stack of medical records and many imaging studies, I must often answer to Medicare for charging its highest consultation fee, which is but a fraction of the amount allowed for endoscopy.
Third: Overcoming an American culture that believes that more medical testing is better is a daunting challenge.
There is so much that is wrong with the byzantine and arbitrary way our doctors and hospitals are paid, and so many powerful entrenched interests arguing for the status quo, that it's easy to be pessimistic about meaningful reform.

To the Editor:
Your series on the high cost of medical care in the United States will perform a valuable service if it causes us to behave as consumers of medical services rather than as children of authoritative parents, as we currently do. There is a telling quote from a patient in your article: ''If a doctor says you need it, you don't ask.''
Attitudes like that need to change. Of course you ask. You ask why. You ask if there are other options. You ask how the results will affect your treatment. And you should be able to ask what it will cost.
The advertising slogan ''An educated consumer is our best customer'' applies to medical services as much as any other product or service. We have a responsibility to participate in our care.
CLAIRE BURSON New Milford, Conn., June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
''The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill'' suggests that the causes for high procedure costs are profiteering and no transparency. While this is true, the article doesn't address another major reason for price inflation: cost shifting from the uninsured and inadequately covered.
Many nonprofit hospitals are in the red as the ''market'' (insurance company contracting) demands discounted rates, and the uninsured are given services as mandated by law. Health care now exists in the worst of two worlds -- for-profit exploitation and, unlike any other ''market,'' an obligation to give care at no cost to the uninsured.
The only solution: Medicare for all, a national health insurance that eliminates needless profiteering and stealth subsidies.
SARA HARTLEY Oakland, Calif., June 2, 2013
The writer is a psychiatrist.
To the Editor:
At age 50, I had a routine colonoscopy, recommended by my physician and fully covered by my insurance. When a copy of the bill arrived in the mail, I knew the temptation of simply looking for a zero balance and filing it away.
I actually examined the bill and found a whopping charge for an office visit. So I called the gastroenterologist's office and informed it that I never had an office visit. The billing clerk calmly explained that my insurance policy covers one office visit before the procedure. I learned that my ''office visit'' consisted of a perfunctory conversation I had with the doctor while I was wearing a paper gown, lying on an operating table and in a fog, minutes before he did the deed.
I tried to challenge this absurd billing to both the doctor and my insurance company, and got nowhere. If it's paid for, why should I care? I do care.
THOMAS P. ROBERTS Lawrenceville, N.J., June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
Your article rightly questions why an anesthesiologist is required for a colonoscopy. I would go further: No sedative of any kind is needed, in many if not most cases. In my experience, the procedure does not involve any pain, and scarcely any discomfort.
I have had several colonoscopies, all without a sedative. I insist in advance that it be that way. I can drive myself home afterward and go about my normal business for the rest of the day.
DONALD D. BREED Providence, R.I., June 2, 2013
To the Editor:
''The $2.7 Trillion Medical Bill'' creates an underlying distrust between patients and physicians that will do little to fix the admittedly broken American health care system and potentially adversely affect the quality of patient care.
Portraying doctors as overly concerned with financial advancement plants seeds of skepticism in patients when a successful physician-patient relationship rests upon unwavering trust. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopies not because of their profitability but because of their efficacy in colon cancer prevention.
Your article may serve as a deterrent for patients to follow their physician's advice.

HEADLINE: Teachers Ask About Mission They Lived By

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
There are few more pleasurable ways to pass an hour than to talk with veteran teachers who burn with a passion for their chosen work -- lighting bonfires in the minds of children.
I sat last week in a hilly playground off University Avenue in the Bronx with Eloise Pescador Martinez, 58, and Richard DeZonie, 61. They have taught for three decades each at Holy Spirit School, down the street. ''Long ago I came to the realization,'' Mr. DeZonie said, ''that I love that look in a child's eye when you've reached him.''
Ms. Martinez nodded, emphatic. ''I love it!'' she said. ''We're family, generation after generation of family.'' 
Their family is being torn asunder. In a few weeks, the Archdiocese of New York will shutter their school, 1 of 25 to close this year. Their children will be dispersed. A few veteran teachers will find toeholds in a shrinking Roman Catholic system. Many will be cut adrift, middle-aged wayfarers in a bad market. For their decades of modestly paid work, the diocese offers this parsimonious going-away gift: Teachers can choose a $5,000 severance check or six months of health coverage. Not both.
So which will it be? Ms. Martinez's daughter has asthma -- she'll opt for insurance. Mr. DeZonie's wife teaches at Holy Spirit as well; he'll take the insurance and she'll take the money. ''Man, it's not much after three decades, no it really isn't,'' he said.
Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan projects a jovial official face of Catholicism in this city. He can crack a joke with practiced timing. At the recent conclave in Rome, where bishops and cardinals paraded about in glorious raiment, he was regarded as quite the comer.
Back home, the Catholic Church and the archdiocese give the appearance of an empire sunk in financial despondency. Church attendance and school enrollment has tumbled for decades.
Some of the financial problems are owing to the church's own lies and omissions around the sexual abuse scandals involving priests.
Cardinal Dolan and his school superintendent, who declined to comment, twice cut the system close to the bone in recent years, eliminating nearly 60 schools. They have sold off and leased real estate, raising many millions of dollars.
The superintendent, Timothy J. McNiff, said recently that the diocesan schools were stable. There's a survivor's comfort to be had in that. But you wonder what becomes of those who have turned to the beacon that has been Holy Spirit, an elementary school that sits atop the bony spine of the Morris Heights neighborhood. Generational waves of immigrants, Italians and Irish, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, Mexicans and Ghanaians, have come through its doors.
The tuition at Holy Spirit is a pittance compared with a Dalton or a Brearley. And the archdiocese deserves credit for subsidizing these costs. But for a Ghanaian immigrant working two jobs and pulling down $25,000 a year, that tuition looms as a mountainous sum.
Any talk of subsidy, however, must include the teachers. A parochial school veteran with 20 years of service and a master's degree makes $60,000; that's a touch above the starting pay for a public-school teacher. Nor are parochial school pensions remotely comparable to those of public-school teachers.
That's O.K., sort of. Ms. Martinez, who first spoke to me one evening after choir practice, talked easily of their mission. But this is a city grown more expensive by the week, and the gap between the wealthy few and the middle-class many who scrape by gets wider.
Ms. Martinez is divorced and has twice dipped into her small retirement savings for her daughter's tuition. She sprints paycheck to paycheck. ''I always said I didn't get into this for the money,'' she said. ''I guess I was right.''
Sacrifices are easiest when shared. No one likes to think of themselves as naïve. Last time, the archdiocese said it had set aside $7.4 million for a ''teacher transition plan.'' That was sophistry.
The diocese spent $600,000 on severance the last time it closed schools. It appears to have counted its payments into unemployment insurance to pad that package.
''I've told my landlord I'm facing a layoff,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''I want to know: Where's that Catholic mission we have lived with all of our lives?''
We walked back down University Boulevard toward the Romanesque tower of the school. We passed children, who smiled, waved and shouted out her name. ''I try to separate my faith from the institution,'' she said slowly. ''My faith now? It's those children.''

HEADLINE: A Smart Change in Iran Policy

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The Obama administration has made a useful modification to its Iran policy by lifting sanctions on companies that want to sell cellphones, laptops, encryption software and other similar technology to ordinary Iranians. This should improve the ability of Iranians to circumvent their government's unrelenting crackdown on dissenting opinion and communicate with each other and the outside world without reprisal. 
The decision, announced by the State and Treasury Departments on Thursday, is a departure from the administration's general approach, which over four years has been to increase sanctions in an effort to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear program.
The Obama administration has definitely not repudiated that approach. Along with the technology decision, it also announced sanctions on an Iranian company, a government agency and nearly 60 individuals accused of human rights abuses related to political repression. On Friday, for the first time, eight Iranian petrochemical companies were sanctioned; penalties were also levied against a company based in Cyprus and Ukraine that is accused of trying to evade Iran-related sanctions.
More sanctions are likely. But the decision to permit the export of personal communications technology suggests a welcome willingness on Washington's part to reduce the burden of the sanctions on ordinary Iranians. The directive bans sales to anyone in the government or on the sanctions list.
So far, the sanctions have failed to force Iran to make a deal on its nuclear program, which is advancing steadily toward a bomb-making capability. But the sanctions have badly damaged the country's economy, and ordinary Iranians, not just the government, are paying a price.
The technology decision, which comes two weeks before Iran's presidential election, inserts the United States into Iranian politics on the side of political freedom in a way the Obama administration did not during the last election in 2009. That election was denounced as fraudulent by the Iranian opposition, which, using various social networking services and Web sites, staged months of protests that, in turn, triggered a vicious government crackdown.
Just what impact the technology decision might have on the presidential election on June 14 is unclear. Most opposition leaders remain under house arrest, imprisoned or otherwise silenced; only eight candidates, handpicked by the state's Guardian Council, have been allowed to run for president.
There could be delays in exporting hardware, but software updates and access to instant messaging and other online programs could be made available quickly.
This should have been done sooner. Tensions beween Iran and the United States -- over Syria and terrorism, as well as the nuclear program -- will almost certainly get worse, barring some unexpected new policies in Tehran. But America will be in a stronger position if it is seen as standing with the Iranian people.

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Tuesday about lifting United States trade sanctions on sales of cellphone technology to Iran incorrectly described the new policy on commercial sales. It permits commercial sales, but not to anyone in the government or on a list of sanctioned companies and individuals.

HEADLINE: Proposition 13 at Age 35

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The California voter initiative was cited as the vanguard of a nationwide tax revolt, but its main effect has been a loss of power for local governments, not a reduced tax bite, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Thirty-five years ago this week, on June 6, 1978, California voters approved an amendment to the state constitution known as Proposition 13. It cut and capped property taxes in the state and remains in effect today. 
Prop 13, as it came to be known, arose from three developments. First, California was a high-tax state, in no small part because of huge tax increases enacted by Gov. Ronald Reagan. One of his first acts in office in 1967 was to ask for a $1 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in state history, equal to one-third of state revenue. Reagan also supported further tax increases in 1971 and 1972. State revenue tripled on his watch, to $8.6 billion from $2.9 billion, in eight years.
Second, home prices in California rose very rapidly in the 1970s. Because property taxes were assessed on market value, any increase in home prices led automatically to higher property taxes even if the tax rate was unchanged. Many Californians were literally being taxed out of their homes.
The third important development leading to Prop 13 was a state Supreme Court decision, Serrano v. Priest, which equalized per-pupil school spending in the state. This meant that the higher taxes homeowners paid no longer benefited their own children. According to research by William A. Fischel, an economist at Dartmouth, the strongest support for Prop 13 came from school districts adversely affected by Serrano.

Two tax activists, Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann, organized a petition drive to get Prop 13 on the ballot and were successful in early 1978. In an article on April 14, 1978, The New York Times reported that support for the initiative was weak and that it was strongly opposed by the business community, which feared higher business taxes would result from a cut in property taxes.
The Times also cited an analysis by economists at the University of California, Los Angeles, that enactment of Prop 13 would sharply raise the state unemployment rate, to 6.7 percent from 5.9 percent under their best-case scenario.
Nevertheless, two-thirds of California voters supported Prop 13 despite the dire warnings of devastation to government services by both Republican and Democratic state leaders. This quickly led to talk of a nationwide tax revolt. A New York Times/CBS News poll in June 1978 found strong support for tax and spending cuts throughout the country, at both the federal and state and local government levels.
Prop 13 unquestionably bolstered the efforts of Representative Jack Kemp, the Republican of New York for whom I worked, and Senator William Roth, Republican of Delaware, to enact a big federal income tax cut. Within weeks of Prop 13's enactment, the Senate Finance Committee held hearings on their legislation. Other tax cutting initiatives, such as a proposed cut in the capital gains tax led by Representative Bill Steiger, Republican of Wisconsin, also benefited. Indeed, the Steiger bill was enacted by Congress in November against strong opposition from President Carter, who ultimately signed the bill, an acknowledgment of the strong tax-cutting sentiment among Americans.
A year later, there was little evidence that the dire predictions of devastation from Prop 13 had materialized. A state budget surplus cushioned the blow to local governments and fees increased, but over all there were no signs that government services were significantly reduced.
On the first anniversary of Prop 13, an article in The New York Times found that the principal impact was on the way people talked about government: "After June 6 there was less emphasis on tax reform and more on cutting back the tax burden, less on innovation and social justice and more on fiscal accountability, less on enrichment of programs and more on questioning their productivity."
By 1983, it was apparent that a huge shift in power resulted from Prop 13. More local funding decisions were made in Sacramento, as the state government picked up responsibilities that could no longer be financed at the local level because the property tax was the principal revenue source for local governments.
On the 25th anniversary of Prop 13 in 2003, William Fulton and Paul Shigley, editors of the California Planning & Development Report, asserted that Californians had lost a great deal of control over their local governments as a consequence. As they wrote in The Los Angeles Times:
The most important - and peculiar - side effect of Proposition 13 has been to tether local governments to Sacramento, turning them into lobbyists and dragging them into the annual budget debate. Proposition 13 was intended to empower the people against tax abuse by the government. But, paradoxically, it also took the power to determine what to do with the property taxes away from local governments.
In the old days, property taxes were high, but at least you could have a debate at your local city hall about how much they would be increased and what the money would be used for. No more. Proposition 13 says that the allocation of the property taxes among local government entities is a decision to be made by the governor and the Legislature.
In the immediate aftermath of Prop 13, the combined state and local government tax burden in California dropped to 10 percent from 12 percent of income. But over the years, it has crept back up. According to the conservative Tax Foundation, California was the fourth most heavily taxed state before Prop 13 and is still the fourth most heavily taxed state, with total state and local taxes at 11.2 percent of income.
While California's property tax remains lower than it was before Prop 13, other states generally did not follow its lead. According to the Census Bureau, property taxes nationwide raise almost exactly the same amount of revenue today as they did in 1978 - 3 percent of the gross domestic product in 2010 compared with 2.9 percent in 1978.
A 2008 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that Prop 13 remained overwhelmingly popular, supported by 59 percent of the state's residents, with only 27 percent opposed.
Prop 13 once loomed large, but over time its historical importance has shrunk.

HEADLINE: Reagan for Health Care Reform

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican governor of Ohio, John Kasich, said the G.O.P.&#8217;s favorite president would have expanded Medicaid. 

 BODY:
With many right-wing politicians dead set against expanding Medicaid, the Republican governor of Ohio, John Kasich, needed cover for going along. Facts and figures and kindness surely weren't enough, what with his colleagues comparing health care reform to a "hostage" situation. But in an op-ed for USA Today he settled on a great excuse: It's what Ronald Reagan would have done. 
Reagan, Mr. Kasich asserts, was "fiscally responsible, but he was also pragmatic and compassionate."
The patron saint of the Republican party, who approved tax increases in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987, also signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to provide emergency health care to anyone who needs it, regardless of citizenship or ability to pay. And Reagan broadened Medicaid's reach. As Mr. Kasich notes, in 1986 he let states add poor children and pregnant women to the program.

So Reagan would surely have approved of Mr. Kasich pushing to extend "health care coverage to 275,000 low-income Ohioans," a move that would spare "hospitals the effects of looming cuts in federal funding for uninsured care" and prevent "additional projected increases in health insurance costs."
The arguments for expanding Medicaid should stand on their own. Ezra Klein and Evan Soltas, summarizing a Rand corporation study in today's Washington Post, explain that "states rejecting the expansion will spend much more, get much, much less, and leave millions of their residents uninsured." But if an appeal to authority gives Mr. Kasich room to maneuver, then by all means.

HEADLINE: The Return of McMansions

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Construction of new homes plummeted during the housing bust. But where there has been building of single-family homes in recent years, the homes have been getting bigger. 

 BODY:
Construction of new homes dropped off a cliff during the housing bust. But where there has been building of single-family homes in recent years, the homes have been getting bigger. 
On Monday the Census Bureau released new data on the characteristics of homes built in 2012. Here's a look at building over the last 40 years, to give you a sense of how sharp the decline in residential construction really was:
For a few years now, though, the size of the typical home built has been growing. For single-family homes, median size rose to 2,306 square feet in 2012, the highest median square-footage for single-family homes since the government began keeping track in 1973.
And the number of bedrooms has gone up, too. In 2012, 41 percent of the new homes built had at least four bedrooms, the highest share on record. The median newly built house still had three bedrooms, though.
The share of new single-family homes with at least three bathrooms also reached a new high of 30 percent.
I should note that the same trends don't hold true for newly completed multifamily housing units. Units built for sale are getting bigger, but the median size of units being built for rent - which represent the vast majority of all multifamily construction - ticked downward from 2011 to 2012.

HEADLINE: Crunchtime for China's High School Seniors

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: Friday and Saturday will be momentous days for millions of Chinese families, but not because of the upcoming California summit meeting between President Obama and China&#8217;s new leader, Xi Jinping. 

 BODY:
Friday and Saturday will be momentous days for millions of Chinese families, but not because of the upcoming California summit meeting between President Obama and China's new leader, Xi Jinping.
On those two days, high school seniors from around China will sit for the annual college entrance examination, called the Gaokao in Chinese. Most Chinese students prepare for years under intense pressure, and families spend huge amounts on tutoring and after-school study sessions. While increasing numbers of Chinese students go overseas for college - nearly 200,000 went to North America for the 2011-12 academic year - the vast majority have no option for higher education but to do well on the national exam. 
 Cheating is a concern; last year 1,500 people were arrested on suspicion of selling equipment including "clear-plastic earphones, wireless signal receivers, and modified pens, watches, glasses and leather belts." This year, one province has banned anything that "makes the metal detector beep," including bras with metal clasps. 
As with just about everything in China, there are too many people competing for a scarce resource. And through the household registration (hukou) system, the college entrance process is biased in favor of urban applicants. 
The Economist this week has an excellent article on urbanization that examines some of the social barriers to expanding urbanization (last week's China Insider column looked at some of the political and financial obstacles):
The hukou perpetuates a rigid caste system. Children of holders of rural hukou inherit their parents' second-class status, even if they are born in cities. Many urbanites want to keep this system in place, to protect their preferential access to jobs, education and health care.
Getting into college, however, does not guarantee a good job upon graduation, especially this year. Seven million students who succeeded at the Gaokao four years ago are now looking for work in the toughest job market ever.
While those millions of Chinese students are sweating through the two-day test, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi will be talking in the California desert, in their first meeting since Mr. Xi succeeded Hu Jintao.
The venue for the United States-China summit meeting, Sunnylands, the former estate of Walter and Lee Annenberg, is an inspired choice that will allow the two leaders to have focused discussions in an informal setting. California will be the last stop in Mr. Xi's Americas tour that has included visits to Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica and Mexico.
The agenda has not been disclosed, but it is likely the topics of discussion will include cyber issues, North Korea, maritime issues including the South China Sea and the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, Iran, Syria, and trade and the economy. 
More important than any specific agenda item is that the two leaders build some sort of rapport. As Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing and previously a National Security Council official in the administrations of both the George W. Bush and President Obama, told Bloomberg News:
"What these two leaders need to do is really begin to establish a working relationship. ... The biggest problem we have had in our interaction with China is that it has been very stilted, and very much in accordance with scripted talking points."
The meeting should have political benefits for Mr. Xi, as it will likely show him as a down to earth, confident, global statesman, in marked contrast with the style of his predecessors. One "senior Obama administration official" told The Wall Street Journal that "there is a lot more hope ... the previous government was more 20th century. The new team seems to be more 21st century."
President Obama is under increasing pressure from Congress to show progress on cybersecurity, but we should not expect any breakthroughs. The United States and China have agreed to hold talks on hacking, but it is not clear that the Chinese government understands how serious this issue has become on Capitol Hill and the effect it may have on the relationship:
A new, bipartisan Senate measure, for example, calls for the creation of a "watch list" of foreign countries engaging in cyber espionage. For the worst offenders, the president could "block imports of certain categories of goods if they benefited from the stolen U.S. technology or proprietary information," explained Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) in a letter to Obama last week.
"I thought you could refer to this bill in your meeting with President Xi as an example that the U.S. will indeed impose real costs on China should they continue to steal our intellectual property," added Levin, who promised he would seek action on the bill this year.
 THE NEW FOREIGN POLICY MANTRA for the Chinese government is building "a new type of great power relations." The meaningis not yet clear, but it is probably safe to assume that it involves a relative diminution of American power vis a vis China. While there are many positive aspects to the United States-China relationship, including bilateral trade that may exceed $450 billion in 2013, managing the rise of China is going to require statesmanship and strategic thinking that, given the partisan politics in Washington, could be lacking. 
I have two suggestions for the summit meeting organizers. First, Peng Liyuan and Michelle Obama will be with their husbands at Sunnylands, and it would be great if there were a global initiative on which they could cooperate. 
Second, given the proposed acquisition of Smithfield Foods by Shanghui International, serve some Smithfield Ham.

HEADLINE: After JPMorgan, Staley Sizes Up Banks for Hedge Funds

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: James E. Staley, who left JPMorgan Chase this year to join the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, said on a panel at the Bloomberg Hedge Funds Summit that the regulatory changes being developed could present an investment opportunity. 

 BODY:
As the head of JPMorgan Chase's investment bank, James E. Staley helped the company navigate the thicket of new regulations that emerged after the financial crisis.
Now, he is betting that those regulations present an investment opportunity. Mr. Staley, who left JPMorgan this year to join the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management as a managing partner, said on Tuesday that European banks would have to adapt as regulators remained concerned about the problem of too-big-to-fail lenders. 
On a panel at the Bloomberg Hedge Funds Summit in New York, Mr. Staley discussed what is known as resolution authority, in which regulators help wind down failing banks. The process of adapting to these new rules, he said, would give banks a "more clearly defined capital structure," creating opportunities for investors.
 "There's going to be tremendous mispricing between the different levels of the capital structure in these banks," Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, said on the panel.
European leaders are currently developing a system for dealing with failing banks, as part of a broader effort to unify the Continent's financial oversight. This system may involve the creation of a new body, according to a news report this week.
While he did not discuss JPMorgan Chase, which is the largest United States bank, Mr. Staley mused on the general issue of big banks that had to be rescued in the financial crisis.
"It's inherently unstable to give liquidity to depositors and invest money for seven years," he said. "But society thought it was important enough that, to give stability, they put the government behind the banks."
But because banks have gotten so big, he said, "the government can't stand behind banks anymore."
BlueMountain, a firm that has done business with JPMorgan over the years, was one of the hedge funds on the other side of the so-called London Whale trade, in which the bank lost billions of dollars. The chief executive of BlueMountain, Andrew Feldstein, previously worked at JPMorgan.
Some hedge funds have been lining up to buy assets that European banks are forced to sell to comply with new regulations. One participant of the panel on Tuesday, Victor Khosla, the chief investment officer of SVP Global, said Europe was like "El Dorado."
"This is the opportunity of the moment," Mr. Khosla said, discussing the prospect of long-term gains to be had from investing in European assets.
Mr. Staley also gave his thoughts on the economic situation in Europe, expressing cautious optimism.
"I personally think tremendous progress has been made both in Europe and the U.S.," he said.
Later, he added, "It's very hard to bet against a central bank."

HEADLINE: Libertarian Populism and Its Limits

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Some thoughts on a potential path to Republican reform. 

 BODY:
I recommend reading Peter Suderman's entire post on the relationship between libertarianism and what I've been calling "reform conservatism," but the ending, especially, is very perceptive about the state of play on the American right today:
... part of the reason why conservative reformers of various stripes have gotten so much attention recently-eventually, something will have to fill the [current Republican policy] void. The agenda Douthat outlines is perhaps one possibility, and simply because it's a basically coherent policy outlook might even be preferable in a lot of ways to the sort of short-term thinking that grips the GOP right now. But although it has a number of high profile supporters, so far it doesn't seem to be having much success in the actual halls of power. Indeed, if there is an upstart reform movement in the Republican party that actually seems to be gaining traction at the moment, it's the one that draws more from the libertarian side of the right than from Douthat's brand of lightly technocratic soft-social conservatism. 
Part of the reason the Rand Pauls of the world have had some success recently is that there's space for an anti-establishment faction within the Republican party, and a growing frustration with the arrogance and ineffectiveness of the old guard. But that faction has also-though not always consistently-drawn from two important, and related, libertarian insights: that government, especially large and complex government, is not a very effective tool for doing lots of things, and that, as a result, it's not a terribly useful tool for achieving big-picture social goals. I'm tempted to say that it embraces a politics of difference, but that probably goes a little too far. Instead, it embraces a politics of privateness, one that assumes, as a given, that the public realm, and public policy, can only accomplish so much, and that they should be limited accordingly. It's another, still-evolving brand of conservative reformism, one that also says it cares-not by what it tries to do for you (or to you), but by what it promises it won't.
I think this is right. To the extent that there's a Big Idea for where the G.O.P. should go from here that has any real traction within the party (as opposed to among right-of-center pundits) and that doesn't just reflect the self-interest of the G.O.P.'s big donors, it's probably what Ben Domenech has termed "populist libertarianism" - a strain of thought that moves from the standard grassroots conservative view of Washington as an inherently corrupt realm of special interests and self-dealing elites to a broader skepticism of "bigness" in all its forms (corporate as well as governmental), that regards the Bush era as an object lesson in everything that can go wrong (at home and abroad) when conservatives set aside this skepticism, and that sees the cause of limited government as a means not only to safeguarding liberty, but to unwinding webs of privilege and rent-seeking and enabling true equality of opportunity as well.
This is a Tea Party idea from 2010, in a sense, but it's been given more heft by figures like Senator Paul and by potential 2016 contenders like Bobby Jindal, and its imprint is visible across a range of policy debates: The return of right-wing civil libertarianism and the re-emergence of an anti-interventionist spirit on the right, the sympathy among some grassroots conservatives for proposals like the Brown-Vitter banking overhaul, the (pre-existing but expanding) conservative interest in prison and sentencing reform, the Congressional G.O.P.'s willingness (and eagerness, in some quarters) to accept defense spending cuts, the federalist turn on issues like gay marriage and marijuana. From the design of the sequester to the emerging design of Dave Camp's tax reform, Republicans are plainly more willing to take on right-leaning interest groups (defense contractors, Wall Street) than they were a few years ago. And since the 2012 election, at least in some quarters, they've also become more likely to frame their arguments for limited government, not as briefs against the menace of socialism, but as defenses of the little guy - or the small organic farmer, to lift from of the more arresting passages from Paul's recent Reagan library speech.
As the foregoing probably suggests, I see a lot to like about this populist libertarianism, and some of its impulses and tendencies (on pot and gay marriage, in particular) have a clear political wisdom even if I don't necessarily share them. I've written favorably about Rand Paul in the past, and I expect to do so again: He's exactly the kind of principled political entrepreneur that moribund parties need. And a G.O.P. remade along libertarian-populist lines - more anti-interventionist abroad, suspicious of big government and big business at home - would be a much more interesting party, and in certain ways a more constructive force in American politics, than the G.O.P. that Mitt Romney led down to defeat last fall.
But could it win a presidential election? And would it deserve to? Right now I think the answers are no and no, because its broader economic agenda - to the extent that it exists - would be both politically untenable and mistaken on the merits. Consider, for instance, Senator Paul's budget blueprint, which offers the following five big planks:
1) A balanced budget amendment, requiring deeper cuts to discretionary spending than Paul Ryan's budget contemplates.
2) A flat tax.
3) The repeal of Obamacare, without any sort of alternative reform on the horizon.
4) An end to the Federal Reserve's (supposedly) inflationary policies.
5) Entitlement reform.
To be clear, I'm not saying this is the populist libertarian agenda, or associating it with Suderman or Domenech, both of whom I suspect would have some disagreements with it. But right now, it is an agenda that's backed, in outline at least, by many of the G.O.P. politicians and activists who fit the category they describe. And as a blueprint for policy reform, it's just not sufficiently responsive to the actual problems facing most Americans today.
Item 4 is straightforwardly wrongheaded: A recipe for slower growth, shading into stagnation, at a time when inflation is the least of the West's economic problems. Items 1 and 2 are somewhat more defensible in theory - there are versions of a flat tax that would be preferable to our current code, and versions of a balanced budget amendment that might have a positive impact on how Washington does business - and I'm very much in favor of Item 5. But put the three together along the lines that many Republicans in this camp tend to envision, and add the repeal-without-replacement of Obamacare as well, and you have a reform of the welfare state that would dramatically reduce the tax burden for the wealthiest Americans while dramatically stripping down benefits and tax breaks for the poor and working class - and which would do all this, crucially, after a long era in which the rich have already been doing just fine (to put it mildly), while wages have grown more slowly for the middle class, the employer-based health insurance system has begun to unravel, and mobility from the bottom has probably weakened.
Would a majority of Americans vote for this combination? I doubt it. Should a majority of Americans vote for it? No, I don't think they should. Principle matters, but context matters too, and conservatives simply cannot make economic policy successfully (or credibly cast themselves as a populist party on these issues) if they ignore the actual performance of the American economy over the last generation, and if they refuse to see that distributional issues as well as arguments from efficiency and liberty have to play a role in the way that we reform our tax code and our welfare state.
It is not a surrender to big government to recognize that cutting the top tax rate was a better idea in Reagan's era than in ours, or that making the tax code more regressive is a counterproductive response to recent trends in working class life, or that some federal programs are better targets for spending cuts and caps than others. It's an accommodation to reality - and one that libertarian populism, for all its promise as answer to the G.O.P's malaise, has yet to adequately make.

HEADLINE: Calculating Apple's True U.S. Tax Rate

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Apple&#8217;s chief has said that the company paid about 30.5 percent in taxes on its profits. The author examines cash tax payments to the Treasury Department and estimates that it&#8217;s probably closer to 8.2 percent. 

 BODY:
One lesson from the Senate hearing about Apple's offshore tax planning is that figuring out what a multinational company actually pays in taxes is harder than it should be. At the risk of sounding Clintonesque, it depends on what the meaning of "pays" is. 
"The way I look at this is that Apple pays 30.5 percent of its profits in taxes in the United States," Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said at the hearing. The statutory rate for companies is 35 percent, and in theory the government taxes corporations on their worldwide income at that rate. Mr. Cook explained that Apple paid less on a global basis because its profits generated abroad were taxed at a lower rate than in the United States. 
The way I arrive the real taxes paid by Apple is a little different. As Bloomberg News highlighted recently, Mr. Cook's calculation is based on a badly distorted measure of United States income. 
The whole point of the Senate hearing was to show how Apple shifts substantial amounts of its economic profits from the United States to Ireland, where they are taxed at a rate close to zero. Those profits are then sheltered in Ireland and untaxed unless Apple decides to bring the cash back to the United States.
These overseas profits create deferred tax liabilities that will not be taxed until the cash is repatriated. But Apple is reluctant to repatriate its overseas cash; it would rather lobby for another tax holiday and bring the cash back tax-free. An added benefit of a tax holiday for Apple is that it would provide a quick jump in reported earnings when the accounting entry for the deferred tax liability is reversed. 
My point is that politicians and voters are interested in a very different question than Apple's shareholders. Shareholders are indifferent to whether a dollar of tax is paid to the Treasury Department or to a foreign government and credited in full by the American tax system. Either way, it's a dollar that won't be distributed to the shareholders. 
But as voters we care about actual dollars flowing to the federal government. You can't finance a food stamp program with foreign tax credits.
Most of us think of paying taxes as writing a check to the government or having money withheld from a paycheck. By this common sense measure, how much tax does Apple actually pay? 
The number can be calculated from the company's tax return, but tax returns are not public. Felix Salmon of Reuters has suggested that public companies file their tax returns with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The problem is that many companies would resist disclosing information that could offer competitors insight into company strategy, including tax avoidance strategies. 
It's sometimes possible to dig through a company's filings and figure out the amount of cash paid in taxes, but accounting conventions make the task onerous and imprecise. It shouldn't be this hard. 
Here's my suggestion. Congress should require every large American company to disclose to the public a simple number each year, which I would call the "true U.S. tax rate": (1) the amount of cash tax payments to the Treasury Department divided by (2) worldwide pretax book income. To account for fluctuations, we might calculate this number over a three-year period.
According to the Senate report, Apple paid $5.3 billion to the Treasury Department in the fiscal years 2009 to 2011. Its worldwide pretax book income over that period was about $65 billion. Thus, Apple's "true U.S. tax rate," according to my own calculation, was 8.2 percent.
Companies might complain that this figure is deceptive, as it does not account for foreign taxes paid and credited in the United States, or book-tax differences like accelerated depreciation. But so what? 
The point of the disclosure is to allow voters and policy makers an easy way to understand how well the tax system is working and what each corporation contributes to the public coffers.
An earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to Mr. Cook's estimate of Apple's 2012 tax liability. It does not include deferred tax liabilities. According to Mr. Cook's written testimony, the estimate was based on "a reflection of federal taxes Apple paid against U.S. pretax earnings, not a calculation of Apple's final tax liability for FY 2012."

HIGHLIGHT: Chevrolet has announced pricing for its SS performance sedan and Bonhams auction house says it had its best Greenwich sale ever over the weekend. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Chevrolet has announced pricing for its new SS performance sedan. The 415-horsepower LS3 6.2-liter V-8-powered SS, which Chevrolet says will go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 5 seconds, will have a starting price of $44,470. But Chevrolet says there will only be one model - the only options available for the car are a $900 power-operated sunroof and $500 full-size spare tire. (General Motors) 
 Daniel Kim has a vision for personal transportation. The San Francisco Bay area entrepreneur, who was once a Land Rover mechanic, created a fully enclosed, all-electric two-wheel vehicle he said he thought could be the next thing for commuters: the C1. Unlike a motorcycle, the C1 has a pair of computer-controlled gyroscopes mounted below the driver's seat that keep the vehicle upright, even when it is not moving. Mr. Kim got the inspiration for the C1 traveling around Asia, where he noticed that many people travel exclusively on motorcycles. If it ever makes it into large-scale production, Mr. Kim estimates that the C1, which has a 200-mile range, a 120 mile per hour top speed and a 6 second 0 to 60 time, could sell for about $12,000.

 With diesel prices around $4 per gallon and natural gas prices down around $3, some trucking companies in Nevada are considering converting their fleets to operate on natural gas. The conversions would cost about $30,000 a truck, and companies would most likely use natural gas-powered trucks for local shipping, enabling their trucks to be refueled at a home base equipped with natural gas infrastructure. The change comes as many carriers are adding a fuel surcharge to shipping fees because of high fuel prices. Walmart and UPS are among the companies that have already made the switch. (Fox Reno)
 Bonhams, the New York City-based auction house operating at the Greenwich Concours d'Élégance in Greenwich, Conn., last weekend, said it had its biggest Greenwich auction ever this year. The sale brought in $5.6 million, with a few cars topping the three quarters of a million mark. Two of the highlights were a 1930 Bugatti Type 43 Supercharged Sports that sold for $875,000, and a 1967 Aston Martin DB6 Vantage Volante, formerly owned by the conductor Leonard Bernstein, which brought $825,000. All told, Bonhams sold more than 100 cars. (Bonhams)
 Car and truck sales rose 8 percent in May, with trucks outpacing other sectors at 11 percent. Trucks' higher profit margins have been a boon to American auto sales over all, and demand for pickups amid a spike in home building continues to soar. Detroit's Big Three own North American truck sales, with Ford's F-150 retaining the best-seller mantle it has worn since the 1970s. (The New York Times)
 While American car sales have been on the rise, Europe's have lagged in the first half of 2013. The financial crisis continues to impact the economy there, most recently leading to a decrease in French car sales. Government subsidies tempered the decline in Spain, one of the Eurozone's hardest-hit economies, but sales still diminished there, by 17.3 percent for Volkswagen and 46 percent for Renault. In France, Opel sales slid 25 percent and Ford's by nearly 17 percent. Commercial vehicles sales were even more dismal, dimming the outlook for recovery. (The Economic Times)

HEADLINE: Gallup Identifies Factors That Led to Its G.O.P. Skew in November

BYLINE: MARJORIE CONNELLY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Gallup Organization has identified a series of factors that contributed its overestimation of support for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, including problems with its survey sample and methodology, according to an in-depth analysis of their procedures released on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
The Gallup Organization has identified a series of factors that contributed to its overestimation of support for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, including problems with its survey sample and methodology, according to an in-depth analysis of its procedures released Tuesday. 
Gallup was widely criticized about the results of its pre-election polls, and the review found that the way likely voters were defined, the telephone numbers that were called as well as their geographic distribution, and how people were asked about their race adversely affected Gallup's presidential surveys. 
At a meeting of journalists and pollsters on Tuesday, Frank Newport, the editor in chief of Gallup, outlined the testing the company had done with assistance from methodologists at the University of Michigan, which is known for its survey research program. Mr. Newport conceded that "there is something going on in the industry, and Gallup was at the bottom of that" in the 2012 election. Gallup has said that it is committed to transparency as the organization continues to test the way it conducts polls.
The review, led by Mr. Newport and Michael Traugott of the University of Michigan, was conducted by a team of statisticians, methodologists and analysts from Gallup, assisted by outside consultants. After identifying more than 20 possible elements that could have been related to the Republican skew in Gallup's polls, the team isolated four factors as the likely causes. 
Gallup's model in identify those most likely to vote - a series of seven questions - seemed to have failed in 2012, and the organization is re-evaluating its formula for ranking voters who will turn out. 
Just as technology has changed the way campaigns work, it has altered the way survey researchers gather data. A change in the way that Gallup called respondents on land lines may have been a contributing factor that led to its sample to be older and more Republican. Half of their respondents, however, were reached on cellphones - a proportion that is at or above industry standards. 
In addition, there were too many respondents from certain time zones. In the South and the Midwest, there were more respondents from the Central Time Zone, which tends to be more Republican, than the Eastern Time Zone, which skews Democratic. 
Finally, the way Gallup asked callers about their race overrepresented some groups. 
Individually, none of the four problems is considered to have been a significant factor in the results, but taken together, they helped lead to an overestimation of Mr. Romney's share of the vote. Gallup plans to use the governor's races this fall in New Jersey and Virginia to test new election polling methods. 
"We hope to be at the accurate end of the spectrum in the future rather than the uncomfortable position that Gallup was in last year," Mr. Newton said.

HEADLINE: A Study Makes It Official: New York Is the Most Competitive City

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A study, conducted for Citigroup by the Economist Intelligence Unit, ranked 120 cities on their competitiveness, based on their ability to attract investments, workers and tourists, among other attributes. 

 BODY:
Anyone who has tried to park a car on a Manhattan street may already have deemed New York the world's most competitive city. A new study concluded that it is and will stay that way for at least another 12 years. 
The study, conducted for Citigroup by the Economist Intelligence Unit, ranked 120 cities around the globe on their competitiveness, based on their ability to attract investments, workers and tourists, among other attributes.
New York ranked third among the cities in economic strength, the category given the most weight in the analysis. It ranked second in "institutional character," a measure of order and political stability. The accumulation of the high rankings in various categories helped propel New York to the top of the list.
"New York is at the top of the list in terms of financial sophistication," said Leo Abruzzese, global forecasting director for the Economist Intelligence Unit. New York "still remains in many ways the financial capital of the world."
But Mr. Abruzzese added that the city's economy is less reliant on one or two industries than many other big cities around the world. That economic diversity has given New York a big head start on many of the cities in emerging nations, but some of them are closing the gap, he said.
 While New York and London are projected to stay ahead of Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo through 2025, some fast-growing cities will become more formidable challengers, the study concluded. Taipei, for example, is forecast to move up to 11th place from 25th. Doha is predicted to leap 14 spots to become one of the world's 25 most competitive cities by 2025, the study said.
Chicago was projected to remain the second most-competitive city in America, ranking ninth in the world in 2025.
The costs of living and doing business in New York City are high, but not as high as in some others, including London and Tokyo, Mr. Abruzzese said. New York's most glaring weakness has been in the management of the environment and preparation to cope with storms and other natural disasters, he said. 
 "New York doesn't do well in environmental performance or natural hazards," Mr. Abruzzese said. "Certainly that was reinforced last year with Sandy."

HEADLINE: A County in Alabama Strikes a Bankruptcy Deal

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Jefferson County reached an agreement to refinance most of the debt that led to its $4.2 billion municipal bankruptcy, the largest such filing in United States history. 

 BODY:
Jefferson County, Ala., took a big step toward resolving its historic bankruptcy case on Tuesday, saying it had reached an agreement to refinance most of the debt at the heart of its financial breakdown.
The refinancing would save the county hundreds of millions of dollars and position it to emerge from bankruptcy in a matter of months, according to people briefed on the negotiations. But the terms must still be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge, and the county must clear several other hurdles before it can emerge from bankruptcy. Lawyers for the county are scheduled to present details of the agreement in federal bankruptcy court in Birmingham on Wednesday.
 The deal, according to the people briefed on the negotiations, covers about $2.4 billion of Jefferson County's total $3.078 billion in sewer debt, which was issued to pay for significant repairs needed to bring the county into compliance with federal clean water laws. 
The interest due on the sewer debt shot up during the financial turmoil of 2008, and the repayment schedules accelerated sharply, leaving the county unable to pay. The repairs went unfinished as well.
The county also had other debt outstanding when it declared bankruptcy, for a total of $4.2 billion, making it the biggest municipal bankruptcy in United States history.
Governmental bankruptcies are rare and usually involve small single-purpose authorities and districts, not large, complicated counties with a lot of debt. Experts in public finance have been watching Jefferson County closely to see what kind of legal precedent it will set. Some were concerned that the successful application of Chapter 9 bankruptcy rules to municipal debt could cast a pall over the municipal bond market.
Residents of the county, for their part, have worried that they would bear the brunt of the bankruptcy, through lower property values or higher taxes or rates paid for county services.
The refinancing agreement covers debt held by creditors that include JPMorgan Chase, which holds about $1.22 billion of the sewer debt, the biggest block; three bond insurers; and seven hedge funds, according to a term sheet circulated in a meeting of the county commission on Tuesday.
The terms call for these creditors to receive about $1.84 billion for the $2.4 billion of debt they now hold. The concessions were weighted most heavily toward JPMorgan, the term sheet said, "to increase the recovery of other sewer creditors."
The bank is giving up $842 million, or about 70 percent, of the face value of its debt, according to people briefed on the negotiations. Just before declaring bankruptcy in 2011, the county abruptly rejected a previous package of concessions that called for JPMorgan to give up about $750 million.
JPMorgan was widely expected to make big concessions as part of any bankruptcy settlement, because some former officials of the bank were found to have been involved in improprieties in connection with a county debt refinancing in 2002 and 2003. That refinancing involved a complex package of variable-rate bonds and derivatives called interest-rate swaps.
A lawsuit by the county against JPMorgan over the improprieties, still active in state court, would be resolved as part of the proposed agreement. In 2009, JPMorgan agreed to forgive all the termination fees the county owed on the swaps, or about $647 million, to settle a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank also paid the county $75 million under the same settlement.
Despite those concessions, residents of Jefferson County have still often complained that they were treated inequitably because several of their elected officials went to prison as a result of the refinancing, while no one from the bank was convicted of a crime. They have railed in particular against the possibility that their sewer rates would go up to allow the county to pay sewer debt that many now see as illegitimate.
On Wednesday, the federal bankruptcy judge, Thomas B. Bennett, is also scheduled to hear arguments in a lawsuit arguing that much of the debt was issued in violation of the state Constitution and should be voided, not restructured or repaid.
In addition, the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee for small creditors, has asked Judge Bennett for a full independent review of the sewer system's finances, as well as what it has called "poor planning, gross incompetence, waste, graft, corruption or fraud in connection with the construction, repair or rehabilitation" of the sewer system since 1997.
The term sheet indicated that the sewer fees for county residents would indeed rise, by 7.41 percent a year for the first four years of the refinancing deal. After that, they could rise by as much as 3.49 percent a year, depending on variables like inflation and new federal clean-water regulations.
Still, members of the county commission said the new agreement was significantly better than what they could have won without the bankruptcy filing. The five-member commission approved the terms in a 4-to-1 vote.
If the refinancing goes forward, the county's public creditors on the sewer debt will be offered a choice: either 80 cents for every dollar of sewer debt they now hold, if they relinquish all other claims, or 65 cents on the dollar with the right to pursue their own claims, either against the county or its bond insurers.
An earlier version of this article misstated the potential increase in sewer fees for residents of Jefferson County, Ala., under a refinancing deal. After four years, they could rise by as much as 3.49 percent a year, not 3.94 percent, depending on variables like inflation and new federal clean-water regulations.

HEADLINE: Welfare for the Wealthy

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Farm Bill is impenetrable, important and worthy of our outrage. 

 BODY:
The critically important Farm Bill [1] is impenetrably arcane, yet as it worms its way through Congress, Americans who care about justice, health or the environment can parse enough of it to become outraged. 
The legislation costs around $100 billion annually, determining policies on matters that are strikingly diverse. Because it affects foreign trade and aid, agricultural and nutritional research, and much more, it has global implications.
The Farm Bill finances food stamps (officially SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and the subsidies that allow industrial ag and monoculture - the "spray and pray" style of farming - to maintain their grip on the food "system." 
The bill is ostensibly revisited, refashioned and renewed every five years, but this round, scheduled to be re-enacted last year, has been in discussion since 2010, and a final bill is not in sight. Based on the current course of Congress it seems there will be an extension this fall, as there was in 2012. Extensions allow funding changes for individual "titles," as programs are sometimes called; last year's extensions didn't do much damage, but this year's threaten the well-being of tens of millions of Americans.

I routinely talk to people who monitor the Farm Bill, a task that's practically a full-time job. One is David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World, a principled anti-hunger group. Another is Craig Cox, a senior vice president at the Environmental Working Group, among the best NGOs on agricultural policy and just plain consumer advice regarding the various plagues of industrial agriculture. 
These people and many others are devoted to feeding the hungry, protecting the environment and boosting sensible agricultural policies, yet they avoid the fatalism that causes some to throw up their hands. 
The current versions of the Farm Bill in the Senate (as usual, not as horrible as the House) and the House (as usual, terrifying) could hardly be more frustrating. The House is proposing $20 billion in cuts to SNAP - equivalent, says Beckmann, to "almost half of all the charitable food assistance that food banks and food charities provide to people in need." [2]
Deficit reduction is the sacred excuse for such cruelty, but the first could be achieved without the second. Two of the most expensive programs are food stamps, the cost of which has justifiably soared since the beginning of the Great Recession [3] , and direct subsidy payments. 
This pits the ability of poor people to eat - not well, but sort of enough - against the production of agricultural commodities. That would be a difficult choice if the subsidies were going to farmers who could be crushed by failure, but in reality most direct payments go to those who need them least. 
Among them is Congressman Stephen Fincher, Republican of Tennessee, who justifies SNAP cuts by quoting 2 Thessalonians 3:10: "For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat."
Even if this quote were not taken out of context - whoever wrote 2 Thessalonians was chastising not the poor but those who'd stopped working in anticipation of the second coming - Fincher ignores the fact that Congress is a secular body that supposedly doesn't base policy on an ancient religious text that contradicts itself more often than not. Not that one needs to break a sweat countering his "argument," but 45 percent of food stamp recipients are children, and in 2010, the U.S.D.A. reported that as many as 41 percent are working poor. 
This would be just another amusing/depressing example of an elected official ignoring a huge part of his constituency (about one in seven Americans rely on food stamps, though it's one in five in Tennessee, the second highest rate in the South), were not Fincher himself a hypocrite. 
For the God-fearing Fincher is one of the largest recipients of U.S.D.A. farm subsidies in Tennessee history; he raked in $3.48 million in taxpayer cash from 1999 to 2012, $70,574 last year alone. The average SNAP recipient in Tennessee gets $132.20 in food aid a month; Fincher received $193 a day. (You can eat pretty well on that.) [4]
Fincher is not alone in disgrace, even among his Congressional colleagues, but he makes a lovely poster boy for a policy that steals taxpayer money from the poor and so-called middle class to pay the rich, while propping up a form of agriculture that's unsustainable and poisonous.
Knowing that direct subsidy payments are under the gun, our clever and cynical representatives are offering a bait-and-switch policy that will make things worse, and largely replace subsidy payments with an enhanced form of crop insurance - paid for by us, of course - which will further reduce risks for commodity farmers. As Craig Cox explained, "The proposed crop insurance would allow - no, encourage - big farmers to plant corn on hillsides, in flood-threatened areas, even in drought-stricken areas, with subsidized premiums and deductibles, and see a big payout if" - should we say "when"? - "the crop fails or is damaged."
You should get such a deal on insurance: the premiums and deductibles are subsidized and there's no limit to what can be paid, so bigger farms and bigger risks reap bigger rewards in the event of failure, even if that was a failure of judgment. [5]
Even without boosting the program, crop insurance payments came in at a whopping $17 billion last year. That was unusually high because of the drought, but only a climate-change denier believes that was the last drought we're going to see. And if you think any of this can be justified because it supports the insurance industry and creates American jobs ... well, no: most of the subsidized insurance providers are based offshore.
We are so used to welfare for the wealthy that most of us, sadly, shrug it off. But a Farm Bill extension does give an opportunity to end direct subsidy payments, rein in crop insurance, and protect the programs that are critical to our national identity and benefit those who deserve it.
It's a simple solution, says Cox: "The legislators could decide not to reauthorize direct payments and invest some of the savings in good programs while still hitting budget reduction targets." The Congressional Budget Office reports that this action would save about $5 billion per year, far more than the proposed potential savings of cutting SNAP and other beneficial programs while enhancing crop insurance. (The Senate proposes saving less than $2 billion annually, the House just over $3 billion.)
In other words, without hurting conservation or poor people or foreign aid or progressive and traditional farming, you could achieve targeted savings simply by letting direct payments go away and refusing to boost the crop insurance scam.
Boosters of crop insurance on steroids simply want a government guarantee of farm revenue. Maybe you don't want to scream "communism!" but it's the type of guarantee that no other industry in this country would dare to dream of.
Avoid fatalism: Call your representative (or at least support those agencies that are doing so) and insist that payments to people like Fincher be ended without replacing them with other subsidies to big ag. Let's at least try to protect the poor, the environment and our national health. 
The alternative is to wait for the second coming. 
1. This year going by the fun names of "Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act" (House version) and "Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act" (Senate). Note that the titles tell us what matters to each of these bodies, and that food doesn't cut it in the House.
2. "People in need," by the way, outnumber food stamp recipients, since not everyone eligible for food stamps signs up. So really it's a bit worse than it sounds, and it sounds bad enough.
3. By design, it is precisely when people are falling economically that an economic safety net is most necessary, and food stamps are an entitlement: if you qualify, you get 'em, no matter how big the budget line grows.
4. It actually gets worse. Here's Fincher quoted in the International Business Times: "[T]he role of citizens, of Christians, of humanity, is to take care of each other," Fincher said at a Memphis event last week. "But not for Washington to steal money from those in the country and give it to others in the country. Our role is out of control."
5. So: Buy the most expensive car you can afford, even one you can't afford. Premiums and deductibles are cheap. Wearing a seat belt and a helmet, wreck it. Voilà!

HEADLINE: Playing Politics With Student Debt

BYLINE: By LAMAR ALEXANDER, TOM COBURN and RICHARD BURR. 
Lamar Alexander, Tom Coburn and Richard Burr are Republican senators from Tennessee, Oklahoma and North Carolina, respectively.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- THIS summer, more than nine million undergraduates will take out an average of $6,700 each in federal loans to pay for college next year. They will borrow, on average, $24,803 to earn their degrees. While this continues to be one of the smartest investments they will ever make, Congress should take one step toward making it an even smarter one.
We have introduced a proposal that would get rid of the confusing and arbitrary way interest rates are determined on federal student loans, and instead allow rates to be set by the market. We commend President Obama for introducing a similar proposal in his budget, and the House of Representatives for recently passing similar legislation, on a bipartisan basis, that offers a long-term, market-based solution. 
But we are worried that Senate Democrats, who could vote on the issue as early as this week, will oppose a permanent solution for 100 percent of loans and instead will merely extend the existing, arbitrary rate for a minority of loans, and for just two years -- a politically easy move that will only hurt students in the long run.
Over the past four years, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at record-low levels, allowing banks to borrow money from the federal government at nearly zero percent interest and, in turn, offer low rates to individuals borrowing money for the purchase of a home or a car or to start a business.
But if you're a college student who has taken out a federal loan during that time, you've seen no benefit at all from the dirt-cheap borrowing costs. Instead, your interest rate was set by Congress, which temporarily set some rates at 3.4 percent for low-income students but left most rates at either 6.8 percent or 7.9 percent.
In other words, you could borrow money to buy a used car to drive yourself to college and pay about 3 percent interest over five years, while at the same time you could be paying nearly 7 or 8 percent interest on the cost of your education.
That is, except on your federally subsidized Stafford loans. Last year Congress extended a temporary provision, first passed in 2007, to lower the 6.8 percent interest rate on newly issued Stafford loans for low-income undergraduate borrowers to 3.4 percent, for one year. The government pays the interest for these loans while the borrower is in school.
Congress extended the interest rates for a year not because it was good policy, or because 3.4 percent is some ideal rate for loans, but largely because student debt had become a political issue in the presidential campaign. In the end, the one-year extension cost taxpayers nearly $6 billion, but saved a mere $9 a month in future repayments for the 40 percent of student borrowers who receive subsidized Stafford loans.
Congress is now approaching the end of that temporary ''fix.'' On July 1, those rates will return to 6.8 percent -- which is why it is important for the Senate to make the right fix, right now.
Student debt shouldn't be grist for the political mill. Congress must provide certainty and stability to student borrowers.
Our legislation would tie all federal student-loan interest rates to the 10-year Treasury rate (currently 1.75 percent), plus 3 percentage points to cover the costs of collections, defaults and other risk factors. That would benefit students and families by cutting rates on almost all federal student loans to a little under 5 percent for the coming school year.
Under our proposal, interest rates will remain the same over the lifetime of a loan, but the rate on a loan taken out in 2013 might differ from one taken out in 2014, because market rates vary.
One big advantage of our proposal is consistency: the confusion over differing rates on Stafford loans and unsubsidized federal PLUS loans would end, since one rate formula would be used for all federal education loans.
Our plan would also protect students by using the existing income-based repayment program, which allows borrowers to reduce their monthly payments based on a capped percentage of their discretionary income and ultimately have those loans forgiven after a period of time. This is a better solution than capping future increases in interest rates, and one that the president's own budget proposal endorses.
Taxpayers would be protected, too. When the economy recovers and interest rates return to historical norms, taxpayers will no longer be subsidizing artificially low interest rates.
Our proposal has some differences from the president's plan and the House-passed bill -- for example, the president proposes three different interest rates for different types of loans, while ours has just one interest rate for all direct federal student loans, and the House bill applies a variable interest rate that resets each year, while our interest rate remains the same for the life of the loan.
But all of us embrace the same idea: we should stop playing politics with student loan debt and move to a simpler and fairer system, one that will immediately lower borrowing costs for all students while protecting taxpayers and providing certainty for the future. We hope Senate Democrats will agree.

HEADLINE: Pelé Plays Up the Cosmos

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
It seemed like old times.
A packed conference room in a hotel in midtown Manhattan. A bank of television cameras. A gaggle of news media. A collection of hangers on.
And then, right on cue, at least in Brazilian time (which can sometimes be at least 30 minutes late), Pelé floated into the room. With Muhammad Ali, he is among the first truly global superstars, first for the Santos club (forever dressed in the club's all-white uniform), then in the canary yellow jerseys and blue shorts of his native Brazil.
But on Tuesday, he was back as a member of the New York Cosmos, a club that has not played a league game in nearly 30 years, but has been reborn, rebooted if you will, and will begin play in the similarly reborn North American Soccer League on Aug. 3.
''Today, when I travel around the world, every place I go people say, Pelé, when will the New York Cosmos come back,'' he said, in English. ''I played 25 years for Santos and we won a lot of things. I played for Brazil and we won World Cups. But people want to know about the Cosmos. We made soccer in the United States well known.'' 
That was then.
The news conference Tuesday was to announce a jersey sponsorship deal with the Middle Eastern air carrier Emirates, which also sponsors European powers like Arsenal (and has its name plastered on that club's stadium in north London), Paris St.-Germain, A.C. Milan, Hamburg, Olympiacos and most recently Real Madrid. The deal with the Cosmos is for three years and will pay the club about $1 million a year. The red Fly Emirates logo is splashed across the Cosmos white home and green away jerseys, which are made by Nike. But unlike with many of its other deals, Nike's relationship with the Cosmos is as a supplier (the club pays for the uniforms) rather than a sponsor (free gear).
It has been a long road back for a club that was the Galaticos before that term became associated with Real Madrid. The Cosmos, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, were at the pinnacle of their power, domestically in the original N.A.S.L. and internationally. Players like Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer, Giorgio Chinaglia and Johan Neeskens were well-known soccer superstars who came to America to sell the game. For a time they succeeded, supported by the cash and marketing acumen of Warner Communications.
Then, it was over. Quickly. The Cosmos and the N.A.S.L. bascially packed it in after the 1984 season. The club, the brand, lay dormant until several years ago when it was bought from its custodian, G. Peppe Pinton, and underwent a splashy, but ultimately unfulfilling relaunch by the British businessman Paul Kemsley.
His effort to muscle his way into Major League Soccer as the league's 20th team and second in the New York metropolitan area, fizzled in a sea of red ink and bombastic marketing.
The operation was taken over by Sela Sports and handed to Seamus O'Brien, the founder and chief executive of the World Sport Group -- Asia's top sports marketing/media/event management company. O'Brien promised to get the Cosmos back on track and back on the field, saying from Day 1 ''judge us by our deeds, not our words,''
The club has designs on building a privately financed 25,000-seat stadium and retail complex on the grounds of Belmont Race Track in Elmont, N.Y., and expects to know the fate of its plan by end of the current legislative session in Albany, O'Brien said on Tuesday. For now, the club will play at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. And while O'Brien said he has a good relationship with M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber, the league may have boxed in the Cosmos when two weeks ago it announced that Manchester City of England and the Yankees of Major League Baseball would be partners in the league's 20th team.
Is there a place in the New York area for three soccer teams? One playing in New Jersey, one in New York City (either in a new stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park or perhaps in a new building next to Yankee Stadium) and a second-division club on the border of Queens and Nassau County?
''They have a year to get up and running,'' O'Brien said of New York City F.C., which plans to begin play in M.L.S. in 2015. ''We're not afraid of the competition. It's a good thing. We think the soccer economics of this city will be able to support three teams. I once lived across the street from three teams. In the largest metro area in the world, that's not going to be a problem.''
But while O'Brien and others have compared New York to London, which more than a dozen professional soccer teams call home, those teams do not have the N.B.A., N.H.L., N.F.L. or Major League Baseball to compete against. Add up those professional teams in the New York area and they approach the number of soccer teams in London.
Ultimately when they get on the field, the Cosmos of 2013 will bear no resemblance the Cosmos of yesteryear. It is a bit like reconnecting with a boyfriend or girlfriend you had 30 years ago. The mind remembers one thing. The eyes see another.
Perhaps most strange is that soccer fans in the United States who are younger than 40 have no memory of the Cosmos. They may have heard stories, read books, seen films and videos on YouTube, but the institutional memory is stronger outside the United States, where the Cosmos name still resonates.
So the posters around the room on Tuesday said, ''Don't Call It a Comeback,'' and pointed people to Twitter, that most modern social media creature with the handle #cosmosreboot.
''On August 3 we begin our journey back to the top,'' O'Brien said.
Time will tell.
NOTES The N.A.S.L. plays a split schedule, with the spring/summer season ending early in July, and the summer/fall season, in which the Cosmos will participate, beginning in August. ... The league's commissioner, Bill Peterson, said the N.A.S.L. planned to expand from its current eight teams to 18 teams, perhaps by 2015. The league will add Indianapolis, Ottawa and Virginia for the spring/summer season in 2014. ... Synergy? The Cosmos news conference was held in the Cosmopolitan Room at the Four Seasons Hotel and, according to Seamus O'Brien, the first word in the Emirates statement of principles is Cosmopolitan.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Widens 8.5% Despite Growth in Exports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The trade deficit widened in April, as demand for foreign cars, cellphones and other imported goods outpaced growth in exports.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that the trade gap rose 8.5 percent in April from March, to $40.3 billion. 
Exports increased 1.2 percent to $187.4 billion, the second-highest level on record. Companies sold more telecommunications equipment, industrial machinery and airplane parts, while vehicles made in the United States and auto parts also rose to a high of $12.8 billion.
But imports grew an even faster 2.4 percent, to $227.7 billion. Sales of foreign cars increased to $25.5 billion. Americans also bought more consumer goods, led by a big gain in foreign-made cellphones.
A wider trade gap can restrain growth because it means American consumers and businesses are spending more on foreign goods than United States companies are gaining in overseas sales.
But Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, said the wider deficit did show growth in the United States remains stronger than in most other nations. And that growth has helped propel more spending by consumers on imported goods.
''The U.S. economy may not be robust, but with growth continuing, the demand for foreign goods is picking up,'' Mr. Naroff said.
Most economists said trade would most likely be neutral in the April-to-June quarter after subtracting slightly from growth in the January-to-March quarter. They expect economic growth has slowed to an annual rate of about 2 percent, down from a 2.4 percent rate in the first quarter.
Still, a weaker global economy is reducing demand for American exports, and that could weigh on growth this year.
Europe's recession continues to be a problem for American companies. The deficit with the European Union grew 25.6 percent, to $12.4 billion. American exports to the region declined 7.9 percent, while imports from the region rose slightly.
The politically delicate deficit with China surged to $24.1 billion, the highest level since January and the largest with any single nation. Imports jumped 21 percent, while exports fell 4.7 percent. The March deficit had been artificially lowered by shipping disruptions caused by the Chinese New Year holiday.
The weakness abroad has coincided with less investment by American businesses, possibly out of concern that government spending cuts could hobble economic growth.
The deficit so far this year is running at an annual rate of $491.9 billion, down 8 percent from the revised annual deficit of $534.7 billion for 2012.

HEADLINE: Xi Jinping's Chinese Dream

BYLINE: By ROBERT LAWRENCE KUHN

 BODY:
BEIJING -- What to make of Xi Jinping, China's new senior leader, who holds his first summit meeting this week with President Barack Obama?
The hope is that Xi is a reformer who will guide China through domestic transformation and to responsible statecraft. The fear is that Xi is a nationalist, who has set China on an aggressive course of bullying its neighbors and confronting the United States.
The fear seems not unfounded. China has intensified its territorial claims, from island disputes with Japan to vast areas of the South China Sea.
Xi frequently inspects People's Liberation Army forces, especially naval fleets, exhorting China's military to ''get ready to fight and to win wars'' and ''to win regional warfare under I.T.-oriented conditions.'' 
Xi holds China's top three positions: head of the ruling Communist Party of China, head of state, and, as chairman of the Central Military Commission, head of the military. He will likely lead China for a decade.
Just after becoming party chief in late 2012, Xi announced what would become the hallmark of his administration. ''The Chinese Dream,'' he said, is ''the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.''
Xi's Chinese Dream is described as achieving the ''Two 100s'': the material goal of China becoming a ''moderately well-off society'' by about 2020, the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, and the modernization goal of China becoming a fully developed nation by about 2049, the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic.
The Chinese Dream has four parts: Strong China (economically, politically, diplomatically, scientifically, militarily); Civilized China (equity and fairness, rich culture, high morals); Harmonious China (amity among social classes); Beautiful China (healthy environment, low pollution).
''A moderately well-off society'' is where all citizens, rural and urban, enjoy high standards of living. This includes doubling the 2010 G.D.P. per capita (approaching $10,000 per person) by about 2020 and completing urbanization (roughly one billion people, 70 percent of China's population) by about 2030.
''Modernization'' means China regaining its position as a world leader in science and technology as well as in economics and business; the resurgence of Chinese civilization, culture and military might; and China participating actively in all areas of human endeavor.
If Xi's nationalism seems at odds with these grand goals, it is not. Here are six reasons why:
Need to consolidate power. Xi was not selected by Deng Xiaoping, the architect of reform, as were his predecessors (Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao), and he was not elected by the people. Conventional wisdom had it that Xi would be a weak leader. In order to realize his Chinese Dream, Xi needs to assert strength and assure control. So far, he has exceeded expectations.
Need to enable reform. Xi and Premier Li Keqiang are determined to enact far-reaching economic reforms, the most extensive in 15 years, but there is stiff resistance from those whose dominance would be diminished and benefits cut (such as state-owned enterprises with ties to party power).
This resistance can no longer be couched credibly in terms of ideology, so it appeals to nationalistic aspirations by accusing reformers of ''worshipping Western ways,'' ''glorifying Western models'' or ''caving in to Western pressures.'' Xi's proactive nationalism is a strategy of ''offense is the best defense'' -- an inoculation, as it were, against the political virus of being labeled ''soft'' or ''pro-Western.''
Reformers in China are generally associated with pro-American attitudes and thus subject to fierce public criticism. By establishing himself as a nationalist operating independently of the United States (his first foreign trip was to Russia), Xi is able to secure economic reforms by distinguishing them from serving Western/American interests.
Need to legitimze one-party rule. To perpetuate its rule (which China's top leaders truly believe is essential for the well-being of the country), the Chinese Communist Party has constructed a grand narrative that is founded on three critical claims: Only the Communist Party can continue to improve citizen's standard of living (and ameliorate severe social and economic disparities); only the party can maintain a stable, unified country and construct a happy, harmonious society; and only the party can effect the ''rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,'' which stresses a firm command of ''core interests'' (i.e., sovereignty and territoriality) and increasing global respect.
Maintain stability through unity. China faces numerous internal tensions, especially a class-divided populace (rich-poor, urban-rural, coastal-inland) that have erupted within one generation. Moreover, an increasingly complex society can fracture along multiple fault lines. Pollution, corruption, healthcare, housing, migrant workers, workers' wages, social cynicism, changing values, among other raging issues, threaten to fragment society -- and all are exacerbated by an energetic social media. Only nationalism, which resonates intrinsically and passionately across Chinese society, can provide sufficiently strong social glue.
Differentiate from predecessors. Top Chinese leaders must combine historical continuity with their own distinguishing theories and practices. How shall Xi fare?
Economic growth rates must decline, and a host of domestic tensions (or crises) are coming his way, such as public anger at corruption and resistance to pollution. Hence another rationale for nationalism.
In the past, nationalistic surges were triggered largely by external events (such as NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999). Xi is putting nationalism at the core of his leadership -- his nationalism is proactive, riding the high road of patriotism and pride.
Personal beliefs. Xi has deep-seated patriotic convictions, the product of family, life and career. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a founder of the new China and a leading reformer under Deng Xiaoping. In 2006, when Xi Jinping was party secretary of Zhejiang Province, he told me about Chinese pride and patriotism as motivating China's historic resurgence -- words remarkably similar to his recent pronouncements.
So is Xi a reformer? A nationalist? The answer is that he is both, because only by being a nationalist can he be a reformer. American policy makers must understand Xi's nationalism so that when the reigning superpower meets the rising superpower, both can benefit.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Traders Size Up the Fed

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve guessing game threw the markets for another loop on Tuesday.
Comments from a Fed official raised expectations that the Fed could start easing off its support for the economy soon, sending the stock market sharply lower in the late afternoon. The market recovered in the last hour of trading to end with slight losses.
Snippets from a prepared speech by the official, Esther L. George, president of the Kansas City, Mo., branch of the Federal Reserve, were reported in the early afternoon. Ms. George pointed to ''improving economic conditions'' as well as evidence that financial markets were getting dependent on the Fed's support. As a result, she said, ''I support slowing the pace of asset purchases as an appropriate next step for monetary policy.'' 
''History suggests that waiting too long to acknowledge the economy's progress and prepare markets for more normal policy settings carries no less risk than tightening too soon,'' Ms. George was to say in the speech in Santa Fe, N.M. She did not give the speech because she was sick, but news outlets reported her comments, and the Kansas City Fed posted the speech online.
It was the latest volatile turn in stock trading as investors try to figure out when the Fed will make a move.
The Fed's next step will be to pare down its bond-buying, but when that will happen is unknown. As a result, traders have been trying to outguess one another in anticipation of the decision, seizing on comments from bank officials and minutes from a recent meeting of policy makers to send stock and bond prices swinging sharply over the last two weeks.
The next big data point for investors is the Labor Department's monthly employment survey, which is to be released on Friday. A weak report might be encouraging to stock investors since it would imply that the Fed would keep buying bonds to support the economy.
That was the stock market's reaction on Monday, when traders interpreted an unexpected easing in American manufacturing last month as a sign that the Fed was not close to winding down its stimulus program.
''You've got to believe that people are getting ready for the end of the week,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
The Fed's bond purchases have helped keep bond prices high and the yields they pay low. The Fed's goal is to encourage borrowing and investing with low interest rates.
Many investors expect long-term interest rates to rise when the Fed scales back its bond-buying. If they climb high enough, more investors might be tempted to buy bonds instead of stocks. Trying to anticipate that outcome, many traders are pre-emptively selling stocks on the slightest signs that the Fed could be closer to slowing its stimulus.
The current yield of 2.15 percent on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is low by historical standards. The yield rose from 2.13 percent on Monday, after the note fell 6/32, to 96 14/32, on Tuesday. It is nearly identical to the average dividend payment of 2.14 percent for stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-share index.
The S.& P. 500 fell 9.04 points to close at 1,631.38, a loss of 0.6 percent. It had lost as much as 16 points, or 1 percent, around 2:30 p.m. Other major market indexes also fell.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 76.49 points to 15,177.54, a drop of 0.5 percent. It had been down as much as 153 points earlier in the day. The Dow had gained for the previous 20 Tuesdays in a row.
The Nasdaq composite fell 20.11 points to 3,445.26, down 0.6 percent. The price of crude oil slipped 14 cents, to $93.31 a barrel, and gold fell $14.60, to $1,397.10 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Chinese President Makes Bridge-Building Trip to Mexico

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN; Karla Zabludovsky contributed reporting from Mexico City.

 BODY:
SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico -- President Xi Jinping of China arrived in Mexico City on Tuesday for a three-day visit intended to smooth over relations that have long been prickly.
China has moved forcefully to secure oil and other commodities in South America over the past decade. Mexico -- Latin America's second-largest economy -- has played a different role though, not supplying China but competing with it to export manufactured goods like electronics and clothing to the United States.
President Xi's visit to Mexico, coming only two months after President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico traveled to China, is an effort to recast the relationship under two new leaders. 
The trip underscores China's growing ties in the hemisphere. Before arriving in Mexico, President Xi visited Central America and the Caribbean, further securing his nation's foothold there. In Trinidad and Tobago, he met with 10 Caribbean leaders and promised $3 billion in loans for projects in the region, according to Bloomberg News. Among the loans was one for $250 million to build a children's hospital in Trinidad, the Caribbean's largest energy supplier.
China has given billions in loans and aid to Caribbean nations to build stadiums, roads, ports and tourist resorts, and Mr. Xi's visit came days after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with 15 regional leaders in Trinidad, drawing a sharp contrast about what the two countries had to offer the area's tiny economies.
Mr. Biden announced no new initiatives, though he spoke about providing help for clean energy research and education and promised to dismantle remaining trade and investment barriers.
On Sunday, Mr. Xi traveled to Costa Rica -- which has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan -- and promised almost $300 million in loans to finish building a highway. The trip sent a clear message to other Central American countries that by withdrawing their recognition of Taiwan ''they could get goodies too,'' Kevin P. Gallagher, a professor at Boston University, wrote in an e-mail.
Latin American leaders have long complained that Washington pays too little attention to the rest of the hemisphere's concerns, and China has begun to take advantage of that perception.
As Latin America and the Caribbean become less dependent on the United States, ''they have another economic ally, and that economic ally is a superpower,'' said S. Lynne Walker, the director of the China-Americas program at the Institute of the Americas in California.
Matt Ferchen, a scholar at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, suggested that President Xi's itinerary may also be intended as a message to the United States. ''China wants to remind the U.S. that just as the U.S. has influence in regions close to China, China too has rising influence in the Americas,'' he wrote in an e-mail.
Analysts will be watching the trip closely for signs that Mexico and China are taking steps toward changing their frosty relationship.
Mexico's government would like to narrow its large trade gap with China. Last year, Mexico imported $57 billion in goods from China and sent back only $5.7 billion in products, according to Mexico's Ministry of Economy.
The two countries announced a series of agreements late Tuesday covering energy, trade and education. ''We agree on the importance of balancing our trade and investment relationship,'' Mr. Peña Nieto said, noting promises from China to start by accepting more tequila and pork imports.
China could also send a strong message by announcing investments in Mexican manufacturing, experts said, perhaps in the automobile industry.
''At least having the possibility of greater Chinese investment on the table might allow China and Mexico to move beyond their up-till-now quite dysfunctional and competitive relationship,'' Mr. Ferchen wrote.
Still, China's interest in natural resources leaves little doubt that it is looking at future oil deals in Mexico. In a symbolic move, Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly, Pemex, signed an agreement during Mr. Peña Nieto's visit to China in April to ship 30,000 barrels a day to Sinopec, a state-owned company there.
Mexico's Congress is expected to begin debating measures to open the country's closed oil industry to outside investment later in the year, although it is unclear how far that opening will go.
Still, ''in Mexico the goal is to get to the head of the line in energy reform,'' Mr. Gallagher wrote.
Despite China's rising influence in Latin America, the United States has an opportunity to improve relations with the region, he added.
''As excited as Latin American governments are about the new trade and finance from China, they are also getting concerned about an overreliance on commodities and about the heavy toll on the environment Chinese-led growth has exacted,'' he said.
The problem is that the United States is not making an attractive enough counteroffer, he said: ''We used to be able to dangle access to the biggest economy in the world, but that is no longer enough.''

HEADLINE: Belgium: NATO Sends Team to Libya To Assess Providing Security Aid

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- NATO is sending a team of experts to Libya to assess how the alliance can provide security assistance, notably military training, to help the turbulent North African nation combat Islamist militants claiming allegiance to Al Qaeda and other threats.
Libya has been bedeviled by instability since a NATO air campaign helped topple the country's longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011. The pledge to help Libya's fragile new government came as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other NATO defense ministers began a two-day meeting in Brussels focused largely on Afghanistan and cybersecurity. 
The NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said at a news conference that a team of experts would visit Libya ''as soon as possible'' and report back by the end of June. He said that providing security assistance ''would be a fitting way to continue our cooperation with Libya after we successfully took action to protect the Libyan people two years ago.''
The overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi's autocratic government has left the new government struggling to fill a security vacuum. Last September, Islamist militants attacked the United States Mission in Benghazi, resulting in the death of the American ambassador and three of his colleagues, an episode that created a political firestorm in Washington over whether security issues were taken seriously enough and how President Obama's administration responded.
Mr. Rasmussen, who discussed Libya last Friday in Washington with Mr. Obama, said Tuesday in Brussels that any security assistance would aim to beef up Libya's own security forces and would not involve sending NATO troops to the country.
''Let me stress, this is not about deploying troops to Libya,'' said Mr. Rasmussen, who added that the country had made a formal request for help last week. He said that any training of military forces ''could take place outside Libya.''
Prime Minister Ali Zeidan of Libya visited NATO headquarters in Brussels early last week and said that the alliance had agreed to provide ''technical assistance in terms of training.'' He provided no additional details.
Libya has been wracked by insecurity since the overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi in the summer of 2011, when NATO declared a no-fly zone and sent warplanes to assist anti-Qaddafi rebels.
The growing role of Islamist fighters is a source of special concern to Washington. They have become particularly active in southern Libya, where militants have taken refuge after being driven out of Mali by a French-led offensive earlier this year.
The first day of the NATO defense ministers' meeting, however, centered on the threat posed by attacks on the alliance's computer systems. "Cyberattacks are getting more common, more complex and more dangerous,'' Mr. Rasmussen told reporters. ''They come without warning from anywhere in the world and they can have devastating consequences.''
He said that NATO had ''dealt with'' more than 2,500 ''significant cases'' last year. ''That is one every three hours, day and night, every day of the year,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. But he added that ''despite the increasing sophistication of these attacks, our security has not been compromised.'' He did not specify where the attacks originated.
The NATO secretary general also raised what in recent years has become a perennial complaint at gatherings of the alliance: the shrinking defense budgets of many European nations. Washington has repeatedly pleaded with its allies to beef up their defense budgets but, with much of Europe mired in a deep economic slump, the downward slide has largely continued.
''European countries must do more to relieve the unequal burden that is currently being carried by the United States,'' Mr. Rasmussen said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: College Fund Tinkers With Its Slogan to Stress Investing in Students

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
THE United Negro College Fund, now known as the U.N.C.F., is introducing a new public service advertising campaign this week that tweaks its well-known tagline to stress the importance of investing in university education for young African-Americans.
The new tagline, ''A mind is a terrible thing to waste but a wonderful thing to invest in,'' was created by the advertising agency Y&R in conjunction with the Advertising Council, as was the tagline created in 1972 that it is replacing, ''A mind is a terrible thing to waste.'' 
According to the College Fund, which has helped more than 300,000 students obtain undergraduate and graduate degrees since 1972, a persistent gap in education remains between African-Americans and other groups. The bachelor's degree completion rate for African-American students is today 21 percent, it said, compared to a national average of 30 percent. The high cost of college and lack of financial assistance are main reasons minority students do not enter or complete college, it said.
To quantify the claim of its new tagline, a study commissioned by Y&R estimated that African-American students who finished college today would earn $500,000 more in their lifetimes than African-American high school graduates, would be healthier, more economically independent and less likely to commit crime, while paying more in taxes and using fewer government health and welfare services. The study further estimated that every $10 invested in the education of an African-American college student today could generate what it quantifies as $102 in benefits to society.
To illustrate these concepts, the advertising features high school and college students from across the country who could apply for or have already received College Fund scholarships.
In one TV spot, Jacquez Griffin, a student from Chicago who attends St. Augustine College in Raleigh, N.C., says, ''I come from a big family, I'm the oldest of six. To me, being the first person to go to college it's like setting a standard, you know? My little brother is 8 years old now. I challenge his curiosity, I challenge him to dream. I have to paint a picture for him that he can look up to and possibly be better than. My name is Jacquez, and I am your dividend.''
In a radio ad, Alisha Shepard, a high school student from Yonkers, says, ''You don't usually get a stock tip from a 16-year-old. But I'm here to tell you about a different kind of stock. It's called better futures. A stock for social change that's not about making money. Instead, you invest to help students like me go to college. Which ends up making the future better for all of us. My name is Alisha. And I'm your dividend.''
All advertising for the campaign concludes with the new tagline and Web address.
Dr. Michael L. Lomax, president and chief executive of the College Fund, said the organization proceeded with ''great caution'' in tweaking its original tagline, which he said had ''worked so powerfully for decades. We don't want to do anything that undermines it.''
The new campaign was relevant today, he said, as the United States challenges ''itself to compete globally by producing talent. This isn't charity any longer. This is an investment in individual students, an investment in our nation's work force, an investment in retaining our global competitiveness.''
The new ads are directed at previous donors to the College Fund, graduates of historically black colleges and universities, many of which were supported by the fund, and individuals who provided other financial assistance for higher education, according to David Sable, global chief executive of Y&R, part of WPP Group of companies.
Although earlier College Fund advertising had discussed the concept of investing -- for example, a 1977 print ad urged readers to ''invest in the fund that pays the best dividends'' -- Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive of the Ad Council, said the new advertising represented the first time the College Fund had quantified the impact of investment in education.
''Up to this point, there was creative storytelling with professional actors and spokespeople,'' she said, often with celebrities like the actor Samuel L. Jackson, an alumnus of Morehouse, a historically black college in Atlanta. ''Using the actual face of students to represent the potential takes the campaign to a whole new level,'' she added.
The campaign and its strategy has received mixed reviews.
Harold D. Brown, president of EDWorks, a subsidiary of the KnowledgeWorks Foundation that works with high schools in underserved communities, called the campaign ''solid'' but said ''it didn't blow me away given the history of U.N.C.F.'s success.'' He added that in ''any work by any of us, there are a variety of factors that are going to contribute to a student's success. Certainly financial aid is going to be one of them.''
Renée Richardson Gosline, a professor of marketing at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, said it ''makes logical sense'' for the College Fund to ''attempt to say it's not just doing something for someone else. People are more likely to give when they believe that it will benefit them as well.''
The College Fund's new quantification of the value of donations might be a response to a trend of ''a new generation of donors for whom intent isn't enough. They want to know exactly what will be achieved with their money, they want to see how their giving is creating change,'' said Jim Coutré, a partner at the Philanthropic Initiative, a gift-giving consultant.
Marybeth Gasman, a professor of higher education at the University of Pennsylvania, who has written extensively on the College Fund, called the ads ''a little safe,'' compared to what she described as ''more provocative advertising'' in the 1970s and 1980s. But she said their tone was ''probably a good thing, given the changing demographics of the country. It's good to have ads everyone can relate to.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: In the College Fund's latest ads, African-American students emphasize the value of investing in their educations. A study done for the organization says African-Americans with college degrees earn more, lead healthier lives and pay more in taxes.

HEADLINE: A County in Alabama Strikes a Bankruptcy Deal

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Jefferson County, Ala., took a big step toward resolving its historic bankruptcy case on Tuesday, saying it had reached an agreement to refinance most of the debt at the heart of its financial breakdown.
The refinancing would save the county hundreds of millions of dollars and position it to emerge from bankruptcy in a matter of months, according to people briefed on the negotiations. But the terms must still be approved by a federal bankruptcy judge, and the county must clear several other hurdles before it can emerge from bankruptcy. Lawyers for the county are scheduled to present details of the agreement in federal bankruptcy court in Birmingham on Wednesday.
The deal, according to the people briefed on the negotiations, covers about $2.4 billion of Jefferson County's total $3.078 billion in sewer debt, which was issued to pay for significant repairs needed to bring the county into compliance with federal clean water laws. 
The interest due on the sewer debt shot up during the financial turmoil of 2008, and the repayment schedules accelerated sharply, leaving the county unable to pay. The repairs went unfinished as well.
The county also had other debt outstanding when it declared bankruptcy, for a total of $4.2 billion, making it the biggest municipal bankruptcy in United States history.
Governmental bankruptcies are rare and usually involve small single-purpose authorities and districts, not large, complicated counties with a lot of debt. Experts in public finance have been watching Jefferson County closely to see what kind of legal precedent it will set. Some were concerned that the successful application of Chapter 9 bankruptcy rules to municipal debt could cast a pall over the municipal bond market.
Residents of the county, for their part, have worried that they would bear the brunt of the bankruptcy, through lower property values or higher taxes or rates paid for county services.
The refinancing agreement covers debt held by creditors that include JPMorgan Chase, which holds about $1.22 billion of the sewer debt, the biggest block; three bond insurers; and seven hedge funds, according to a term sheet circulated in a meeting of the county commission on Tuesday.
The terms call for these creditors to receive about $1.84 billion for the $2.4 billion of debt they now hold. The concessions were weighted most heavily toward JPMorgan, the term sheet said, ''to increase the recovery of other sewer creditors.''
The bank is giving up $842 million, or about 70 percent, of the face value of its debt, according to people briefed on the negotiations. Just before declaring bankruptcy in 2011, the county abruptly rejected a previous package of concessions that called for JPMorgan to give up about $750 million.
JPMorgan was widely expected to make big concessions as part of any bankruptcy settlement, because some former officials of the bank were found to have been involved in improprieties in connection with a county debt refinancing in 2002 and 2003. That refinancing involved a complex package of variable-rate bonds and derivatives called interest-rate swaps.
A lawsuit by the county against JPMorgan over the improprieties, still active in state court, would be resolved as part of the proposed agreement. In 2009, JPMorgan agreed to forgive all the termination fees the county owed on the swaps, or about $647 million, to settle a complaint from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank also paid the county $75 million under the same settlement.
Despite those concessions, residents of Jefferson County have still often complained that they were treated inequitably because several of their elected officials went to prison as a result of the refinancing, while no one from the bank was convicted of a crime. They have railed in particular against the possibility that their sewer rates would go up to allow the county to pay sewer debt that many now see as illegitimate.
On Wednesday, the federal bankruptcy judge, Thomas B. Bennett, is also scheduled to hear arguments in a lawsuit arguing that much of the debt was issued in violation of the state Constitution and should be voided, not restructured or repaid.
In addition, the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee for small creditors, has asked Judge Bennett for a full independent review of the sewer system's finances, as well as what it has called ''poor planning, gross incompetence, waste, graft, corruption or fraud in connection with the construction, repair or rehabilitation'' of the sewer system since 1997.
The term sheet indicated that the sewer fees for county residents would indeed rise, by 7.41 percent a year for the first four years of the refinancing deal. After that, they could rise by as much as 3.49 percent a year, depending on variables like inflation and new federal clean-water regulations.
Still, members of the county commission said the new agreement was significantly better than what they could have won without the bankruptcy filing. The five-member commission approved the terms in a 4-to-1 vote.
If the refinancing goes forward, the county's public creditors on the sewer debt will be offered a choice: either 80 cents for every dollar of sewer debt they now hold, if they relinquish all other claims, or 65 cents on the dollar with the right to pursue their own claims, either against the county or its bond insurers.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Is Barefoot-Style Running Best? New Studies Cast Doubt

BYLINE: GRETCHEN REYNOLDS


HIGHLIGHT: Recent studies examining just how the body actually responds when we run in our birthday shoes or skimpy footwear suggest that for many people, running without shoes or in minimalist footwear does not make running easier, speedier or less injurious. 

 BODY:
Barefoot-running enthusiasts long have believed that running without shoes or in minimalist footwear makes running easier, speedier and less injurious. But a surprisingly large number of new studies examining just how the body actually responds when we run in our birthday shoes or skimpy footwear suggest that for many people, those expectations are not being met. 
Consider, for instance, the findings of the most definitive of the new studies, published last month in The Journal of Applied Physiology. It looked into whether landing near the front of the foot when you run is more physiologically efficient than striking the ground first with the heel. 
This is a central issue in any discussion of barefoot-style running, because one of the supposed hallmarks of running shoeless or in minimalist footwear is that doing so promotes a forefoot landing. Without the heel cushioning provided by standard running shoes, barefoot proponents say, runners will gravitate naturally toward landing lightly near the balls of the feet. 
And they should, most proponents add, because landing near the front of the foot will require less oxygen and effort and allow you to push harder at any given speed and ultimately run faster or longer. 
But that idea, while appealing, has not been well scrutinized. So researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst recruited 37 experienced runners, 19 of whom were habitual heel-strikers and 18 of whom landed first near the front of the foot. (Heel striking is far more common than forefoot striking among modern runners, by most estimates, with at least 70 percent of us nowadays leading with our heels.)
The researchers began by outfitting all of the volunteers with the same neutral running flats and then having each run on a treadmill as he or she normally would, using his or her preferred foot strike. The volunteers ran at three different speeds, equivalent to an easy, middling and fast pace. Throughout, the researchers measured oxygen uptake, heart rates and, through mathematical calculations, the extent to which carbohydrates were providing energy. 
Then, in a separate experiment, they asked each runner to switch styles - the heel-strikers were to land near the balls of their feet and the forefoot strikers with their heels - while the researchers gathered the same data as before. 
In the end, this data showed that heel-striking was the more physiologically economical running form, by a considerable margin. Heel strikers used less oxygen to run at the same pace as forefoot strikers, and many of the forefoot strikers used less oxygen - meaning they were more economical - when they switched form to land first with their heels.
Most of the runners also burned fewer carbohydrates as a percentage of their energy expenditure when they struck first with their heels. Their bodies turned to fats and other fuel sources, "sparing" the more limited stores of carbohydrates, says Allison Gruber, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who led the study. Because depleting carbohydrates results in "hitting the wall," or abruptly sagging with fatigue, "these results tell us that people will hit the wall faster if they are running with a forefoot pattern versus a rear-foot pattern," Dr. Gruber says. 
These findings undermine some of the entrenched beliefs about minimalist shoes or barefoot running, but they jibe closely with the conclusions of multiple studies presented last week at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis. Five separate studies there found no significant benefits, in terms of economy, from switching to minimalist, barefoot-style footwear. 
The news on injury prevention and barefoot-style running is likewise sobering. Although many barefoot-style runners believe that wearing lightweight shoes or none at all toughens foot muscles, lessening the likelihood of foot-related running injuries, researchers at Brigham Young University did not find evidence of that desirable change. If foot muscles become tauter and firmer, the scientists say, people's arches should consequently grow higher. But in a study also presented at the sports medicine meeting, they found no changes in arch height among a group of runners who donned minimalist shoes for 10 weeks. 
Other researchers who presented at the meeting had simply asked a group of 566 runners if they had tried barefoot-style shoes and, if so, whether they liked them. Almost a third of the runners said they had experimented with the minimalist shoes, but 32 percent of those said that they had suffered injuries that they attributed to the new footwear, and many had switched back to their previous shoes. 
None of this new science, of course, proves that barefoot-style running is inadvisable or disadvantageous for all runners; it proves only that the question of whether barefoot is best is not easily answered. "There are lots of individual instances where people report that change" from one type of running shoes or running form to another "was good for them," says Rodger Kram, a professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who's long studied running form. "There are also lots of cases of people switching or trying to switch who got hurt." 
The primary lesson of the accumulating new science about barefoot-style running, he says, is that "the biomechanics of running are not simple, and generic proclamations" - like claims that all runners will benefit from barefoot-style shoes and running form - "are surely incorrect." 
Dr. Gruber agrees. "I always recommend that runners run the way that is most natural and comfortable for them," she says. "Each runner runs a certain way for a reason, likely because of the way they were physically built. Unless there is some indication that you should change things, such as repeated injury, do not mess with that plan."

HEADLINE: Andrew Greeley's Insistence on Careful Measurement

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The late Father Andrew Greeley insisted that good data could help resolve misunderstandings, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
The Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, who died on Thursday, was a creative and dedicated social scientist who taught economists and others that scholars help resolve controversies by making careful measurements.
Father Greeley was a Roman Catholic priest, well known outside of academic circles for his outspoken views on Church matters (the late Cardinal John Patrick Cody of Chicago refused to assign Father Greeley to a parish) and his best-selling mysteries and romance novels. But he also earned a doctorate in sociology at the University of Chicago in 1962 and was a senior study director at the National Opinion Research Center at Chicago. 
Father Greeley actively participated in academic discourse at both of those institutions for the rest of his life. His participation included sharing wisdom and ideas with young social scientists arriving at the University of Chicago, as he did with me when I arrived in the early 1990s.
In his dissertation work, Father Greeley tried to help answer controversial questions by gathering better data. One anecdote from his graduate student days - a time when Americans were actively debating whether it would be appropriate to have a Catholic, John F. Kennedy, as president of the United States - succinctly illustrates Father Greeley's approach.

He was interested in assertions that Catholics were not segregated from Protestants, especially in Midwestern cities like Chicago. As evidence against segregation, Father Greeley told me, many people pointed to Chicago institutions that included significant numbers of both Catholics and Protestants. The Beverly Country Club on the southwest side of the city was one of those institutions, and in fact had roughly equal numbers of Catholic and Protestant members.
Father Greeley wondered whether the club was nonetheless highly segregated on the inside, but, working long before the days of surveillance cameras and eye-recognition software, was faced with the challenge of measuring internal segregation. He approached the caddy master at the club, who kept records on which club members played golf and at what "tee time." Up to four members could play golf together, and in doing so they would have a common tee time. Father Greeley was permitted to examine the tee sheets and found that Catholics and Protestants rarely shared a tee time: Catholics and Protestants might have been at the same club, but they were not golfing together.
(If you are wondering how tee sheets would indicate religion, Catholics in the Beverly neighborhood were primarily Irish and had distinctly Irish surnames. Moreover, Father Greeley was the assistant pastor at a Catholic parish in that neighborhood and knew many of the families).
Father Greeley's passion to inform controversies with new and better data suited him well for his positions at the National Opinion Research Center, where in the early 1970s he helped initiate the General Social Survey, which continues today and is widely used in economics and other social-science research. For example, the survey results he examined helped overturn the belief that Catholics were less educated than the average American. He also helped fund expansions in the General Social Survey, and its international counterpart the International Social Survey Programme, to include additional topics and additional nations.
He and I talked about the welfare state, especially its differences between the United States and Western Europe. One point of view, still held today, is that Western Europeans are more compassionate toward their less fortunate neighbors. After all, the United States had traditionally devoted less of its national income to social programs than did France, Sweden and other nations. But Father Greeley noted that results from international surveys of volunteering and giving showed that Americans spent more money and time in volunteer work than Western Europeans did, so perhaps American compassion takes a different form.
Survey results are criticized when they go against the conventional wisdom. Father Greeley acknowledged that surveys have flaws but explained that conventional wisdom often has those flaws in spades.
"Everybody takes surveys," he wrote. "Whoever makes a statement about human behavior has engaged in a survey of some sort," adding:
The difference between the survey takers and the rest of generalizing humankind is that the former (usually) observe large numbers of people in a representative sample that reflects the total population and are precise about their methods of data collection and analysis. Precisely because the professional survey taker is honest about his methods, he becomes an easy target for loudmouth critics who appeal to 'what everyone knows' and 'common sense.'

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Personal Diplomacy

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and a look at the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
President Obama will meet with Xi Jinping, the president of China, in a California setting carefully chosen to nurture personal diplomacy and a high-level friendship, Mark Landler and Jackie Calmes report. The president is hoping to move beyond the usual stilted talking points, with hopes of exchanging ideas about how to best manage a complex, sometimes combustible relationship between the world's two biggest economies.
 

        
Republicans are viewing President Obama's plan to fill three vacancies at once on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as an attempt to steamroll the nominations past the opposition in Congress, Michael D. Shear and Jeremy W. Peters report. Democrats are hoping that it will call attention to Republican obstruction of his choices for the cabinets and the courts, as well as his legislative agenda.

        
In a rare joint appearance, the majority of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday about the problem of sexual assault in the military. Senators from both parties pressed the issue, calling the chiefs' responses "stunningly bad," Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, disclosed on Tuesday that she had made telephone calls to three companies regulated by her department, urging them to help a nonprofit group promote the health care law, Robert Pear writes. She argued, though, that she was following well-established precedents.

        
An audit of the Internal Revenue Service has given Republicans new reason to beoutraged after it was revealed that the tax-collecting agency spent $4.1 million on a single conference in Southern California in 2010, Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
Republicans plan to accuse President Obama of hypocrisy for nominating Michael Froman to be his trade representative, when Mr. Froman made millions of dollars largely because of a tax loophole the administration has sought to close, Jonathan Weisman.

HEADLINE: Trying to Take the Sting Out of a Price Increase

BYLINE: ADRIANA GARDELLA


HIGHLIGHT: How you deliver the bad news can make a big difference in how it&#8217;s received. 

 BODY:
At the last She Owns It Business Group meeting, the owners talked about several pricing issues. Susan Parker, who owns Bari Jay, recently discovered that customers react not only to a price increase but also to the way it is presented. When she learned her factories were raising her prices, she thought she would pass along a 10-percent-per-dress increase to all of customers. But then she had another idea.
Bari Jay customers who paid their invoices within 30 days had been receiving an 8 percent discount. Rather than increasing dress prices for all customers, Ms. Parker decided to discontinue the discount. This seemed like a good idea because it would affect fewer accounts, and the timely payers would still end up paying less than they would if she increased prices 10 percent across the board. But when customers learned they would be losing their discount for prompt payment, they were angry and confused, Ms. Parker said. 
"I could see that," said the group member Alexandra Mayzler, who owns Thinking Caps Group. "I'd feel like I'd been being so good, paying early, and you're taking that opportunity away from me." 
With hindsight, Ms. Parker realized where Bari Jay went wrong. When she and her sister sent letters to the discount recipients, they said simply that Bari Jay was eliminating the 8 percent discount. The news might have been better received had they stressed that the discontinuation was in lieu of a 10 percent increase. "We only gave them the negative without giving them the positive, so the perception was that we're taking something away," she said.
"I think understanding that these things are going to happen, and building contingencies into your contracts - if you have a contract-type business - helps," said Jessica Johnson, owner of Johnson Security Bureau.
Shifting gears, Ms. Parker said Bari Jay's biggest pricing challenges are in Europe and Australia. While the company sells directly to stores in the United States, it sells through distributors in Europe and Australia, and the relationships with those distributors were in place before Ms. Parker and her sister took over the company. 
Recently, Ms. Parker's Australian distributor claimed it could increase Bari Jay's business if it received a bigger discount. Ms. Parker said she was glad to offer one given the promise of more sales. But Bari Jay found that the change resulted in a decline in revenue. "The distributor must have made more money but it came from our pockets, not from increased sales," she said.
Ms. Parker had agreed to offer the bigger discount for a trial period that ended about six months ago. But because Bari Jay didn't speak up when the trial ended, Ms. Parker said she and her sister now feel stuck with the discount.
"Did they know it was a trial period?" asked Deirdre Lord, who owns the Megawatt Hour.
"They did," Ms. Parker replied. Sometimes, she added, she wonders whether she and her sister are "suckers." She said they walked into a meeting with the distributor saying, "We're going back to our original discount." But they found neither of them had the nerve to push for the result they wanted.
"Are you afraid that they're going to stop carrying your line?" Ms. Lord asked.
Ms. Parker doesn't think that would happen - it doesn't cost the distributor all that much to keep the line. But she said she has learned from her experiences with stores in the United States that they seem to promote the lines of their favorites. So, she said, she is wary of becoming "the person they don't love dealing with." Already, Ms. Parker suspects her Australian distributor isn't promoting Bari Jay as much as it does other lines. For example, she said the distributor advertises other lines in all four issues of Australia's leading bridal magazine but only advertises Bari Jay in two issues.
Ms. Lord said it sounds like Bari Jay may have a marketing issue, not a pricing one. That is, it's not Bari Jay's prices that are affecting sales, but the way in which the distributor is marketing the company's dresses.
In Europe, Bari Jay's distributor claims he needs a bigger discount to improve sales, which have fallen significantly. Ms. Parker is considering offering a discount that incorporates a minimum order. But she's not sure. "If I do this and it doesn't work, well then how do you renege?" she asked.
Why wouldn't Ms. Parker just conclude that Europe isn't her market? Ms. Mayzler asked. "You don't want to have a price that's not actually working," she said.
But Ms. Parker stressed that Bari Jay has been successful there. At their peak, she said European annual sales were about $500,000, or one-fourteenth of Bari Jay's revenue - with minimal labor costs. The dresses ship directly from Asia, at the distributor's expense, so Bari Jay isn't responsible for packing and unpacking. She said her labor is basically limited to order entry and invoicing. "So, it's mostly profit," she said. But now, European sales are close to zero - not profitable at any cost.
"What happened?" Ms. Mayzler asked.
"Europe keeps saying the market changed," Ms. Parker said. She acknowledged that the region's economic woes aren't helping. But she suspects other issues are at play. She recently learned the distributor buys all of his other lines directly from factories, not retailers like Bari Jay, which mark up the factory's price. "I can't compete when he's getting direct from a factory and I'm a middle man," Ms. Parker said. "He's selling my dresses next to a dress for half the price."
Ms. Mayzler suggested that the problem is the distributor, not the discount amount. Ms. Parker acknowledged she is searching for a new European distributor. But until she finds one, she said she would like to see at least some European business. A bigger discount may offer her current distributor an incentive.
"Dare I say it's not worth being in Europe?" Ms. Lord asked.
"It is though, because I can do half a million dollars, why wouldn't I want that?" Ms. Parker replied.
"It depends how much it costs you," Ms. Mayzler said.

HEADLINE: Pushy Parents Urged to Let Offspring Go It Alone

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Britain&#8217;s new social mobility czar is a self-made millionaire who believes that even prosperous and well-connected parents should give their children an opportunity to find their own way in the career market. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Here's a question for every parent. Is it right to use your connections to give your children a potentially unfair advantage in the labor market or should you make them stand on their own feet?
It was posed this week by James Caan, one of Britain's most successful and high-profile businessmen, who on Wednesday begins a new role as the government's adviser on social mobility.
In an interview this week, he told The Telegraph that too many parents were eager to provide their offspring with work experience at top companies rather than allowing them to make their own way in the workplace. 
Parents should only step in after a year in which "the child has tried everything" and failed to find a job. 
Mr. Caan was speaking ahead of the launch of an initiative, spearheaded by Nick Clegg, Britain's Liberal Democratic deputy prime minister, that aims to persuade companies to take on more young people from poorer backgrounds.
The initiative comes as new government-sponsored research indicates that young people from lower social categories are several rungs behind on the career ladder. 
In a debate on social mobility, Mr. Clegg has criticized the growing phenomenon of unpaid internships that some see as favoring the children of well-connected and well-off parents. 
It is an issue echoed in other countries where tight job markets have led to tougher competition for top jobs among the young. My colleague Joyce Lau reported last month on job seekers who actually pay for the privilege of working for nothing in order to enhance their resumés.
At first sight, Mr. Caan seems the ideal candidate to preach the virtues of self-reliance. The 52-year-old Pakistani-born entrepreneur passed up the chance to go into his father's London leather goods business and left school at 16 in order to strike out on his own.
He went on to found a major international recruitment business before moving into private equity.
Formerly a panelist on the reality TV show "Dragon's Den" - Britain's version of the American "Shark Tank" - Mr. Caan helped select aspiring entrepreneurs pitching their business ideas in order to secure investment finance.
His advice to parents to let their children go it alone was potentially undermined this week when it emerged that one of his daughters works at a company he invests in, while another has interned at his private equity firm.
Mr. Caan insisted both daughters had been treated the same way as other applicants to his companies via a rigorous recruitment procedure.
He acknowledged, however, "The fact is that parents will always have the innate feeling to help their children into jobs. I'm no different."
As Mr. Clegg's government's social mobility czar, Mr. Caan will lead a campaign to encourage companies to offer fair and open access to jobs and professions for young people, regardless of who they are or where they come from.
Some commentators were skeptical about whether Mr. Caan's assault on nepotism was likely to have much effect on prosperous, aspirational parents.
"Middle-class parents are notoriously energetic when it comes to securing the best possible opportunities for their offspring," according to Toby Young, writing in The Telegraph on Wednesday.
"It's a safe bet that any solution that depends on parents being less pushy is doomed to fail, particularly in the current climate," he wrote.
 Let us know what you think. Do prosperous and well-connected parents have a moral duty to ensure a more level playing field in the labor market? Or will it always be a case of "family comes first?"

HEADLINE: It's Not Just Nice to Share, It's the Future

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: With collaborative consumption &#8212; the growing new economy based on access instead of ownership &#8212;you don&#8217;t have to buy a bike, car, prom dress, DVD, or chainsaw. You rent it or swap for it. 

 BODY:
Some people in New York love the city's new bike-sharing system. Some people really, really do not. One of the latter is Dorothy Rabinowitz, an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal, who in a five-minute opinion video called "Death by Bicycle" - this is apparently not a parody - charges that bikes are the city's "most important danger" and that Citi Bikes have "begrimed" the city's best neighborhoods. She calls the bike lobby an "all-powerful enterprise" and denounces Mayor Michael Bloomberg's "ideology-maddened traffic commissioner."
"Do not ask me to enter the minds of the totalitarians running this government of the city," Rabinowitz says.
She doesn't know the half of it. What would she have said if she had realized that a Citi Bike isn't just a Citi Bike? It's the mayor's endorsement of collaborative consumption - the exploding new economy based on access instead of ownership. With collaborative consumption, you don't have to buy a bike, car, prom dress, DVD, book, chainsaw. Instead, you rent it or swap for it. 
This is not exactly a fresh idea. In some fields, it's been around for millenniums - in the hospitality industry, for example. You can't own a house in all the places you need to travel to, so you rent a bed. Before World War II, the shared economy was most of the economy. "It's only the last 75 years or so in the United States where the industrial revolution, modern mechanization and access to credit have allowed us to buy things for ourselves instead of checking with our neighbors, friends and family first," wrote Adam Werbach, the co-founder of the sharing platform Yerdle.

There are still a few places where the sharing economy has ruled. We join gyms instead of buying treadmills. We borrow books from the library and rent movies and music.
What's new is that the sharing economy is deepening and spreading. Thousands of new businesses now sell access rather than ownership. For the young, hip and urban, collaborative consumption is a way to live light, waste less, to protect the environment, to create and associate with a community of like-minded people. But it's not just a phenomenon of the hip. For everyone, it's a way to de-clutter and save money.
Citi Bike debuted on Memorial Day with a network of 6,000 hefty blue bikes and 300 docking stations in Manhattan below 59th street and affluent Brooklyn (other socioeconomic groups to come later). Riders with credit cards can now dispense with the bother of storing bikes in their apartments and the uncertainty of locking them on the streets.
New York is very late to this party. Hundreds of cities have bike-share systems, the vast majority begun in the last five years. The largest, in Hangzhou, China, is more than 10 times the size of Citi Bike. Even Mexico City is three years ahead of New York. "At the beginning of Ecobici they said 'this is not Amsterdam,'" said Tanya Müller Garcia, the city's environment minister. "It's not a bike-friendly city. But we've seen that if you have systems that are efficient, people are willing to change their mode of transport." Ecobici has 80,000 members, who have taken 8 million rides. More than two-thirds of members had not been bike-riders before Ecobici. (It helps that the traffic in Mexico City often makes a bike trip faster than one in a car.) This year Mexico City won the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy's Sustainable Transport Award.
While bike-sharing increases bike ridership, car-sharing, paradoxically, does the reverse for autos. By putting cars into hundreds of neighborhood parking spaces, eliminating paperwork and renting for as little as an hour, car shares allow people to give up ownership of a very expensive item that sits idle nearly all the time. The largest car share, Zipcar, (owned by Avis) claims that each of its cars takes 20 cars off the road. When people do use car shares, they drive more efficiently, bunching their errands. In Mexico City, Ecobici is collaborating with Carrot, a new car share that includes electric vehicles.
We can share almost anything that costs a lot, is used only occasionally or temporarily, and comes out of the experience only slightly worse for wear. College textbooks are absurdly expensive, but you can rent them at Bookrenter or Chegg. Formal clothes? Men have always rented tuxes for special occasions, even though they can wear the exact same tux every time. For women, who by convention can't repeatedly wear the same dress, there are Web sites such as Rent the Runway and Little Borrowed Dress. The accompanying jewels can be rented from Borrowed Bling. (No endorsement implied - these are examples. There are others, which you can find with a little research, that provide access to the same products.)
Collaboration is not just for consumers - it is perhaps even more useful for producers. Most cities now have co-working spaces - big open-plan offices with desks, equipment and tools for creative freelancers. Some co-workers find the opportunity to schmooze to be a great spark for innovation. (Others find it a magnificent time-waster.) Techshop and Fablab are democratizing the design and prototyping of physical products. Techshop has six branches in California, Austin, Detroit (in collaboration with the carmaker Ford) and Pittsburgh (with the Department of Veterans Affairs - it includes free memberships for vets). Techshop is a sort of gym, but with injection molders and metal mills instead of weight machines. For a $125 membership you can get access to a fully stocked workshop with every kind of tool and software you might need, along with training, expert help and classes in such topics as how to use the equipment, get a patent or sell on Etsy. Fablab, begun at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a network of more basic, nonprofit workshops around the globe, many associated with schools or universities. There's one in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, for example, and seven in South Africa, including one that's mobile.
Just as important as the equipment, however, is the community these workshops provide. Innovation happens best when people from different disciplines collaborate.
So far I've described a particular kind of sharing business - companies that Lisa Gansky, the author of "The Mesh: Why the Future of Business is Sharing," calls "full mesh" businesses: the company owns the stuff that people buy access to. Full mesh businesses are like spiders - they have a central brain, though which everything must flow. But there's a much larger category of thousands of small companies and nonprofits doing what Gansky calls "own-to-mesh," in which there is no centrally owned inventory - people rent out or lend what they own. Own-to-mesh businesses are like starfish, with brains distributed through each finger. The head office only provides the infrastructure to keep the peer-to-peer network running. (See Steven Johnson's "Future Perfect" for an argument about how this idea is changing the political system.)
The list is long and eclectic: Airbnb and Home Exchange, Wikipedia and open-source software, peer-to-peer banks such as Lending Club, time banks. There are countless local tool exchanges, clothing swaps and neighbor-to-neighbor taxi services. You can share your Wi-Fi. You can share a dog. You can even share a baby.
Why is collaborative consumption exploding now?
- The green zeitgeist. For some people, it's still desirable to own a lot of stuff that sits idle 95 percent of the time. But more and more people are coming to define this as waste. "Using simple communications technologies to match people in need of a product or service to an existing resource that is underutilized shows just how much potential there is for us to be using the world's resources better and more effectively," wrote Rory Smith in Shareable, an online magazine about collaborative consumption.
- Recession. Sharing saves money. Zipcar boasts that its members report they save $500 a month over car ownership, on average. In a survey of its members (pdf)Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., found that they save an average of $800 a year in travel costs. And sharing makes money: Airbnb is keeping a lot of people, and not just mattresses, afloat.
- Increased longing for community. The same desire that is luring people out of traditional suburbs into walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods drives collaborative consumption. We like to bond with interesting strangers. Many of the Web sites for these businesses, notes Julia Neyman, focus their advertising on the "awesome people" who you'll meet and swap with. (That same increased population density makes collaborative consumption more practical - most shares can only work when people live close together.)
- The march of technology. Every business benefits from better information technology, but sharing businesses benefit more than others. When you are lending out your goods, you need to track them, maintain them, protect them and connect customers to them over and over. There were bikeshares in the 1990s, but they failed because they couldn't charge users or track and secure bikes. Plenty of neighborhood carshares run with a blackboard, but they will never grow. Gansky calls Zipcar "primarily an information business that happens to share cars."
Sharing also requires trust, and technology has found new ways to create it (or at least work around it). You're more likely to rent someone's couch if you can Google them first, can read reviews by previous guests and can make an online payment into an escrow account, so that no money changes hands until both parties are happy.
- Mobile technology and social networking. Sharers need to communicate with a network - often several times a day, from anywhere. "When our business first started 13 years ago the least common denominator for making reservations was a touchtone phone," said Mark Norman, the president of Zipcar. "And Zipcar required being able to make reservations via desktop computer. Now, the majority [of reservations] are from a smartphone. Those advances make it easier to take that service with you wherever you go."
Collaborative consumption is also an experience that people share with their social networks. "We get most of our customers through word-of-mouth," said Mark Hatch, the chief executive of Techshop. "Social networking platforms in which people talk about their experiences at Techshop really drive our membership model. If we didn't have that, we wouldn't be nearly as far along as we are today. People don't e-mail these kinds of experiences. But they do put them on Twitter."

HEADLINE: Toeing the Line

BYLINE: CARLOS PUIG


HIGHLIGHT: Mexico succeeds where the United States fails: at revamping the infrastructure of the world&#8217;s busiest border crossing. 

 BODY:
Tijuana, Baja California - On most radio stations in this city you get a traffic report every 15 minutes. It's not the typical kind. It doesn't refer to what's going on in the streets; it's all about "la Línea," the Line. Here, an average of 50,000 cars and 25,000 pedestrians move between the United States and Mexico every day. 
The wait is described not in minutes or hours but in cars or pedestrians. The line is not a line; it's four different lines. And so the reports go something like this: "San Ysidro, doors: 16." (Referring to one of the two border crossings between Tijuana and San Diego, and the number of gates open there.) "Left: 220." (Meaning, there are 220 cars lined up in the lanes to the left.) "Sentri: 70." (That's the count for pre-screened frequent crossers.) "Pedestrians: 1,600." (According to the 9 a.m. report from June 3). You have to live on the border to know that 220 cars means waiting about two hours and 1,600 pedestrians about 90 minutes.

Another way of putting this is to say that the busiest border in the world has become one of the more inefficient. A 2010 study by the San Diego Association of Governments and the California Department of Transportation estimated that the delays cost the state of California around $4 billion and more than 25,000 jobs a year.
In 2011, the U.S. and Mexican governments agreed to revamp border infrastructure in the Tijuana/San Diego area to reduce waiting times to a maximum of 30 minutes. In October last year Mexico opened its new border station with 22 inspection lanes, an additional 16 from before. On the U.S. side, the plan was to roughly triple the number of car lanes and double the number of inspection posts for pedestrians. But the project has fallen prey to the economic crisis and the U.S. budget sequester, and Customs and Border Protection - a subset of the Department of Homeland Security - has delayed any construction. Although President Barack Obama included in his budget proposal for FY 2014 some $226 million dollars for the border crossings, the allocation is still under discussion in Congress.
It may be the first time that the poor southern country beats its rich northern neighbor. Small consolation, though, especially for the struggling Mexican economy. "Americans are not coming as they used to, and a big part is the delay at the border when they want to go back," Carlos Bustamante, the mayor of Tijuana, told me last week.
Mexico has tried to alleviate losses by issuing a "fast pass" to tourists who spend $70 in designated local hotels and restaurants: It's a one-day pass authorizing them to go through a makeshift lane monitored by the Tijuana police that let's them skip the line to just before the U.S. inspection booth. It's empty much of the time.

HEADLINE: Is This a Government Which I See Before Me?

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on the prospects for immigration reform, Obama nominees and environmental action. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: Happy June, David! How's the weather where you are? Last weekend New York felt like August. August in the tropics. Now it feels like we're getting ready for an Easter Egg Roll.
David Brooks: I thought they had banned Easter in New York. Too many trans fats in the chocolate bunnies. I'm in Wisconsin and Illinois this week, where I'm freezing my insights off. It reminds me of the winter I spent here, I think in 1982, when it was minus 26 and minus 83 with the wind chill. I think it lasted for six months, though I could be exaggerating. My general rule for Midwestern winters is that any day you can sleep 22 hours is a good day.
Gail: I always did wonder why the pioneers who founded Chicago didn't decide to decamp after the first winter. But this kind of deep freeze in late spring isn't normal. Isn't global warming supposed to produce rapid shifts in extreme weather? This looks like a global warming crisis to me. How extreme do things have to get before Congress takes action? 
I keep hearing conservative lawmakers howl about how we're betraying future generations. But the villain is always the deficit or entitlements. Do you agree that greenhouse gases are a much bigger threat to our descendants than Social Security?
David: I'll give you Social Security but I'm still ranking health care costs as a bigger threat, though I acknowledge that health care inflation does seem to be moderating, at least temporarily.
Gail: Health care costs are a problem, but at least we're trying to deal with it. Meanwhile, the polar bears are running out of ice.
David: My big problem with global warming is not whether it's happening but what to do about it. I'd be for a gas tax, but no unilateral action will really make much of a difference and all the comprehensive approaches are economically suicidal. I'm waiting for a better scientific solution. Some people want to treat the oceans so they soak up carbon dioxide. I'm not totally up on the science, but I think they do that by dumping in huge quantities of cottage cheese.
Gail: See, this is why I despair on this topic. We start with weather Armageddon and wind up with an ocean full of cottage cheese.
Let's talk about something Congress actually might do. The Senate is back and we're hearing that the immigration reform bill might pass by July 4. And then of course there's the House and, at best, a conference committee and then more voting. When do you think we'll get a resolution - Thanksgiving? If it goes well, we could all nod over our turkeys and say: "See, Congress really can get things done."
David: Thanksgiving should be no problem. I'm feeling a little better about the prospects of passage. That's not based on any actual information except that the opponents have not really built on their early momentum. It looks like the bill could get 70 votes in the Senate. The conventional wisdom is that this large a majority will force a yes vote in the House, but I'm not sure why we should take this carry-over for granted.
Gail: When it comes to the House, I try to expect the worst. Eliminates all the muss and fuss of cleaning up heaps of charred, dashed hopes.
David: The House will likely break the bill up and it's possible they could never get around to appointing a conference committee.
Gail: That does seem to be a trend.
David: But I'd bet that we get something by Halloween. Then we could all go trick-or-treating as border control guards with our own drones.
Gail: I'm rooting for the current Senate version of immigration reform. You and I agree about the critical point of giving current undocumented residents a path to citizenship. We don't want a huge population of alienated guest workers like Europe.
For the undocumented immigrants, the big priority is just to get out from the shadows, be able to get a driver's license, buy an airplane ticket and stop worrying about sudden deportation. But for the country as a whole, it's crucial that everybody have a citizen's stake in the nation's welfare.
David: I agree and did you see the study showing that new immigrants pay more into Medicare than they take out?
Gail: Yes, and when millions of people are working with fake IDs, they never get to collect on all the money they pay into the retirement system. Entitlement hawks should be begging for more illegal immigrants.
I'm just worried that a lot of Republicans see those future citizens and envision a whole bunch of Democratic voters.
David: Well, most will be Democrats short term. But the Republicans have to fix their problem with minorities anyway. If they don't do that with the minority groups that are already here, it won't matter whether the Latino population rises a bit.
Gail: One of the things I don't like about the current immigration bill is that it spends a ridiculous amount of money on fences and border patrols. Talk about wasting taxpayer money. We've already hit the point of diminishing returns when it comes to border security, and the price tag will get even crazier as the bill moves along.
David: I guess I agree but that seems to be the price of passage, so it is worth it. I'm actually wondering more about the concentration of global skill. We've already begun moving to a more skills-based system, along with most if not all of the other rich nations. That means global talent will be concentrating more and more in a few nations. The side effects of that are obvious.
Gail: Meanwhile, I don't see anything else getting done in Congress. It looks like the Senate will be spending a lot of time failing to pass Obama nominees for federal judgeships, cabinet posts and lesser positions. The Republicans have been shocking on this front. They stonewall people because they just don't like the National Labor Relations Board. Or the Environmental Protection Agency. Or, on a number of occasions, because there's somebody who just wants to pressure the White House into giving his state a new courthouse or expanding a local military base.
David: I'd say the Republicans have taken us another notch on the continuum we've been on for a while, with both parties involved. If Romney were doing the picking, I suspect the Democrats would be just as inactive.
Gail: Federal judges are there for life and I can see why the minority party would be very aggressive about overseeing who gets named to those jobs. A cabinet is just an extension of the president, and whoever wins should pretty much have a free hand in filling the slots.
But during the Obama years the Republicans have done an unprecedented amount of stonewalling on cabinet-and-below appointees. I would also argue that their war on judicial nominees has been way beyond what went before. Really, if the president nominated God to serve on the D.C. Court of Appeals, Mitch McConnell would threaten a filibuster.
David: Can I point out that the whole confirmation process is totally insane? The F.B.I. ruined it before Congress got crazy. They now force nominees to disclose every possible thing about themselves, every bit of income, every potential conflict. Nominees have to pay legal and accounting fees to gather an insane amount of raw information. It actually tells you nothing about how good somebody is going to be at their job and it rules out many fine people. All of this is the result of open government extremism. The Congressional probing is just a cherry on top of a large meringue of insanity.
Gail: You know, the White House has been criticized for being slow to make nominations. It's because they're terrified the scandal patrol will find something hidden in the depths of a biography. When the president first came into office, I think he was shocked by how hard it was to find people in the cream of the achievement elite whose past tax records stood up to this kind of scrutiny.
David: I can't help repeating Bill Galston's great line about why government and the lives of public people should not be totally exposed. He said government should have some privacy for the same reason middle-aged people should wear clothes.
Gail: There was a columnist of yore - maybe Art Buchwald - who wrote that the nice thing about France was that nobody knew much about the political elite. When somebody got appointed to a key job people just nodded and went on with their lives. But that in the United States, you'd hear the name of the new Secretary of Whatever and realize that was the guy who got drunk and threw up at your neighbor's cookout.
But give me the big picture, David. What's your prediction for the Congressional summer? How many new Gang of Eights will arise? I'm looking forward to a return of the gun control bill, but not so much the debt-ceiling crisis. So tired of that debt ceiling.
David: I think it's going to be politically slow summer. My big question mark concerns the administration. They've only got a year left before they slide into lame duckery. You'd think they'd want to use every day to launch proposals to build a big legacy. But they are not filling the space with big plans. They seem distracted by the everyday business of administering the country. They do not seem to be carving out time to set their own agenda. The White House is still weirdly summer calm.
Gail: Or, in the spirit of our current weather, summer calm mixed with the occasional blizzard and gale-force winds.

HEADLINE: How Bad Is European Youth Unemployment?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: A crisis of &#8220;economic inactivity&#8221; is still a crisis. 

 BODY:
My Sunday column returned to what's become a recurring theme of mine: The remarkable political quiescence of Europeans in the face of the economic devastation wrought by their rolling disaster of a currency union. In this case, my jumping-off point was what the Atlantic's Derek Thompson calls "the scariest graph in the world," which shows youth unemployment - for under-25-year-olds, that is - breaking 40 percent in Italy, 50 percent in Spain and 60 percent in Greece. So it's worth saying something about the (fairly widespread) rejoinder that these numbers aren't actually as bad as they look, because most young people are in school or training rather than looking fruitlessly for work. For instance, here's the Financial Times' Kate Allen, downplaying the youth-unemployment crisis:
Unemployment figures only reflect the proportion of the population who are economically active - ie. looking for a job, but unable to find one. 
Among young people in particular, inactivity rates can be expected to be very high - many are in either education or training.
What do the figures look like if we take into account the economically inactive population?
Far less bad, actually, even with the caveat that some individuals will go into training or education because of the lack of jobs.
What follows is a chart showing that the vast majority of Spanish, Greek and Italians under 25 are neither employed nor actively job-hunting, but "economically inactive." Which is a fair point - but is it really all that encouraging? For one thing, as Thompson noted in his post, the ranks of the economically inactive include millions of so-called NEETS - "Not Employed, or in Education, or Training" - who, like "discouraged workers" of all ages, are plainly jobless even if they aren't technically unemployed. For another, the picture still looks extremely grim for Spain and Italy and Greece if you look at overall rates of economic activity instead of just looking at the unemployment rate alone. In the United States, which at least has a semi-healthy post-Great Recession economy, the youth workforce participation rate - the percentage of all 16-24-year-olds either doing or seeking paid work - is currently about 53 percent, and most of the more stable northern European economies are up over 50 or even 60 percent. In southern Europe, though, not so much: Spain's youth workforce participate rate is about 36 percent, and Italy's and Greece's are both about 28 percent. In other words, almost half of the under-25 population in those countries who would be working under normal (and by normal, I mean the high-unemployment, slow-growth, post-Great Recession "normal") circumstances are sitting on the sidelines instead. Of course some of them are doing useful things that may pay some dividends for them down the road. But the costs in wasted productivity, lost earnings, and delayed family formation far exceed those benefits - not least because this generation of young Europeans was not exactly undereducated or undertrained to begin with, so an extra few years of schooling would probably bring diminishing marginal returns even in the best of times.
Now these numbers do point to one plausible answer to the "why no upheaval" question: Namely, that European-style public education systems no less than European-style safety nets can serve as stabilizing forces in a crisis, making "economic inactivity" more bearable and even superficially productive than it would have been in past eras. The problem, though, is that the best response to this particular crisis is not the kind of muddling-through, "go back to school until the economy recovers" that the social democratic model is designed to enable; rather, it's a painful-but-necessary break with a misguided continent-wide consensus. And because it's hard to see how the economies of southern Europe can really recover absent such a break, there's a case to be made that those countries would be better off if their young people actually had fewer short-term options - because that would make it more apparent what the Eurozone's current course means for today's under-25-year-olds in the long term, and encourage the Spanish and Italians and Greeks (and the Portuguese, and the Cypriots, and ...) to actually leap out of the pot instead of letting themselves get slowly boiled.

HEADLINE: Komen Breast Cancer Charity Cancels Races in 7 Cities

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Nearly 18 months after an uproar over its decision to withdraw funding to Planned Parenthood, Susan G. Komen for the Cure is still struggling to meet fund-raising and participation goals. 

 BODY:
The Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation has canceled half of its "3-Day" fund-raising races around the country next year as it struggles to regain support nearly 18 months after its 2012 decision to withdraw funding for breast cancer screening at some Planned Parenthood affiliates.
Citing the economy and concerns about meeting fund-raising and volunteer participation goals in seven cities, Komen, the nation's largest breast cancer advocacy organization, canceled its 2014 races in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Phoenix, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington. 
It will continue to hold races in Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Philadelphia, San Diego and Seattle.
After Komen announced its Planned Parenthood decision last year, many longtime supporters took their anger to social media platforms, leading Komen to restore the funds. The foundation, based in Dallas, has struggled to regain those supporters.
The announcement about the race cancellations was made on Monday on the Facebook page Komen had set up for the 3-Day races.
As the Susan G. Komen 3-Day continues to evolve, next year will bring changes that will affect many members of our Komen 3-Day family. The 2014 Susan G. Komen 3-Day will return to Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Michigan, Philadelphia, San Diego, Seattle and the Twin Cities. However, we are saddened to share that the 3-Day will not be returning to the following markets in 2014: Arizona, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Tampa Bay, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Please note the 2013 3-Day series will continue as planned.
We are in the process of notifying all of the 3-Day family about plans for 2014, but wanted to share this news with you all here, too. The difficult decision to exit these markets was not made lightly, as we know this bold and empowering event has touched the lives of thousands of participants like you. While the 3-Day has brought great awareness to the breast cancer cause, participation levels over the last four years have made it difficult to sustain an event of this magnitude in 14 cities.
We'd like to thank all of our 3-Day participants for generously giving their support and participation to the Susan G. Komen 3-Day. We deeply appreciate your passion and commitment in helping find a cure for breast cancer and we hope all of you continue your support of the 3-Day and consider participation in one of the seven markets in 2014.
The decision prompted another wide-ranging conversation online, with some people writing on Twitter and Facebook that they were not surprised by the news. 
Others expressed disappointment.
@The3Day Saddened by the news, but have hopes that it will make the remaining 7 cities stronger.Looking forward to this year's walk and 2014
- Margie Dowens (@MargieDowens)3 Jun 13
@The3Day Very sad-walking in memory of Betty Wood in her home city meant so much to every Team Betty to walk through Boston. @RememberBetty
- Jackie M (@SweetSinger2888)4 Jun 13
A Komen representative replied on Twitter: 
@SweetSinger2888 It was not an easy decision. We ultimately want to return the most $ to the cause & this allows us to do that.
- Susan G. Komen 3-Day (@The3Day)4 Jun 13
A spokeswoman for Komen said on Wednesday that the decision would not affect other races sponsored by the foundation.
On Facebook, Paulene Layher Bitners, who has Stage 4 breast cancer, wrote that she had been looking forward to joining the walk in San Francisco in 2014 "as a 'triumph' walk."
I had many wonderful supporters when I walk in SF in 2009...those people are now supporting me as I walk through Stage 4 Breast Cancer (stage 4 at diagnosis). I was looking forward to walking in SF in 2014 as a "triumph" walk...I will never be called a survivOR, but wanted to walk to show that I am survivING! Now, I won't be able to walk at all as the travel expenses will be too much on top of the fund raising. So sad to see one more dream stolen from me!!!

HEADLINE: Debt Deal in Alabama Will Cost JPMorgan

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Ultimately, JPMorgan Chase will have given up nearly $1.6 billion as a result of its dealings with Jefferson County. 

 BODY:
Under the deal to settle the bankruptcy of Jefferson County, Ala., firms that invested in its distressed debt will have the most to gain, JPMorgan Chase will face a big loss, and residents will be wondering whether there will be any relief for them.
The terms of the agreement, laid out in federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday, are in several ways better for the county than the concessions that creditors were offering in the fall of 2011 as they struggled to keep the county from declaring bankruptcy. If the deal goes forward, original creditors would receive 80 cents on the dollar for the county's debt, while alternative investment firms like hedge funds that invested later would receive close to 85 cents, saving Jefferson County more than $1 billion over time. The state would not have to back the county's finances with a so-called moral obligation pledge, as proposed in 2011.
 And the new deal would allow the county to keep control of its sewer system - the troubled cash cow at the heart of the bankruptcy. Two years ago, creditors tried to transfer the system to an independent authority to shield it from elected officials who some feared might try to manipulate its rates for political gain. 
When the dust finally settles, JPMorgan Chase, which many in the county hold responsible for the financial collapse in the first place, will have given up nearly $1.6 billion as a result of its dealings with the county and its ill-fated effort to finance sewer repairs. The new deal calls for the bank to forfeit $842 million on the $1.22 billion of sewer debt that it holds, which comes on top of $647 million it forgave in termination fees on derivatives contracts with the county and a $75 million penalty it paid to settle a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The county, for its part, will drop a lawsuit against JPMorgan if the new agreement goes through.
Despite the improved terms, some county residents are still so angry about the debacle that the proposed concessions are not enough. Some still think the only fair thing is full-blown debt repudiation.
"The deal will force Jefferson County to return to the scene of the crime that crippled it: the bond market," John Archibald, a columnist for The Birmingham News, wrote inan article published online Wednesday.
"Lucifer spells his name J. P. Morgan," he added.
County officials said that a hearing on Wednesday before Judge Thomas B. Bennett of Federal Bankruptcy Court lasted less than an hour and attracted only a handful of protesters, a tiny turnout that one official attributed to a case of "sewer fatigue." The judge stayed a lawsuit that contended the county's sewer debt had been incurred unconstitutionally and needed to be written down more than the new deal proposes. That done, county officials said they could now turn to the bigger task of writing a plan of adjustment, the document that the judge must approve for the bankruptcy to be resolved.
"It was clear in the court proceedings today that the parties are beginning to relinquish their litigation posturing," said Laurence L. Gottlieb, chief executive of Fundamental Advisors, a private equity firm that participated in the negotiations.
With the county headed toward an exit from bankruptcy, hedge funds and private equity firms stand to profit. When Jefferson County declared bankruptcy in November 2011, these alternative investment firms saw opportunity in the defaulted warrants of a county mired in the biggest Chapter 9 bankruptcy case in United States history. Speculative interest in distressed municipal debt is normally extremely limited because while distressed municipalities are not rare, officials willing to walk away from public debts are. When municipalities have defaulted in the past, they have usually been too small for hedge funds to bother with.
But Jefferson County had $3.2 billion of sewer revenue debt alone, and a total of $4.2 billion in debt when it went bankrupt. The scale attracted a number of alternative investment firms that took the unusual step of buying debt for about 60 cents on the dollar. While that would be routine in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, where investors may buy deeply discounted debt in an attempt to take over a company, a Chapter 9 bankruptcy does not afford such opportunities: municipalities obviously do not issue stock, and it is impossible for a hedge fund to take one over in bankruptcy.
Instead, the alternative investment firms helped to negotiate a refinancing of Jefferson County's debts. In return, they are being paid extra for bearing some of the risk if the municipal bond market steers clear of Jefferson County after the refinancing. They will receive an additional 4.9 cents on the dollar in exchange for a promise to buy 10 percent of the county's new debt in the refinancing if other investors will not.
The investment firms, in other words, are providing a market backstop that could let Jefferson County refinance without having to rely on the state, and without raising sewer rates too much. Part of their extra payment will come from the proceeds of the new debt issue, and part from JPMorgan, according to people briefed on the agreement.
"Getting even 80 percent is a huge windfall to them," said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Municipal Market Advisors, noting that the firms' purchase cost may have been as low as 60 percent.
The underwriter of the coming debt issue will also have to promise to take 10 percent of the issue if the market will not. Other signatories to the deal appear content with their outcomes. Assured Guaranty, one of the insurers of Jefferson County's debt, issued a statement Wednesday saying that the size of its loss would be smaller than the amount of reserves it had put in place to cover the loss.
Mr. Fabian said he doubted that the municipal bond market would have much appetite for Jefferson County's coming issue of new debt, which would pay for the 80 cents on the dollar it will pay to extinguish the old debt.
"Most people expect they cannot sell it," he said. "It's going to be bought by very aggressive buyers." The problem, he said, is that Jefferson County's problems have been going for years, and investors are now in the habit of expecting things to go wrong.
"There's a real potential for some kind of litigation, and a workout going forward," he said. "You have to assume that. If anything goes wrong, they're not going to do the right thing by investors. So you need a broad enough return that you can afford lawyers and restructuring counsel down the road."
To show it was bringing its new debt to market in good faith, he predicted Jefferson County would raise sewer rates one more time before the sale.
That's what Mr. Archibald, the Birmingham columnist, was also predicting, in his column.
"Sewer rates will rise dramatically under this deal," he wrote.

HEADLINE: Is Virginia for Haters?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The gubernatorial campaign may be the proving ground for how far out the cutting edge of social conservatism can go. 

 BODY:
This year's gubernatorial election in Virginia represents politics at its worst. So says Jonathan Chait, New York magazine columnist. He describes the race as the "most depressing election in America," giving voters a choice between "Republican nutjob Ken Cuccinelli or soulless Democratic hack Terry McAuliffe."
Not to be outdone, Time magazine headlined its story: "The Dirtiest, Nastiest, Low-Down Campaign In America: Cuccinelli vs. McAuliffe."
There is however, another way to look at the upcoming Virginia off-year election: as a unique proving ground for two of the most significant developments in contemporary politics - Republican intra-party schism and the critical role of campaign technology.

First, we have the gubernatorial nomination of Cuccinelli, exemplifying the widening rift within the Republican Party. The split pits the hard right wing, which argues that moderation leads to moral collapse, against the establishment wing, which is calling on candidates to mute discussion of social issues. 
Virginia is a state moving steadily from red to purple - from "reliably Republican" to "presidential battleground." Republican activists with majority control of the state Party nominating process have come down with a vengeance on the side of the hard right.
At the May 17-18 Virginia Republican Party convention, the nomination of Cuccinelli, the Rev. E. W. Jackson for lieutenant governor, and State Senator Mark D. Obenshain for attorney general amounted to a declaration of "no retreat" from conservative orthodoxy, a thumb in the eye of the establishment.
"This is the most conservative Republican ticket in the history of Virginia," Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, told me in a telephone interview.
On the Democratic side, the Virginia election will be the first off-year test of Obama campaign techniques without Obama actually on the ballot. It will help determine whether the deployment of innovative microtechnology, data analysis and IT-enhanced voter lists, combined with a large network of volunteers to boost turnout, can be successfully replicated under very different and more adverse circumstances.
McAuliffe has hired technology and turn-out staff from the Obama campaign, and he has also acquired that campaign's 2012 Virginia voter files, including names of local organizers and neighborhood volunteers, information that proved critical to Obama's victory last year.
Brennan Bilberry, McAuliffe's spokesman, said the campaign has picked Michael Halle, who was the North Carolina election director for Obama, to coordinate election activities with the Virginia Democratic Party and local Democratic and progressive organizations. Michelle Kleppe, who was Wisconsin field director for Obama, is McAuliffe's field director. "Our organizers are overwhelmingly veterans of the 2012 effort. Furthermore, the neighborhood team program - which was the most important local organizational structure in 2012 - is activated and enthusiastic about this election," Bilberry said.
But 2013 will be a much more difficult test. Not only does McAuliffe have significant candidate-specific liabilities, which I'll get to shortly, but, perhaps more important, turnout in gubernatorial elections drops by 30 points or more compared to turnout for presidential elections. According to the Virginia State Board of Elections, it falls from low-to-mid 70 percent levels to low-to-mid 40 percent levels.
Turnout decline occurs disproportionately among Democratic constituencies - young voters, single women, minorities - the very voters that the Obama campaign was able to identify and turn out in 2012.
The turnout issue is directly linked to the ideological warfare within the Republican Party. McAuliffe is banking on the extreme conservatism of the Republican ticket to motivate Democratic and liberal-leaning independent voters to go to the polls in droves.
Soon after the 2012 election, which was widely viewed as a setback with long-term implications for the Republican Party, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, initiated a study that, on publication in early March, became known as the "Autopsy Report."
The Autopsy Report warned that growing numbers of people were perceiving the party as "'scary,' 'narrow-minded' and 'out of touch' - made up of 'stuffy old men.' "
A study of young voters released earlier this week by the College Republicans, "Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation," came to very similar conclusions. When young, potential swing voters were asked what came to mind when they thought about the Republican Party, "responses were brutal: closed-minded, racist, rigid, old-fashioned." According to the report, support for immigration reform, including a path to citizenship, has for many millennial voters become what political strategists call a "gateway issue" - that is, a litmus test a candidate must pass before he or she is given serious consideration. Republican hostility to reform can "turn voters away," the authors wrote. The issue of same-sex marriage cuts even deeper:
Perhaps no topic has gotten more attention with regards to the youth vote than the issue of gay marriage. And on this issue, the conventional wisdom is right: young people are unlikely to view homosexuality as morally wrong, and they lean toward legal recognition of same-sex relationships.
Cuccinelli has a different point of view.
After the Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws in 2003, Cuccinelli, then a state senator from Fairfax County, flatly declared, "Homosexuality is wrong." During his 2009 campaign for attorney general, Cuccinelli shifted the focus of his critique from homosexuality to homosexual acts:
My view is that homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. They're intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law-based country it's appropriate to have policies that reflect that.
Cuccinelli went on to say, 
I happen to think that it represents, to put it politely - I need my thesaurus to be polite - behavior that is not healthy to an individual and in aggregate is not healthy to society.
These statements did not prevent Cuccinelli from winning the election for attorney general by a decisive 58-42 margin.
On immigration, Cuccinelli has sponsored legislation to allow employers to fire workers who can't speak English. In 2007, he broke with President Bush over administration legislation proposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants. "Dear Fellow Republican: My president is wrong," Cuccinelli wrote in an e-mail to supporters. "For much of his presidency, President Bush has functioned as the head of the Republican Party. Not any more... This immigration bill is something of a 'last straw' for ordinary Republicans."
In 2007, while a state senator, Cuccinelli sponsored an anti-abortion "personhood" amendment to the state constitution that declared: 
life begins at the moment of fertilization and the right to enjoyment of life guaranteed by Article 1, § 1 of the Constitution of Virginia is vested in each born and preborn human being from the moment of fertilization.
Cuccinelli went on to compare the abolitionist movement before the Civil War to the anti-abortion movement now: "it was Christians who led the fight against slavery, and now years later it's Christians who are on point fighting abortion."
Cuccinelli is currently downplaying his stands on social issues, rarely mentioning abortion or homosexuality on the campaign trail, talking instead about jobs and the economy. But the McAuliffe campaign, the state Democratic Party, liberal blogs and the media have been relentless in turning up every available Cuccinelli quote, video and newspaper clip - and there are many of them - in which he aggressively proclaims his views on gays, immigration and abortion.
American Bridge, a Washington-based "super PAC" that describes itself as "a progressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable for their words and actions," is publishing on its Web site every potentially damaging Cuccinelli statement, and linking Cuccinelli to E.W. Jackson, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor - with subtle videos like "Partners In Slime: Cuccinelli and Jackson" and "Cuccinelli and E.W. Jackson See Eye-to-Eye on Planned Parenthood Attacks."
If Cuccinelli is on the cutting edge of social conservatism, his running mate, Jackson, is over the edge. Jackson, a black minister, lawyer and former Marine, was the surprise choice of the 8,000 activists attending the Republican convention in Richmond last May. He wowed the gathering with a campaign speech that repeatedly brought cheers, applause and standing ovations:
We stand up for the lives of unborn children because there is no liberty without freedom. We stand up for the traditional family because there is no liberty when the government violates your conscience. We stand up for parental choice in education because there is no liberty when our children are indoctrinated instead of educated.
Jackson's speech reached a high point toward the end, when he declared: "I am proud to say I am not an African-American. I am an American."
Jackson has consistently thrown caution to the winds, and it didn't take long for Buzzfeed to post videos of "The 10 Most Anti-Gay Statements From The Republican Nominee For Lt. Governor Of Virginia." Among them:
These people are out to transform the culture. And they believe that sexuality is how everybody ought to be defined. And that means sexual freedom, sexual license to do whatever you want to do. And I know their people say, well, 'It's unfair to associate homosexuality with pedophilia or some of these other perversions.' But I believe that there is a direct connection, because what they really want is absolute sexual freedom.
And this gem:
Their minds are perverted, they're frankly very sick people psychologically, mentally and emotionally and they see everything through the lens of homosexuality. When they talk about love they're not talking about love, they're talking about homosexual sex.
While not dissociating himself from Jackson, Cuccinelli has sought to portray his campaign as distinct from Jackson's.
"I am just not going to defend my running mates' statements at every turn," Cuccinelli told reporters on May 20. "They've got to explain those themselves. Part of this process is just letting Virginia voters get comfortable with us, on an individual basis, personally."
In Virginia, voters cast separate ballots for governor and lieutenant governor so it is possible to have a governor of one party and a lieutenant governor and/or an attorney general of another.
In a radio interview on WMAL late last week, however, Jackson disputed the distinctness of Cuccinelli's campaign. 
This ticket is probably more homogeneous than almost any ticket ever in the history of Virginia, so there's no stark disagreement between us. There may be some nuances here and there, and I don't think we'll be afraid to express those.
The depth of the right wing ideology of the Republican ticket in Virginia is not only a direct challenge to Reince Priebus, it is crucial to the McAuliffe campaign strategy of boosting turnout among lethargic Democratic voters.
A top McAuliffe operative who refused to be quoted by name discussing campaign strategy told me, 
We will use Ken Cuccinelli to expand the electorate. For younger voters, African-Americans and Latinos, Cuccinelli's record on issues is highly motivating, and gives those voters a sense of urgency about the election. The other key for a Democrat in an odd year election is the independent voter. Here again, Cuccinelli's extreme position on issues provides an opportunity for us to appeal to independent voters.
Cuccinelli is also crucial to McAuliffe because, as some of his supporters privately acknowledge, the Democratic nominee has his own vulnerabilities and will need to campaign against Cuccinelli more than for himself.
In 2009, McAuliffe ran for governor only to lose the Democratic primary with just 26.44 percent of the vote.
Sabato, who seemed to like the Democratic nominee, said McAuliffe has a number of problems running in Virginia, including his boisterousness - "his personality, he comes on so strong" - the fact that he has never held public office, and his ties to the moneyed Washington establishment. Sabato told me that he once asked McAuliffe if the fact that he has raised hundreds of millions of dollars would hurt him. McAuliffe shot back, "I am outraged that you would say I have only raised hundreds of millions. I have raised billions."
Ronald Rapoport, a political scientist at William and Mary, noted that neither McAuliffe nor Cuccinelli is a solid candidate: "Clearly each is lucky to be running against the other since they both have significant weaknesses."
Both candidates have higher unfavorable than favorable rating among Virginia voters. A May 29 survey by Public Policy Polling found 44 percent holding an unfavorable opinion of Cuccinelli and 32 percent were favorable. McAuliffe's numbers were 33 percent unfavorable and 29 percent favorable.
McAuliffe's main claim to fame is that he is a prodigious Democratic fund-raiser. Known as the Macker, McAuliffe is a glad-handing, fast-talking inveterate salesman. Some people enjoy him as a rascal promoter, most importantly of himself, while others view him as the embodiment of a Democratic Party corrupted by big money.
Bill Clinton, a major beneficiary of McAuliffe's fund-raising talents, made perhaps the most revealing comment in an interview with Mark Leibovich in The New York Times Magazine: "Absolutely, I would buy a new car from Terry," Clinton said. "But a used car? I am not so sure about a used car."
McAuliffe has toned down for the campaign, although his fund-raising skills are paying off. As of the end of May, he had raised $9.7 million, $2.1 million more than the $7.6 million raised by Cuccinelli. McAuliffe has spent very little of his cash; he had $5.4 million in the bank at the end of April, compared to $2.7 million for Cuccinelli.
Major donors to McAuliffe include the Democratic Governors' Association ($2 million) Clinton ($100,000), the American Federation of Teachers ($100,000), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ($132,530), Los Angeles Democratic donors Haim Saban ($250,000) and Ron W. Burkle ($100,000).
Cuccinelli's biggest donor is the Republican Governor's Association at $2 million. He has strong backing from prominent conservatives like David H. Koch at $50,000 and Foster Friess at $25,000 - along with energy company support, including Consol Energy, $129,000; Murray Energy Corp., $50,000; and Appalachian Power, $47,500.
Polling at this stage in the contest remains unreliable. RealClearPolitics lists four public polls, two taken in March that show Cuccinelli ahead by 3 and 10 points, and two taken in April, both of which show McAuliffe ahead by 5 points.
While the Virginia contest will have direct implications for the elections of 2014 and 2016, it's not at all clear what lessons political strategists and advocates will draw from the outcome on Nov. 5. I asked Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition and a Cuccinelli supporter, whether the race is a good test of who is correct, the Republican establishment calling for moderation or the party's social conservatives. Reed replied by e-mail: "It's a terrific test if Cuccinelli wins. If he loses, it's not."

HEADLINE: Jefferson County's Bankruptcy Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A county in Alabama took a big step toward resolving its bankruptcy. | Regulators are preparing for an important vote on the money market fund industry. | Obama&#8217;s planned F.B.I. nominee could offer a peek at the largest hedge fund in the world. | Patent rights are set to be publicly traded on a new exchange. 

 BODY:
Jefferson County, Ala., reached an agreement to refinance most of the debt at the heart of its financial breakdown, taking a big step toward resolving its bankruptcy, Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook. "The deal, according to the people briefed on the negotiations, covers about $2.4 billion of Jefferson County's total $3.078 billion in sewer debt, which was issued to pay for significant repairs needed to bring the county into compliance with federal clean water laws."
The refinancing would position the county, which includes Birmingham, to emerge from bankruptcy in a matter of months, according to people briefed on the negotiations, though the terms must still be approved by a federal judge. The county must also clear other hurdles. The county's bankruptcy, which came in 2011 after the interest due on the sewer debt shot up as a result of the financial turmoil of 2008, is the biggest municipal bankruptcy in United States history. 
"The refinancing agreement covers debt held by creditors that include JPMorgan Chase, which holds about $1.22 billion of the sewer debt, the biggest block; three bond insurers; and seven hedge funds, according to a term sheet circulated in a meeting of the county commission on Tuesday. The terms call for these creditors to receive about $1.84 billion for the $2.4 billion of debt they now hold. The concessions were weighted most heavily toward JPMorgan, the term sheet said, 'to increase the recovery of other sewer creditors.' The bank is giving up $842 million, or about 70 percent, of the face value of its debt, according to people briefed on the negotiations." Some former officials of JPMorgan were found to have been involved in improprieties in connection with a county debt refinancing in 2002 and 2003.
S.E.C. TO VOTE ON MONEY FUND PROPOSAL | After a long effort to revamp the money market fund industry, regulators are preparing for an important vote on Wednesday morning. The five members of the Securities and Exchange Commission are scheduled to vote on a proposal that could eventually do away with the stable dollar-a-share value that has long defined money market funds, according to people briefed on the proposal, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. "The proposal suggests that it may be necessary to eliminate the fixed share value only on money funds used by big institutional investors, not those used by small investors, and only on so-called prime money funds that invest in corporate debt, not on money funds that invest in government and municipal debt. The affected funds are the ones that were hit the hardest during the financial crisis in 2008."
F.B.I. NOMINEE COULD OFFER PEEK AT BRIDGEWATER | 
It is not unusual for a government official to come from a hedge fund. But in the case of President Obama's planned F.B.I. nominee, James B. Comey, the hedge fund in question, Bridgewater Associates, may raise some eyebrows, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world, is known for a 123-page manifesto by its founder, Ray Dalio, containing principles that could easily be seen as a "latter-day model of EST or another 1970s personal discovery group," Mr. Davidoff writes. At the same time, Mr. Dalio is often hailed as a genius.
"Mr. Comey's reasons for going to Bridgewater and what he thought of the culture there are only speculation at this point. If he is nominated, though, Mr. Comey may want to go before the Senate and let the public know what he thinks of the hedge fund and why he worked there."
ON THE AGENDA | The Federal Reserve's so-called beige book about the economy is out at 2 p.m. Rue21, which agreed to sell itself to Apax Partners, reports earnings after the market closes. Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, is on Bloomberg TV at 7 a.m. Matthew Layton, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Clifford Chance, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m.
AN EXCHANGE FOR PATENT RIGHTS | Patent rights, which are usually bought and sold in private transactions, are set to be publicly traded on a new exchange that plans to announce its first offering on Wednesday. The Intellectual Property Exchange International, which is based in Chicago and says it is the first of its kind, has attracted a handful of blue-chip companies and prominent universities as its initial members. One of those companies, Royal Philips Electronics, is set to begin marketing the rights to a portfolio of more than 600 patent assets.
Separately, President Obama took direct aim on Tuesday at shell companies known as patent trolls, which exist to pursue patent infringement claims, Edward Wyatt reports in The New York Times. The president announced several executive orders "to protect innovators from frivolous litigation" by patent trolls.

HEADLINE: A Star of Football's Violent Past

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Deacon Jones was one of the first pro football players to put a sunny spin on what we know to be a very dark game.
Beginning with his nickname, ''Deacon,'' Jones, who died Monday at age 74, touched many lives inside and outside of football. Jones was not the product of a college football factory -- he attended South Carolina State and Mississippi Vocational, now known as Mississippi Valley State. Yet he climbed out of relative obscurity to put an indelible stamp on the National Football League.
The flood of heartfelt tributes tells the story of a pro football fraternity that has found itself splintered -- young players against old, team executives against players. 
Deacon Jones, in death as he was for much of his life, has been a bridge between those sides.
Jack Youngblood, Jones's teammate and fellow Hall of Famer, said, ''Deacon Jones has been the most inspirational person in my football career.''
Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen said: ''Deacon Jones was one of the greatest players in N.F.L. history. Off the field, he was a true giant.''
Allen's father, George Allen, coached Jones with the Los Angeles Rams and the Redskins.
''His passion and spirit will continue to inspire those who knew him,'' Bruce Allen said. ''He was a cherished member of the Allen family and I will always consider him my big brother.''
N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell called Jones an icon among icons.
Even contemporary players who had no way of knowing Jones's impact saluted him. Philadelphia Eagles running back Felix Jones said on Twitter, ''He truly changed the culture and way the games played.''
Indeed, he did.
Jones was the leader of the Rams' fierce pass-rushing unit, the Fearsome Foursome. It spawned an era of defensive fronts in a time in which defense ruled the N.F.L. There were the Vikings' Purple People Eaters, the Cowboys' Doomsday Defense and Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain.
Jones was part of an era in football in which everything was legal: Horse-collar tackles, clothesline tackles, below-the-knees crackback blocks. Defenseless receivers were a sight for sore eyes.
Jones is credited with coining the term ''sack.'' What I remember Jones for is the head slap, easily the most devastating defensive maneuver in professional football this side of the clothesline. Jones would take a step, slap the offensive lineman's helmet with his forearm or perhaps with both hands. The head slap was eventually outlawed, but it remains a monument to a legacy of violence and brutality that defined an era.
How many concussions did Jones cause? How much brain damage?
These are questions for our era, not his. You played to the extent that the rules allowed. Defensive backs reveled in defenseless receivers, better to bury shoulder pads in ribs. This was an era in which defenders were encouraged to launch their bodies; leading with the helmet was an accepted practice, and a concussion was the cost of doing business.
Fans could not get enough.
Many of the players we lionize were part of pro football's brutal past. Tactics lauded then are no longer legal tender. This is the complex tightrope that professional football continues to negotiate with each passing decade.
Today the economically vibrant N.F.L. finds itself in an increasingly uncomfortable moral bind, uneasily embracing its brutal past -- represented by stars like Deacon Jones -- while sanitizing the game with new rules that give the veneer of safety.
There is no way to make football safe. Players of Jones's era knew this, accepted it and, in some ways, reveled in the reality that they played an often deadly, violent game.
Some players played with a relentless, humorless, nonapologetic fury. Jones chased quarterbacks with a passion, slapped offensive lineman silly and was probably responsible for more concussions than anyone will ever know.
While Jones played a violent game, he always maintained a sense of humor, always provided reporters with a good quote or a snappy line. Who could forget his infectious smile?
Deacon Jones was a product of his era. And he was the best of his era.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Development Won't Ensure Democracy in Turkey

BYLINE: By DARON ACEMOGLU. 
Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., is the co-author, with James A. Robinson, of ''Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'' and ''Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty.''

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- FOR the past few years, there has been a general optimism about Turkish democracy in Western capitals, especially in Washington, thanks to the economic strides made by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P.
These optimists, and even those who admit that Turkish democracy has its shortcomings, tend to subscribe to the political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset's famous modernization theory -- the idea that greater democratization follows automatically as a country becomes more prosperous. Turkey has been growing rapidly and steadily over the last 11 years, the theory goes, so perhaps all we need is patience. By this logic, Mr. Erdogan's own economic success will inexorably bring an end to his authoritarian style of government.
But modernization theory has had little success in explaining the rise of democracy around the world. My research with Simon Johnson, James A. Robinson and Pierre Yared has shown, for example, that countries that have grown faster don't show any greater tendency to become democratic or to consolidate democratic institutions that already exist. A few cases where democracy has followed rapid growth, as in South Korea and Taiwan, did not occur automatically but as a result of a combative political process -- and a far more violent set of confrontations between the military and protesters, trade unionists and students. 
And it has little relevance to this week's protests in Turkey.
Even before the brutal suppression of the demonstrations, the belief that Turkey was on its way to becoming a mature democracy -- a role model for the rest of the Middle East -- had already become untenable.
As the A.K.P. consolidated its power, dissent was tolerated less and less. Judicial institutions lost the little independence they'd had, and an array of critics of the government, ranging from former high-ranking military officers to journalists, are now in jail, in most cases without having had a fair trial (According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkey has now surpassed China for the number of jailed journalists.)
The bulwarks of democracy have not exactly distinguished themselves during the past week's events. There has been hardly any criticism of the prime minister from within his own party (except a mild rebuke from President Abdullah Gul).
The main opposition party, which was established by the Turkish republic's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, still seems trapped in a time warp -- focused solely on defending the nationalist, secularist ideology of the Turkish state.
And the Turkish news media still seems cowed into submission, so much so that it did not report much on how the small protests against a new shopping center on one of the few remaining parks in Istanbul turned into a spontaneous mass movement challenging Mr. Erdogan's authoritarianism. Indeed, while CNN International was reporting live from Taksim Square, the local channel, CNN Turk, which is partly owned by Turner Broadcasting, was airing a program on penguins.
Even so, what began as peaceful protests by a few hundred demonstrators in Taksim Square could define Turkish democracy for years to come -- for two reasons.
First, democracy doesn't just take place at the polls, especially when the choices on the ballot are as unappealing as they have been in Turkey. British democracy came of age in the 19th century partly as a result of protests in the streets, which not only led to the enfranchisement of the previously disenfranchised but also to the formation of the Labour Party, offering new options to voters. Large numbers of people pouring into the street in several Turkish cities, even in the face of heavy-handed police action, may be Turkish democracy's coming-of-age moment.
Second, there is a real chance that these protests, and the political movements that they might spawn, will transcend the deep-rooted but stale political divisions of the last two decades, divisions captured pithily by Recep Tayyip Erdogan when he said in 1998: ''In this country there is a segregation of Black Turks and White Turks. Your brother Tayyip belongs to the Black Turks.''
In Turkey, these terms have nothing to do with skin color. ''White Turks'' are the well-educated, wealthy secular elites who see themselves as the defenders of Ataturk's legacy. They are often associated with government bureaucracy, the military and big businesses in major Turkish cities. ''Black Turks'' are those that the White Turks look down upon as poorly educated, lower class and trapped by their piety. Elites tend to view them as peasants or being unable to shake off their peasant heritage.
Although the Turkish military periodically used religion as a weapon in its struggle against the political left, particularly after the 1980 military coup, by the 1990s the most important challenge to the secular elite's rule came from religious conservative parties, who unabashedly represented the Black Turks.
In 1997, the military toppled a government led by the A.K.P.'s predecessor, the Welfare Party, which was subsequently shut down by the constitutional court. It similarly threatened the A.K.P. in 2007, with the Constitutional Court again following at its coattails and threatening to ban the party because its religious outlook violated the Turkish Constitution.
Particularly troubling for the secular elite was the fact that the wife of the new president, Mr. Gul, wore a head scarf, something banned in public spaces by the Constitution.
Since 1997, these divisions have defined Turkish politics. The military failed and the A.K.P. withstood the challenge. Turkey has become more democratic in the sense that the previously disenfranchised have become empowered. But it has not taken many steps toward liberal democracy. On the contrary, Turkish society has become more polarized between supporters of secular orthodoxy and the A.K.P., which, under Mr. Erdogan's leadership, has used its newly acquired power to exact revenge on the military, secular elites and its other critics with increasingly authoritarian certitude.
This week's protests are unlikely to topple the government or even force an about-face by the prime minister. Their import lies in their symbolism.
Suddenly, there is a diverse group of people pouring into the streets to demand not handouts or policy concessions but a voice in Turkish politics. The protesters are not hard-core opposition supporters wishing to turn the clock back to the secular orthodoxy of yore but young urbanites frustrated by the A.K.P.'s increasingly unresponsive monopoly on power.
As in 19th-century Britain, if the ballot box doesn't offer the right choices, democracy advances by direct action.
The danger in Turkey is that hard-liners in the A.K.P. will use these events to further divide society. They are already painting a picture in which the protests are an attempt to claw back the newly acquired powers of the previously disenfranchised, labeling the young men and women in the streets as alcoholics, looters and leftists.
These hard-liners have been aided by the Turkish news media, which, with a few exceptions, still obediently toes the party line. In the short run, they may well succeed, further polarizing Turkish politics and cementing the A.K.P.'s control over state institutions.
What makes these events a turning point, however, is that the discontent of a large segment of the Turkish public is now out in the open, and even if the Turkish media continues to ignore it, the knowledge of this discontent will spread.
The genie is out of the bottle. Neither it nor Turkish democracy can be put back.

HEADLINE: The Middle Class Strikes Back

BYLINE: By SONER CAGAPTAY. 
Soner Cagaptay, a fellow and the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Rise of Turkey: The 21st Century's First Muslim Power.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- SINCE 2002, Turkey's sound economic policies have made it a member of the Group of 20 and turned it into a majority middle-class society for the first time in its history. Yet this week's huge protests show that the ruling Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., has become a victim of its own success.
Indeed, the middle class that the party has created is committed to individual freedoms -- and it is now challenging the A.K.P.'s style of governance and political domination. College students, mostly of middle-class origins and considered apolitical, emerged as an organizing force in the demonstrations. They set up makeshift clinics, provided legal counsel for those demonstrators arrested and established hot lines for injured people. Their participation offers an early glimpse of Turkey's future; these students were only in elementary school when the A.K.P. took office in 2002, and they have known no other party. They want their voices to be heard -- along with the environmentalists, ultranationalists, gay rights groups, members of the Alevi community, Kurdish separatists and secular liberals who have taken to the streets. These unlikely bedfellows all reject the A.K.P.'s heavy-handed political style. 
All this suggests that modernization theory -- the idea that economic development leads to more democracy -- is in the process of being proved right in Turkey. Indeed, as countries become middle class, they tend to become irreversibly diverse and democratic, developing the bedrock for democratic governance, including consensual politics and respect for individual and minority rights.
This week's clashes have exposed a fundamental rift between that democratic vision and the ruling party's leadership style. The A.K.P. and its leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have interpreted democracy simply as majoritarianism -- rule by and for the majority, no matter how narrow, with little regard for consensus building. Mr. Erdogan believes that once elected, leaders need not worry about opposing views. During the demonstrations, he dismissed the protesters' legitimacy, arguing that ''the will of the people is manifested at the ballot box.''
Mr. Erdogan is a democrat only in the sense that he believes in ruling through popularly elected governments. Half of Turkey supports the A.K.P., but the other half does not. Yet, acting on this mentality, Mr. Erdogan has pushed to remake Turkey in his own image: capitalist and conservative, while dismissing opposing views. He has embraced free-market economics, successfully privatizing Turkey's moribund public-sector companies. At the same time, his government has promoted a socially conservative, family-values agenda, encapsulated by his iconic call for each woman to have at least three children.
For several years, Mr. Erdogan's image as ''a strong man with strong family values'' worked. It brought him two successive election victories after 2002, with a growing share of the vote each time. But as Turkey prospered, more Turks were lifted out of poverty in the last decade than ever before.
Recently, though, the A.K.P. has faced severe public opposition to some of its projects, including legislation that limits the sale of alcohol as well as the catalyst for the protests: his plan to uproot hundreds of trees and turn a park adjacent to Istanbul's largest square into a shopping mall. Yet in both cases the A.K.P. leadership simply plowed ahead. For them, steamrolling opposing voices was just business as usual.
Mr. Erdogan has failed to realize that he is dealing with a new Turkey. It was surprising enough that an environmentalist sit-in was organized in downtown Istanbul to save a city park. Even more surprising was the fact that when the police moved in to crack down, tens of thousands of middle-class citizens poured into the streets in the middle of the night.
Since then, demonstrations have spread across the country deep into Anatolia, following the footsteps of the country's growing bourgeoisie, which is no longer only in historically cosmopolitan coastal centers like Istanbul and Izmir, but in provincial cities like Gaziantep and Malatya, where trade with neighboring countries like Iraq and Iran has brought newfound wealth. The nationwide popular reaction suggests the birth of a new Turkey that cherishes individual rights and the accouterments of middle-class life.
Even Mr. Erdogan's allies and supporters, including the Gulen movement, an influential grass-roots network that had hitherto mostly supported the A.K.P., threw some support behind the demonstrations and published a number of editorials in its media outlets criticizing the ruling party.
The new middle class that the A.K.P. has built is telling its government that democracy is not just about winning elections; it is also about building consensus. And they are telling Mr. Erdogan that while they may vote for him, they do not necessarily support all his policies.
This is good news for Turkey's future. The country has crossed a threshold -- it is too middle class and too diverse to fall under a one-size-fits-all democracy. And the A.K.P. will have to listen to opposing views, even though it remains the most popular party in the country.
Turkey has become the first majority middle-class and majority Muslim society in history. Now it can become the first consolidated democracy among all Muslim countries, if Mr. Erdogan begins to respect the will of his people.

HEADLINE: Financial Fears As Street Unrest Shakes Turkey

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- It is not often that the rock-throwing street protester and the seasoned bond investor see eye to eye.
This curious happenstance -- where both fear that the profusion of glass towers and shopping malls now overwhelming the classic Istanbul skyline is not only ugly but unsustainable -- underlies the convulsive uprising in Taksim Square.
The once soaring Turkish stock market has fallen about 9 percent in the past week, interest rates are on the rise and, crucially, after a period of strength, the currency, the lira, has lost 8 percent in recent months and 1 percent just since the protests began.
For more than two years, a very small subset of investors and economists has warned that, as with other economic booms built on a mountain of debt -- like the property spikes in Japan in the 1980s and more recently in the United States, Spain, Ireland and other European countries -- the one in Turkey would reach a painful end. 
Until recently, their warnings were ignored.
In contrast to a Europe stagnating throughout most of the past decade, Turkey has grown at a 5 percent annual rate while keeping its public finances in check.
In fact, with a budget deficit that is below 2 percent of gross domestic product and overall public-sector debt of less than half its economic output, Turkey challenges powerhouse Germany for best-in-class status when it comes to these critical benchmarks of broad economic health.
For Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the political crisis he is facing seems manageable precisely because of Turkey's economic success, which has buoyed a pious entrepreneurial class that forms the core of his constituency. As the protest movement has unfurled, few analysts have suggested Mr. Erdogan's hold on power is in jeopardy, arguing that he maintains the support of the religious masses that propelled him to power.
But that dynamic could change quickly should the economy falter, as a growing number of analysts now say is possible.
Hundreds of billions of dollars of short-term loans have been flowing into the country from investors in search of higher yielding assets, financing the very malls and skyscrapers that have so dismayed the small but growing coalition of secular intellectuals, left-of-center political activists and a smattering of the professional classes.
What worries financial experts is that this so-called hot money can leave the country just as quickly as it arrived, touching off a currency crisis and, eventually, a collapse in the property markets that could threaten the nation's banks.
''This is a classic credit boom, with money being thrown at Turkey, especially the banks,'' said Tim Lee, an independent economist at Pi Economics in Greenwich, Conn., who has warned for years of a Turkish financial bubble. ''At some point, though, you reach a moment when the music stops.''
It is perhaps too soon to say if that moment has come, but the financial jitters that have followed the protests have been noticeable, especially with regard to the wobbly lira.
Mr. Lee and other skeptics point to the currency as the ultimate barometer of how foreign investors see Turkey. The country's two previous financial implosions, in 1993 and 2001, were largely currency disasters, set off by a stampede of fleeing investors and lenders.
Two points in particular concern them.
This year, for example, Turkey's private sector will require $221 billion in outside financing alone, with most of it coming in short-term loans.
By normal standards, that is a heady sum, about 25 percent of Turkey's G.D.P., and it is about the size of the economy of Greece, Turkey's longtime rival.
Moreover, in preparation for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923, Mr. Erdogan's government has unveiled a $400 billion public works program, which is more than half the size of the $770 billion Turkish economy.
Many of these grand projects will have a visible aesthetic effect on Istanbul, which is what infuriates the protesters.
Planners envision a third bridge spanning the Bosporus at a cost of $3 billion, for which ground has already been broken; $10 billion to be spent on a third airport, which would be the world's largest; and a $2 billion outlay to create a financial center in Istanbul to compete with Dubai and London. On top of a slew of equally large projects in high-speed rail, subways, ports and other amenities, Istanbul is also seen as a leading contender to secure the 2020 Olympic Games.
The decision on the Games will be announced in September, and if Turkey wins, the building and borrowing will only speed up.
To Richard Segal, a credit analyst at the investment bank Jefferies in London, it is the hidden buildup of external debt on the part of Turkish banks and companies that is most worrying. He said it reminded him in some respects of the situations in Ireland and Spain before their collapse.
Ireland and particularly Spain entered the euro crisis with budget deficits and debt levels among the healthiest in the euro zone, the consequence of building booms that lifted tax revenues and allowed governments to spend freely without busting the budget.
As is now the case in Turkey, however, banks and corporations were issuing bonds, many of them short term, at very low interest rates. And like Spain and Greece before 2008, Turkey runs one of the largest current account deficits in the world, at around 7 percent of G.D.P. That, economists say, sets in motion a vicious circle as an overheated economy sucks in imports. That, in turn, creates a stronger currency that hurts the country's exports, forcing Turkey to borrow ever more to finance the gap.
''This looks like a huge debt bubble,'' Mr. Segal said.
He added that Turkey was even more vulnerable than other emerging markets pumped up by hot money in that domestic factors, particularly the possibility that the riots might lead to political unrest, were as likely to send investors fleeing as the wider possibility of an increase in interest rates in the United States, which would also stanch investment flows into emerging markets.
In fairness, many have predicted that the bubble would burst in Turkey -- only to be proven wrong.
Having survived two financial meltdowns, the Turkish regulatory apparatus, led by the central bank in particular, is well aware of the risks, and the country's banks, which just a few years ago saw lending growth of 40 percent and more, have been reined in and are flush with cash to cushion a downturn.
Turkey has other advantages, especially compared with countries in the euro zone.
It has a flexible currency and a central bank war chest of more than $100 billion in reserves. More sanguine economists point out that imported oil absorbs almost all of the country's current account deficit, and that it is not just spending that fuels the gap.
Still, for the edgy traders in London and New York, eyeing scenes of mayhem in Taksim Square on their television screens, these are mere niceties, and may do little to keep them from redirecting their money to safer havens.

HEADLINE: Debt Deal in Alabama Will Cost JPMorgan

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Under the deal to settle the bankruptcy of Jefferson County, Ala., firms that invested in its distressed debt will have the most to gain, JPMorgan Chase will face a big loss, and residents will be wondering whether there will be any relief for them.
The terms of the agreement, laid out in federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday, are in several ways better for the county than the concessions that creditors were offering in the fall of 2011 as they struggled to keep the county from declaring bankruptcy. If the deal goes forward, original creditors would receive 80 cents on the dollar for the county's debt, while alternative investment firms like hedge funds that invested later would receive close to 85 cents, saving Jefferson County more than $1 billion over time. The state would not have to back the county's finances with a so-called moral obligation pledge, as proposed in 2011.
And the new deal would allow the county to keep control of its sewer system -- the troubled cash cow at the heart of the bankruptcy. Two years ago, creditors tried to transfer the system to an independent authority to shield it from elected officials who some feared might try to manipulate its rates for political gain. 
When the dust finally settles, JPMorgan Chase, which many in the county hold responsible for the financial collapse in the first place, will have given up nearly $1.6 billion as a result of its dealings with the county and its ill-fated effort to finance sewer repairs. The new deal calls for the bank to forfeit $842 million on the $1.22 billion of sewer debt that it holds, which comes on top of $647 million it forgave in termination fees on derivatives contracts with the county and a $75 million penalty it paid to settle a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The county, for its part, will drop a lawsuit against JPMorgan if the new agreement goes through.
Despite the improved terms, some county residents are still so angry about the debacle that the proposed concessions are not enough. Some still think the only fair thing is full-blown debt repudiation.
''The deal will force Jefferson County to return to the scene of the crime that crippled it: the bond market,'' John Archibald, a columnist for The Birmingham News, wrote in an article published online Wednesday.
''Lucifer spells his name J. P. Morgan,'' he added.
County officials said that a hearing on Wednesday before Judge Thomas B. Bennett of Federal Bankruptcy Court lasted less than an hour and attracted only a handful of protesters, a tiny turnout that one official attributed to a case of ''sewer fatigue.'' The judge stayed a lawsuit that contended the county's sewer debt had been incurred unconstitutionally and needed to be written down more than the new deal proposes. That done, county officials said they could now turn to the bigger task of writing a plan of adjustment, the document that the judge must approve for the bankruptcy to be resolved.
''It was clear in the court proceedings today that the parties are beginning to relinquish their litigation posturing,'' said Laurence L. Gottlieb, chief executive of Fundamental Advisors, a private equity firm that participated in the negotiations.
With the county headed toward an exit from bankruptcy, hedge funds and private equity firms stand to profit. When Jefferson County declared bankruptcy in November 2011, these alternative investment firms saw opportunity in the defaulted warrants of a county mired in the biggest Chapter 9 bankruptcy case in United States history. Speculative interest in distressed municipal debt is normally extremely limited because while distressed municipalities are not rare, officials willing to walk away from public debts are. When municipalities have defaulted in the past, they have usually been too small for hedge funds to bother with.
But Jefferson County had $3.2 billion of sewer revenue debt alone, and a total of $4.2 billion in debt when it went bankrupt. The scale attracted a number of alternative investment firms that took the unusual step of buying debt for about 60 cents on the dollar. While that would be routine in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, where investors may buy deeply discounted debt in an attempt to take over a company, a Chapter 9 bankruptcy does not afford such opportunities: municipalities obviously do not issue stock, and it is impossible for a hedge fund to take one over in bankruptcy.
Instead, the alternative investment firms helped to negotiate a refinancing of Jefferson County's debts. In return, they are being paid extra for bearing some of the risk if the municipal bond market steers clear of Jefferson County after the refinancing. They will receive an additional 4.9 cents on the dollar in exchange for a promise to buy 10 percent of the county's new debt in the refinancing if other investors will not.
The investment firms, in other words, are providing a market backstop that could let Jefferson County refinance without having to rely on the state, and without raising sewer rates too much. Part of their extra payment will come from the proceeds of the new debt issue, and part from JPMorgan, according to people briefed on the agreement.
''Getting even 80 percent is a huge windfall to them,'' said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Municipal Market Advisors, noting that the firms' purchase cost may have been as low as 60 percent.
The underwriter of the coming debt issue will also have to promise to take 10 percent of the issue if the market will not. Other signatories to the deal appear content with their outcomes. Assured Guaranty, one of the insurers of Jefferson County's debt, issued a statement Wednesday saying that the size of its loss would be smaller than the amount of reserves it had put in place to cover the loss.
Mr. Fabian said he doubted that the municipal bond market would have much appetite for Jefferson County's coming issue of new debt, which would pay for the 80 cents on the dollar it will pay to extinguish the old debt.
''Most people expect they cannot sell it,'' he said. ''It's going to be bought by very aggressive buyers.'' The problem, he said, is that Jefferson County's problems have been going for years, and investors are now in the habit of expecting things to go wrong.
''There's a real potential for some kind of litigation, and a workout going forward,'' he said. ''You have to assume that. If anything goes wrong, they're not going to do the right thing by investors. So you need a broad enough return that you can afford lawyers and restructuring counsel down the road.''
To show it was bringing its new debt to market in good faith, he predicted Jefferson County would raise sewer rates one more time before the sale.
That's what Mr. Archibald, the Birmingham columnist, was also predicting, in his column.
''Sewer rates will rise dramatically under this deal,'' he wrote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Therapy for Victims of Sexual Violence Shows Promise in Congo

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
A type of group therapy designed for trauma victims has proved extraordinarily helpful for survivors of sexual violence in Democratic Republic of Congo, enabling women to overcome the shame, nightmares and terrifying flashbacks that had left them unable to work or take care of their families or themselves, researchers report.
An article about the therapy, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, is a rare event: a rigorous study of a treatment meant to heal the mental and emotional scars of women in a part of Africa where rape has become a routine weapon of war. Congo, with two decades of civil war, has been called the rape capital of the world by the United Nations. The country has little or no treatment for those with mental health problems. 
A team of researchers from Johns Hopkins University, the University of Washington in Seattle and the International Rescue Committee brought a type of treatment called cognitive processing therapy to Congo. They adapted the method to treat women who could not read or write, and taught it to local health workers who had a high school education or less. The workers then conducted group therapy sessions in five languages with survivors of sexual attacks who had severe anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In Swahili, the treatment was called ''mind and heart'' therapy.
Hundreds of thousands of Congolese females, from toddlers to grandmothers -- possibly as many as two million, according to one study -- have been raped by rebel fighters or government troops. Notoriously brutal attacks have included gang rapes and penetration with guns, knives and other objects that have torn apart women's reproductive systems and intestines, sometimes beyond repair.
The study included women from 15 rural villages in eastern Congo, an area of rolling green hills and farmland bordered by dense forests where rebels often hide and venture out to conduct raids. Researchers estimate that about 40 percent of the women in the region have been victims of sexual violence.
The therapy technique employed in the study has been used successfully with rape victims and others with post-traumatic stress in the United States. It involves teaching people to think rationally about the troubled thoughts, feelings and beliefs that can linger after an attack.
For instance, women who were raped often blame themselves. They left a window open. They went out alone. They made eye contact with a man who later attacked them. Their clothing somehow invited the assault.
The therapy urges them to question those beliefs. Have women been raped in other circumstances? If so, then how can a woman blame herself?
The program is highly structured, based on a manual for counselors, with topics defined for each therapy session and homework assignments for participants.
Seven villages, with 157 women, were picked at random to receive the group therapy. Eight other villages, with 248 women, were offered ''individual support,'' meaning that the women could ask for personal counseling and referrals for medical, legal and economic problems.
The group therapy consisted of one individual session with a counselor, and 11 weekly two-hour group meetings. The women's symptoms were assessed and graded three times: before the treatment program, when it ended and six months afterward. Sixty-five percent of the women in group therapy completed all three assessments, as did 52 percent of those who got individual support.
The improvement from group therapy was striking, the researchers found. Six months after treatment, only 9 percent of the women who received group therapy still had anxiety, depression or PTSD. By comparison, 42 percent of the women who had individual support still had those problems.
Catherine Poulton, an adviser to the International Rescue Committee, said the group hoped to work with the country's Health Ministry to offer the therapy to more women through national health centers. She said her organization also hoped to provide the treatment in other countries where it was needed. One of the treatment's advantages, she said, is that people without university degrees can learn it.
Janny Jinor, a clinical social worker who helped supervise the study as part of the Johns Hopkins team, observed some sessions and said that a number of women made striking improvements even before the program was complete. One woman, she said, initially showed up unwashed, her hair uncombed and her clothing dirty. She was in her 50s, and had been raped a few years earlier. Her husband rejected her and began to see other women, and her in-laws wanted little to do with her.
But after a few therapy sessions she began grooming herself and wearing clean clothes, and thanked the counselor for helping her to realize that she was an important person. Her family had begun to treat her better, she said.
''She started to shine, and they could see past the woman who was raped, who didn't comb her hair, the one whose fault it was for being raped,'' Ms. Jinor said.
The women who received group therapy said it had lifted a huge burden, but they had one complaint, Ms. Jinor said: why hadn't they been given this good treatment sooner?
Judith K. Bass, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the department of mental health at Johns Hopkins, said: ''It's not like it's a miracle cure. It's not like all these women are running into the streets and dancing. But they can go back into the community.''
Researchers have also found that sexual violence at home is not uncommon in Congo, in the form of child molesting and marital rape.
''The rate of sexual violence against women in Congo is staggering,'' Dr. Bass said.
Violence in eastern Congo continued during the study, and one participant was killed.
Debra Kaysen, another author of the study and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington, said, ''In two of our villages, during most of the trial, the group leaders, counselor and group members were not able to sleep in their homes at night because it was not safe.'' She added: ''The fact that we got these kinds of results in those kinds of settings certainly bodes well that we can still treat PTSD even in settings that are quite unstable and even in people with very big, real world problems.''
Dr. Bass added, ''If you can do this in Congo, you can do it anywhere.''

HEADLINE: Rice to Replace Donilon as National Security Adviser

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced on Wednesday afternoon that Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, would replace Tom Donilon, who is resigning, as national security adviser in a major shakeup of his foreign-policy inner circle.
The appointment, which Mr. Obama made in a Rose Garden ceremony, puts Ms. Rice, 48, an outspoken diplomat and a close political ally, at the heart of the administration's foreign-policy apparatus.
It is also a defiant gesture to Republicans who harshly criticized Ms. Rice for presenting an erroneous account of the deadly attacks on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya. The post of national security adviser, while powerful, does not require Senate confirmation.
In his announcement, Mr. Obama referred to Ms. Rice's role as an adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign and praised her work as a key diplomat during his first term. 
''With her background as a scholar, Susan understands that there's no substitute for American leadership,'' Mr. Obama said. ''She is at once passionate and pragmatic. I think everybody understands Susan is a fierce champion for justice and human dignity, but she's also mindful that we have to exercise our power wisely and deliberately.''
Mr. Obama also named Samantha Power, a National Security Council official, as Ms. Rice's replacement at the United Nations. Ms. Power, who has written extensively about genocide, is closely allied with Ms. Rice on human rights issues.
In his statement, Mr. Obama cited Ms. Power's work with Ms. Rice on issues related to the United Nations.
''She knows the U.N.'s strengths. She knows its weaknesses," Mr. Obama said. "She knows that American interests are advanced when we can rally the world to our side. And she knows that we have to stand up for the things that we believe in. And to ensure that we have the principled leadership we need at the United Nations, I would strongly urge the Senate to confirm her without delay.''
Mr. Donilon, 58, a central member of Mr. Obama's foreign-policy team since he first took office, has exerted sweeping influence, mostly behind the scenes, on issues from counterterrorism to the reorientation of America to Asia from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
''Tom's that rare combination of the strategic and the tactical. He has a strategic sense of where we need to go, and he has a tactical sense of how to get there,'' Mr. Obama said in his announcement. ''He's helped shape every single national security policy of my presidency, from forging a new national security strategy rooted in our economic strength here at home to ending the war in Iraq.''
Among Mr. Donilon's last big projects was negotiating the highly unusual informal meeting between Mr. Obama and President Xi Jinping of China on Friday at an estate in Southern California. Just back from talks in Beijing, he clearly took pride of ownership.
''I don't know when there was a broad meeting like this,'' Mr. Donilon said in an interview. ''For the last 40 years or so, these conversations have taken place in a more formal, scripted context.''
But Mr. Donilon has also hit a rough patch recently, with the publication of an unflattering profile in Foreign Policy magazine that cast him as a sharp-elbowed infighter and a domineering boss who had strained relationships with colleagues, including his former deputy, Denis R. McDonough, now the White House chief of staff.
Mr. Donilon and Mr. McDonough, however, both denied those reports. Mr. McDonough said he had a ''very good relationship with Tom,'' adding, ''It pains me to think anybody would think he's leaving because of me.''
Mr. Donilon, whose departure is effective in early July, said he had planned to leave after Mr. Obama's first term but stayed on at the president's request to break in a new team led by Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John O. Brennan.
He pointed to the unusual harmony among Cabinet heavyweights like former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, and chalked up reports of unhappy subordinates to the relentless grind of working in the White House.
''I cherish my staff,'' he said. ''They are a national treasure.''
Mr. McDonough said Mr. Donilon's greatest policy legacy would be his role in engineering the pivot to Asia. In a statement, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said, ''I've worked with eight different administrations and even more national security advisers, and I've never met anyone with more talent and with greater strategic judgment.''
The president recently nominated Mr. Donilon's wife, Cathy Russell, a former chief of staff to Jill Biden, as the State Department's ambassador at large for global women's issues -- a job that will impose heavy work and travel demands of its own on a family that has seen little of Mr. Donilon since 2009. The Donilons have two children, ages 14 and 16.
For Ms. Rice, the appointment amounts to redemption after she withdrew from consideration as secretary of state because Republicans threatened to block her nomination over Benghazi.
Mr. Obama steadfastly defended Ms. Rice, and after he nominated John Kerry instead of her, White House officials said she became the front-runner to succeed Mr. Donilon, who has been in the job since October 2010 and had been the principal deputy before that.
Ms. Rice, a Rhodes Scholar who holds a doctorate in international affairs from Oxford University, began her government career on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, and later served as senior director for African affairs from 1995 to 1997.
A foreign policy adviser to then-Senator Obama during his 2008 campaign, Ms. Rice was viewed as a potential national security adviser in his first term. Mr. Obama instead sent her to the United Nations and chose Gen. James L. Jones, a former Marine Corps commandant.
At the United Nations, Ms. Rice earned good reviews for lining up balky members behind sanctions on North Korea and Iran. After Mr. Obama's re-election, she was seen as a prime candidate to replace Mrs. Clinton. But that was before she appeared on television to discuss the attack in Benghazi, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.
Ms. Rice, using talking points drafted by the C.I.A., said the assault appeared to be a protest gone awry rather than a premeditated terrorist attack. That proved incorrect, and though Ms. Rice cautioned that the account could change with further intelligence, Republicans accused her of sanitizing the truth for political reasons.
After withdrawing her name as secretary of state, Ms. Rice returned to the United Nations, where she kept a low profile, immersing herself in issues involving countries like Syria and North Korea. But she has retained the confidence of the White House, playing an influential role in internal debates over questions like whether to arm the rebels in Syria.
''When she speaks,'' Mr. Biden said last month, ''no one wonders whether or not she is speaking for the president.''
Unlike Mr. Donilon, Ms. Rice is known for her outspoken views on human rights and other issues. She advocated the NATO-led military intervention in Libya, for example. That raises a question of how she will approach the job of national security adviser, which has traditionally functioned as a broker among competing agencies.
Mr. Donilon has said his model was Brent Scowcroft, the influential adviser to President George H.W. Bush. A tireless student of the bureaucratic process, Mr. Donilon favors exhaustive preparation over seat-of-the-pants advice. He prided himself on delivering a daily briefing to Mr. Obama more than 800 times -- scheduling overseas trips on weekends to avoid missing that ritual.
In the last year, with Republicans accusing him of being responsible for national security leaks -- which the White House has denied -- Mr. Donilon has steered clear of reporters.
Critics have faulted Mr. Donilon, whose background is in Democratic Party politics, for not functioning as a strategic adviser to Mr. Obama. But Mr. Donilon oversaw risky operations like the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden and took on delicate tasks like managing relations with Pakistan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia and China.
With the new focus on Asia, a revived trade agenda and a narrower American approach to fighting terrorists, he said, ''We really have changed the strategic posture of the U.S. in the world.''

HEADLINE: Productivity and Job Gains Are Modest

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The productivity of American workers grew a modest amount from January through March, after having declined in the previous quarter. And a private survey showed on Wednesday that American businesses added just 135,000 jobs in May, the second consecutive month of weak gains. 
The survey, from the payroll provider ADP, found that May's gain was above April's revised total of 113,000 but much lower than the gains ADP reported over the winter. Those numbers averaged more than 200,000 a month from November through February.
Productivity rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent in the first quarter, after a 1.7 percent decline in the October-to-December period, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. With productivity growth slow, companies might have to add workers if demand for their products continues to grow.
The first-quarter performance was revised down slightly from an initial estimate of a 0.7 percent first-quarter increase. The revision reflected the fact that the government lowered its estimate of overall economic output in the first quarter to a rate of 2.4 percent, from 2.5 percent. Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work.
Labor costs actually fell in the January-to-March quarter, dropping at an annual rate of 4.3 percent after having surged at an 11.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
The trend in productivity has been fairly weak in recent years. For all of 2012, productivity rose just 0.7 percent, after an even smaller 0.6 percent rise in 2011.
Those gains were less than half the average growth in 2009 and 2010, shortly after many companies laid off workers to cut costs during the recession. And it is below the long-run trend of 2.2 percent annual growth in productivity dating to 1947.
But most economists say they expect higher Social Security taxes have started to weigh on consumers. That should slow economic growth in the second and third quarters.
The ADP survey is derived from payroll data and tracks private employment. It has diverged at times from the government's more comprehensive monthly jobs report, which will be released on Friday. In April, the government said private employers added 176,000 jobs, much higher than the ADP's estimate.
Economists say the gap between the ADP survey and the government figures has narrowed since Moody's Analytics began compiling the numbers eight months ago. Still, it has differed from the Labor Department's report by about 40,000 a month since then.
''The ADP survey has never been the most reliable indicator,'' Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
Economists forecast that the government's report will show employers added 170,000 jobs in May, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate is expected to stay at a four-year low of 7.5 percent.
Most economists said the ADP report would not prompt them to change their forecasts.
The ADP report found that manufacturing companies cut 6,000 jobs last month. Construction firms added only 5,000, below the previous month's 15,000 gain, and retail hiring has also been weak.

HEADLINE: Paying Tribute to a Seeker of Justice, 50 Years After His Assassination

BYLINE: By ASHLEY SOUTHALL

 BODY:
Myrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, said her husband was a man who saw a job that needed to be done, and he answered the call, ''not just for his people but for all people.''
Ms. Evers-Williams and a group of about 300 visitors, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and former President Bill Clinton, observed the 50th anniversary of Mr. Evers's assassination on Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery, where Mr. Evers is buried. 
Mr. Evers was working as a field secretary for the N.A.A.C.P. when he was gunned down in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Miss., on June 12, 1963, at the age of 37. Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was convicted of the murder in 1994, 30 years after two all-white juries deadlocked on earlier charges.
The anniversary comes as the Supreme Court prepares to issue rulings on voting rights and affirmative action, as a divided Congress considers overhauling the nation's immigration laws, and as the White House faces political turmoil at home and upheaval abroad.
Mr. Clinton said that Washington could learn from Mr. Evers.
''The next time you hear people complaining around Washington about what a rough business democracy is, we might do well to remember what it was like 50 years ago, and the sacrifices that were made,'' he said.
He added: ''Fighting for a world we can share instead of having to agree to let somebody else control it has always been a highly dangerous proposition. It is expensive in blood and life.''
Other speakers included Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy and a former governor of Mississippi, and Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P.
Mr. Evers was the N.A.A.C.P.'s first field officer in Mississippi. In that role, he organized voter registration drives, economic boycotts, demonstrations and investigations to draw attention to discrimination. He was best known for his investigation of the 1955 murder of Emmett Till and his failed bid to enroll in the University of Mississippi's law school.
Mr. Evers served in a segregated Army unit in Europe during World War II. After returning to Mississippi in 1945, he joined the civil rights movement as a co-founder of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, where he organized a boycott against gas stations that did not allow blacks to use their restrooms.
Before the Supreme Court declared the doctrine of ''separate but equal'' unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, he applied to the law school at the University of Mississippi and was rejected. He later helped James Meredith become the first black person admitted to the university in 1962.
His actions drew threats from white supremacist groups, and his wife and civil rights leaders encouraged him to leave Mississippi. He stayed. Later that year, he became the N.A.A.C.P.'s first field secretary in Mississippi.
''While African-Americans were the obvious beneficiaries of his life's work, in a real sense he set us all free,'' Mr. Mabus said. He added, ''The Mississippi that my children grew up in is a far more just, far better place, than the Mississippi in which I was raised because of Medgar Evers and Myrlie Evers and so many others like them.''

HEADLINE: Luxury Hospitality: Luring the Next Generation

BYLINE: By KEVIN BRASS

 BODY:
Luxury hotel executives know they have a problem.
A pillow menu, gold-plated bathroom fixtures and spacious rooms will not be enough to woo the next generation of the world's wealthiest clientele. They will be better traveled than their parents and grandparents, and much harder to please.
''The younger generation, who is 28 to 35 years of age, they will start traveling differently,'' said Marco P. Nijhof, chief executive of Yoo Hotels, a division of the London-based company co-founded by the designer Philippe Starck. ''It's a whole different ballgame.''
Designers are proposing everything from underwater hotels to high-tech enclaves that will use facial-recognition software to predict a guest's every whim. But some are moving in the opposite direction, creating simple hotels that they want to stand as works of art, allowing guests to escape from their hectic lives. 
''People are moving away from the bling factor,'' said Andreas Scriven, director and head of consulting for Christie & Co., a sales and advisory company for the hospitality industry.
No one is sure what will work. But everyone knows the stakes are huge. The luxury hospitality sector is valued at an estimated &#x20ac;127 billion, or $164.4 billion, a year, up from &#x20ac;91 billion in 2009, according to Bain & Co., the global management consulting firm based in Boston.
And the target audience is growing at an unprecedented rate. By 2022, there will be 4,076 billionaires in the world, an 85 percent increase from the 2,198 billionaires in 2012, the international property agency Knight Frank predicts.
There also will be 285,000 high net-worth individuals with at least $30 million in assets, a 50 percent increase from 2012, the agency's analysts say.
In many parts of the world, luxury hotels have recovered from the global recession far more quickly than other economic sectors.
The average price for a night in a luxury hotel last year in Paris was &#x20ac;617, up from &#x20ac;532 in 2010, according to data tracked by STR Global, a hotel research company. And in Hong Kong, the average daily rate for a luxury room in 2012 was 2,585 Hong Kong dollars, or $333, up from 1,901 dollars in 2010.
In response to the market forces, developers now are building 458 luxury hotel projects with 123,325 rooms around the world, according to STR data. Of those, 253 are in the Asia-Pacific region, the area with the largest predicted growth in billionaires.
The rapid development of the luxury market in Asia is sending ripples through the entire industry, some say.
''Asia will continue to set the trend in creativity and what you can do,'' said Mr. Nijhof, the Yoo Hotels chief.
The next wave of luxury hotels around the world is expected to try to reach the standards of many top Asian resorts in emphasizing exceptional levels of service, privacy and nature.
''It is the personal service you get in certain countries in Asia, but not in Europe and the U.S.,'' said Jaya Ibrahim, founder of Jaya International, an Indonesia-based design firm that had worked on luxury hotels around the globe. ''It doesn't happen in ordinary hotels because it is very expensive.''
To compete, private butlers will become more common, as customers come to expect their bags to be unpacked and in-room refrigerators stocked with their favorite foods and beverages, some executives say.
Hotels will also have to know more about their customers. Software and services that help hotels anticipate the needs and desires of clients are in their infancy now, many analysts say. And concierge services will have to advance to new levels, delivering on the demands of guests long before they arrive.
Helicopter pickup service will become more popular, connecting to airfields used by private jets, said Xavier Destribats, senior vice president for operations with Kempinski Hotels. ''More and more of the clientele will use private planes,'' he said.
And in some markets, security will become increasingly important; the bulletproof glass and steel doors now in some locations will be replaced by bazooka-proof glass and personal panic rooms.
''These customers will be more and more demanding,'' Mr. Destribats said. ''If they are going to pay for it, they are expecting value for what they are going to pay.''
Then there is technology. While hotels will be expected to provide the latest array of gadgets, guests will also want seamless use of their own mobile devices, analysts say.
But technology is a slippery slope for hoteliers. Guests do not want to spend time figuring out controls, and what is cutting-edge technology today may be passé in six months. Trying to keep pace with the latest and coolest is an expensive, never-ending cycle, some argue.
''The trend will be to remove some of the technology,'' said Mr. Scriven, the Christie & Co. executive. ''People don't want to interact with technology.''
The debate is part of a larger rethinking of the basic luxury room. Designers are already questioning the orientation of beds and the role of a desk in a room, said Lamarr Reid, managing director of the Chicago office of Pierre-Yves Rochon, a Paris-based interior design firm that had worked with Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Ritz-Carlton and other luxury chains.
''People are not using the desk in a guest room the way they did 10 years ago,'' he said, adding that bathrooms will be opened up to create a sense of space. Guests will be able to customize their rooms, using light and window systems to control the ''scene'' and mood. Walls will be able to move, and glass dividers will be able to turn from transparent to opaque.
In older hotels, however, designers face the constant challenge of making modest square footage ''seem like a big grand room in the European hospitality standard,'' Mr. Reid said.
Some hoteliers argue that the next generation of wealthy travelers will want a room experience that reminds them of home, even while they are getting away from home. Those companies are moving away from glitz and technology to focus on creating casual, individual atmospheres that seem far removed from the standard hotel ambiance.
''The desire to feel like you're in another home is growing,'' said Jonathan Oakes, general manager for resort operations with Oil Nut Bay, a British Virgin Islands development that recently opened three cliff-top suites priced at $1,500 a night. The furniture in the 1,334-square-foot, or 124-square-meter, penthouse was designed by Fendi Casa, the home design arm of the fashion company, and includes a Fendi-designed chandelier.
In the future, luxury resorts will distinguish themselves with attention to detail, he believes. ''If you charge what we charge, people better pull out the hair dryer and say that's a good hair dryer,'' Mr. Oakes said.
Yet a conference for hotel designers last month in Valencia, Spain, included a panel debate on ''Ornament is Crime.'' Speaking in support of the statement was Tarek Hegazy, creative director of Living Design, a company based in Sweden that has completed more than 250 hotel projects.
''How would ornament add to the luxury?'' Mr. Hegazy said in an interview. ''We try to show that luxury has so much ornament, that now the next wave is 'simple is beautiful' and 'simple is luxury'.''
But the designer acknowledged that many luxury hotels of the future would still have the ornate style and private dining rooms that have been part of the formula for generations.
''This is a sign of luxury,'' Mr. Hegazy said. ''This is a sign of showing off. This is a sign of power. That is never going to disappear.''

HEADLINE: Why I Am Not Returning to Russia

BYLINE: By SERGEI GURIEV

 BODY:
PARIS -- On Monday, May 27, I was on vacation in Paris when I decided that my personal circumstances do not allow me to return to Russia in any foreseeable future.
At that point I was running a university in Moscow, the 20-year old New Economic School. I was proud of what my colleagues and I had accomplished. The school has become a model for other universities in Russia as well as other emerging markets.
Sadly, I could not come back to Russia and therefore had to resign from the school. The board called an extraordinary meeting on May 30 to accept my resignation and appoint an acting rector, and asked me not to talk about my decision to the media. Neither the board nor I thought it should be a major media event.
I also had to resign from board positions at several Russian companies. My longest relationship as a board member was with Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia and one of the largest in continental Europe. 
This was also a sad and painful decision. I have been a board member of Sberbank for five years, during which time the bank underwent an amazing transformation from a sleepy Soviet-style institution to a dynamic and modern customer-oriented financial company, and it was exciting to participate in this transformation.
Sberbank was scheduled to hold its annual shareholders meeting in just four days, so I hurried to submit a request that my name be taken off the ballot for the new board. Sberbank is a public company listed in Russia and the United States, so I knew I had to emphasize in my letter that this decision was driven by personal considerations unrelated to the bank.
Following the letter of the law, Sberbank immediately disclosed this fact. And my quiet life changed beyond recognition. Journalists began calling me, asking for the reasons for the resignation. As a board member of a public company, I had to reassure journalists and investors that my withdrawal had nothing to do with the bank, and that I had no negative information about the bank. But, following the request from the board of the New Economic School, I also had to keep quiet about the ''personal reasons.''
Given that voluntary resignations from the boards of large companies are very rare in Russia, journalists started searching on their own for explanations and soon discovered what they were.
The truth was that I could not come back to Russia because I feared losing my freedom.
Why was that? Since February, I have been repeatedly contacted and interrogated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation as a ''witness'' in ''Case 18/41-03.'' Surreal as this may sound (like many other things below), this is the original case against Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the imprisoned head of the Yukos oil company, launched in 2003.
Since then, the prosecutors apparently have used this case to produce further ''subcases'' -- and jail terms -- for Khodorkovsky, his business partner Platon Lebedev, and some of their colleagues. These cases are generally perceived in Russia as politically charged. This was especially true for the so-called ''second case'' against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev in 2010.
The widespread outrage over the additional sentences meted out to them in 2010 gave rise to then-President Dmitri Medvedev's request for his Human Rights Council to carry out an evaluation of the case. The council gathered a panel of nine economics and law professors (including me) and asked us to read through the case and give our opinions. And so we did. While we worked independently, every expert declared that the case did not contain convincing proof of the guilt of Khodorkovsky or Lebedev.
These opinions had no legal weight, being only public statements of independent academics expressed after the trial was concluded, and therefore were largely disregarded. But not forgotten.
Right after Vladimir Putin's return to the Kremlin as president in May 2012, the spokesman for the Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the committee would look into the objectivity and independence of the experts. Already in the fall of 2012, some experts were interrogated, their offices and even houses searched, their computers and documents seized.
As for me, interrogations started in February 2013. After that, I heard that in February, a colleague of Mr. Putin had talked to him about my situation, and the president had reassured the colleague that I had nothing to worry about. This did not stop the investigation -- I was interrogated twice and received demands for all sorts of documents and personal information. Moreover, the investigators introduced ''operative measures'' -- the police euphemism for surveillance. Whenever I or my wife (who has nothing to do with the case) crossed the Russian border, we were subjected to special attention.
Interestingly, during the interrogations the investigators asked me to produce ''alibis,'' though they did not explain for what, and insisted that I was a ''witness,'' not a ''suspect.''
Then on April 25, the investigators scheduled an interrogation, but instead came to my office with a court warrant to seize my e-mails going back five years.
In Russia, e-mails are treated as correspondence and therefore are protected by the constitution. To seize them, the investigators need a court order. The warrant gave no specific reasons why my e-mails had to be seized, yet concluded they had to be seized. When I complained to the investigators, one of them said that I was better off than Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident who was sent to internal exile in Gorky. They also hinted that they had a warrant to search my home.
This demonstrated that the investigators can produce any search warrant they want without any respect for my rights, and that they can do it without warning.
I concluded that my next meeting with them could result in the loss of my freedom. I bought a one-way ticket from Russia and will not return to my country.
Since I made that decision, many observers have called me a ''symbol of political repression,'' a dissident and a political martyr. At the same time, President Putin and his spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, have said that my decision to leave was driven by personal and family circumstances.
They are correct. I have never been a politician, and I am not a political refugee. I left Russia for personal reasons: I personally prefer to stay free. I also have family reasons: My family wants -- and deserves -- to see me free. In this sense, I have no other but personal and family reasons to leave Russia.
I also do not want to be a ''symbol.'' I am just one simple person, and mine is an isolated case. What happened to me is similar to an accident, or a rare disease. Everybody faces the risk of contracting such a disease, but may also be lucky enough to avoid it. There are behavioral traits that reduce the risks -- not speaking out in favor of the rule of law or against corruption, for example. As with other grave diseases, once you catch it everybody sends words of consolation but they all understand there is no help.
Or almost none. The Khodorkovsky trials showed there is one simple but effective therapy: witnesses who left Russia are alive and well. Those who stayed and refused to cooperate with the prosecutors ended up in prison. One of them, Vasily Aleksanyan, did not live to see his 40th birthday.
Sergei Guriev is a Russian economist and former rector of the New Economic School, in Moscow. He and his family currently live in France.

HEADLINE: Buyout Firm That Grew With Indonesia Prepares to Go Public

BYLINE: By JOE COCHRANE and NEIL GOUGH

 BODY:
JAKARTA -- It seems a world away from where he sits now -- a young, rich and rising star in the clubby but booming world of business in Indonesia -- but Sandiaga Uno cannot forget the hellish days of the Asian financial crisis.
In 1998, the Indonesian economy contracted a staggering 14 percent and the country erupted in political and ethnic violence. Mr. Uno, then in his twenties, had lost his job as an investment banker working for a Canadian company, NTI Resources.
He returned home and was essentially forced to become an entrepreneur because he could not find a job, he said. His business philosophy at that time was simple: Survive.
''Cars were burning on the street, people were rioting, demonstrations on a daily basis,'' Mr. Uno said in a recent interview. ''It was very hard to operate; capital was fleeing out of the country. I needed five months to get investors to see me in Hong Kong or New York.'' 
Today, given his boyish good looks, a passion for international marathons and triathlons and a net worth that has been estimated by Forbes at more than $600 million, one might wonder why Mr. Uno, 43, is not sitting on a beach in Bali and drafting his summer running schedule.
Instead, Mr. Uno's company, Saratoga Investama Sedaya -- which he co-founded in the dark days of 1998, and which has since grown into the biggest private equity firm in Indonesia -- is moving forward with a Jakarta stock market debut that could raise more than $200 million. Saratoga's investments have been buoyed by Indonesia's decade-long turnaround: Today, the country boasts an economy of nearly $1 trillion that according to a September 2012 report by McKinsey & Co., will overtake those of Germany and Britain by 2030. The government expects a record $51 billion in realized domestic and foreign direct investment in 2014, a 29 percent increase from this year.
But Mr. Uno sees a lot of work ahead, both for Saratoga and for Indonesia.
''Indonesia should do much better than this as a country,'' he said. ''We are squandering our opportunities. We have been blessed by so much potential, but we have not really put up a result to match that potential.''
Helping Indonesia bridge that gap could prove immensely profitable to Saratoga, which was set up by Mr. Uno and Edwin Soeryadjaya, an Indonesian businessman who lost some of his own fortune before and during the Asian crisis. The firm, named for the Battle of Saratoga in the American Revolutionary War, grew fast, and today Mr. Uno values the business at $2 billion. Saratoga focuses on three core sectors: natural resources, infrastructure and consumer products and services, across the country and Southeast Asia.
Saratoga currently manages 17 companies in its portfolio, and the value of its assets has increased threefold in the past five years, according to company data. Mr. Uno said the company's most important investments had been Adaro Energy, one of the biggest Indonesian producers of thermal coal, which is used in power generation; the telecommunications company Tower Bersama Infrastructure; and Mitra Pinasthika Mustika, a motorcycle distributor, which conducted an initial public offering in May. He said returns on all three had been about triple the amount of invested capital.
In the case of Adaro, Saratoga began accumulating its share in 2002. The company was privatized in 2005, restructured with help from Saratoga and relisted in 2008. Today, Saratoga retains a 16 percent stake in Adaro worth the equivalent of $660 million, about nine times the private equity company's total investment.
In late June, Saratoga is scheduled to conduct its own initial public offering to raise between $170 million and $220 million by selling new shares equal to as much as 15 percent of the company. It plans to price the offer between 6,100 rupiah and 7,800 rupiah, or $0.62 and $0.80, per share and begin trading June 28, according to the company.
Last year, Saratoga made $197.6 million in profit, up 151.4 percent from 2011, according to its preliminary I.P.O. document. Its total assets were $1.34 billion at the end of December.
''We are raising long-term capital to continue to invest in Indonesia's primary pillars of the economy: natural resources, consumers and infrastructure,'' Mr. Uno said. ''Why now? We saw more long-term opportunities.''
The main share index in Jakarta has risen 16 percent this year, and other private equity groups are cashing in, too. In March, the Indonesian retailer Matahari Department Store, backed by the British firm CVC Capital Partners, sold shares worth $1.3 billion. Last month, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group of Japan announced that it was planning to buy a 40 percent stake in Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional of Indonesia for about $1.6 billion. The U.S. buyout firm TPG Capital and its local affiliate North Star are the bank's biggest shareholders.
Saratoga's rise and expansion have mirrored Indonesia's own economic resurgence. The country was virtually untouched by the global financial crisis of 2008, and its gross domestic product has expanded more than 6 percent annually for the past three years.
Mr. Uno, who attended college and graduate school in the United States, no longer needs to wait in office reception areas in Hong Kong and New York to get meetings with investors. Instead, he said, he is receiving 5 to 10 new investors in Jakarta each week.
''We've been showing very good, positive returns, showing that people who invest in Indonesia do make money when they employ the right strategies and pick the right management team, within the right sectors,'' he said.
For local and foreign buyout shops, Indonesia's attractions are clear. A report on private equity in Southeast Asia released last week by the consulting firm Bain & Co. runs through the highlights: rich natural resources, a growing middle class that will have 77 million new consumers by 2030 and the largest and fastest-growing economy in Southeast Asia.
''Indonesia is receiving a tremendous amount of attention as a private equity destination at the moment, very similar to what you would have seen five to seven years ago in China or India, by far the most active places in the Asia-Pacific region,'' said Suvir Varma, who heads Bain's Asia-Pacific private equity and sovereign wealth fund practice in Singapore.
But the report also noted several challenges to investing in Indonesia, including a tough regulatory system, high valuations and a preference for minority-only stake sales.
Private equity firms eyeing the market also need to contend with a relative information gap and must navigate the webs of relationships among influential business families and the government, according to Ling Tok Hong, a partner in the private equity practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Singapore.
''A lot of big Indonesian families own multiple businesses, and many of those that are large and fast-growing could have certain intertwined relationships among the families, and with the government, so appreciation of the culture and the position of the business environment in a country like this is critical success factor No. 1 for private equity,'' Mr. Ling said. ''It's quite the other end of the spectrum for someone who is used to operating in the U.S. or U.K., where information is readily available.''
With his overseas education and local roots, Mr. Uno agrees with that notion, with caveats.
''Indonesia's macroeconomic metrics are very interesting, but there are some micro issues, like governance, like visibility of policies -- therefore, you would need a local partner to help you navigate this sort of minefield or surprises,'' he said.
''Some of the stories about people getting cheated here are mainly because they rush into the market, they pick the wrong partner, and I guess they have themselves to blame,'' he added.
Neil Gough reported from Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: A Spiritual Center of Power Is a Required Stop on Iran's Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
QUM, Iran -- Qum, home to some of Iran's most influential clerics, is not just Iran's holiest city, but one of its most powerful, a Shiite Vatican in the desert that can make or break any Iranian political career. So it is not surprising that it has become a destination recently for almost all of the candidates in next week's presidential election, seeking to sip from the cocktail of money, politics and religion that the city represents.
While the eight presidential candidates, carefully vetted by the government, all hold roughly the same views on the major issues, they need to make sure they have support from Qum. 
''The top clergymen from Qum are among the few in the country who can openly criticize all politicians if they feel like it,'' said Farshad Ghorbanpour, an Iranian journalist. ''Seeking their allegiance not only prevents public reprimands, but also means the support of their followers.''
Qum's centrality to the election process tends to attract the more politically minded, though few here speak openly against the government. Sitting on the soft beige carpets that line the halls of the shrine of Fatemeh Masoumeh, a sister of Reza, the Eighth Imam, Rahman Askari, 26, an information technology and theology student from the city of Zanjan, sees the vote as an opportunity to finally achieve the goals of the 1979 revolution.
The bloody war with Iraq, waged from 1980 to 1988, and an accumulation of Western sanctions have long held back Islam in Iran, Mr. Askari said. Now, it is time to become more Islamic, he said, and suggested a much harder line in Iran's foreign policy.
''Islamic development means never backing down,'' Mr. Askari said, admitting that he, like most of the influential clerics in the city, supports Saeed Jalili, the former chief nuclear negotiator who is the candidate of the traditionalists, a coalition of conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders. ''He is a religious man,'' Mr. Askari said. ''Islam prescribes that we must never give up in the face of pressures, no matter if they are sanctions, war or criticism of our nuclear program.''
The candidates seek the blessings of high-ranking clerics the way American presidential contenders court wealthy donors. Mr. Jalili, the presumed front-runner, visited the city twice last week, nailing down the support of Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, who, according to analysts, seems to be the second most influential cleric in Iran, after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Mr. Jalili argues that the answer to Iran's problems lies not in ''Western concepts'' like Keynesian economics or human rights; instead he propounds vague slogans like Islamic development and creating an Islamic lifestyle.
Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, a hard-liner who in two elections supported the departing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has often said elections should be used as a way for people to confirm the rule of the clergy. He praised Mr. Jalili for not engaging in popular themes like the economy, instead emphasizing ''Islamic and revolutionary values.''
Other prominent candidates, including the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, and Ali Akbar Velayati, a foreign policy adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei, have also recently made high-profile visits here.
Political missteps come at a high price in Qum. In 2005, President Ahmadinejad told Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli that he had been surrounded by a divine light while addressing the United Nations General Assembly. The remark, caught on video, was a first crack in the now destroyed relationship between the president and leading clergymen, who suspect him of challenging their power by promoting individual relations with God.
Nobody here speaks of Mr. Ahmadinejad; most of the clerics who are close to the traditionalists are backing Mr. Jalili.
That is not to say this is a place of monolithic thinking. The 15 or so leading clerics all have good ties with Ayatollah Khamenei and support his policies, and those who are critical have been silenced. One of those, Ayatollah Yousef Sanaei, who supported the opposition leaders Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi when they fell out with the state after Mr. Ahmadinejad's disputed 2009 victory, has been muzzled.
But behind the official opinions there are glimpses of the same dissatisfactions that can be found elsewhere in the country.
During a funeral on Tuesday for the former Friday Prayer leader of the city of Isfahan, Ayatollah Jalaledin Taheri, who in 2002 quit his position in protest against the muffling of reformists, dozens of people shouted slogans in favor of the opposition leaders, calling for the lifting of their house arrests, videos on social media Web sites show.
Several of the hundreds of lower-ranking ayatollahs in Qum were dismayed when Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a pragmatic moderate who in 2009 offered veiled support for the opposition, was disqualified by the conservative Guardian Council, insiders say.
''I do not understand how such an extraordinary figure like Rafsanjani, a man that has guided our revolution, is not allowed to try to become president,'' said Ayatollah Mohammad Feiz, an 89-year old cleric. A member of the council that voted in Ayatollah Khamenei as Iran's supreme leader in 1989, Ayatollah Feiz gave a long lecture on the Islamic Revolution as he served melon juice in his small workroom filled with books on Islam.
He recalled when security officers of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi kicked down his door in 1964, looking for his neighbor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the ''imam,'' as he is now called here, who was later exiled and returned as the leader of the 1979 revolution.
''When they found him, they put him in a Volkswagen Beetle and sent him off to Turkey,'' Ayatollah Feiz said. The revolution produced great men, but ''many of those that were with the imam are no longer in politics,'' he concluded.
''Only one of the eight candidates is a cleric; that illustrates how much things have changed since then,'' he said. ''There are many shortcomings. I am not surprised people have become discouraged.''
In an industrial neighborhood just outside Qum, several people said they shared Ayatollah Feiz's dissatisfaction. Business was slow, said Mehdi, 40, a garage owner who did not want to mention his first name out of fear of retribution.
''We need to fix our economy,'' he said. ''I love Islam, but how do we fix 100 percent inflation? I'll vote for anybody with a good plan, but until now I haven't seen any candidate with clear ideas for the future.''

HEADLINE: Market Plummets on Weak Economic Data

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Several weak economic reports sent the stock market plunging on Wednesday to its lowest level in a month.
Mining, banking and chemical companies, and other businesses with fortunes tied closely to prospects for growth, led the market lower. That is a sign that investors are becoming less confident in the economy. 
The troubling data included weak hiring at private companies, a plunge in mortgage applications and sluggish orders to American factories.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 216.95 points and finished at 14,960.59, a drop of 1.4 percent. The close was the first below 15,000 since May 6 and the decline was the largest in seven weeks.
Intel fell the most in the Dow, dropping 66 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $24.70.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended down 22.48 points, or 1.4 percent, at 1,608.90. The index is 3 percent below its record close of 1,669 reached May 21. It is still up 12.8 percent this year.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 43.78 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,401.48. The index closed at its lowest level in a month.
Stocks started lower and declined steadily throughout the day. Some investors said that because stocks rose every month this year and climbed to record levels this spring, a significant pullback was overdue.
''The rally is tired, and people are taking some profits,'' said Brad Reynolds, at the investment adviser LJPR.
Investors also were unnerved by an 11.5 percent drop in mortgage applications last week. The decrease was a disappointment because the rebound in housing had been a major factor supporting the stock market's record-breaking rally this year.
Housing stocks slumped in response. D.R. Horton dropped 27 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $22.65. Beazer Homes fell 60 cents to $18.78, a decline of 3.1 percent.
Applications declined as mortgage rates rose to the highest point since April 2012. The increase was driven by higher yields in the bond market.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed as high as 2.2 percent last week, the highest in more than two years. On Wednesday, the note rose 17/32, to 96 31/32, and yield fell to 2.09 percent, from 2.15 percent late Tuesday.
News was disappointing on hiring, another one of the major supports for the market rally this year.
A measure of employment in the service sector fell in May to the lowest level since last July, and the payroll provider ADP reported the second straight month of weak gains in jobs.
The stock market's recent bout of volatility began May 22 as traders studied comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and minutes from the last meeting of the Fed's policy committee for clues about when the bank may slow its stimulus program.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's New Premier Calls for Drone Strike Halt

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH and SALMAN MASOOD; Declan Walsh reported from London, and Salman Masood from Islamabad, Pakistan.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Nawaz Sharif took office as Pakistan's prime minister for an unparalleled third time on Wednesday, vowing to tackle the country's crippling electricity crisis and issuing an urgent call for the end of American drone strikes on Pakistani soil.
''The chapter of daily drone attacks should stop,'' a grave-faced Mr. Sharif told the packed lower house of Parliament, where he won a comfortable majority of votes to become prime minister. ''We respect the sovereignty of other countries, but others should also respect our sovereignty.'' 
Those comments resonated with many Pakistanis who view the C.I.A. missile strikes as a troubling symbol of American aggression -- even if they occasionally kill Pakistan's own enemies, like the country's deputy Taliban leader, Wali ur-Rehman, who died in an attack last week.
But the rate of drone strikes is already declining sharply, amid tough scrutiny of the program in the United States and new restrictions from President Obama. And though the drone issue was a galvanizing one through the campaign season, Mr. Sharif is likely to face even more complex foreign policy challenges now that he is in office.
''Drones are just a side show,'' said Mosharraf Zaidi, a former Foreign Ministry adviser. ''The bigger issue is the American drawdown from Afghanistan in 2014 and what it leaves behind for Pakistan to deal with.''
It has been a remarkable comeback for Mr. Sharif, a Punjabi steel tycoon whose last stint as prime minister was abruptly truncated by a military coup in 1999, forcing him into a seven-year exile in Saudi Arabia and London.
Now, after a sweeping victory by his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party in the May 11 election, he returns to power with a strong mandate -- one that he will have to employ if he is to tackle the country's daunting array of urgent challenges.
In his speech to Parliament, Mr. Sharif referred to some of those issues: soaring government debt, a sagging economy, lawlessness and corruption. Equally pressing issues that received little mention include the festering Taliban insurgency in the northwest, Baluch separatism in the southwest and strained relations with neighboring India and Afghanistan.
Mr. Sharif said he could not promise to resolve those problems quickly, but he vowed to promote a culture of transparency. ''My government will not tolerate any form of corruption,'' he said as legislators thumped their desks in approval.
His comment on drone strikes suggested a firm, and perhaps more distant, tone in relations with the United States, whose alliance with Pakistan has frequently been stormy in recent years.
During the campaign, Mr. Sharif vowed to limit American influence in the country and drew a firm line against continued drone strikes. He boasted of having resisted American diplomatic and economic pressure in ordering the country's first nuclear tests in 1998.
Analysts caution, however, that Mr. Sharif's approach may have been driven by political considerations, and some suggest that he may be more pragmatic toward the United States now that he is back in office.
In contrast, Mr. Sharif has openly promoted warmer relations with China. In Parliament, he promised to increase economic cooperation with Beijing, including the completion of road and rail links between the Pakistani ports of Gwadar and Karachi, on the Arabian Sea, and the landlocked cities of western China.
Hours after his address, Mr. Sharif was sworn in by his rival, President Asif Ali Zardari, during a brief ceremony at the soaring presidency building that overlooks the capital, Islamabad. Mr. Zardari is to remain in office until September, and though relations between the two men have been tense at times, in recent months there has been little sign of open enmity.
Mr. Sharif's return to power is the first time in Pakistan's fragile democracy that a civilian government has served a full five-year term and peacefully passed power to another administration.
Mr. Sharif's comeback looked distant in December 2000, when the military leader at the time, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, banished him into exile in Saudi Arabia, a year after the coup that ousted him.
Back then, Mr. Sharif had little public support because of accusations of corruption and mismanagement, while the coup received a broad, if short-lived, welcome. During General Musharraf's nine-year tenure, however, Pakistan saw a rise in military violence and political instability.
Mr. Sharif and his opposition rival, Benazir Bhutto, returned from exile in late 2007. Ms. Bhutto was killed in a suicide bombing that year but her party, led by her husband, Mr. Zardari, won the 2008 general elections.
While the Zardari government introduced important constitutional changes and laws that strengthened women's rights, it lost the public's trust amid persistent accusations of mismanagement and corruption, as well as the effects of a painful electricity crisis.
Although Mr. Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party was trounced in the May 11 election, it remains the country's second-largest political force, just ahead of a grouping led by the former cricketer Imran Khan.
Beyond dealing with Mr. Zardari's party, Mr. Sharif faces a more immediate, and longer standing, test from the military command that toppled him in 1999.
In the years since his return to Pakistan, Mr. Sharif has done little to hide his hostility toward military meddling in democratic politics, and that sense of suspicion was reciprocated by the military top brass. During the negotiations to resolve the 2008 political crisis, the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, told the American ambassador then, Anne W. Patterson, that ''regardless of how much he disliked Zardari, he distrusted Sharif even more,'' according to a State Department cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010.
But as elections neared this year, Mr. Sharif toned down his hostility. He says that he will also hold the defense and foreign affairs portfolios himself -- a move that some interpret as an effort to coordinate policy on delicate issues, like Afghanistan and Islamist militancy, with the military.
One early litmus test of that relationship may lie in the fate of General Musharraf, who is under house arrest at his villa on the edge of Islamabad facing a litany of charges.

HEADLINE: Voters Think Silver Should Resign, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- By more than two to one, New York State voters believe the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, should step down because of the way he handled sexual harassment allegations against Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, according to a new poll.
In an illustration of New Yorkers' feelings, 58 percent of voters said they would not want their daughter to work as an intern in the State Legislature, according to the poll, which was conducted by Quinnipiac University and released on Wednesday. 
The survey offered evidence of widespread disgust over the allegations against Mr. Lopez, Democrat of Brooklyn, who resigned last month to avoid expulsion from the Assembly, as well as unease with Mr. Silver, Democrat of Manhattan, who has served as speaker since 1994.
''People are certainly appalled by what's going on,'' said Maurice Carroll, the director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. He added, ''I don't know that that means they're going to fire a bunch of legislators, but I think it's bad.''
Mr. Silver apologized last month for his handling of the Lopez matter, in which he reached a confidential settlement with two of Mr. Lopez's accusers and did not refer their initial allegations to the Assembly's ethics committee. After two more women accused Mr. Lopez of harassment, Mr. Silver did refer the allegations to the committee, and then publicly censured Mr. Lopez on behalf of the Assembly.
Various newspaper editorial boards have called for Mr. Silver to step down, as have many Republican lawmakers. But with two exceptions, all of his Democratic colleagues in the Assembly have stood by him, as has Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat.
Voters, however, appear much more upset: 51 percent said Mr. Silver should step down, compared with 22 percent who said he should keep his job, according to the poll, which was conducted from May 29 to June 3. Mr. Silver's approval rating was also the worst ever recorded by a Quinnipiac poll: 52 percent disapproved of how he was handling his job, compared with 44 percent in April.
A plurality of Democrats -- 45 percent -- said he should step down, compared with 28 percent who said he should keep his post.
In New York City, Mr. Silver's base of power, 50 percent of voters said he should resign, compared with 26 percent who said he should remain as speaker.
A spokesman for Mr. Silver, Michael Whyland, brushed off the poll.
''Polls change all the time,'' Mr. Whyland said, ''so we are focused on making sure we pass legislation important to New Yorkers, including the governor's Women's Equality Agenda, the New York Dream Act to help young immigrants get a good education, and measures to improve our economy.''
Also on Wednesday, a dozen Assembly Republicans said they had requested a federal criminal investigation of Mr. Silver and his staff members.
In a letter to Richard S. Hartunian, the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, which includes Albany, they suggested Mr. Silver and his staff may have committed fraud in their handling of the confidential settlement payment.
''You can't have a state body thoroughly investigate someone who is that powerful and that omnipotent in the state,'' said Assemblyman Kieran Michael Lalor, a Republican from Fishkill. ''You need to take it to the next level.''
Mr. Lopez resigned last month after a report by the state's ethics commission, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, described the behavior he was accused of in lurid detail. His departure came shortly after several other state legislators were arrested in unrelated corruption scandals, casting an unwelcome cloud over the Legislature as it prepares to finish its session this month.
The poll released on Wednesday made clear that voters have paid attention to the scandals and are not pleased.
Two-thirds described state government as dysfunctional, and 86 percent said corruption was a serious problem. A plurality of voters agreed that ''almost everyone'' in the Senate and the Assembly should be thrown out in a legislative housecleaning -- including their own senators and Assembly members. Voters also said that Governor Cuomo had primary responsibility for cleaning up corruption, and that he had done a lackluster job with it.
The poll recorded Mr. Cuomo's lowest net approval rating as governor. Fifty-three percent of voters said they approved of the job he was doing; in April, 57 percent had approved.
The governor's popularity has fallen sharply this year. In December, 74 percent of voters approved of his job performance. Still, in the poll released on Wednesday, 58 percent of voters said they believed Mr. Cuomo deserved re-election next year.
The poll of 1,075 registered voters, conducted by telephone, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Obama Appoints Rice to Key Post On U.S. Security

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama named Susan E. Rice and Samantha Power to major national security posts on Wednesday, promoting two outspoken voices for humanitarian intervention on a foreign policy team known for its deep caution in dealing with conflicts abroad.
The president they serve has steadfastly resisted intervening in the most dire human-rights calamity he has faced since taking office: the civil war in Syria. Given Mr. Obama's well-known skepticism about the dangers of more direct involvement, it is not clear whether Ms. Rice and Ms. Power can -- or even want to -- change his mind about more aggressive action.
But there is little doubt that along with two other recent additions to his national security team, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, they will bring a different tone to foreign policy in Mr. Obama's second term.
At the same time, the resignation of Tom Donilon as national security adviser, which precipitated Wednesday's announcement, could create complications for a White House that takes pride in a smooth-running operation that Mr. Donilon has overseen for more than two and a half years. 
Ms. Rice, who is taking Mr. Donilon's job, and Ms. Power, who is replacing Ms. Rice as ambassador to the United Nations, joined forces in 2011, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, to persuade Mr. Obama to back a NATO-led intervention in Libya. Yet neither Ms. Rice, 48, nor Ms. Power, 42, has spoken out in favor of a more aggressive response in Syria, attesting to both the insoluble nature of the conflict and the discipline of the White House.
In introducing Ms. Rice, who like Ms. Power worked on his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama praised her mix of idealism and pragmatism.
''Everybody understands Susan is a fierce champion for justice and human dignity,'' he said in a Rose Garden ceremony. ''But she's also mindful that we have to exercise our power wisely and deliberately.''
How Ms. Rice wields her enhanced power could have implications for what has been a generally harmonious national security team. Given her foreign policy background, strong views and personal ties to Mr. Obama, some believe her appointment will further consolidate foreign policy decision-making in the White House.
In an interview, Ms. Rice said she viewed her role as bringing ''as much rigor to our problem-solving as possible.''
''My style is to be collegial,'' she added. ''I don't need the glory; I want to get stuff done.''
But Ms. Rice's ascendancy could be a headache for Mr. Kerry, whose path to the State Department opened up after the furor over her role in explaining the deadly attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya, forced her to withdraw her name from consideration for the department's top job.
White House officials played down suggestions that Mr. Kerry was at risk of being marginalized, noting that he had carved out a prominent role in dealing with the Syrian conflict as well as in trying to revive peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
''John Kerry is going to be a very aggressive diplomat,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. ''We support him diving headfirst into some very tough issues.''
Mr. Rhodes said that although Ms. Rice and Ms. Power adhered to the tenets of liberal interventionism, which holds that the United States has an obligation to defend human rights aggressively, neither reflexively advocated the use of military force.
During the administration's debate last summer about whether to supply the Syrian rebels with weapons -- a proposal pushed by the director of the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, David H. Petraeus, and favored by Mrs. Clinton -- Ms. Rice sided with officials who opposed it. Mr. Obama shelved the idea.
Over time, friends of Ms. Rice said, she has become more open to providing lethal aid because it could change the momentum in what has become a stalemate. But she is said to be wary of any halfway strategy, which she believes would do more harm than good.
Ms. Power, an Irish-born academic who worked on human-rights issues on the National Security Council during Mr. Obama's first term, favors a more aggressive response in Syria than most people in the administration do, according to people who know her.
''I have seen U.N. aid workers enduring shellfire to deliver food to the people of Sudan,'' she said Wednesday, ''yet I've also seen U.N. peacekeepers fail to protect the people of Bosnia.''
Ms. Power and Ms. Rice, who are friends, each bring their own anguished histories to these questions.
For Ms. Power, who covered the wars of the former Yugoslavia as a journalist, Bosnia was a formative experience. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ''A Problem From Hell,'' she recorded the history of genocide in the 20th century, offering a critique of the failure of the United States and other countries to stop it.
For Ms. Rice, who began her career in the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, Rwanda was a crucible. President Bill Clinton's inaction in the face of genocide there led people who worked for him, including Ms. Rice, to vow never again to allow such a slaughter.
Years later, she told Ms. Power, who was then a journalist writing about the episode, that ''I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, I would come down on the side of dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required.''
However fervent these new officials are, some former officials say they may not make a big difference. ''The problem is not the advice the president has been getting so much as his own presidential priorities, which do not include getting involved in another Middle East war,'' said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former director of policy planning at the State Department.
The timing of the announcement of Mr. Donilon's departure raised questions, coming just two days before a meeting between Mr. Obama and China's president, Xi Jinping, in Southern California that Mr. Donilon largely organized. But Mr. Donilon insisted that he had planned to leave at the end of Mr. Obama's first term, and that he stayed on at the president's request to break in the new team.
Colleagues of Mr. Donilon said his most lasting policy legacy would be the administration's shift in priorities from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to the fast-growing economies of Asia.
''What Tom provided was the air cover that allowed for a very substantial shift in focus from the Middle East and South Asia toward Asia proper,'' said Kurt M. Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.
While Asia has not been a focus for either Ms. Rice or Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rhodes said that was not necessary because the policy had been set. Likewise, he said, Ms. Rice did not need to devote as much of her time to the bureaucratic aspects of the job as Mr. Donilon did because the system he created would live on after his departure.
''That allows some leeway for her to bring her experience as a strategist and foreign policy thinker to bear,'' Mr. Rhodes said.
Mr. Obama appeared genuinely pleased to introduce his new team. He referred jokingly to Ms. Rice's reputation for being assertive, noting that he plays basketball with Ms. Rice's brother, John, and ''it runs in the family, throwing the occasional elbow.'' Pausing for a moment, he added, ''but hitting the big shot.''

HEADLINE: Vollis Simpson, 94, Whirligig Folk Artist

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Vollis Simpson, who made metal scraps into magnificent things that twirled and jangled and clattered when he set them out on his land, and who did so long before anyone started calling them whirligigs or him an artist, died on Friday at his home in Lucama, N.C. He was 94.
His death was confirmed by his wife, Jean. 
Asked how her husband could visit a junkyard, gather odd objects and eventually produce a rocket ship or a guitar player or a team of horses pulling a carriage across the sky of eastern North Carolina and make it all look as natural as the breeze that animated it, Ms. Simpson explained, ''It was just in his mind and in his brain and it just came out.''
By the end of his life Mr. Simpson had become an art star. His 55-foot-tall, 45-foot-wide ''Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness'' is on permanent display at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, and his works are part of several other collections, including the American Folk Art Museum in Manhattan.
In Wilson, N.C., about 10 miles from Lucama, that city plans to open the Vollis Simpson Whirligig Park this fall to display many of the artist's most ambitious works.
''By leveraging one of Wilson's most unique cultural assets into an economic engine of entrepreneurial job creation and tourism, the Wilson community will add vibrancy to its historic downtown,'' the park's Web site said. ''The Whirligig Park is the catalyst needed to propel Wilson into 21st-century competitiveness and quality of place.'' For nearly a decade the city has held the Wilson Whirligig Festival in honor of Mr. Simpson. It replaced the Golden Leaf Festival, which celebrated the history of tobacco in Wilson.
Mr. Simpson did not set out to make art.
''He did it for his own pleasure in the beginning,'' Ms. Simpson said. ''It caught on and people liked it. It went from there.''
For decades he ran a machine shop in Lucama, where he repaired heavy equipment and came up with customized devices for moving houses and towing large trucks. By the 1970s he had begun his grand repurposing.
''Didn't call it nothing,'' Mr. Simpson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2010. ''Just go to the junkyard and see what I could get. Went by the iron man, the boat man, the timber man. Ran by every month. If they had no use for it, I took it.''
He installed his creations on his family's farm. He eventually called them windmills. Curators now call them outsider art or visionary art, and regard Mr. Simpson's work as distinctive interpretations of the old mechanical toys known as whirligigs.
''Everybody made fun of me and laughed at me,'' Mr. Simpson said in a documentary paid for by the North Carolina Arts Council. ''I didn't pay 'em no damn mind.''
Ms. Simpson declined to specify her husband's date of birth, but she said that his parents were farmers and that he lived his entire life in Wilson County. He was one of 12 children, and he was expected to work as a child.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Simpson's survivors include three children and four grandchildren.
Mr. Simpson left school after the 11th grade. He built his first windmill to power a large washing machine for soldiers' clothing while he was serving in the Pacific during World War II in the Army Air Corps. He made it from parts of a junked B-29 bomber.
Some of his windmills would eventually sell for thousands of dollars. Late in life he worried about what would happen to his menagerie at home.
''I guess it'll just rust and fall down when I'm gone,'' he said.
He was pleased when Wilson announced it would build the park, and he played a consulting role as works were moved to a storage site for restoration.
''He wanted them to be saved and refurbished so they could go on forever,'' Ms. Simpson said, ''or for a long, long time.''

HEADLINE: Wooing in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- A bold new billboard looms over U.S. 101, the highway that runs through the heart of the global technology industry. ''H-1b problems?'' it reads. ''Pivot to Canada.''
That sassy invitation is directed at the thousands of foreigners having trouble getting temporary visas, known as H-1b's, to work in the United States. Canada's new so-called start-up visa offers them the prospect of permanent residency and with it, the country's relatively low business taxes and public health insurance.
Canada is not alone in reaching out to foreign entrepreneurs. In a bid to create their own versions of Silicon Valley, Britain and Australia have dangled start-up visas like this too. Chile is even offering seed money to lure foreigners to come to Santiago and get their start-ups off the ground.
But the seductions of this Silicon Valley are hard to resist for the men and women who dream of building the next Google (or at least being the next Google acquisition). This is where they want to be. 
''It's like being in Florence during the Renaissance,'' is how Xavier Lasa, a Spanish computer coder, put it recently. He sounded dead serious. He had come to Mountain View, just south of San Francisco, on a short-term business visa to join a technology incubator program called 500 Startups. He was building a tool for brands to advertise on the Web.
Like many foreign tech entrepreneurs angling to stay here, he had his eyes on Washington, not Ottawa. The landmark immigration bill that the full Senate is to take up next week includes a provision that Silicon Valley investors have pressed hard for: a new visa category for entrepreneurs who have persuaded American investors to back them with at least $100,000 in financing.
Never mind that immigrants don't need special visas to be entrepreneurial; research shows that they are far more likely than native-born Americans to start businesses. Start-up visas are an easy political sell, which also explains Canada's latest gamble.
When Canada's immigration minister, Jason T. Kenney, came to visit 500 Startups recently, on a gloriously sunny Friday afternoon, he got a taste of what attracts foreigners. Dave McClure, a co-founder of the incubator, took him straight to the wall-to-wall 12th-floor window.
''Facebook is that way,'' Mr. McClure said, pointing to the 360-degree view. ''You can see Apple over there.''
''There's Sand Hill Road,'' he continued cheerfully, motioning toward the wide boulevard lined on both sides with big-name venture capital firms. ''Stanford is just up that way.''
The room was full of foreign entrepreneurs, huddled over laptops or sketching out business plans on whiteboards.
Julian Garcia, a programmer from Chile who was building a tool for marketers to target potential customers by location, explained his view of the Valley. ''Here, you build something incredible, in two years, you get acquired.''
Aditya Sahay, the founder of a men's fashion site, from India, retorted, ''Even if you build something not incredible, you still get acquired -- in four months!''
Mr. Kenney kept his game face on as Mr. McClure waxed about the attractions of the Valley. In an interview later, he said he was certain that some of the foreign entrepreneurs, uncertain about their immigration status in the United States, could be tempted by, say, Manitoba. He called them ''a captive audience,'' and said he hoped to take advantage of what could be a short window of opportunity for his country while Congress argues over how to fix its own immigration law.
The new Canadian visa is not for tech entrepreneurs per se, but the venture capital requirements favor technology start-ups over more traditional immigrant businesses, like corner shops and restaurants. And the offer is far more generous than its American counterpart.
Anyone with one year of college and 75,000 Canadian dollars from an approved Canadian angel investor, or 200,000 Canadian dollars from an approved Canadian venture capitalist, can apply for the visa. Applicants need to be able to speak basic English or French. They need not prove they will create any jobs.
Mr. Kenney said he believed that investors, rather than workers in his ministry, were more capable of vetting who would be good for his country.
''The kind of rigorous assessment made by investors will ensure that the qualified applicants have really a high level of human capital and they are going to be able to move around the economy,'' the minister said.
Asked what happens if their businesses fail, he said he was confident that skilled, entrepreneurial foreigners would dust themselves off and find jobs in Canada's technology industry. ''It's a risk we're willing to take,'' he said.
American lawmakers have opted for a more cautious approach. The proposed Senate bill would grant temporary visas valid for three years, unlike Canada, which would grant permanent residency. The Department of Homeland Security would have to report to Congress every three years on what kinds of businesses the recipients create, how many jobs they produce, and how much revenue.
It is not geared toward entrepreneurs in any specific industry, though the rhetoric around it has centered mainly on technology. Technology investors, like Mr. McClure, have been actively pushing for it.
''From a political perspective, the goal of the start-up visas is to demonstrate they're bringing in the sexiest, highest-value people,'' said Madeleine Sumption, assistant director for research at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, who has studied start-up visa programs worldwide.
But, she pointed out, most immigrant entrepreneurs -- Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin, included -- come in on other visas. ''You don't need an entrepreneur visa to have entrepreneurs,'' she added. ''You would have to let in a lot of people before you guarantee some Sergey Brins.''
Australia offers its version of a green card to those who secure 1 million Australian dollars in financing from approved Australian venture capitalists. Britain offers temporary visas to those who procure £50,000 from a venture backer. Chile doles out $40,000 in equity-free seed capital to foreign visitors who want to start a technology business.
Ayan Barua, from India, has already spent six months in Chile and taken advantage of its offer. Even though his girlfriend, who is Australian, has tried to persuade him to apply for her country's start-up visa, he has resisted. Instead, he and his business partner, Vamshi Mokshagundam, have returned to Silicon Valley repeatedly to develop their business, a recommendation engine for businesses shopping for software.
Their funders are here, they said, as are their initial customers. So too are other entrepreneurs whose guidance they seek. ''It's hard to find advice and mentorship anywhere else,'' Mr. Mokshagundam said. ''That's a big deal for us.''
Mr. Barua described California as the N.B.A. of the start-up world. ''The adrenaline rush you need as an entrepreneur is here,'' he said.
If the omnibus immigration bill winding its way through the Senate were to become law, he said, he would absolutely apply.
If it did not, he and his partner said they might consider the Canadian visa. They would still want to come to Silicon Valley as often as possible. But they could use Canada as their base, as they use Bangalore, India, now. ''It would be a shorter flight,'' Mr. Mokshagundam said.

HEADLINE: Wide China Push Is Seen to Obtain Industry Secrets

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW; Edward Wong reported from Shenzhen and Beijing, and Didi Kirsten Tatlow reported from Beijing. Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
SHENZHEN, China -- A government-financed research institute in the Pearl River Delta here boasts an impressive range of specialties, from robotics to nanomedicine to magnetic resonance imaging.
But not all the cutting edge developments may be the result of indigenous innovation, according to American prosecutors, who last month charged three Chinese scientists at the New York University School of Medicine with taking bribes to share research findings with their real employers: the Shenzhen institute and a separate Shanghai medical technology company.
Though considerable attention has been focused on Chinese cyberespionage efforts, the institute is at the vanguard of a related push to bolster China's competitiveness by acquiring overseas technology directly from Chinese scientists working in the United States and other developed countries, say American officials and analysts. Those scientists are heavily recruited to return to China or, in some instances, to share their knowledge while remaining overseas, according to the federal court case and a book released last month by three experts who do China research for the United States government.
In advance of a summit meeting in California later this week between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, the two countries agreed to hold regular meetings on the issues of cybersecurity and commercial espionage. But there is no sign yet of what those discussions might accomplish. 
The authors of the new book, ''Chinese Industrial Espionage,'' say that technology transfer is an official policy at all levels of the Communist Party and the state. It often takes place in a legal gray area, since laws governing technology transfer can be vague or nonexistent. The authors warn that the United States and other nations need to acknowledge the extent of the Chinese campaign, which they say far exceeds those of other countries and threatens American competitiveness.
They contend that the scale of China's efforts to gather overseas technology is so immense that the National Counterintelligence Executive, a federal agency, has considered issuing separate annual reports each year: one for China and one for the rest of the world.
''China is in a different league altogether, exceeding the international norm not just in scale, the number and variety of transfer venues, the moral agnosticism of its practitioners, and the degree of government support,'' the authors, William C. Hannas, James Mulvenon and Anna B. Puglisi, said in written answers to questions. ''It's an entire mind-set.''
China's strategies range from setting up science parks for Chinese returnees to persuading foreign companies to open research centers in China, they said.
A private intelligence company in the Washington area, Defense Group Inc., which employs Mr. Mulvenon, says the government-financed center that the N.Y.U. scientists are accused of being part of, the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, recruits overseas Chinese with technical knowledge and ''has sought to develop collaborative relationships with foreign companies and research organizations which display high potential for technology transfer.''
A spokeswoman for the Shenzhen center said it was investigating the accusations in the N.Y.U. case. A lawyer for Yudong Zhu, an associate professor in the N.Y.U. radiology department and the lead scientist charged, said the government ''has drawn some erroneous conclusions from some of the evidence they have observed'' and that Mr. Zhu did not work for the Shanghai company.
The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property concluded in May that technology theft amounted to a loss of more than $300 billion a year, the equivalent of total annual United States exports to Asia. ''Virtually every sector and technology is attacked,'' the commission said.
''National industrial policy goals in China encourage IP theft, and an extraordinary number of Chinese in business and government entities are engaged in this practice,'' said the report by the commission, which was led by Dennis C. Blair, a former director of national intelligence, and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former ambassador to China.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry and the State Council, China's cabinet, declined to comment for this article. In early May, the Commerce Ministry denied accusations by the United States Trade Representative that China was weak on enforcing intellectual property rights. ''The Chinese government attaches great importance to intellectual property protection and has made great progress in areas like intellectual property legislation and enforcement,'' it said.
Cases like the one at N.Y.U. of overseas Chinese scientists and scholars accused of secretly transferring technical information are considered rare, especially given that the number of Chinese students going abroad reached 400,000 last year. But the growing emphasis in the United States on technology theft by China has made some Chinese-Americans and overseas Chinese fearful of undue persecution. They point to the fiasco of the Wen Ho Lee case, in which a Chinese-American scientist was wrongly accused by federal officials of stealing classified nuclear-related documents.
Frank H. Wu, dean of the Hastings College of the Law at the University of California and a member of the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American advocacy group, urged Americans not to judge people on their ethnicity. ''This is complicated because the facts are messy,'' he said, calling for ''due process and fairness.''
Some foreign economists say Chinese institutions have been unable to capitalize fully on technical knowledge acquired from overseas Chinese. A notable financial failure is Suntech Power, one of the world's biggest solar-panel makers, whose main subsidiary declared bankruptcy in March. Its founder, Shi Zhengrong, was an overseas scientist who had gotten Australian citizenship and had several patents to his name before deciding to return to China to start a business. The city of Wuxi had lured him there with a $6 million initial investment in his company.
There are overseas Chinese associations in the technology field that are transparent about their ties to Chinese institutions and government agencies. One such group is the Silicon Valley Chinese Overseas Business Association, whose stated goal is to promote the business interests of its members, some of whom hold posts as technology advisers to Chinese ministries and universities. The president, Dongping Daniel Zhu, founded Zaptron Systems, which specializes in analysis of the Chinese stock market. The group has laboratories in Shanghai and Dalian.
An online biography says Mr. Zhu, who has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Virginia Tech, has been invited every year since 1995 by Chinese ministries and local governments to give seminars and consult with industrial and high-tech parks in China.
''If we transfer, we just bring our own technology,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''There is a fine line to draw between technology transfer and espionage. I believe everybody in the field knows where the bottom line is and will not cross it.''
The authors of the industrial espionage book said they were not trying to put overseas Chinese under unfair scrutiny; rather, they want the United States government and American companies to be aware of the sophistication of China's efforts.
The book notes that beginning in the mid-1950s, China built a system of information extraction from overseas, focusing on open-source material and blurring the boundary between ''information'' and ''intelligence.'' Today, the government openly appeals to overseas Chinese to ''lend'' it technology, with a typical meeting in the city of Shenyang in 2001 attracting hundreds of overseas Chinese, the authors wrote.
The technology is converted into products and equipment across China, including in designated technology transfer centers. Shanghai alone has 10 such centers, and a single center may have a bank of thousands of projects, the authors wrote.
One, the Shanghai New High Technology Service Center, offers ''one-stop shopping'' for government and business customers. Another, the Shanghai National Technology Transfer Center, has about 7,500 employees spread across laboratories, research institutes and offices in the region who are engaged in the ''conversion'' of foreign technology, including in microelectronics, lasers and nuclear technology, the authors wrote.
In the N.Y.U. case, prosecutors say the Chinese scientists hid their work in Shenzhen and Shanghai from their American employers. The scientists specialized in M.R.I. technology and did research at N.Y.U. with millions of dollars of grant money from the National Institutes of Health. They were caught, prosecutors said, after the university secretly filmed their actions in the laboratory and reviewed their e-mails, including some written to the Shenzhen center and United Imaging Healthcare, the Shanghai company. Dr. Zhu and a colleague were arrested in May, but the third scientist had already left for China.
Asked about the case, a spokesman for United Imaging said, ''Our company would never do such things.''

HEADLINE: Fighting 'Patent Trolls'

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Abusive patent litigation is a festering problem that costs the American economy billions of dollars. This week President Obama proposed promising reforms to rein in lawsuits filed by businesses that buy patents with the intent of suing individuals and businesses for using or selling products that they claim violate their patents. 
Such firms, often called patent trolls, have no interest in creating products or services; they make money by using legal threats to induce others to pay them a licensing fee or to settle their suits. One firm threatened to sue 8,000 coffee shops, retailers and hotels that used Wi-Fi networks to provide Internet service to their customers and demanded they pay a one-time fee to settle the claims.
The patent system encourages innovation by giving inventors a temporary monopoly on their creations. But, in recent years, as patent applications increased, the Patent and Trademark Office has struggled to keep up and granted many patents that were poorly documented or too broad. This has encouraged lawsuits by companies that have bought patents and even between large technology firms like Apple and Samsung. Because defending patent cases is expensive and time-consuming, many defendants feel compelled to settle such cases even if they are without merit. One study found that such cases and threats cost businesses $29 billion in 2011, and much of that was borne by small and medium-size firms. That was up 400 percent from 2005, according to the Obama administration.
The administration has proposed changes that should help fix at least part of the problem. It is asking Congress to restrict lawsuits against consumers and businesses that use technology, a badly needed step. Another proposal would make it easier for judges to award attorney fees to defendants who prevail in frivolous patent cases. The administration wants to make it tougher for businesses to get the government to ban the import of products that may rely on disputed patents. Mr. Obama also will issue an executive order to improve the training of patent examiners.
Some companies like Microsoft have expressed concerns that one of the president's proposals to subject software patents to greater scrutiny might make it harder to patent some technologies. It is hard to judge those claims because the proposals include few details. The biggest unresolved question is what the administration and Congress plan to do to make sure the patent office has enough resources to ensure patent applications get thorough scrutiny. The office has made some improvements, including reducing its application backlog to about 600,000, from more than 700,000, but it needs to do more.
Democrats like Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Republicans like Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia have offered support for the president's proposal and said they intend to work with him. It's good to see that encouraging innovation, not litigation, is a bipartisan goal.

HEADLINE: China Aims at Europe's Wines After Solar Panel Action

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, Eric Pfanner from Serraval, France, and Hilda Wang from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's nouveaux riches millionaires, wealthy princelings and bribing business executives may soon find their wallets a little thinner: The price for French Champagnes and Burgundies, Italian Barolos and pinot grigios and other European wines may soon rise in mainland Chinese stores.
Less than a day after the European Union said it was imposing preliminary import tariffs on Chinese solar panels, China's Ministry of Commerce announced Wednesday that it had begun a trade investigation of wines imported from the European Union. The investigation could lead to the imposition of steep tariffs by China. 
The European Union's trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, announced Tuesday in Brussels that he was imposing preliminary tariffs of 11.8 percent on solar panels imported from China, saying the panels were being ''dumped,'' sold for less than they cost to make, in Europe.
If China was trying to send a retaliatory signal to Mr. De Gucht personally, wine might be a good target. He owns a 50 percent stake in a wine-producing estate in the Tuscany region of Italy.
The Chinese commerce ministry carefully avoided linking the solar panels to Wednesday's announcement that it would investigate European wines for improper duties or subsidies, saying instead that it was acting in response to a complaint from Chinese wineries.
But the ministry issued a separate statement expressing ''resolute opposition'' to the decision on solar panels. ''We hope the E.U. will further show their sincerity and show flexibility, through consultations to find mutually acceptable solutions,'' the statement said.
The 27 countries of the European Union exported $980.7 million worth of wine to China last year, most of it from France, according to customs data compiled by Global Trade Information Services in Columbia, S.C. That is much smaller than Chinese exports of solar panels to Europe, which reached $27 billion in 2011 before a combination of trade frictions and cuts in European subsidies to buyers of solar panels started to discourage shipments.
President François Hollande of France called on Wednesday for officials from all 27 countries to meet and form a united position on trade policy toward China, while France's trade ministry labeled the Chinese action as ''reprehensible.''
Threatening to retaliate against fine wines during a trade dispute with the European Union is a time-honored tactic for international trade negotiators. Wine exporters are a powerful political constituency and national figures in some European countries, particularly France. A threat to limit their overseas sales is a way to bypass European leaders and appeal to public sentiment for a reduction in trade tensions.
Mr. De Gucht was already bucking widespread opposition in Europe by taking on Beijing over solar panels, with a range of national politicians and executives from other industries eager to expand -- not curtail -- trade relations with China.
In November 1992, in a dispute over European farm subsidies, the United States announced that it was imposing a 200 percent tax, to take effect in 30 days, on imports of still white wines from Europe, like Chablis from France and riesling from Germany, and a few red wines. The two sides quickly reached a compromise.
Until now, China has tended to pursue retaliatory trade actions against industrial products, including imports of polycrystalline silicon, the main material for solar panels. That material is already the subject of a Chinese trade investigation after the United States imposed antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs totaling about 30 percent on Chinese solar panels.
The Chinese threat against wine imports has the potential to upset consumers in China -- at least some of the most affluent ones. The move may also end up impinging on some Chinese investors because growing wine consumption in China has prompted a surge of investment in French vineyards.
In recent years, Chinese companies and business leaders have snapped up more than three dozen chateaus in Bordeaux, the wine region that has drawn the greatest interest from Chinese drinkers.
The acquisitions involved mostly lesser-known vineyards among the close to 10,000 Bordeaux estates. Many of these properties have struggled in recent years to sell their wine in the traditional markets of Europe.
Under the new Chinese owners, production in some cases is exported entirely to China, where the wine often is marked up substantially. Low-end Bordeaux that might sell for less than 5 euros, or $6.50, in France, might go for five or 10 times as much in China.
Philippe Castéja, president of the Conseil des Crus Classés en 1855, an organization representing elite chateau owners of Bordeaux, said punitive Chinese tariffs could substantially harm the French economy. About 500,000 people in France are employed in the wine industry. About 20,000 of those jobs, he said, are supported by sales to China, directly or indirectly.
''The potential effect is very serious, both in terms of revenue and employment,'' Mr. Castéja said.
As for Mr. De Gucht's wine holdings, according to the personal financial declaration he filed last July as a European Commission official, the estate, called La Macinaia, is a small vineyard and a destination for agricultural tourism, or vacationing in farmhouse resorts.
The business, valued at 1 million euros, lost 145,313 euros in 2011 but still benefited from a small European Union subsidy of 1,500 euros as a ''biodynamic winery,'' according to the declaration by Mr. De Gucht, who is a Belgian and a former president of the Flemish liberal party.
He had a share in the property before he was European Union trade chief, said his spokesman, John Clancy. ''There are no exports to China,'' Mr. Clancy said.
While the Chinese trade case was immediate news in Europe on Wednesday, it drew less attention in China, possibly because the Ministry of Commerce did not release a timetable for its investigation. Western governments have long complained that Chinese antidumping and antisubsidy inquiries are capricious and seem to follow few of the complex but fairly transparent legal procedures used in the West.
Some in China may be able to avoid the higher prices for wine if they are imposed. Hong Kong ended taxes on wine several years ago in a fairly successful bid to become a wine trading hub, and the nearly autonomous territory has become a popular place for many mainlanders to drink, then bring a bottle or two home.
Extra taxes could also help another, more dubious Chinese industry: the entrepreneurs who print fake French labels and slap them on bottles of local plonk, some of it almost undrinkable.

HEADLINE: Kerry Meets With Official Of Venezuela To Set Talks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; William Neuman reported from Caracas, and Randal C. Archibold from Antigua, Guatemala. María Eugenia Díaz contributed reporting from Caracas.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- After months of tensions between the United States and Venezuela, Secretary of State John Kerry met on Wednesday with the Venezuelan foreign minister, Elías Jaua, in Antigua, Guatemala, and announced the start of talks aimed at improving relations between the two countries.
The overture came after another hopeful sign, Venezuela's release from jail and subsequent expulsion of an American documentary filmmaker who had been accused of seeking to undermine the government. The filmmaker, Tim Tracy, was put on a commercial flight to Miami on Wednesday morning. 
''We agreed today, both of us, Venezuela and the United States, that we would like to see our countries find a new way forward, establish a more constructive and positive relationship,'' Mr. Kerry said after meeting with Mr. Jaua on the sideline of a session of the General Assembly of the Organization of American States. American officials said Venezuela had requested the meeting.
Appearing separately, Mr. Jaua said, ''We have faith and confidence that this meeting marks the start of a relationship of respect.''
The two men were photographed shaking hands in what a senior Obama administration official said appeared to be the first public meeting of top officials from the two countries since President Obama and the Venezuelan president at the time, Hugo Chávez, shook hands in a brief encounter at a regional summit meeting in 2009.
Mr. Kerry said the countries had agreed ''that there will be an ongoing and continuing dialogue at a high level'' between the State Department and the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry.
He expressed hope that the countries could ''quickly move to the appointment of ambassadors.'' Mr. Chávez expelled the American ambassador in 2008, accusing the United States of backing a group of military officers plotting a coup against him. In response, the United States expelled the Venezuelan ambassador.
The two countries quietly began similar talks aimed at improving relations late last year, but they ground to a halt a few weeks after Mr. Chávez, a socialist who often made the United States out to be a villain, flew to Cuba in early December for cancer surgery. Mr. Chávez died in March. In April, his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, narrowly won an election to replace him.
In the previous round of talks, the two countries agreed to focus on topics of potential cooperation, including the fight against drug trafficking, and to have the regional head of the Drug Enforcement Administration meet Venezuelan counterparts in Caracas -- a meeting that never occurred.
Mr. Maduro, who is struggling with economic problems and faces great pressures from within Mr. Chávez's movement and from a re-energized opposition, has repeatedly used the United States as a political punching bag and accused it of ties to purported plots to undermine or overthrow his government.
Last month, Mr. Maduro called Mr. Obama ''the big boss of the devils'' and said Mr. Obama planned to provoke violence in Venezuela to have an excuse to intervene.
On the day Mr. Chávez died, Mr. Maduro expelled two military attaches at the American Embassy, saying they were trying to destabilize the country. He has speculated that the United States may have found a way to cause Mr. Chávez's cancer.
In April, the Maduro government arrested Mr. Tracy, the filmmaker, accusing him of being a spy seeking to set off a civil war in Venezuela by funneling money to student protesters. It never made public any evidence to support the charges against Mr. Tracy, who said he had come to Venezuela to make a documentary about the country's political divide.
In a television interview last month, Mr. Obama called the accusations ''ridiculous.'' Mr. Kerry on Wednesday called Mr. Tracy's release ''a very positive development.''
The Venezuelan interior minister, Miguel Rodríguez Torres, said Mr. Maduro had ordered Mr. Tracy's expulsion.

HEADLINE: Beyond the 'Palace,' an International Tour in One City

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
VENICE -- Dark weather and high water were the backdrop to the start of the 55th Venice Biennale, an event that predictably combines enough cold cash and hot air to create a storm system of critical opinion. The main barometric indicator is always the big show that gives each Biennale its theme, and on this score, for the first time in years, there's fairly smooth sailing.
The main show, ''The Encyclopedic Palace'' -- organized by Massimiliano Gioni, 39, chief curator at the New Museum in Manhattan and this Biennale's director -- is a quiet success. Spread over two sites, in the park called the Giardini and the fortresslike Arsenale nearby, it's immense, with more than 150 artists, but as tightly thought out as a small show -- maybe too tightly to allow for wild-card surprises. Most shows on this scale are too messy; this one may be too neat. But it works.
Plus -- a significant plus for anyone fed up to here with big-buck art -- ''Palace'' doesn't seem to have much interest in the mainstream market. It doesn't say no to it, exactly. It just goes its own interesting way, not without problems. 
And of course, the show is not the whole story. The Biennale is as much an archipelago of islands as Venice itself is.
Clustered around the main exhibition are dozens of national pavilions, each with an exhibition of its own, with more pavilions scattered around town in premises -- churches and palazzi -- more interesting than any on the Biennale grounds. Nearly 50 ''collateral events,'' semiofficially part of the Biennale, must be included in any comprehensive tour.
The total is overwhelming, but equipped with decent shoes and multiday vaporetto pass, I saw roughly 80 percent of this year's sights on a trek that took me through most of city, always the Biennale's real attraction.
Mr. Gioni titled his exhibition after a single piece of art, an 11-foot-high tower built by the self-taught artist Marino Auriti. Born in Italy in 1891, Auriti moved to the United States in the 1920s, settling in Kennett Square, Pa., where he ran an auto body shop while painting on the side.
After retiring in the 1950s, he began work on the tower, a stack of seven cylindrical layers surrounded by a colonnaded piazza, constructed of wood, glass and plastic (including hair combs). He conceived it as a model for a museum to be called the Encyclopedic Palace of the World, which would display the range of human achievement, ''from the wheel to the satellite.''
He also made it a monument to ethical values, spelled out on the colonnade entablatures: ''Live by your work,'' ''Make friends of your enemies,'' ''Watch that you don't become greedy.'' He wanted the museum to be erected on the Mall in Washington, took out a patent on it, even initiated a fund-raising campaign.
Mr. Gioni has placed Auriti's dream tower up front in the Arsenale as a key to what follows: art that embodies utopian and dystopian visions; or attempts to encompass and categorize vast amounts of data; or is composed of many small and repeated parts.
Among works that qualify are paintings by the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, who claimed to receive her images from otherworldly beings. A video by the young French artist Camille Henrot jams the entire creation story into one short, percussively edited video. A set of 130 small clay sculptures made by the Swiss artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss cover a period of 30 years.
Although Mr. Gioni includes several young artists on the rise -- Ed Atkins, Helen Marten, Paloma Polo, James Richards, Shinichi Sawada -- he also chooses some offbeat figures, like the nature photographer Eliot Porter, and brings in spiritual utilitarian objects like Tantric paintings and Roman Catholic ex-votos that were not created to be art in the conventional sense.
In combining these things, Mr. Gioni refers to the model of the ''wunderkammer,'' or cabinet of curiosities, collections of uncategorizable, often exotic objects first assembled in Renaissance Europe. This concept is not original, and it gets tricky when, as here, some curiosities are works by ''outsider artists,'' which can simply mean self-taught, but often implies having some form of physical, social or psychiatric disability.
The outsider art concept is tired by now, even ethically suspect, the equivalent of ''primitive art'' from decades ago. Mr. Gioni finesses the problem without really addressing it by integrating outsider-ish-looking inside art (there's more and more of this around) so the two designations get blurred.
However you label them, it's great to see in one place outsider pieces like the embroidery-encrusted vestments of the Brazilian Arthur Bispo do Rosario and the paper and twine sculptures of the American James Castle together with out-of-the-mainstream art like the copper-wire paintings by Prabhavathi Meppayil from Bangalore, and the thickly collaged notebooks of the Japanese noise-rock musician Shinro Ohtake. That they're elbow to elbow with Bruce Nauman, Charles Ray, Cindy Sherman, Rosemarie Trockel and Jack Whitten is nice too.
Ms. Sherman is here as guest curator of a minishow embedded within Mr. Gioni's larger one, but so much in its spirit as to be indistinguishable as a separate entity. Ms. Trockel is represented by components from the exhibition ''A Cosmos,'' from the New Museum.
She's an artist I admire, but I found that show surprisingly unsurprising.
With a blend of insider-outsider and art-nonart components, it could have been stimulating. But the objects had little to say to one another. I feel a lack of surprise in Mr. Gioni's show for the opposite reason: Its pairings -- spiritualists paintings by af Klint and Emma Kunz, digital-printer abstractions by Alice Channer and Wade Guyton -- are too neat and museumy.
Yet at the same time, the show's curatorial line is so firm, its choice of artists so strong and its pacing so expert that you are carried along, and ultimately rewarded. This is particularly true toward the conclusion of the Arsenale, with its purgatory of sculptures by Pawel Althamer, followed by Ryan Trecartin's video hell, followed by Walter De Maria's Minimalist heaven. It's a great end to a serious, standard-setting endeavor.
Once outside, you're in a world of hit and miss among the national pavilions, which tend to be high in polish, low in impact. Some of the best extend the accumulative density of Mr. Gioni's show. This is true of Sarah Sze's assemblages of countless tiny found things in the United States pavilion, and of archival photographic installations by Petra Feriancova at the pavilion of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
There are persuasive alternatives to material density. In the otherwise empty Romania pavilion, Alexandra Pirici and Manuel Pelmus have directed performers in stylized enactments of art from Biennales past. The work owes much to the example of Tino Sehgal, but it has its own charms. (Mr. Sehgal, who is in Mr. Gioni's show, received the Gold Lion award for best artist this year.)
Three young artists, Ei Arakawa, Gela Patashuri and Sergei Tcherepnin, make similarly interactive use the Georgia pavilion, a temporary, raised, loftlike enclosure at the edge the Arsenale for more sporadic performances. And Alfredo Jaar's show at the Chile pavilion is centered around a sculpture that moves, an exact model of the Giardini campus that emerges from and sinks back into a vat of fetid-looking water.
Mr. Jaar is telling a story about the alignment of art and power: Many of the older, pre-World War II pavilions are relics of a murderous nationalism were built as cultural trophies by economically competitive nations that created colonial empires and eventually led Europe into war.
This show is filled with narratives. Everything seems to have a back story, many of them politically inflected. Tavares Strachan's entrancing installation at the Bahamas pavilion tells of exploration and who really got where first.
At the Lebanon pavilion, a film by Akram Zaatari fleshes out a real-life account of an Israeli Air Force fighter who, in 1982, was sent to destroy a building in a Lebanese town, recognized the place as a school and dropped his bombs into the sea. And in a church converted into an exhibition space, a group of dioramas installed in a church dramatize, in exacting detail, the ordeal that artist Ai Weiwei underwent in police custody in China.
This notable display, technically a collateral event, is not far from the Arsenale but hard to find. Others are long walks or boat rides away, but worth tracking down. An Iraq pavilion is an informal affair up the Grand Canal. You're invited to relax, read up on Iraq, have tea. And the artists, based in Babylon, Basra and Baghdad, are terrific, from Abdul Raheem Yassir, who has been producing mordant political cartoons since 1970, to the two-man collective called WAMI (Hashin Taeeh and Yaseen Wami), which produces ingenious furniture from cardboard boxes.
Without biennales we would probably never see shows of such art, made under truly challenging conditions. And without such shows, we would never see so many of Venice's varied interiors, from sports arenas (the Cyprus and Lithuania pavilions), to commercial galleries (the Kosovo pavilion), to the National Archaeological Museum, where work by the Cuban-American artist María Magdalena Campos-Pons sits amid Roman sculptures.
Every now and then, a visit gives a shock.
When I climbed the stairs of an old building to the Angola pavilion, I couldn't believe my eyes. Gorgeous photographs by Edson Chagas, from the city of Luanda, were there, in neat stacks of giveaway prints. And the walls around them were lined with Renaissance paintings: Sassetta, Bernardo Daddi, Botticelli and Piero di Cosimo. I and Angola were in the Palazzo Cini, a private museum that, except during the Biennale, keeps eccentric hours.
Mr. Chagas worked perfectly into the setting. (The pavilion, with his installation, was later awarded best of show.)
He and the young curators, Paula Nascimento and Stefano Rabolli Pansera, had keyed colors in the photographs to the paintings: a stack of prints of a blue-painted Luanda door stood in front of a blue-robed Botticelli Virgin. Neither blue was more beautiful than the other, but the African blue was soaked in sunlight. And I could take it away. It made my Venice stay.

HEADLINE: Genetically Altered Wheat in Oregon Comes as No Surprise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
One week after the revelation that an Oregon farmer had found genetically engineered wheat growing in his fields, scientists remain mystified over how the strain -- apparently the remains of a test crop shut down a dozen years ago -- got there.
But few are surprised. Even with extensive precautions, gene-altered plants turn up in unwanted places regularly enough that farmers have come to consider a few of them weeds, and even a threat to their livelihood. 
And while none of them yet poses any known public health hazard, experts say the boom in so-called transgenic crops should prompt even more careful evaluation of future varieties with an eye to the prospect that they, too, could eventually appear elsewhere.
In the case of the wheat found in Oregon, most experts say, all those prospects are remote. The experimental wheat was created and tested by the Monsanto Company to be resistant to its best-selling Roundup herbicide, and similarly Roundup-resistant varieties of corn, soybeans and other crops are widely grown with no known health effects.
In a telephone news briefing on Wednesday, Monsanto officials called the appearance of the altered wheat ''a random isolated occurrence'' and said there was no evidence that the wheat had moved beyond the single farm or that its seeds were in the seed stocks that the farmer used to plant his fields.
Nor is the Monsanto wheat likely to spread elsewhere, most experts say. The plants found in Oregon, which the company said covered less than 1 percent of the farmer's 125 acres, are the only ones found anywhere since Monsanto abandoned plans to sell modified seeds in 2004.
As with most transgenic plants, the wheat could have transferred its engineered trait to ordinary wheat via its pollen, which contains the single gene for herbicide resistance. That gene is dominant, meaning plants fertilized by the Monsanto wheat's pollen would likely pass the Roundup-tolerant trait to future generations.
But while plants like corn fertilize each other, spreading their pollen far and wide by winds, butterflies or bees, wheat plants generally fertilize only themselves. Moreover, wheat pollen rapidly loses its potency once it leaves the plant.
''A transgene that comes up in corn could be a much different situation,'' Kendall Lamkey, the chairman of Iowa State University's agronomy department, said in an interview. ''Corn pollen can travel, under the right conditions, a great distance,'' he said. But with wheat, he said, ''The gene's unlikely to be moving to other varieties in any significant way.''
When a gene does move to other varieties, however, the potential for mischief can be considerable.
Consider the benchmark example: in 1998, Aventis CropScience, a Swiss company now known as Bayer CropScience, won federal approval to sell a strain of corn called StarLink altered to produce a pesticide that kills insect larvae. After scientists found a moderate possibility that the strain could trigger allergic reactions in some people, the government registered the corn for use only in animal feed and biofuels, and imposed safeguards to keep it out of the food processing chain.
At its peak, StarLink corn was grown on less than half of a percent of all the corn acreage in the United States. Yet by September 2000, it was discovered in corn taco shells, triggering a huge recall, tests on more than four billion bushels of corn and the cancellation of StarLink's federal registration.
Such dire consequences are rare, but not unheard of. A group representing more than a thousand organic farmers in Saskatchewan complained in 2002 that gene transfers from canola that had been genetically engineered to tolerate herbicides had contaminated their fields. That made it impossible to certify their canola as wholly natural, costing the farmers $10 million, the group stated.
Nature is hardly the only culprit in genetic transfers. Farmers can accidentally mix bags of natural and modified seed. Combines that harvest a gene-altered crop can pick up its seeds, then drop them while harvesting a field of natural plants.
Both farmers and manufacturers alike employ measures like putting buffer zones around fields, to limit the risk that genetic material will cross from altered crops to natural ones. But many experts say that the myriad ways that seed and genes can be spread make that possibility substantial.
The real question, they say, is how much that matters.
Absent any proven health threat, the most common fear is economic -- that organic farmers will lose crops, or that food exports to countries that ban imports of gene-altered products will suffer. The Oregon incident instantly raised fears that the United States' $8 billion annual wheat trade would be hard hit, although the strain of winter wheat at issue makes up only a fraction of those exports.
But a 2010 report on genetically engineered crops by the National Research Council noted that genes can pass not only from an altered plant to its natural brother, but to less close relatives in the wild. ''Such hybridization is common in plants generally and is a key process for the evolution of new plant species,'' the report stated.
Concerns about transfers to the wild already had stalled approvals of genetically altered crops like sunflowers and rice. During tests in Oregon of a pesticide-tolerant bentgrass in 2003, ''introgression of the transgene into weedy populations was detected at a considerable distance from the test sites,'' the report stated.
That is also a potential problem with genetically modified wheat, said the chairman of the group that prepared the report, David E. Ervin, an environmental management professor at Portland State University in Oregon.
''There has always been a worry with wheat, being in the grass family,'' he said. He added that if there were a transfer of the gene into grasses, ''There's going to be difficulty in controlling those grasses, and you might have to resort to stronger herbicide treatments, some of which have more environmental consequences.''
That underscores the need for caution in approving new varieties of altered plants, he said, adding: ''All bets are off when you start introducing new kinds of crops. That we haven't had any serious events to this point doesn't mean we won't have significant risk of them occurring in the future.''

HEADLINE: Top Hotels Look to Their Next Frontier

BYLINE: By MIKE IVES

 BODY:
LIJIANG, China -- Tourists from China's crowded coasts have long considered this city of 1.2 million in the Himalayan foothills to be a scenic getaway.
Its hotel choices are still predominantly low- and mid-range properties, but a few of the world's top luxury hotel brands are putting the final touches on properties here in hopes of attracting the country's growing ranks of extremely wealthy travelers.
As economic growth has slowed in Europe and the United States, Asian locations now dominate lists of the current and projected hot spots for luxury hotel and resort growth. And Asia-based planners from leading luxury hotel groups say China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, is the top regional priority.
''There are several hot spots there because China is so massive,'' said David Spooner, vice president of sales and marketing at Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts, which opened Lijiang's first international-standard luxury property in 2006. And, he added, the country's luxury sector is flourishing because ''a growing market of Chinese travelers is much more sophisticated.'' 
In April, 253 of the 458 branded luxury hotel projects under construction or in the final planning stages were in the Asia-Pacific region, according to STR Global, a hotel research company.
And of all such Asia-Pacific projects -- branded and independent, and across all economic categories -- 58 percent were in China, the company said.
China will not be the only driver of Asia's future luxury hotel growth. Top-end hotel brands say they are expanding in India's cities and southwestern region, and that there is considerable buzz about Sri Lanka and Myanmar, countries where, until recently, unrest and political issues had limited visits by international travelers.
''Myanmar, at least medium to long term, has the potential to be a top tourism destination that could rival Thailand,'' said Michel Van der Hoeven, senior vice president of projects and development at Anantara Hotels, Resorts & Spas, a luxury hotel group based in Bangkok with properties in Asia and the Middle East. ''It has amazing culture, it has natural beauty, it has heritage -- what's lacking there is good-quality properties.''
The country has just two luxury hotels, both in Yangon: The Governor's Residence, an Orient-Express property, and The Strand, which is operated by Myanmar Hotels International, a joint venture of the government's Tourism Ministry and Strand Hotels International.
But there are several high-end resorts in the central city of Bagan that could potentially qualify as luxury properties, said Jonas Ogren, Asia director at STR Global. And industry experts say the country's undeveloped islands offer immense potential, although construction is likely to be several years away at best.
They also say destinations in Bhutan and Laos are beginning to attract interest among luxury hotel groups, as are Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and undeveloped islands in Indonesia and the Philippines.
But the industry's primary focus is on China.
''China is obviously a key market for us,'' said Chris Hart, president of Asia-Pacific hotel operations at Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. ''I think eventually we will have as many hotels in China as we do in the United States.''
The group, which manages 31 U.S. properties, now has five in mainland China, with a sixth to open this year in Shenzhen and another under construction in Tianjin, a city of 10 million southeast of Beijing.
Mr. Hart said the company, which is based in Canada, was expanding across China partly to expose its citizens to the brand and encourage them to stay in other Four Seasons properties.
The number of annual overseas trips by Chinese travelers has risen to 83 million last year from 10 million in 2000, according to the U.N. World Tourism Organization. And their 2012 spending on international tourism -- $102 billion -- helped China overtake Germany to become the world's largest source of tourism spending.
''We want to be their first choice when they go on vacation, whether to the Maldives or to Paris or New York,'' Mr. Hart said.
While Beijing and Shanghai already have well-developed luxury hotel markets, they still can accommodate more growth -- especially boutique properties with 80 to 150 rooms, said Damien Little, Asia director at Horwath HTL, an international hotel and tourism consulting firm.
Mr. Little said there are already luxury hotels in the coastal cities of Hangzhou and Suzhou, destinations that appeal to tourists with a picturesque lake and traditional gardens, respectively.
And some luxury brands -- including Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton and Kempinski -- are operating in Sanya, a tropical resort destination on Hainan Island in the South China Sea that has been developing for more than 20 years.
But when it comes to luxury and mid-range hotels, ''much of China's development has been urban-related, and Sanya's really the only significant leisure-slash-resort destination that's developed to any great scale in the last decade,'' Mr. Little said.
The lure of China's wealth now has major luxury brands wading into second-tier cities that are not typically regarded as tourist magnets. Ritz-Carlton, for example, is planning to open hotels soon in Tianjin as well as Chengdu, a city of 14 million in the southwestern province of Sichuan. And Fairmont and Kempinski will soon be established in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, a northern province known for its coal mines.
Andrew Hirst, Asia operations manager at Mandarin Oriental, said luxury hotels in China's second-tier cities are beginning to cater to leisure travelers as well as those on business trips. As the economy grows, people are ''getting wealthy and wanting to enjoy the better things in life,'' he said.
And China's scenic areas and hot springs are said to be promising destinations for luxury brands. Mr. Little of Horwath HTL said the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan were the primary hot spots in that emerging market.
In Yunnan, Banyan Tree operates two resorts and is planning to open two more next year. Aman and St. Regis say they plan to open their first Lijiang locations in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Anantara opened in southern Yunnan in February.
When Banyan Tree Lijiang opened in 2006, about 80 percent to 90 percent of its guests were international tourists, but since 2008 more than 70 percent have been wealthy Chinese, many of them business executives and their relatives from the major coastal cities, said the hotel manager, Jeff Wang.
The resort, which includes 84 villas and 42 suites, lies inside a walled compound on the city's unassuming outskirts and was built mostly from stone. The interiors are decorated in bold reds and blacks -- in keeping with the vernacular architecture of the Naxi, a local ethnic minority group.
On a recent Sunday evening, the grounds were quiet as Zhang Gang, a construction executive from Zhuhai, a city near Macau on China's southern coast, ordered mushroom soup at one of the resort's restaurants.
Mr. Zhang, 40, said he would much rather pay 18,365 renminbi, or $3,000, per night for a Banyan Tree villa than stay in Lijiang's touristy Old Town and endure 4,290 renminbi-per-night hotels, which he said are cramped and noisy.
''They weren't my style, but here I feel at peace,'' he said in an empty dining room. The view was of an open-air pagoda framing the snow-capped peaks of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, Lijiang's signature landscape feature.
Mr. Zhang said he expected the resort to prosper as the Chinese elite grow even wealthier, in part because Lijiang is an appealing destination for avid golfers like himself. His only complaint was that Banyan Tree has no locations in North America, where he owns a second home and often travels on business.

HEADLINE: Multinational Corporations' Support for Big Banks Is Not Persuasive

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The notion that the United States would better regulate big banks by conforming to European standards, as the Business Roundtable has suggested, is wrongheaded, an economist writes 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
Large multinational nonfinancial companies waded into the debate over too-big-to-fail financial institutions this week, coming down strongly on the side of very large global banks. Specifically, the Business Roundtable, a group representing big nonfinancial companies, sent a letter to the leadership of the House Financial Services Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee arguing in favor of including financial services in any potential new trade agreement with Europe (known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, pronounced T-tip).
The rationale is that "the negotiations will provide an opportunity to address market access barriers that keep U.S. businesses from enjoying full opportunities in Europe." 
And the letter comes from the International Engagement Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee of the Business Roundtable, a distinguished group of executives. It will carry weight.
There are three reasons to worry a great deal about the thinking behind this intervention: the motivation, the facts and the implications for our ability to limit systemic risks.
First, the explicit intention of this letter includes resisting further attempts at strengthening cap requirements for the United States financial system, like the legislation proposed by Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. The letter includes this statement:
The "Brown-Vitter" legislation and other contemplated proposals threaten to place significant new burdens on the largest U.S. banks, unilaterally imposing a new regulatory regime while leaving E.U. financial institutions unaffected.

The reasoning is that higher capital requirements would hurt American banks and therefore hurt nonfinancial activity:
The end result of these proposals would be to give large European and Asian financial institutions a serious advantage against their U.S. competitors, while increasing regulatory dissonance between the United States and the E.U.
The implication, as I read the letter, is that the United States should tie itself more closely to European banking practices, on capital and regulation more generally.
But the point of the Brown-Vitter proposal is precisely to make the financial system safer, by requiring larger buffers of loss absorbing equity financing. As Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig point out in their book, "The Bankers' New Clothes," more equity reduces the risk of financial distress. Financial crises cause huge damage to the nonfinancial sector, and this is exactly what happened in 2008 and the years that followed.
Ask yourself this question: had the United States more fully adopted Basel II - the international capital standards preferred by Europe - in the run-up to 2007, would its problems now be bigger or smaller? Under Basel II, banks were allowed to have less equity funding and more leverage (i.e., more debt relative to their balance sheets). Thank goodness that Sheila Bair and her colleagues at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation resisted efforts by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and others to fully adopt the European way of calculating and regulating capital.
Unfortunately, leading nonfinancial corporate voices seem to have forgotten that lesson.
Second, there is a problem with the basic facts in the Roundtable letter. These representatives of big nonfinancial companies assert that if, for example, American banks were forced to become smaller, this would put American nonfinancial companies at a disadvantage relative to European and Asian nonfinancial companies.
The United States is home to only three of the largest 20 global banks, ranked by total assets; if those banks were significantly downsized or altered via these proposals, European and Asian competitors would be much better positioned to handle major, complex global transactions that smaller, regional U.S. financial institutions simply cannot handle.
But if big banks are measured on a comparable basis - for example, by converting American balance sheets from GAAP (the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, used in the United States for financial reporting) to the International Financial Reporting Standards, or I.F.R.S., used in Europe - the United States has the largest three banks in the world (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup).
Differences in accounting standards may sound technical, but this is just about comparing apples to apples. Thomas Hoenig, vice chairman of the F.D.I.C., has done a great service by providing the numbers on this basis. I agree with Mr. Hoenig that I.F.R.S. is the best basis for this comparison.
Asked for its sources and definitions, the Business Roundtable responded with a statement that said it used "conventional industry rankings," which I believe are flawed.
Measured properly, JPMorgan Chase is already much larger than its nearest foreign competition (a balance sheet of nearly $4 trillion, compared with the largest European banks, which are under $3 trillion) and Bank of America is nearly as big. If JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are pressured to shrink to the level of their European competitors, what exactly would the broader American economy lose?
Third, consider the deeper logic implied in the Business Roundtable letter. The euro-zone economy is a mess, and its financial sector is a disaster - in part because equity capital fell to dangerous levels and has not been rebuilt, and in part because the European regulatory and private-sector application of "risk weights" has completely broken down. Sovereign debt within the euro zone is still considered to be low or zero risk, despite all that we have observed over the last five years.
The idea that the United States should associate itself more closely with this completely failed approach to bank regulation boggles the mind.
If financial services are included in TTIP, this would completely tie the hands of American regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the F.D.I.C.
Existing international agreements - for example, the Basel III accord on capital - are not good, but at least these only set a floor on what American regulators can do. And the latest indications are that the Fed - with much prodding from the F.D.I.C. - will set a limit on financial-institution leverage that is lower (i.e., a tougher restriction on how much such companies can borrow) than required under Basel.
But if such details were put into a trade agreement, in all likelihood a ceiling would be set on bank equity capital, severely limiting the ability of American officials to respond to financial risks as they materialize. The Federal Reserve, among others, should resist strenuously any attempt to include financial services in TTIP.
It is with good reason that capital requirements and core regulatory issues for financial services are not usually part of such trade agreements. The nonfinancial sector - along with everyone else - really does not need big banks to blow themselves up along European lines at any point in the foreseeable future.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times 

        
The Obama administration is keeping mum about whether it is using a controversial provision in the Patriot Act to collect data about business communications involving Americans, after the program was disclosed in a court order on Wednesday evening. Charlie Savage and Edward Wyatt write that many questions about the scope and duration of the program remain unanswered, and its disclosure comes as the Obama administration faces criticism for using aggressive tactics to pursue leaks of classified information.
 

        
By elevating Susan E. Rice to national security adviser and Samantha Power to replace her as ambassador to the United Nations, President Obama has put two outspoken advocates of intervention in humanitarian crises on a national security team known for its cautious approach to conflicts abroad, Mark Landler writes.

        
In his second-term appointments and nominations, Mr. Obama is showing a willingness to offend Republicans with his selections as he tries to balance his newfound freedom from re-election concerns with a desire to forge bipartisan deals, Peter Baker observes.

        
Ashley Parker recalls the Congressional career of Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, as he becomes the longest-serving member of the House when he serves his 20,997th day on Friday.

        
In the continuing battle over who should have access to emergency contraception, the Obama administration is considering how to respond to a federal appeals court's orders on Wednesday to make two-pill versions of emergency contraception available to women of all ages without a prescription or sales restrictions, Pam Belluck and Michael D. Shear report.

        
Sabrina Tavernise explains that a federal panel's recommendation for the government to collect better data on guns to help researchers understand the impact of firearms faces opposition from gun advocates reluctant to accept more reporting requirements and a Congress seeking budget cuts.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
Economic reports expected Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 a.m. by weekly mortgage rates.

        
At 9:30 a.m., the House Committee on Ways and Means will hold a hearing on the "spending culture and conference abuses" at the Internal Revenue Service, with testimony from Daniel I. Werfel, the acting commissioner of the agency; the head of its small business and self-employment division; and two Treasury inspectors general.

        
At 10 a.m., Interior Secretary Sally Jewell will make her first appearance before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources since she was confirmed in April, as the panel examines her agency's programs and activities.

        
At the same time, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and the Justice Department's inspector general are expected to testify before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee at a budget hearing for the agency.

        
At 10:30 a.m., environmental experts and officials will update the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on environmental restoration in the Gulf of Mexico three years after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

        
Michael Froman, the president's pick to become the next United States trade representative, will testify when the Senate Finance Committee takes up his nomination at 11 a.m.

HEADLINE: From Blankfein, a Horatio Alger Story for New Graduates

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: In a commencement address to graduating students of LaGuardia Community College, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs drew on his own journey &#8211; from a housing project in Brooklyn to the top of one of Wall Street&#8217;s mightiest firms &#8211; to offer life advice. 

 BODY:
Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive and chairman of Goldman Sachs, tried out a new role on Thursday: inspirational speaker.
In a commencement address to graduating students of LaGuardia Community College, Mr. Blankfein drew on his own journey - from a housing project in Brooklyn to the top of one of Wall Street's mightiest firms - to offer life advice.
"My struggle to get to and through college turned out to be an advantage for me," Mr. Blankfein said in his speech in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. "The disadvantages you have had become part of your personal history and track record, all advantages in your later life. So confidence is justified." 
 The speech was the latest example of the public relations recovery that Goldman Sachs has undertaken in recent months. Pilloried in the news media and on Capitol Hill in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs and its leader have recently been making efforts to show their softer side.
In that vein, Goldman chose LaGuardia in 2010 as a partner in the firm's 10,000 Small Businesses program, which aims to train entrepreneurs. In a statement, Gail O. Mellow, president of LaGuardia, which is part of the City University of New York system, called Mr. Blankfein a "stalwart supporter of small businesses and community colleges."
Mr. Blankfein, dressed in a black academic robe with a pink-fringed hood, slipped comfortably into an avuncular role on Thursday, delivering the message that life is unpredictable and success comes from persistence.
"What are the chances that a kid from the projects would run one of the great financial institutions in the world?" Mr. Blankfein said, a velvet tam and gold tassel atop his head. "You just never know."
"You have the ambition, you have the smarts and you have the toughness," he said. "So, turn the page on your biography - you have just started a new chapter in your lives."
The Goldman chief recalled his upbringing in the East New York section of Brooklyn, where his father sorted mail for the post office and his mother worked as a receptionist at a burglar alarm company. Looking back, he said, it was a "world of unlimited opportunity."
But at the time, he wanted to get out. The young Mr. Blankfein was accepted to Harvard, which struck him as an "intimidating place." He felt "insecure," he said.
He did not find his footing right away. After Harvard Law School, Mr. Blankfein went to work at a law firm but quit when he found he was not passionate about the work. He eventually landed at J. Aron, a small financial firm that was bought by Goldman Sachs. 
In tone, Mr. Blankfein's speech was different from one delivered in 2009 by the No. 2 at Goldman, Gary D. Cohn, at the Kogod School of Business at American University.
"You are competing. Every day you are competing and every day you are playing to win," Mr. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman, said in a commencement address given not long after the financial crisis. "So remember, wake up every morning and figure out how to win."
In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Blankfein emphasized the importance of loving one's work. He has observed a certain passion in other chief executives, he said.
"While they may be wealthy and powerful, their passion goes beyond money and power," Mr. Blankfein said. "I won't stand here and tell you those are bad things. They can be pretty good, but only if you have a larger purpose in mind."

HEADLINE: Former Interior Secretary Salazar Joins WilmerHale

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ken Salazar, who recently stepped down as Interior Secretary, is joining WilmerHale as a partner, the law firm announced on Thursday. 

 BODY:
Ken Salazar, who recently stepped down as interior secretary, is joining WilmerHale as a partner, the law firm announced on Thursday.
Mr. Salazar, a Colorado native who was named head of the Interior Department at the start of the Obama administration, will anchor WilmerHale's planned office in Denver. In his new job, he will advise clients on matters of law, business and public policy. 
Before leading the Interior Department, Mr. Salazar represented Colorado in the Senate starting in 2005. He was Colorado's attorney general before going to Washington. A graduate of Colorado College, Mr. Salazar received his law degree from the University of Michigan.
"I look forward to leading WilmerHale's entry into the Rocky Mountain region, which is integral to the growing national and global economy," Mr. Salazar said in a statement. 
Mr. Salazar is the latest retired politician to take a senior position at a law firm. On Thursday, Joseph I. Lieberman, the former Connecticut senator and vice presidential nominee, said he had started at the law firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman. Others to follow a similar path include Scott Brown, who joined Nixon Peabody in Boston after losing a Senate race, and Jon Kyl of Arizona, who joined Covington & Burling.
In September, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that its vice chairman, Stephen Luparello, was joining WilmerHale in Washington.
At WilmerHale, Mr. Salazar "adds to the firm's rich tradition of lawyers who have served at the highest levels of government," Robert Novick, the law firm's co-managing partner, said in a statement.
Mr. Salazar, a blunt-spoken rancher, took over the Interior Department when it was riddled with scandal. His greatest setback, the BP oil spill that exposed flaws in the agency, came near the beginning of his tenure.
"I've had a glorious and joyful run," Mr. Salazar told The New York Times in April. "Coming to work, I've just been living the dream every day."

HEADLINE: Despite Tax Rules, Companies Stick With U.S.

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Two new papers help explain why nearly all new companies with headquarters in the United states choose to incorporate and pay tax here. 

 BODY:
The tactics that multinational companies like Apple, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard use to avoid paying corporate income taxes might make one wonder why they incorporate in the United States in the first place. Why not Ireland?
Advocates of a territorial-based tax system often point out that taxing United States companies on their worldwide income creates an incentive for new companies to incorporate abroad instead. Many countries tax income earned only within their borders. The United States, by contrast, purports to tax companies on their worldwide income, with credits for any foreign taxes paid.
It's easy to incorporate as a foreign company even if a company is truly based in the United States. According to the tax code, residency is determined by a company's place of legal incorporation, not by the location of its headquarters, employees or activities. A company that is incorporated in Delaware or California must pay corporate income tax in the United States, regardless of the size of its operations here. 
A company that is legally incorporated abroad - say, in Ireland or the Cayman Islands - has to pay tax in the United States only on income derived from United States sources. The sourcing rules are notoriously complicated, but they often understate the extent to which a company actually earns money here. 
Because corporate residence is, in effect, elective, it is surprising that nearly all new companies with headquarters here elect to incorporate in the United States and pay tax here. 
Two new papers by a University of Texas law professor, Susan Morse, help explain why. The first, "Tax Haven Incorporation for U.S.-Headquartered Firms: No Exodus Yet," with Eric Allen of the University of Southern California, confirms that new companies are not avoiding the United States in favor of tax havens. Among 918 new companies identified as multinationals with headquarters in the United States, just 27 were legally incorporated in tax havens. 
Why no exodus yet? In a second paper, Professor Morse takes the perspective of a new company with global ambitions and interviews founders, lawyers and investors in Silicon Valley about how they make the decision about where to incorporate. 
The first reason is hiding in plain sight. Because the United States corporate income tax is so leaky, the benefits of avoiding it are smaller than they would appear to be in theory. For technology companies in particular, multinationals based here can obtain low effective tax rates on foreign income. Professor Morse reports estimates of effective tax rates of 3 percent to 6 percent a year on this foreign income.
And, as Apple and others have demonstrated, it is often possible to shift economic income from the United States to tax havens abroad, further reducing tax liability here. 
The second reason is that there continue to be significant nontax advantages to incorporating in the United States. Incorporating in Delaware is fast, easy and cheap. Venture capitalists and other investors like the security and predictability of Delaware law, and companies can rely on United States courts to enforce intellectual property rights. Minority investors might be nervous about enforcing their contractual and shareholder rights in a court in Bermuda, British Virgin Islands or Ireland.
We can also learn something by studying the companies that do incorporate abroad. Professor Morse explains that a significant number of these companies are insurance carriers, which benefit from an "extremely favorable" set of tax rules that support incorporating in Bermuda. Insurance premiums collected in the United States and paid to a Bermuda parent are subject neither to income tax nor the usual withholding tax that would apply to such payments. Instead, they are subject to an excise tax of 4 percent or less. 
Nontax legal factors, which normally favor the United States, can also sometimes drive companies to legally organize abroad. Commercial shipping companies, passenger cruise lines and online gambling sites are three examples. Other decisions to incorporate abroad appear to be driven by historical links with foreign jurisdictions. 
What remains unclear from the research is what would happen if the United States tightened its international tax rules and eliminated deferral of foreign earnings. The nontax factors, or frictions, that encourage incorporation in the United States are substantial but not limitless. I wouldn't walk across a hot sidewalk in bare feet to pick up a nickel, but I might do it for a $20 bill.
For a time, increasing numbers of British companies were incorporating in Jersey (as in the Channel Islands, not the shore) and moving corporate headquarters to Dublin to avoid high British taxes. In the United States, "anti-inversion" rules make it difficult for existing companies to reincorporate abroad. But no legal rule prevents start-ups from incorporating in Ireland, Bermuda or other havens.
Silicon Valley start-ups, known for being nimble and innovative, are remarkably stodgy when it comes to legal matters. Professor Morse points out that start-up founders rarely have more than a few thousand dollars to spend on legal fees, and it would cost thousands more to set up a parent company in a foreign tax haven. It is only a matter of time, however, before the global legal marketplace makes it easier, faster and cheaper for start-ups to incorporate abroad. Our best hope is that if patching our international tax rules makes incorporating abroad more attractive, founders and venture capitalists continue to focus on the short-term costs of legal innovation instead of the long-term benefits of tax avoidance.
For further readings, see Susan C. Morse, Startup Ltd., Florida Tax Review (forthcoming), and Eric Allen & Susan Morse, Tax Haven Incorporation for U.S.-Headquartered Firms: No Exodus Yet, 66 National Tax Journal (forthcoming).
For further discussion of why nontax business considerations often lead firms to organize as corporations instead of partnerships, see Victor Fleischer, The Rational Exuberance of Structuring Venture Capital Start-Ups, 57 Tax Law Review 137 (2004).

HEADLINE: Handicapping May's Job Numbers

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The monthly employment report due Friday may be disappointing &#8212; because of strange weather, the sequester and a pattern in initial data releases of understating changes in the numbers. 

 BODY:
 6:30 p.m. | Updated to include new data from a New York Times/CBS News poll. 
The much-anticipated May jobs report comes out Friday morning at 8:30, and economists are expecting more of the same: a gain of about 165,000 jobs - the same number added in April - and a flat unemployment rate of 7.5 percent.
Many economists have warned that there may be risks to the downside, though, given a steady stream of disappointing economic data over the last few weeks. The construction spending numbers, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index and the ADP employment report all came in below expectations. Talk of a "spring swoon" is resurfacing. 
"In general, the economy is just puttering along," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR Inc. "Companies can get by without hiring people, so they do. I don't see any reason to break out of the pattern this month."
Consumers themselves have been pretty upbeat nonetheless, according to recent polling data. 
In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted May 31-June 4, 39 percent of respondents said that the condition of the economy these days was very or fairly good, the highest share saying this both since President Obama took office and even since the recession officially began in December 2007. About a third of respondents said that the economy is getting better, similar to what the trend had been in the previous six months. (Another 24 percent saying it's getting worse and 42 percent say it is staying about the same.) 
Nearly half of respondents - 46 percent - rated the job market in their area as very or fairly good these days, with a third saying that they think their local job markets will improve over the next year. (The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.)
Some of this optimism likely has to do with rising home and stock market values, which makes consumers feel wealthier. Given the positive outlook among consumers, it's not clear what's dragging on the economy and the job market, particularly given how well the housing market seems to be doing. 
One explanation has to do with weird weather. 
Usually a lot of economic activity slows down during the winter - when frigid, snowy weather makes it difficult to build, for example - then picks up in the spring, when the weather is more accommodating. (The organizations and agencies that release economic data usually adjust the numbers with these predictable patterns in mind.) This year, though, the country had a mild winter and a cold spring, which means some of the economic activity usually tied to spring-temperature weather happened earlier than usual, and some of it may occur later than usual. In addition, there was a lot of rebuilding over the winter as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which put construction workers to work earlier than usual. 
"There's hiring that took place when it wouldn't normally take place," Mr. Shapiro said. "There are all these construction workers who were already hired, and maybe they're moving on to something different now, but that's not being counted as a new job."
All of this could make recent job numbers look weaker than they might otherwise be.
The across-the-board federal spending cuts that officially began on March 1 - known as the sequester - may also be hurting the private sector, although it is hard to tell how much. 
"Any negative news is going to be blamed on the sequester, which I think is becoming a bit of an excuse at this point," said Joseph A. LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank. "It's a factor, but it's not as big as people believe it is."
All the same, when the jobs report comes out on Friday, economists will be looking at changes in the federal employment numbers, as well as sectors like manufacturing and professional services, to see if they are being obviously affected by the spending cuts. Much of the effect will be hard to detect, particularly if people directly harmed by the sequester are furloughed rather than laid off.
Another explanation for the weak string of economic data is that the numbers may be misleading - that they're understating the "true" strength of the economy. That's based on a pattern of revisions in recent months, particularly to the jobs report. 
The first release of a month's employment numbers, put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics typically on the first Friday of the subsequent month, is an initial guess at what happened with hiring and firing, based on incomplete data. It gets the most attention, even though revisions to that initial estimate in the following two months, based on more complete data, can be significant. 
For whatever reason, recent revisions have been very pro-cyclical: That is, when there were job losses, they turned out to be worse than initially estimated, and when there were job gains, they turned out to be much better than initially estimated. Whatever happened with employment, the initial release underestimated the change.
Here is a chart showing the difference between the third estimate (for example, the job change from February, as shown in a jobs report released in May) and the first estimate (the job change from February, as shown in a jobs report released in March):
And here's that same data series (the revisions) shown alongside what the change in payrolls was ultimately determined to be once all the data were in:
Economists are hopeful that the job changes from the last couple of months will likewise be revised upward, and that even if Friday's number disappoints, that it will understate the real job growth in the economy.

HEADLINE: Pressure in Britain Over What to Do With Bailed-Out Banks

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT and JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The British government&#8217;s efforts to reduce its holdings in the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group may prove difficult. 

 BODY:
The archbishop of Canterbury, a former chancellor of the Exchequer and the outgoing governor of the Bank of England are unusual comrades in arms.
Yet, the three stalwarts of the British establishment - Justin Welby, Nigel Lawson and Mervyn King - are all calling for the breakup of the part-nationalized Royal Bank of Scotland.
They are part of a growing debate in Britain about what to do with the bank and its rival, the Lloyds Banking Group, which received more than $103 billion combined in rescue bailouts during the financial crisis.
Now, nearly five years after British taxpayers first took stakes in the lenders, the government is preparing to reduce its holdings before the next general election, which is expected in early 2015. The government owns 81 percent of R.B.S. and 39 percent of Lloyds. 
Yet, unlike the share sales in financial giants like Citigroup that allowed the United States government to make a profit, the prospective offerings in Britain may be more difficult.
The two banks are still cleaning up their balance sheets and selling off unwanted assets that could put off new investors. Both continue to come under political pressure to increase potentially risky lending to the struggling British economy. And the timing of any share sale, which could come as early as next year, may lead to losses for British taxpayers - potentially angering voters.
"As we move closer to an election, the share prices of R.B.S. and Lloyds will become more scrutinized," said Peter Hahn, a banking professor at the Cass Business School in London. "Whoever is in government, selling shares in these banks will be a top priority."
Liz Morley, a representative for UKFI, the government agency that is in charge of managing the bank holdings, declined to comment for this article.
The British government's quandary over the banks stands in contrast with the experience of the United States Treasury Department, which reduced the government's stakes in the big banks more quickly.
Elisabeth Rudman, an analyst with the credit rating firm DBRS, said the two British banks were in much worse shape because of the financial crisis than their American counterparts. R.B.S. was not only burdened by its participation in the acquisition of the Dutch lender ABN Amro, but it had large exposure to imploding real estate markets like Ireland.
The critical element in the British government's effort to shed its banks stakes is timing. Later this month, George Osborne, the current chancellor of the Exchequer, will present his strategy to return the two banks to the private sector. His plan will come soon after the findings of a British parliamentary committee in the middle of June that will outline how the firms could be privatized. Lawmakers remain divided over how the banks' should be privatized, with many of the committee members calling for the breakup of R.B.S. to carve out the most risky assets.
Those in favor of a split say that freeing R.B.S. from its worst-performing assets would allow the bank to lend more, strengthen the banking system and help Britain's economic recovery. Those against the breakup argue that it would cost both time and money that would be better spent letting the bank continue with its planned overhaul.
To connect banks with local communities could involve "recapitalizing at least one of our major banks and breaking it up into regional banks," Archbishop Welby, a former oil executive who sits on the parliamentary committee, said in a speech on April 21.
For Mr. Osborne, planning the offerings will be precarious.
If the British government sells its stakes too soon, it could book a loss that might not sit well with voters. But if the government waits too long to sell, it could deter potential investors from buying the shares. It also may reverse the firms' recent share price rise that have made the banks' stocks some of the best performers in the FTSE 100-stock index over the last 12 months.
"I get confused by all the talk about waiting," said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst with Investec in London, adding that the British government should sell the stakes tomorrow. "Can we sell the shares now? Of course we can."
The fortunes of the two British banks have certainly improved since they received multibillion-dollar bailouts.
R.B.S. has been gradually digging itself out of its ill-judged ABN Amro acquisition in 2007. The bank, based in Edinburgh, has shed billions of dollars from its balance sheet and cut around 40,000 jobs over the last five years. The firm has also trimmed its investment banking operations, which came under scrutiny this year after R.B.S. was forced to pay a $612 million fine connected to a rate-rigging scandal.
Lloyds, which already is Britain's largest mortgage lender, has refocused its efforts on the British retail banking sector. The bank's chief executive, António Horta-Osório, announced a £1.5 billion net profit in the first quarter of 2013, compared with a £5 million loss in the same period last year.
Analysts say the rise in earnings is mostly driven by cost reductions, a fall in delinquent loans and fast-tracked asset sales like the disposal of a portfolio of real estate-backed securities in the United States for £3.3 billion last month to a number of American investors, including Goldman Sachs.
Market participants are now centering their attention on when the British government will start to reduce it stakes.
R.B.S.'s chairman, Philip Hampton, has said the bank would like the British government to start selling shares from the middle of next year, though the firm's current share price is around 35 percent below what British taxpayers paid for their holding. Lloyds' stock price is slightly above the government's so-called break-even point, though bankers caution that any offering will be dependent on the health of the broader financial markets.
"Bringing too many shares to market could easily scare off investors," said a prominent investment banker at a rival firm in London, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. "When it comes to reducing the government's stake, timing will be everything."
Some leading voices in Britain are also calling for restraint.
Alistair Darling, the former chancellor of the Exchequer who led the bailouts of R.B.S. and Lloyds, said the government would make a mistake if it were to rush a sale of shares before the next election. Mr. Darling, a Labour politician who opposes the breakup of R.B.S., said the current government could wait at least another 18 months before selling off its stakes, but must clarify its plans to avoid creating confusion with potential investors.
"A clear statement is needed," Mr. Darling said. "The longer this drags on, the worse this is going to get."
For any prospective share sale in the two banks to be a success, the British government must convince voters that the offerings would benefit the economy after taxpayers spent billions of dollars to rescue the two lenders.
Just outside an R.B.S. branch in central London on Thursday, many seemed unconvinced that privatizing the bank would help to jump-start Britain's recovery.
"I can't see it making much difference," said Sarah Mulligan, an I.T. consultant on her way to a meeting in London's financial district. "Changing who owns the banks won't necessarily get them lending again."

HEADLINE: The Unbearable Lightness of Being Right

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Wrong, wrong, wrong, and nothing changes. 

 BODY:
Ezra Klein and Evan Soltas had a rather uncharacteristically dyspeptic post this morning lamenting the failure of essentially anyone in DC to change policy proposals despite all the information that has come in undermining whatever intellectual basis those proposals might once have had. There's a fair bit of obligatory both-sides-do-it false equivalence in their post; but that aside, they're basically right. 
Except actually it's worse than that. The austerity consensus that took over Washington (and Brussels, and London, and Frankfurt, and ...) never actually had many facts behind it to begin with . It flourished through sheer incestuous amplification: the in-crowd reassuring each other that they were right, with journalists - as Ezra himself pointed out - simply adding to the problem:
For reasons I've never quite understood, the rules of reportorial neutrality don't apply when it comes to the deficit. On this one issue, reporters are permitted to openly cheer a particular set of highly controversial policy solutions. At Tuesday's Playbook breakfast, for instance, Mike Allen, as a straightforward and fair a reporter as you'll find, asked Simpson and Bowles whether they believed Obama would do "the right thing" on entitlements - with "the right thing" clearly meaning "cut entitlements."
Yet there were some people challenging the whole consensus. Yes, I'm going to pat myself on the back a bit; reading my verdict on austerity or on Paul Ryan three years later, they still look pretty good - not perfect (the Baltics have done better than I expected, though not actually well), but compared with the orthodoxy of the time, well, there's no comparison. Overall, it's hard to think of any previous episode in in the history of economic thought in which we had as thorough a showdown between opposing views, and as thorough a collapse, practical and intellectual, of one side of the argument.
And yet nothing changes. Not only don't the policies change; by and large even the people don't change. Reinhart and Rogoff may get a bit fewer high-profile invites, as will Alesina and Ardagna; but Bowles and Simpson are still touring, the same people at the BIS and the OECD are still issuing dire warnings about the dangers of easy money, George Osborne is still making pronouncements, Paul Ryan is still the intellectual leader of his party.
OK, I know I'm hyperventilating a bit. But the lack of accountability, for ideas and people, is truly remarkable in a time of massive policy failure.

HEADLINE: The Woman in a Jim Crow Photo

BYLINE: MAURICE BERGER


HIGHLIGHT: Gordon Parks documented some of the quieter, but no less compelling or important, moments of the civil rights struggle. Decades later, one of his subjects recalls a poignant image. 

 BODY:
When Joanne Wilson stepped out to enjoy a balmy summer afternoon with her niece in 1956, she stepped into history. The two stood in front of a movie theater in downtown Mobile, Ala., dressed in their Sunday best. But the neon sign that loomed overhead - "Colored Entrance" - cast a despairing shadow.
"I wasn't going in," Mrs. Wilson recalled. "I didn't want to take my niece through the back entrance. She smelled popcorn and wanted some. All I could think was where I could go to get her popcorn."
That moment was captured by Gordon Parks, who was working on a Life photo essay that documented everyday life among an extended African-American family in the rural South. Although it was not among the final selections published in September 1956 as "The Restraints: Open and Hidden," the photograph of Mrs. Wilson and her niece, Shirley Diane Kirksey, is among the most compelling of the project. 
We usually associate civil rights photography with dramatic scenes of historic events. But this image helps us to understand that the battle for racial equality and justice was waged not just through epic demonstrations, speeches and conflagrations, but also through the quiet actions of individuals.
More than half a century later, the Gordon Parks Foundation honored Mrs. Wilson with a gift of that color print during its celebrity-filled annual awards dinner at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Speaking in a lilting but strong voice, Mrs. Wilson recounted on Tuesday night what it was like to encounter and work with Mr. Parks - how comfortable he made her feel and her need to teach him, the Northerner, "the things we could do and the things we could not do" under the watchful eyes of segregationists.
White supremacists understood the power of the camera to expose their violent prejudices and turn the nation against them. As Mr. Parks recalled later, the risk of retaliation for participating in the Life story was great, both for the photographer and for his subjects. But neither he nor Mrs. Wilson would be intimidated.
"My family saw the photo essay as an opportunity to advance the cause of civil rights," said Michael Wilson, Mrs. Wilson's son and the family historian. "These pictures were going to be published in a national magazine. People across the country would clearly see the problem. They could see our plight. Maybe then we could get help."
Despite the poverty and racial enmity all around her, Mrs. Wilson endeavored to make life for her family as normal as possible. In 1956, she married Troy Wilson, a longshoreman. They had two children. After receiving her college degree, she taught American government and economics for 36 years at Mattie T. Blount High School, which served a predominantly black and low-income community in Prichard, Ala.
Like her father, Albert Thornton Sr., she believed in the power of education to uplift African-Americans and prepare them to overcome racism and segregation. Each year, she organized a bake sale to finance a trip to Atlanta for her female students and introduce them to the city's historically black colleges.
Mrs. Wilson, who was not featured in the final photo essay, survived its publication relatively unscathed. Her sister and brother in-law, Allie Lee Causey and Willie Causey, were less fortunate. Mrs. Causey, a teacher in a ramshackle one-room schoolhouse in Shady Grove, Ala., was quoted in the piece as advocating integration as "the only way through which Negroes will receive justice." One of the most outspoken members of the Thornton family, she helped to organize voter drives and teach community members the Bill of Rights, the recital of which from memory was a prerequisite for African-Americans to vote in many Southern states.
As Life later reported, Mrs. Causey's candor and activism infuriated white supremacists, who taunted the couple about their participation in the photo essay. Service stations refused to sell gas to Mr. Causey, a woodcutter and farmer. He was soon accused of owing money on his truck, which was seized by alleged creditors. Without it, he was unable to work. Two weeks after the photo essay was published, Mrs. Causey was fired from her teaching job. Unable to make a living and fearing for their safety, the couple moved out of Alabama.
Mrs. Causey, who died in 2006, never taught again.
Despite these setbacks, the family had no misgivings about appearing in the piece. "Everyone was very impressed with the article," Mr. Wilson said. "They felt that they had made a friend. Gordon had become part of the family." After the essay was published, Mr. Parks would periodically check in with Mrs. Wilson's parents.
Mrs. Wilson's only quibble with the photograph of her and her niece was that Mr. Parks did not tell her the strap of her slip had fallen. "I always wanted to look neat and nice," she said. "I did not want to be mistaken for a servant. Dressing well made me feel first class. I wanted to set an example."
But Mr. Parks may have had a reason for the oversight: a desire to stress the human side of an image that, in its refinement and flair, could at first be mistaken for one of his fashion photographs. In this context, Mrs. Wilson was not just challenging racism and stereotypes through meticulous self-presentation. She was also going about her daily life, like millions of women, black and white - tending to the needs of an energetic young child, but in a hostile environment.
The price she paid for meeting this responsibility, as anyone who has cared for a child knows, was the distraction that made her overlook the fallen strap. Yet, it is this poignant detail that helps us to identify with her. And it is this appeal to empathy, a central goal of Mr. Parks's civil rights work, that helped him to challenge racism's abiding myth: that we are fundamentally different.
The decision of the Gordon Parks Foundation to honor Mrs. Wilson challenges another misconception: that history is principally the domain of the famous and powerful. As the Life photo essay shows, history is also made through the daily, unheralded acts of ordinary people. What we see in Mr. Parks's image is a determined and self-possessed woman, challenging stereotypes and fortifying herself against the poisonous tide of oppression that threatened to engulf her and her family.
Mrs. Wilson's humanity was under assault, and she chose, in her own way, to fight back. Fifty-seven years later, that moment is potent proof that even the smallest gesture, seen through the right eyes, can change the world.

HEADLINE: Teachers, What Are Your Thoughts on the Common Core Standards?

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: As we&#8217;ve experimented with the C.C.S.S. over the last two years, we&#8217;ve been aware of how politically charged their implementation has become. Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done and why. Please tell us your thoughts and describe your experiences with the standards so far. 

 BODY:
The work of this blog is to suggest ideas for teaching and learning with The New York Times. We don't do original reporting, and we don't offer opinions on education issues. Instead, like teachers everywhere, we strive to facilitate discussion on issues of the day rather than imparting our own points of view. 
But as we have experimented with the new Common Core Standards over the last two years, we have also been aware of how politically charged their implementation has become. 
For some, it's not so much the standards as the inevitable related standardized testing that is the issue. Many, from Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers to the National Council of Teachers of English to the New York Times editorial page, have recently called for caution on testing until teachers and students have a chance to adjust to the new requirements. 
For others, the standards themselves are the problem.
The Republican National Committee rejects them on federalist grounds. Others dislike them because of the way they have been adopted and implemented. Still others say that we need less standardization, not more, or that national standards are beside the point when bigger issues of inequality are the real issue. Many simply see them as part of a troubling wave of change around the direction of education policy in the United States in general. 
Common Core defenders, however, say the standards are powerful and much-needed - as a way to help students compete in a global economy, and as a way "replace the mediocre patchwork of learning standards" that predates them. 
We thought we'd both explain how this blog is approaching the Common Core and ask you about your own experiences and opinions as we plan for the next school year. Please join the conversation below. 
 What We've Done on the Blog So Far, and Why 
One of the first things teachers noticed about the Common Core Standards was the fact that they require significantly more nonfiction, or "informational text," across the curriculum. 
Since the C.C.S.S. definition of "informational text" includes pretty much everything The Times publishes, we saw this as an opportunity to help teachers use Times articles, essays, infographics, videos and photographs alongside literature and other classroom materials to make connections between academic content, students' lives and the world at large. 
Of course, making those connections has been the chief focus of The Learning Network for our entire 14-year history, so this wasn't a departure for us. 
Standards or no standards, our work is to make the newspaper accessible for learners. It's why the liveliest part of the blog has always been the daily Student Opinion question, and why we run features like our new photojournalism activity and our summer reading contest.
But to help teachers understand how what we do works for the Common Core, we also aligned our lesson plans this year both to the McREL Standards we've always used and to the new C.C.S.S.- a task that wasn't hard given that we've occasionally been accused of overstuffing our lessons with so many complex activities and questions that some of them could serve as graduate seminars. Next year we may well add the new science standards to the mix. 
But because the shift to more nonfiction is the subject of much controversy, this fall we also published a lesson plan inviting students to examine the standards themselves, and discuss the question "What should children read?" 
Perhaps the most obviously C.C.S.S.-aligned experiment we did this year was our Friday "Common Core Practice" series, in which we collaborated with two teachers and their freshman humanities classes to post three standards-based writing prompts drawn from each week's Times.
Their students have just created a video that sums up better than we ever could the benefits of reading the newspaper regularly. 
For these teachers and students and for us, however, the focus on the Common Core was just a lens through which to see the work we would have done anyway. Yes, the prompts addressed the argumentative, informative and narrative writing the standards highlight, but the exercise was much more about the serendipity of discovery a reader can have paging through The Times, and about creating a culture of lifelong learning. 
As the two teachers - Jonathan Olsen and Sarah Gross - say: "We've used newspapers in the classroom before the Common Core, and we'll continue to use them if the Common Core disappears. Reading and writing with The Times works no matter what standards you're following."
We suspect that's how many of you feel about what and how you teach, too. Several teachers have told us they will tweak the good work they've always done in order to address the standards more directly, but, like Mr. Olsen and Mrs. Gross, they already have a solid sense of what works with their own students. 
This summer we'll be thinking about where we should go with the standards for 2013-14 ourselves, and your thoughts will help. We hope you'll weigh in. 
 Questions for You 
We know that the answers to these questions are not simple, but please post briefly below in response to as many as you like:

        
What have been your experiences so far with the Common Core?
        
How prepared do you think you, your students and your school are to begin addressing them during the next school year? 
        
What do you think of the standards themselves?
        
What are your thoughts on how they have been implemented so far?
        
How do you feel about what this blog has been doing around the C.C.S.S. so far? 
        
What else could we be doing? How can we help you?
 Update: June 10 | Here are two pieces on the Common Core published in the Sunday Review on June 9: Who's Minding the Schools? and No Learning Without Feeling

HEADLINE: SAC Says It Will Survive

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: SAC Capital Advisors tells its employees the fund will survive a wave of investor withdrawals. | JPMorgan Chase faces a big loss in the deal to settle the bankruptcy of Jefferson County, Ala. | John Thain discusses his regrets over the sale of Merrill Lynch. | Countries are trying to lure foreign entrepreneurs with the promise of start-up visas. 

 BODY:
SAC Capital Advisors has told its employees that it will survive a wave of investor withdrawals amid the government's insider trading investigation, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Investors in the hedge fund, which is owned by Steven A. Cohen, have asked to withdraw a significant amount of money by a quarterly deadline on Monday, according to an internal e-mail sent by SAC's president, Thomas J. Conheeney. The amount, though not disclosed, was said to be more than the $1.7 billion taken out earlier this year, meaning SAC would be left with a fraction of the $6 billion in outside capital with which it began the year, Mr. Lattman reports. 
SAC is putting up a confident front, reiterating in the e-mail that there were no plans to significantly reduce the staff of roughly 1,000. Mr. Cohen's fortune accounts for roughly $8 billion of the fund's $15 billion in assets. "Yet the exodus of investors is a humbling blow to Mr. Cohen and his firm," Mr. Lattman writes. "Until recently, elite investors had clamored to get into the top-performing hedge fund, despite fees that are among the highest in the industry. Now, the investor departures underscore the reputational damage caused by the spate of criminal cases involving former SAC employees - as well as the authorities' push to build a criminal case against the fund, and possibly Mr. Cohen."
LOSS FOR JPMORGAN IN ALABAMA DEBT DEAL | JPMorgan Chase will face a big loss under the deal to settle the bankruptcy of Jefferson County, Ala., Mary Williams Walsh reports in DealBook. The bank, which many in the county hold responsible for the financial collapse in the first place, will have given up nearly $1.6 billion when the dust finally settles. The deal calls for the bank to forfeit $842 million on the $1.22 billion of sewer debt that it holds, on top of $647 million it forgave in termination fees on derivatives contracts with the county and a $75 million penalty it paid to settle a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ms. Walsh writes. The county will drop a lawsuit against JPMorgan if the deal goes through.
But to some county residents, the proposed concessions are not enough. "The deal will force Jefferson County to return to the scene of the crime that crippled it: the bond market," John Archibald, a columnist for The Birmingham News, wrote in an article published online Wednesday. "Lucifer spells his name JPMorgan," he added.
THAIN'S BIG REGRET | "I wouldn't have taken the Merrill job," John A. Thain, former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, tells The Wall Street Journal in a rare interview about the events surrounding the financial crisis. "I regret having to sell Merrill Lynch to Bank of America."
Mr. Thain, now the head of the CIT Group, is overseeing a turnaround at the lender that may involve opening its first bank branch, in Salt Lake City. His current office, half a block from Bank of America's New York headquarters, is nothing special, Mr. Thain suggested to the newspaper. That may be a contrast with Merrill, where one particular item, a $35,000 commode, became a symbol of Wall Street excess.
ON THE AGENDA | The chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, gives a commencement address to LaGuardia Community College. The Bank of England and European Central Bank release decisions on interest rates. The analyst Meredith Whitney, who has a new book out called "Fate of the States: The New Geography of American Prosperity," is on Bloomberg TV at 7 a.m. Gary Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is on Bloomberg TV at 11:45 a.m.
COUNTRIES SEEK SILICON VALLEY ENTREPRENEURS | In a sassy billboard over a highway that runs through the heart of the technology industry, Canada makes an invitation to foreigners having trouble getting temporary visas. "H-1b problems?" it reads. "Pivot to Canada," where the country offers a new so-called start-up visa with the prospect of permanent residency. Somini Sengupta writes in The New York Times: "Canada is not alone in reaching out to foreign entrepreneurs. In a bid to create their own versions of Silicon Valley, Britain and Australia have dangled start-up visas like this too. Chile is even offering seed money to lure foreigners to come to Santiago and get their start-ups off the ground. But the seductions of this Silicon Valley are hard to resist for the men and women who dream of building the next Google (or at least being the next Google acquisition). This is where they want to be."

HEADLINE: SAC Says It Will Survive

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: SAC Capital Advisors tells its employees the fund will survive a wave of investor withdrawals. | JPMorgan Chase faces a big loss in the deal to settle the bankruptcy of Jefferson County, Ala. | John Thain discusses his regrets over the sale of Merrill Lynch. | Countries are trying to lure foreign entrepreneurs with the promise of start-up visas. 

 BODY:
SAC Capital Advisors has told its employees that it will survive a wave of investor withdrawals amid the government's insider trading investigation, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Investors in the hedge fund, which is owned by Steven A. Cohen, have asked to withdraw a significant amount of money by a quarterly deadline on Monday, according to an internal e-mail sent by SAC's president, Thomas J. Conheeney. The amount, though not disclosed, was said to be more than the $1.7 billion taken out earlier this year, meaning SAC would be left with a fraction of the $6 billion in outside capital with which it began the year, Mr. Lattman reports. 
SAC is putting up a confident front, reiterating in the e-mail that there were no plans to significantly reduce the staff of roughly 1,000. Mr. Cohen's fortune accounts for roughly $8 billion of the fund's $15 billion in assets. "Yet the exodus of investors is a humbling blow to Mr. Cohen and his firm," Mr. Lattman writes. "Until recently, elite investors had clamored to get into the top-performing hedge fund, despite fees that are among the highest in the industry. Now, the investor departures underscore the reputational damage caused by the spate of criminal cases involving former SAC employees - as well as the authorities' push to build a criminal case against the fund, and possibly Mr. Cohen."

Museums
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'A Different Kind of Order: The ICP Triennial' (through Sept. 8) The fourth, and best, edition of the International Center of Photography's triennial turns out to be that extremely rare thing in New York City these days, an exhibition of contemporary art for adults. The up-to-the-minute emphasis is on the continuing and enveloping impact of digital technology on photography. The results, as seen here, couldn't be more varied and gripping in content. This is a show that's in touch with the big, live, real world out there beyond Frieze New York. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'Jack Goldstein x 10,000' (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein's posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein's signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like ''Milk,'' in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or ''Spotlight,'' in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'At War With the Obvious: Photographs by William Eggleston' (through July 28) In 36 transcendentally beautiful photographs shot in the Mississippi Delta region in the 1970s and early '80s, this pioneer of color photography captured those kinds of sacred moments when something you ordinarily would pass by without a thought -- a children's swing set overgrown by weeds, an abandoned gas station, a basket of fake flowers hanging on someone's front door -- suddenly takes your breath away. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cambodian Rattan: The Sculptures of Sopheap Pich' (through July 7) Born in Cambodia in 1971, Soheap Pich first came to international attention in 2009 with a series of openwork, basketlike rattan sculptures that looked as light as air, but carried serious ideas in images of half-built cities, viscera, flowers and bombs. His impressive Met show is embedded in the permanent Asian collection. It starts outside the Chinese painting galleries, continues in mezzanine space usually devoted to South Asian material, and concludes in the galleries of Southeast Asian art with a gorgeous suspended Buddha. (An exhibition of new work is on view through June 14 at Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea.) (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through Sept. 2) If you've seen ''Photography and the American Civil War'' at the Met, you might suppose that viewing another exhibition about the war would be redundant. It's not. With outstanding works by Frederic Edwin Church, Sanford Robinson Gifford and Winslow Homer, this gripping show sheds expansive light on the nation's experience of its own fratricidal conflict. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (through Aug. 14) This entertaining exhibition proves that high fashion rarely looks quite as frivolous and cluelessly 1 percent-ish as when it upgrades aspects of the obstreperous punk sartorial mode, adding gold-plated safety pins, careful rips and holes, and a feigned DIY look that can involve materials like garbage bags or cellophane. Cleverness abounds. A few designers absorb and transform punk attributes, but most garments simplistically scream punk. Not for nothing do they call the show's organizing department the Costume Institute. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi' (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met's rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brushstrokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair.

&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velázquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake in the region. It's a chance to see another commanding Velázquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship.

&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Expo 1: New York' (through Sept. 2) A sprawling, multisite extravaganza including a multitude of installations, shows-within-shows and events, ''Expo 1: New York'' offers few answers but raises many provocative questions about the current and future state of our planet's unsettled human and natural ecology. Attractions at PS1 range from a beautiful show of pictures by the beloved nature photographer Ansel Adams to a refrigerated room containing chunks from an Icelandic glacier by Olafur Eliasson. On 53rd Street, next to the Museum of Modern Art, ''Rain Room'' invites viewers into a chamber where steady precipitation ceases wherever bodies are detected by high-tech hardware. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 2) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collagelike storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

New Museum: 'Adhocracy' (through July 7) The term ''adhocracy'' was coined by the futurologist Alvin Toffler, who predicted that innovative, ad hoc forms of organization would replace more bureaucratically entrenched structures in business and government. This crowded design exhibition presents a variety of self-empowering things that people can make and do for themselves like build their own furniture and bicycles; make new appliances from functional parts of old, broken ones; raise money for bigger projects by means of Kickstarter; and, more problematically, make their own functional handguns using 3-D printers. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; Paul McCarthy: 'Life Cast' (through July 26) One of the outstanding shows of the artist's career is best viewed as a single piece. Three fanatically realistic life-size sculptures of naked humans are paired with two video installations that reveal the meticulous casting process behind their ecstatic, mysterious exactitude. The piece is a homage to -- but also perhaps penance for -- Marcel Duchamp's ''Étant Donnés'' and its obsessive focus on the female sex. Hauser & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4970, hauserwirth.com. (Smith)
'Salvaging the Past: Georges Hoentschel and French Decorative Arts from The Metropolitan Museum of Art' (through Aug. 11) This sometimes arcane but highly effective assemblage of rare furnishings, artifacts and a smattering of art and printed matter resurrects a once-renowned French interior designer whose collections -- and displays -- of 18th-century French decorative material and Medieval art were purchased en bloc by J.P.Morgan and given to the Met. They formed the nuclei of the museum's holdings in these areas, helped shape its departmental structure and influenced the arrangement of its galleries in numerous ways.

Galleries: Chelsea
Laddie John Dill: 'Elementary' (through July 26) At the end of the 1960s the West Coast Light and Space artist Laddie John Dill began producing electric light works out of blown glass tubes in a lush palette of jewel-bright colors. Here, nine of these works, all from 1971, are installed in one room at regular intervals creating a trippy visual chamber music. Elsewhere, glowing constructions of glass panes in geometric arrangements could be models for updates of Stonehenge, monuments for a new cosmic paganism. Nyehaus, 358 West 20th Street, (212) 366-4493, nyehaus.com. (Johnson)
Rodney Graham (through June 15) In four giant photographic transparencies mounted on lightboxes, the versatile Vancouver artist Mr. Graham ponders a man's middle age with comical ennui. Each is a fictional self-portrait of the artist as a construction worker, a scientist, an aging punk and an old hippie in a kayak. They are funny and touching because of the disproportionate relationship between their grandiose scale and their goofy images, which resemble those of downbeat Father's Day greeting cards. 303 Gallery, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com. (Johnson)
Jeff Koons: 'New Paintings and Sculptures' (through June 29) Hastily assembled as a retort to Mr. Koons's ''Gazing Ball'' exhibition now at David Zwirner, this exhibition reveals the artist to be both highly productive and uneven. His Photo Realist paintings are uniformly lifeless. The best works are a magenta stainless steel balloon sculpture inspired by the Venus of Willendorf and an inflatable gorilla, rendered in a dark material that resembles plastic or bronze but is actually polished granite. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com. (Smith)
Jeff Koons: 'Gazing Ball' (through June 29) In his latest series, the artist everyone loves to hate could be said to revisit his ''Banality'' series of the late 1980s. He appropriates blazing white plaster casts of well-known Greco-Roman sculptures -- the ''Farnese Hercules,'' ''Sleeping Satyr (Barberini Faun)'' and ''Belvedere Torso'' -- and accents each with a blue mirrored ball of the yard-ornament variety to add irony and visual pizazz. Fighting cliché with cliché, they are neither especially good or bad, just average Koons. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Smith)
Marc Quinn: 'All the Time in the World' (through June 29) Four much enlarged, bronze sculptures of seashells made by high-tech 3-D replication seem, at first, like pointless baubles for rich collectors. But they reveal an unexpected inner beauty both literal and metaphorical, as their polished interiors cause their interiors to warmly glow as if supernaturally illuminated from within. Implicitly vaginal, these seeming products of phallic ambition become objects of oceanic, feminine mystery. Mary Boone, 541 West 24th Street, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Richard Serra: 'Early Work' (through June 15) This terrific exhibition looks back on five formative years in the career of Mr. Serra, one of the world's most admired living sculptors. One room contains objects made of lead, rubber, wood and stone produced by basic actions like cutting, folding and tearing. A second gallery features works made by propping up 4-by-4-foot lead panels and a single slab of hot-rolled steel, 8 feet tall and 24 feet long, that juts from a corner into the room with grand implacability. David Zwirner, 537 West 20th Street, (212) 517-8677, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Wolfgang Tillmans (through June 22) The nomadic German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans addresses globalization in a curiously offhand way. This is true even in his latest works, which assert themselves more strongly as art objects thanks to Mr. Tillmans's experiments with inkjet printing; they are lush and almost painterly in their rich concentrations of pigment. Only after connecting the dots of the installation -- which moves from downtown Los Angeles to Kilimanjaro, a Masai hut to a construction site in Shanghai, a car headlight to a close-up of mold spores -- do you sense transformation and upheaval. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Robert Zakanitch: 'Hanging Gardens' (through June 15) The veteran Pattern and Decoration painter is showing flower-filled works in gouache and colored pencil on immense pieces of unframed paper. The dense cascading blooms -- based on wisteria or largely invented -- fill the surface, conjuring the exquisitely botanical, the nearly abstract and wallpaper, often at the same time. Light flows through their ravishing abundance. Nancy Hoffman Gallery, 520 West 27th Street, (212) 966-6676, nancyhoffmangallery.com. (Smith)
Galleries: SoHo
&#x2605; 'Mel Bochner: Proposition and Process: A Theory of Sculpture (1968-1973)' (through June 29) This beautiful exhibition is a veritable time capsule. It shows the artist's pioneering Conceptual works in a setting redolent of the early artist-oriented, pre-retail era of SoHo -- which is when they were made. Defiantly modest, they parse Minimalist space, measuring it openly with non-Minimalist objects (small stones, walnuts, burned matches) often annotated with writing or drawing in chalk, repeatedly locating the place where language, counting and dimensional experience overlap, to the confusion and excitement of eye and mind.

Andreas Schulze: 'Windows' (through June 23) After a 13-year absence from New York, this terrific German artist has had two exhibitions at this gallery in 14 months. The second features deadpan renderings of recognizably Northern European windows, stoutly framed, often with sturdy metal handles and, always, a view that suggests the arrival of cloud-parting light. The basic nature of painting as a window on an illusionistic world is evoked, with the handles signaling both our disbelief and its suspension.

Galleries: Other
Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation. Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 316-7490, stjohndivine.org. (Cotter)
Aiko Hachisuka (through next Friday) The five colorful works in this New York debut distinguish themselves from the increasingly crowded field of stuffed fabric sculptures with their deliberation, complexity and wonderful sleights of hand. From certain viewpoints, they suggest giant, colorfully glazed ceramic planters or tangled bodies but are actually individually stuffed garments carefully stitched together, with paint applied in random shardlike patterns. Soft, cuddly friendliness contrasts with astute, slightly mysterious art-making. Eleven Rivington, 11 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-1930, elevenrivington.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
Margaret Weber (through June 23) Recycled industrial carpets are Ms. Weber's thing. In her impressive solo debut she methodically picks apart big swaths of them, layer by layer and thread by thread. Her subtractive handiwork relaxes these slyly pictorial postminimal artworks that retain something of their previous corporate status. Especially indicative of her eco-friendly reverse craft is ''Eater,'' which resembles an unusually elegant version of 1970s fiber art.

Out of Town
Montclair Art Museum: 'The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913' (through June 16) The Armory Show opened 100 years ago in Manhattan, introducing to Americans the shocking works of van Gogh, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse and Duchamp and other European avant-gardists along with less adventurous efforts by hundreds of homegrown artists. This much more modest, centennial show presents a selection of works by artists who were included, most of them Americans. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Marsden Hartley and John Sloan stand out, but a small, vibrant pastoral scene by Matisse shows how far behind the avant-garde curve the Americans lagged. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Montclair Art Museum: 'Oscar Bluemner's America: Picturing Paterson, New Jersey' (through June 16) This lovely, small show presents works dating from 1910 to 1917 when the American Modernist Bluemner was catching up on European avant-garde developments. He combined realism and Cubism in paintings of farm buildings in rural landscapes and the industrial architecture of Paterson, his hometown. Favoring glowing reds and blues and opaque blacks, he painted images that seem illuminated from within like modern stained-glass windows. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

Last Chance
'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints From the Albertina' (closes on Sunday) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints' (closes on Sunday) Contemporary provocateurs could learn a thing or two from the venerable artists in ''Edo Pop,'' who mixed high and low culture in arch and urbane ways. In this show's 100 or so ukiyo-e, or color woodblock prints (drawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), valiant samurai turn out to be Kabuki actors in costume; refined landscapes depict well-trodden tourist sites; and images of classical beauties accompanied by poems are more often than not portraits of courtesans. These spirited images bring to life Edo Japan's ''floating world,'' a sort of Renaissance of popular entertainment. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
'Ellsworth Kelly: Singular Forms, 1966-2009' (through Saturday) A lively nine-work survey of the artist's long involvement with irregularly shaped canvases and metal reliefs and monochrome colors begins with the insouciant ''Yellow Piece'' -- a diamond with two rounded corners -- and concludes with ''Blue Curves,'' which resembles a capital B with erotic undercurrents. Mnuchin Gallery, 45 East 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 861-0020, mnuchingallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Great and Mighty Things: Outsider Art From the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection' (closes on Sunday) One good turn generates another: the gift of a beloved, finely calibrated collection of American outsider art to a major encyclopedic museum is celebrated with an equally excellent exhibition of the same. It displays around 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and assemblages, made mostly from the 1930s to the '80s by 27 outsiders, both renowned and less prominent. All are seen here at or close to their best, pressing against the increasingly unjustifiable division between outsider and inside. 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Sara VanDerBeek (closes on Saturday) With two glamorous installations of photographs and minimalist sculptures, Ms. VanDerBeek contributes to the Postmodern endgame tradition of art reflecting on itself. In the biggest gallery four white columns reflected in mirror glass covering large, abstract, vaguely cosmic photographs call to mind the pillar of salt that Lot's wife turned into when, contrary to divine command, looked back to the corrupt city of Sodom. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100, metropictures.com. (Johnson)
Don Voisine (closes on Sunday) With hard-won control, this veteran abstractionist puts his carefully layered, impeccably painted black geometric shapes through their paces, illuminating a rich fusion of Modernist sources with a meticulous exploration of the mechanics of painting in the process. His efforts enact telling dramas of space, texture, color, edge and light -- all of painting's grand illusions -- especially when given your undivided attention.

HEADLINE: As Wars End, a Rush to Grab Dollars Spent on the Border

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
TUCSON -- The nation's largest military contractors, facing federal budget cuts and the withdrawals from two wars, are turning their sights to the Mexican border in the hopes of collecting some of the billions of dollars expected to be spent on tighter security if immigration legislation becomes law.
Half a dozen major military contractors, including Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, are preparing for an unusual desert showdown here this summer, demonstrating their military-grade radar and long-range camera systems in an effort to secure a Homeland Security Department contract worth as much as $1 billion.
Northrop Grumman, meanwhile, is pitching to Homeland Security officials an automated tracking device -- first built for the Pentagon to find roadside bombs in Afghanistan -- that could be mounted on aerial drones to find illegal border crossers. And General Atomics, which manufactures the reconnaissance drones, wants to double the size of the fleet under a recently awarded contract worth up to $443 million. 
The military-style buildup at the border zone, which started in the Tucson area late in the Bush administration, would become all but mandatory under the bill pending before the Senate. It requires that within six months of enactment, Homeland Security submit a plan to achieve ''effective control'' and ''persistent surveillance'' of the entire 1,969-mile land border with Mexico, something never before accomplished.
For military contractors, that could be a real boon. ''There are only so many missile systems and Apache attack helicopters you can sell,'' said Dennis L. Hoffman, an Arizona State University economics professor who has studied future potential markets for the defense industry. ''This push toward border security fits very well with the need to create an ongoing stream of revenue.''
Since 2005, the number of Border Patrol agents has doubled to 21,000, and the stretches protected by pedestrian or vehicle fencing have grown to 651 miles as of last year from 135. But there are still large swaths where people trying to enter the United States illegally have good odds of success, particularly in rural Texas. And with budget cutting in the past two years, money for surveillance equipment along the border has been pared back.
''The main gap in our ability to provide a more secure border at this point is technology,'' Mark S. Borkowski, the head of acquisitions for Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection, told participants at a border security industry conference in March.
Military contractors have not played a significant role in lobbying for the passage of the immigration legislation, which includes $4.5 billion to bolster border security over the next five years.
But teams of lobbyists, including former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican, and Benjamin Abrams, a former top aide to Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat and House minority whip, have already been pressing Homeland Security officials and lawmakers on behalf of their clients, efforts that have been backed up with millions of dollars of industry campaign contributions.
Homeland Security would have to decide, in consultation with Congress, how to divide the money -- on long-range cameras, radar systems, mobile surveillance equipment, aircraft or lower-tech solutions like more border agents or physical fences -- decisions that would determine how various contractors might fare.
''It has been a tough time for the industry: people have been laid off or furloughed,'' said James P. Creaghan, a lobbyist who represents a small Texas company, Personal Defense, which is trying to sell more night-vision goggles to Homeland Security. ''This could help out.''
Northrop has won some important allies on Capitol Hill, including Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, who is urging the department to invest more in Northrop's drone-mounted surveillance system, called Vader. General Atomics, which Mr. D'Amato represents, has so much support in Congress that it has pressed Homeland Security in recent years to buy more Predator drones than the department has the personnel to operate, so they often sit unused, according to an agency audit.
The specific requirement in the legislation now before the Senate is that Homeland Security must install surveillance equipment or other measures that would allow it to apprehend or turn back 9 out of 10 people trying to illegally enter across all sectors of the southern land border. The department would be prohibited from moving ahead with the ''pathway to citizenship'' for immigrants already in the United States until this new security strategy is ''substantially operational.''
The bill is scheduled to be taken up for debate on the Senate floor next week, and certain Republicans have already drafted amendments that would make the requirement even more demanding, explicitly mandating that the 90 percent standard be achieved before the pathway to citizenship can proceed.
The Tucson area, for years the busiest crossing point for illegal immigrants, has served as the testing ground for the federal government's high-technology border effort, although even senior Homeland Security officials acknowledge it got off to a poor start.
Boeing was selected back in 2006, when the last major push by Congress to rewrite the nation's immigration laws was under way, to create a ''virtual fence'' that would use radar and video systems to identify and track incursions, information that would then be beamed to regional command centers and border agents in the field.
But the ground radar system at first kept shutting down because of faulty circuit breakers, audits found, while the towers installed for the mounting of radar and advanced long-range cameras swayed too much in the desert winds. Even rainstorms snarled things, creating countless false alerts.
''It should have been pretty simple,'' Mr. Borkowski said in a recent speech of the troubled $850 million project. ''We weren't frankly smart enough.''
Critics say the government often is too fixated on high-technology solutions. C. Stewart Verdery Jr., a former Homeland Security official who now runs a lobbying firm, said federal officials should instead focus their limited resources on making it harder for illegal immigrants to work in the United States, an approach that would serve as an effective deterrent.
''Where are you going to get the biggest bang for the buck?'' Mr. Verdery said. ''Enforcement of the workplace is probably the best area to invest more dollars.''
But the technological solutions still have many advocates in Arizona, where Border Patrol officials contend that the equipment Boeing installed, despite its flaws, has fundamentally changed the cat-and-mouse game that plays out every day.
One recent afternoon, as the temperature in the Arizona desert hovered near 100 degrees, Border Patrol agents stationed inside a command center in Tucson were notified that a ground sensor had gone off. The command center, built under the Boeing contract, resembles the set from the Hollywood movie ''Minority Report,'' with Border Patrol agents sitting in front of banks of computer terminals and oversize screens that allow them to virtually fly over huge expanses of open desert 70 miles away.
Using his computer, one agent pointed the long-range, heat-seeking camera at the location where the sensor had gone off. Within seconds, black-and-white images of a group of men and women walking rapidly through the desert heat appeared on his screen. ''One, two, three, four, five,'' the agent called out, counting until he reached 15 people in the group. He also carefully scanned the images to see if any of the people were carrying large sacks, a sign of a possible drug delivery, or had any rifles or other weapons.
The Border Patrol radios lit up as he directed nearby agents on the ground to respond and called for backup from one of Customs and Border Protection's helicopters based in Tucson.
''What you see today is like night and day compared to what we had,'' said Cmdr. Jeffrey Self of the Border Patrol, who oversees the Tucson region. The Boeing system, along with the surge in Border Patrol agents, has resulted in a major drop in attempted illegal crossings, he said, with apprehensions dropping 80 percent since their peak in 2000, considered a sign of a drop in overall traffic.
But the system's weaknesses are still apparent. The computer terminal crashed while the search was under way, cutting off one agent's video feed. And on that recent afternoon, no air support was immediately available. The one helicopter nearby that was on duty was running low on fuel, so it did not arrive on the scene until 90 minutes later. Meanwhile, the Border Patrol agents at the Tucson command center lost the border crossers as they dropped into a ditch, taking them out of the line of sight of the camera and radar.
Apparently seeing Border Patrol trucks and the helicopter, the group realized it had been spotted and retreated back south, an agency spokesman said. The 15 were marked down as ''turn backs.''
Homeland Security has been preparing for more than a year to expand this system, under a new contract that would rely on proven surveillance technology. That is why the military contractors vying for the job will be asked in coming weeks to demonstrate their gear. The department also wants to identify a mix of equipment -- some on fixed towers, others on trucks for mobility -- so that officials can tailor uses to the different needs along the border.
Department officials said their choices would be driven by a determination of what the best available tools were for securing the border, not what the defense contractors or their lobbyists were pitching. Customs and Border Protection officials, said Michael J. Friel, a department spokesman in a statement, are ''dedicated to continuing this progress towards a safer, stronger and more secure border.''

HEADLINE: The Power Inversion

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
There's a weird calm around Washington these days. The Obama administration only has a year before the lame-duck status sets in. Yet you don't get a sense of urgency. White House officials seem busy running the government, but they are not filling the public space with a transformational second-term agenda.
Republican leaders aren't offering bold plans either. They seem more worried about offending pieces of the current coalition than in attracting new ones. 
The heart of the problem is that nobody wants to champion proposals that have no chance of passing. Washington is immobilized by interest groups, polarization and a lack of federal dollars.
In their new book, ''The Metropolitan Revolution,'' Bruce Katz and Jennifer Bradley of the Brookings Institution argue that Washington paralysis is already leading to a power inversion. As the federal government becomes less energetic, city governments become more so.
Katz and Bradley describe a country that is segmenting slightly into divergent city-states. Demographically, society is clustering. In an era when the nuclear two-parent family was the key demographic unit, it made sense to think of America as a suburban economy with common needs. But now two-parent nuclear families account for only a fifth of all households. The young, the old and the single make up a huge slice of the population, and they flock to density. According to Robert Puentes of Brookings, the share of young people with driver's licenses is plummeting. Public transit ridership rose by 32.3 percent between 1995 and 2011.
Economic changes also reinforce regional concentration. For decades, companies sought to protect their intellectual property by isolating their research-and-development functions in suburban research parks. But now scientific breakthroughs are less likely to come from discrete teams. They tend to come from large, loose networks of researchers brought together in physical proximity. It makes sense to locate research facilities in urban districts, often around urban universities, where researchers will make wider and more flexible contacts.
Gerry Carlino of the Philadelphia Fed has found that the number of patents per capita increases by roughly 20 percent to 30 percent for every doubling of employment density. Research by Stuart Rosenthal of Syracuse University and William Strange of the University of Toronto suggests that the intellectual spillovers that often drive innovation drop off as companies move more than a mile apart from each other.
Given this underlying structure, there are a number of reasons city governments are likely to be more dynamic than the federal government. In the first place, regional identity trumps partisan identity. In Washington, your primary affiliation is to your party. But, in Denver, your primary affiliation is to the health of the Denver area. That common consciousness makes it easier for politicians in different parties to cooperate.
Metro governments deal with issues in their particularity, not as abstractions. Leaders in northeastern Ohio can focus on their region's historic strengths, including a history of expertise with polymers. That leads to certain concrete opportunities -- the chance to get into flexible electronics, which are very thin electronic components attached to flexible materials. They can design specific policies around concrete circumstances.
Because issues on the regional level are so tangible, it is possible to debate new proposals without getting immobilized by the big government-versus-small government frame. Republican mayors tend to be more activist than their Congressional counterparts, and Democratic mayors tend to be more business friendly. Katz and Bradley highlight New York City's fantastically successful effort to lure the Technion-Cornell engineering school. That was an exercise in using government to set the table for long-term growth by luring human capital, not in trying to micromanage the future with shiny office buildings, a downtown stadium or a mall.
Finally, city governments actually have power over the basics, which are the key to promoting growth. American growth lags not because of higher order problems, but because of the bad elemental things, like lousy schools and bad infrastructure. Cities can change this. A study by the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that Chicago will be the ninth most competitive city in the world by 2025. Its rise in the rankings is fueled by the fact that the city is taking care of fundamentals: $7.3 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years, a community college program that links education to employment.
Since the New Deal, we have become accustomed to seeing American politics as an ever-concentrated national enterprise. But the sclerosis of the federal system will inevitably produce a reversal, as regions fill the void.
The happiest people these days are those who leave Washington and get elected mayor or governor. The most frustrated people are people who were mayor and governor and get elected to the Senate. They end each day knowing they were busy. They're just not sure they accomplished anything.

HEADLINE: Gay Marriage Seen in Poll as Issue for the States

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and DALIA SUSSMAN; Megan Thee-Brenan and Allison Kopicki contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A solid majority of Americans opposes a broad national right to same-sex marriage, saying the power to legalize gay unions should rest with the states -- even as most support marriage equality for gay people, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
The survey comes as the Supreme Court is preparing to issue decisions this month on two high-profile same-sex marriage cases. Justices are weighing the constitutionality of California's ban and the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that denies federal benefits to same-sex couples; the public appears squarely in favor of overturning that law.
The poll also found Americans are increasingly upbeat about the economy, with 39 percent of respondents calling the economy's condition good, the highest percentage since late 2007. And it found stark racial and partisan divisions on two other matters before the Supreme Court: affirmative action and voting rights.
On national security, Americans expressed strong skepticism about taking the lead in trying to solve overseas conflicts, but support for action against Iran if it is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon. The public continues to support the Obama administration's use of unmanned drone aircraft; 72 percent back their use against people suspected of being terrorists, but 66 percent are concerned the drone program suffers from ''not enough oversight.'' 
The poll found mistrust of the federal government, amid national debate about whether it has grown too intrusive; in subsequent interviews, several respondents said the federal government should stay out of private lives, and one cited the recent controversy at the Internal Revenue Service, which has acknowledged targeting Tea Party conservatives, in arguing marriage should be left to the states.
''The federal government is too involved in too many personal things that they don't need to be involved in,'' said Frances Narramore, 75, a retired teacher in Arizona, who calls herself an independent. ''Just look at what's happening at the I.R.S., and you see what I mean by that.''
Asked whether same-sex marriage rights should be ''determined by the federal government or left to each individual state government to decide,'' 60 percent preferred leaving it to the states, and 33 percent the federal government.
Yet respondents also wanted equal treatment for gay people who are already legally married. By a 17-point margin -- 56 percent in favor, 39 percent against -- they said the federal government should recognize legal marriages of same-sex couples and provide them the same federal benefits given legally married heterosexual couples.
In addition to the same-sex marriage cases, the Supreme Court is also likely to issue decisions on two other major cases -- one on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and one on whether public universities can consider race as a factor in admissions -- by the end of June.
Americans are divided over whether the voting act is necessary; 49 percent said it is, but 44 percent said it is not. Black respondents and Democrats were far more apt to say the act was still needed. The Supreme Court is now reviewing the part of the act that bars jurisdictions with a history of discrimination from changing voting laws without federal approval.
More than half of Americans, 53 percent, favor affirmative action programs for minorities in college admissions and hiring, the poll found. (Other surveys that frame the question in terms of giving minorities ''preference'' find less support.)
In a case brought by Abigail Fisher, a white student denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin, the Supreme Court is considering whether to affirm, limit or overturn a 2003 ruling allowing public universities to consider race as one factor in an ''holistic review.''
In the Times/CBS News Poll, those who favor affirmative action said by large margins that they believe achieving diversity is a stronger rationale for it than making up for discrimination.
But here, too, there are racial and partisan differences. While three-quarters of blacks support affirmative action, fewer than half of whites do, according to the Times/CBS News Poll. And while support stands at 75 percent among Democrats, it drops to 37 percent among Republicans.
''If you're smart enough to get into college, you should be smart enough without your race,'' said one Republican respondent, Krista Bumgarner, 27, a homemaker and personal care assistant in Foley, Minn.
The question of state-versus-federal authority is at the heart of all three major pending court cases. Gay-rights advocates liken California's Proposition 8, which in 2008 banned same-sex marriage there, to earlier state bans on interracial marriage, which fell across the country in 1967 after the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Loving v. Virginia.
Chad Griffin, who organized the challenge of the California law and is now president of the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, argued that the court must intervene, saying marriage rights should be fundamental, and ''not determined by what side of a state border one lives on.''
''The exact same arguments were made in the 1950s and '60s -- let the states decide integration, let the states decide voting rights,'' he said.
Some justices have expressed skepticism, though, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, citing the firestorm after the court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a right to abortion. Many legal analysts expect the court to issue a narrow ruling that applies to California alone.
Respondents to the poll seemed to support that course, regardless of whether they favored allowing gay people to marry. ''We're sort of set up for things to go through the states, and then filter up to the federal government,'' said Steve Koivisto, 47, a Democrat and music instrument repair technician in Baton Rouge, La., who backs same-sex marriage.
Same-sex marriage is legal in 12 states and the District of Columbia; in three of those states -- Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island -- the laws are so new they have not yet taken effect. Still, that is far short of the 34 states that permitted interracial marriage when the court decided Loving v. Virginia.
Many Americans are convinced that marriage change is coming; 72 percent see legalization as ''inevitable,'' according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday.
''The time will come soon enough when enough of these states will have legalized it, for the federal government to make it law,'' Mr. Koivisto said.
Surveys have shown that support for same-sex marriage has been increasing, and the Times/CBS News Poll found that 51 percent back marriage rights for gay people, while 44 percent are opposed, largely unchanged since late last year. Support spikes to 68 percent among Americans under 30, but gay marriage wins the backing of just 32 percent of those 65 or older.
The survey of 1,022 Americans had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. It was conducted from May 31 to June 4, as the Obama administration was coping with the I.R.S. controversy and revelations that the Justice Department had sought reporters' telephone records.
President Obama seems to have been unaffected; his approval rating held steady at 47 percent, the survey found.

HEADLINE: Fed Reports American Households Have Regained Ground Lost in the Recession

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Buoyed by a healthier housing sector and a soaring stock market, American households continue to regain ground lost during the financial crisis and the severe recession that followed.
Without adjusting for inflation, the net worth of American households is now higher than before the recession struck five and a half years ago, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday.
Household net worth jumped by just over $3 trillion, or 4.5 percent, to $70.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2013, surpassing the $68.1 trillion reached in 2007. 
After adjustment for inflation, total net worth still stands below the peak reached in mid-2007, said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.
The encouraging report from the Fed comes amid other signs that Americans are feeling slightly better about the economy.
In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted May 31 to June 4, 39 percent of respondents said that the recent condition of the economy was very or fairly good, the highest share saying this not only since President Obama took office but also since the recession officially began in December 2007.
About a third of respondents said that the economy was getting better, similar to what the trend had been in the previous six months. (Another 24 percent said that it was getting worse and 42 percent said the economy was staying about the same.)
Nearly half of respondents -- 46 percent -- rated the job market in their areas as very good or fairly good, with a third saying that they thought their local job markets would improve over the next year.
The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Despite newfound optimism in some quarters, the economy continues to send mixed signals. Even as consumer spending remains healthy and the housing market rebounds, the labor market has been much slower to recover and many Americans at middle and lower income levels remain worse off than before the downturn.
The latest report on jobs will come Friday morning, when the Labor Department reports employment data for May. Month-to-month numbers have been bumpy this year, with the economy adding a robust 332,000 jobs in February, then slowing to a pace of 138,000 new positions in March and 165,000 in April.
Economists are looking for the report to estimate that the economy created roughly 165,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 7.5 percent. On Thursday, the government reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 11,000, to 346,000, just under the four-week moving average of 352,500.
Trading on financial markets was volatile as investors readied positions ahead of the Labor Department report.
After spending much of the day in negative territory, the stock market staged a late-day rally. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.03 points to 15,040.62 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 13.66, to 1,622.56. The Nasdaq composite index increased by 22.58, to 3,424.05.
The bond market rose modestly, with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds falling slightly to 2.08 percent.
In the currency markets, the dollar fell sharply against the yen and the euro on Thursday, and continued to fall Friday morning. Currency traders will be watching the jobs data on Friday for signs about the economy's underlying strength and the Fed's next move on monetary policy.
The lackluster gains in jobs and income for most Americans stand in contrast to the rally on Wall Street and increase in home prices so far this year.
In the first quarter of 2013, real estate holdings accounted for a $784 billion gain in household net worth, while the value of corporate shares and mutual funds increased by nearly $1.5 trillion, the Fed said.
The stock market gains primarily benefit a fairly narrow stratum of American society, Mr. Maki noted, with the top 20 percent of earners holding 80 percent of stocks.
''That group always accrues the bulk of the benefits from a rising stock market,'' he said.
The Federal Reserve report also showed that Americans remained cautious, continuing to reduce debt levels and strengthen their personal balance sheets. Household borrowing sank at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the first quarter, with mortgage debt declining by $53.2 billion.
The implosion of the housing sector, and the stock market tumble in 2008 and early 2009 took a huge toll on the net worth of American families. Between 2007 and 2008, household net worth dropped by nearly $13 trillion, a decline of nearly 20 percent.
While unemployment remains high by historical standards at 7.5 percent, the economy has shown signs of life lately. Consumer spending has held up this year, despite fears that an increase in payroll taxes and cutbacks in government spending might cool the economy.
The stock market has surged in 2013 in anticipation of better economic growth and expectations that the Federal Reserve will not pull back on its efforts to stimulate the economy until evidence is much stronger that jobs are more plentiful and living standards are improving. But stocks have wavered in recent days on worries that the central bank will not keep pumping as much money into the financial system.
